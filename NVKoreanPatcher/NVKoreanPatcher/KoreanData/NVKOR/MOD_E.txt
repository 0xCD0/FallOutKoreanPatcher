PJN0000150	Project Nevada could not detect the New Vegas Script Extender (NVSE), which is required for correct operation.
PJN0000151	There seems to be a problem with your Project Nevada installation because the HUD extensions were not detected.
PJN0000152	Enhanced Vision
PJN0000153	The scanner gives you the ability to analyze potential enemies over long distances to help on deciding if and how they should be approached.
PJN0000154	To scan something, aim at it while zooming or using ironsights. If it's a valid target, you can press 1 to start the scanning process.
PJN0000155	To activate enhanced vision, press the M key. There are up to three different modes:
PJN0000156	* Night Vision, for a clear vision during the night and in poorly lit areas.
PJN0000157	* Heat Vision, to identify endothermic enemies.
PJN0000158	* EM Vision, which picks up electro-magnetic fields produced by enemies, electronic components in explosives and energy weapons.
PJN0000159	Which of those are available depends on the device you're using. It might also be necessary to provide an external power supply (Energy Cells).
PJN0000160	Stealth Fields greatly reduce the chance of being detected by an enemy while they are active. The default hotkey to switch them on/off is X.
PJN0000161	Generally, there are two types of cloaking devices:
PJN0000162	* Single-use (Stealth Boy)
PJN0000163	* Reusable (Stealth armor, implants, etc)
PJN0000164	When active, both display their status in the top center region of the HUD.
PJN0000165	The field stability of a single-use device will degrade when it's active. Once it has reached zero, the device is broken and no longer usable.
PJN0000166	For reusable devices, stability will always recover over time once the stealth field is disabled. They may require an additional power source though (Energy Cells).
PJN0000167	Energy Cells are required to power this device.
PJN0000168	To quickly equip and throw explosives or throwable weapons, press and hold the G key. Once released, you will re-equip your previous weapon.
PJN0000169	The items supported by the grenade hotkey are categorized in four groups:
PJN0000170	* Grenades
PJN0000171	* Throwable weapons
PJN0000172	* Mines
PJN0000173	* Remotely detonatable explosives
PJN0000174	If you carry multiple items of the same category, press H to cycle through them. The grenade icon will show your current selection.
PJN0000175	To switch categories, hold down H for one second. As long as the category items are visible, H can be used to cycle through them.
PJN0000176	Press C to activate Bullet Time.
PJN0000177	The Grenade Hotkey Feature has been updated with support for many new explosives!
PJN0000178	To handle the higher number of items, they are categorized in four groups:
PJN0000179	Project Nevada now requires at least NVSE v2 beta 12. Please update.

PJN0000197	Implanted directly in your cerebral cortex, the Logic Co-Processor greatly enhances higher brain functions for faster learning, better concentration and an instant understanding of even the most complicated things.
PJN0000198	Effect: Intelligence +1
PJN0000199	By using advanced algorithms developed for image recognition, the Optics Enhancer pre-processes data in the optical nerve to create a sharper and more detailed vision. Open your eyes and see the world in a new light!
PJN0000200	Effect: Perception +1
PJN0000201	Your life is too important to leave anything to chance! With the Probability Calculator, the decision-making controlled by the frontal lobe is optimized to maximize the likeliness of a desired outcome. For personal safety reasons, we discourage its use for excessive gambling.
PJN0000202	Effect: Luck +1
PJN0000203	Already used by thousands of athletes all over the world, the Hypertrophy Accelerator allows for a quick and safe increase of muscle mass without leaving any traceable substances in your organism. Certified to be undetectable by any recent testing method.
PJN0000204	Effect: Strength +1
PJN0000205	Developed by Med-Tek, the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder greatly enhances the healing capabilities of the human body. Due to rapid cell regeneration, recovery after even the most severe injuries is reduced to several days instead of weeks or months.
PJN0000206	Effect: Health Regeneration
PJN0000207	Finally there's hope for the millions of people suffering from chronic pain! Unlike any pain medication that can give only temporal release with often severe side-effects, the Nociception Regulator permanently regulates the pain at its root without diminishing its important natural warning function.
PJN0000208	Effect: Endurance +1
PJN0000209	In situations where milliseconds make the difference between victory and defeat - or even between life and death - the Reflex Booster will give you the essential edge. Learning from the physiology of animals whose survival depends on ultra-fast responses, your central nervous node is enhanced to transmit motor signals with minimal delay.
PJN0000210	Effect: Agility +1
PJN0000211	Studies have shown that NEMEAN Sub-Dermal Armor allows a man clothed only in civilian attire to survive a live fire scenario which under most circumstances would have killed a fully armed soldier. However, due to high-end production costs, it's kept for those who can afford the luxury of sure-fire safety, as others must scrape by with Kevlar.
PJN0000212	Effect: DT +4
PJN0000213	The West Tek Augmented Reality Scanner was designed to provide computer-assisted combat intelligence in real-time. When moving behind enemy lines, it assists in evaluating potential threats, analyzing enemy defenses and reviewing inflicted damage.
PJN0000214	Effect: Scanner
PJN0000215	In the effort to improve combat abilities of soldiers by cybernetically enhancing their bodies, Bionic Eyes were one of the first targets for research. As such, they come in multiple variations with different features, ranging from improved night vision to advanced heat or electro-magnetic vision modes.
PJN0000216	Effect: Enhanced Vision Modes
PJN0000217	Most human feelings and abilities are greatly amplified by stressful situations. The RUSH Adrenaline Booster controls and further enhances this effect, pushing you far beyond anything you've ever experienced. Use of a synthetic heart in conjunction is recommended for both performance and safety reasons.
PJN0000218	Effect: AP regeneration bonus for kills
PJN0000219	Based on previous innovations, RobCo presents its latest breakthrough in stealth technology. Nano-Bots reside on the users skin, eliminating the need for any special device to generate the stealth field. Power has to be periodically recharged by external energy sources.
PJN0000220	Effect: Stealth Field Ability
PJN0000221	Synthetic elements are implanted at several key locations in the respiratory system, greatly enhancing the users' oxygen supply. Initially developed for victims of chronic lung diseases, these implants were later utilized in the civilian sector (firefighters, divers) as well as by the military.
PJN0000222	Effects: Sprint AP drain -25%%, Water Breathing
PJN0000223	Usable in any non-vital body region, the Nanobionic Weave combines a number of techniques to make the respective area highly resilient. Genetic information is replicated and decentrally stored to allow identical reconstruction if necessary. This reconstruction is handled by nanobots which will repair any sustained structural damage in minutes as long as the user is still alive.
PJN0000224	Effect: Limb Regeneration
PJN0000225	Consisting of a mechanical and a neurological control component, the Kinetic Accelerator can be used to speed up movement of various body parts. Generally, hydraulic parts near the joints are used for rapid acceleration, while the brain implant takes care of coordinating the movement at increased velocity.
PJN0000226	Effect (x2): Bullet Time attack and reload speed +50%% (+100%%)
PJN0000227	Effect (x2): Sprint slows down time by 25%% (50%%)
PJN0000228	You don't have any implants compatible with this body part.
PJN0000229	You can't install two implants of this kind in the same body region.
PJN0000230	While not really useful in your hands, with this highly educational and particulary rare book every decent doctor should be able to learn the art of cybernetic surgery.
PJN0000231	Thanks to your book on cybernetic surgery, this doctor learned how to install and remove implants from your body.
PJN0000232	There seems to be a problem with your Project Nevada - Cyberware installation because the menu extensions were not deteced.
PJN0000233	Why bother with expensive seminars or books on rhetorical training? The Voice Modulator adjusts the vibrations of your vocal chords to avoid any unpleasant frequencies. And everybody knows: It's not what you say, but how you say it!
PJN0000234	Effect: Barter +2, Speech +2
PJN0000235	Level: [%]
PJN0000236	The RobCo Hand Stabilizer uses several heuristic approaches to detect and isolate nerve signals that would otherwise cause involuntary muscle movement. To avoid negative side effects, jitter is not removed completely. Still, the Hand Stablizer is popular in work environments that require precise craftsmanship.
PJN0000237	Effect: Lockpick +2, Repair +2
PJN0000238	By analyzing movement patterns and comparing them to those stored in its database, the Motor Memorizer can detect certain actions associated with weapon handling. Once triggered, brain regions responsible for muscle memory are stimulated to increase learning speed.
PJN0000239	Effect: Guns +2, Energy Weapons +2
PJN0000240	Though development in this sector still is in its early stages, the Neural Datatool allows its user to directly interact with machines through common interfaces. Even though low-level machine access is not yet possible, the datatool speeds up data in/output, resulting in a moderate efficiency boost.
PJN0000241	The human body can easily support its own weight, even in the presence of additional force caused by jumping or movement in general. With the Weight Absorber this ability is further enhanced, allowing its user to carry more things without becoming immobilized.
PJN0000242	Developed for spies and assassins, Razor Nails turn the human hand into a lethal weapon. To avoid detection or self-inflicted injuries, the blades stay retracted under the fingernails until activated. The most effective attack locations are the major arteries.
PJN0000243	Effect: Unarmed critical chance and damage +[%]
PJN0000244	The Tread Damper uses a set of ultra-sensitive sensors to detect the distance between sole and ground. Just before surface contact, adaptive motion actuators slow down movement to minimize the resulting noise. This system is best utilized when moving carefully, preferably in light clothes.
PJN0000245	Based on simulations of the neural information circuits in the human brain, scientists were able to optimize processing speed by placing additional synthetic shortcuts at key locations. During trials, test subjects reported an altered perception of time.
PJN0000246	Effect: Bullet Time slowndown +20%%

PJN0000258	Effect: Guns +5, Energy Weapons +5
PJN0000259	The pinnacle of cybernetic weapons research, and it's right there in your hands - literally. The portable EMP Generator is embedded in forearm and palms. Designed for infiltration and sabotage missions, it is self-powered and highly effective against automated protection systems or energy-based weaponry and equipment.
PJN0000260	Effect: EM Burst, Capacity 5x (10x), Recharge 1x (2x) per hour
PJN0000261	While similiar implants utilize electromagnetic bursts to deal with (partly) non-organic adversaries, the Hyperfrequency Emitter is most effective against unarmored human or animal targets. Short-range microwaves quickly energize the air, causing an instantaneous combustion.
PJN0000262	Effect: HF Burst, Capacity 5x (10x), Recharge 1x (2x) per hour
PJN0000263	You're too weak to pull the sword out (Strength 8, Melee Weapons 75).
PJN0000264	You're not worthy to wield this magnificent blade (Melee Weapons 75).
PJN0000265	The Alternative Repair System brings two major changes.
PJN0000266	1. Repair Tools.
PJN0000267	* To repair anything two things are required: An item to repair with, and Repair Tools.
PJN0000268	* Repair tools are created at a workbench.
PJN0000269	* One set of Wrench, Hammer, Wonderglue and Duct Tape yields 5 charges.
PJN0000270	* Crafting of Weapon Repair Kits is disabled, existing Weapon Repair Kits are replaced with at a 1:5 ratio.
PJN0000271	2. Dynamic Repair Lists based on your Repair Skill.
PJN0000272	* If your Repair Skill is below the required skill for an item, you can only repair it with itself.
PJN0000273	* Otherwise the list is expanded with items of similar type.
PJN0000274	* For weapons, the required repair skill is equal to the required weapon skill.
PJN0000275	* For armor, the required skill depends on the DT value of the item.
PJN0000276	The skill exact skill requirements for armor are:
PJN0000277	* 0 Repair for Clothing (DT 0)
PJN0000278	* 25 Repair for Light Armor (DT < 10)
PJN0000279	* 50 Repair for Medium Armor (DT < 20)
PJN0000280	* 75 Repair for Heavy Armor (DT >= 20)
PJN0000281	* 100 Repair for Power Armor
PJN0000282	The original Jurgy Rigging perk is modified to add additional scrap items to weapon repair lists once you meet the repair skill requirements.
PJN0000283	If you don't like this new system, you can disable it in the Control Panel.

PJN0000432	(The cybernetic implant you found came with a booklet in its case:)
PJN0000433	The NEVADA Group
PJN0000434	While at first research and development of cybernetic implants was conducted exclusively for the military, several big companies were prepared to go the next step towards general commercialization. However, despite the fact that the technology itself was solid and more or less safe, multiple studies concluded that the public was not yet ready to accept these products. And no single company alone could change this fact.
PJN0000435	[... other problems associated with the commercialization of cybernetic implants ...]
PJN0000436	To address those issues, the NEVADA group was founded. Its members believed that by pooling their influence and ressources, they could turn the public opinion in their favor. And even after they had accomplished this goal, the group persisted to deal with various other problems that manifested when the first implants hit the market.
PJN0000437	[... more info about the general history of the NEVADA group ...]
PJN0000438	These cornerstones are:
PJN0000439	Recoverability
PJN0000440	Installation of a NEVADA-certified implant does not require in any permanent alterations to the user's body. This enables the option of a later removal. While at first sounding like a serious limitation, this constraint comes with several advantages, i.e. a lower entry barrier and the opportunity to apply more flexible business models (leasing).
PJN0000441	Interoperability
PJN0000442	Unless explicitely stated, implants constructed according to NEVADA standards can co-exist in the same body without interference.
PJN0000443	Unification
PJN0000444	While all NEVADA members pursue their own goals and interests, non-competitive areas are standardized by the group. As a result, the required training time for medical personnel is highly reduced. Costs are lowered further by allowing to use a common set of tools and devices for all implants.
PJN0000445	Project: Quantum Plasma Modulation Matter Multi-Injection Rifle
PJN0000446	Version: 39
PJN0000447	Notes: Generation of multiple quantum-modulated plasma projectiles a success. Data shows that chamber aperture stability was stressed higher than in the original Q35 derivative rifles, but still within safe thresholds. Energy yield of projectiles is intentionally low, this version is just a proof-of-concept for discharging multiple projectiles at once. Further variants will test higher yields.
PJN0000448	Version: 40
PJN0000449	Notes: Tests with higher-yield projectiles a success. Chamber aperture stability is approaching redline, however. Will need to research methods to increase the apertures' resilience to weapon discharge. Also experimenting with overcharge capacitor for a rapid-fire three-volley burst, will post results in next iteration.
PJN0000450	Version: 41
PJN0000451	Notes: Upon holding a charge-shot at full strength for nine seconds, the plasma chamber ruptured and spewed energized plasma over the tester. Fortunately, tester was wearing tesla power armor as a safety precaution, and was only lightly injured. Going over the numbers, it seems that the aperture stability in previous versions was much more tenuous than I originally surmised; wear rate was unacceptably high, which resulted in performance degradation caused automatically by the weapon's control circuitry to compensate. Primary prototype was salvagable and restored to operation. Secondary prototype to be converted to Q42 test article.
PJN0000452	Version: 42
PJN0000453	Notes: Despite putting an additional two aperture stabilizers on, the chamber still cannot handle a charged shot for any length of time without exploding. Charge shot functionality will have to be abandoned. Q-42 prototype was deemed unsalvagable after destruction in testing. Data gathered may suggest that synchronizing the alignment of the aperture stabilizers may further stabilize a conventional version, but would still not be enough to safely contain a charged shot.
PJN0000454	Version: 43
PJN0000455	Status: Inconclusive
PJN0000456	Notes: Unable to conclude testing of Q-43. The Oil Rig has been destroyed, and President Richardson has been killed. We are being ordered by a "President Eden" on the East Coast to evacuate Navarro and report to Raven Rock. I will be unable to take my testing materials with me, due to the haste in which we must leave Navarro.
PJN0000457	Frieda:
PJN0000458	One of my scouts managed to get quite a nice find out of a Hidden Valley bunker: an advanced model of tri-beam laser rifle. It seems to be a production candidate of some kind that never was produced. Overall it's a lot more durable due to its diffraction grating being encased and sealed, and of much higher grade than the specs we produce from. Of particular interest is that it has some manner of charging functionality; when it discharges after a long enough charge-up, it fires off way more than three beams.
PJN0000459	The best part? I found fabrication specs with it too. I'm sending you the prototype as well as the specs. Could you do a small run and ship them back to me? Don't let Mother in on it, the last thing I want is her bombarding me with questions about it.
PJN0000460	Take care, sis...

YUP0000001	Yep, for years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
YUP0000002	Welcome to Casa Madrid - cheapest, cleanest whores in all New Vegas. If you want to know the rates for poon, talk to the whores.
YUP0000003	The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share the profits of the co-op.
YUP0000004	I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll ever find anywhere outside of the Strip.
YUP0000005	Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never got better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
YUP0000006	Dermot knows how to work salvage better than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
YUP0000007	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are gonna get killed
YUP0000008	Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we'll let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
YUP0000009	Your concerns are perfectly understandable, but I assure you, they're entirely misplaced. We would never use technology that wasn't fully tested.
YUP0000010	If you've been around the Kings, you may have met one of them named Pacer. He's always stomping around trying to show off his authority.
YUP0000011	Traders have been griping for a while now about I-15 being too dangerous to travel. I'd steer clear of it unless you're armed to the teeth.
YUP0000012	As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will be accorded them, making their equipment fair game.
YUP0000013	He was never one to stay tied down to a spot, though. Gets that from his mother.
YUP0000014	And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line them up and then squeeze the trigger.
YUP0000015	It's put us in a rather delicate position, you see, his coming here. Not that we aren't grateful for his generous offer.
YUP0000016	And if the Gourmand served staples, it would no longer draw the caliber of people it deserves. It would be a diner or... a family restaurant.
YUP0000017	All right, but make it snappy, kid, this isn't exactly a lucrative career enterprise here.
YUP0000018	As one of our captains, Cachino was kind of a project manager. He made sure people had what they needed to get their jobs done.
YUP0000019	That book can get me killed if the wrong people see it. Let's talk, what do you want? What can I do for you?
YUP0000020	Of course, no one else  is allowed inside the Lucky 38, so no one knows what's going on. Well, except for you.
YUP0000021	Here, take this packet sniffer. It'll allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
YUP0000022	Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack, Diane, and Melissa.
YUP0000023	Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact they get all hopped up on Psycho and harass the NCR patrols.

YUP0000058	I'm happy you cleared that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
YUP0000059	Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if not, take him out.
YUP0000060	I am the greatest of Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
YUP0000061	He was around here not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
YUP0000062	The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able to give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
YUP0000063	I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels it's taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
YUP0000064	Because I killed a couple of marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
YUP0000065	Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from the local Brahmin ranchers.
YUP0000066	He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of a man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
YUP0000067	Sure. What do you want to know?
YUP0000068	Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long hours to provide for our daughter and me.
YUP0000069	Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
YUP0000070	But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her, things will never go back to the way they were.
YUP0000071	I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL IT'S DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
YUP0000072	FINE. DONE. THAT GUN MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE ANYWAY, ALWAYS WORRIED IT'S GOING TO HUMP MY CHASSIS. ANYTHING ELSE, LOBOTOMITE?
YUP0000073	But I couldn't delete you or your arrival any more than I could the other visitors. Only so much Science can do when you started talking to them.
YUP0000074	Every time I see one of you I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, any more than Dog can help himself.
YUP0000075	You're not him any more than I'm Dog. But that collar around your neck...
YUP0000076	This is one of Dr. Richards' patients. You should speak to him before you investigate them.
YUP0000077	Based on the other tanks in the room, you can safely assume this is where your brain would be floating. It's currently missing from both the tank and its proper place in your head, but you seem to be doing just fine without it.
YUP0000078	She has learned a secret Unarmed Weapon technique that increases her attack speed by 50%% and gives her a 25%% chance to knock down enemies.
YUP0000079	We've all heard "stories" that radiation is dangerous - fact or fiction?* A common sight in factories, military installations, and the basements of selected government-funded middle schools, these safety barrels* are just what the name implies - safe. While their attractive coloring can be interpreted as a warning, for REPCONN, it's an invitation to a future filled with nuclear power!
YUP0000080	Some folks have asked - why not a Protectron with wheels? RobCo wasn't afraid to answer that question: The Protect-O-Bot is the answer. While safety standards prevented this free-wheeling dynamo from entering mass market production despite RobCo's best intentions and teams of lawyers, we take consolation in letting you see this extremely well-funded experiment as it was intended - a robot moving so fast it looks like it's standing still!
YUP0000081	Force your parents a short drive south, and you'll see the retractable dome of REPCONN's launch facility (not actual size!). You may have heard wild stories about rocket flights and their impact* on nearby towns and communities, but REPCONN feels you can't put a price on space exploration - after all, Rocketeers, you do want to go into space someday... don't you?
YUP0000082	Non-members found in the White Glove Society Members Only area will be ejected on sight.
YUP0000083	You retrieve the equipment confiscated by the Sierra Madre's security system.
YUP0000084	You retrieved your confiscated equipment.
YUP0000085	Converted [%] damaged books into blank magazines.
YUP0000086	We're cut off from the rest of the platoon, and there are legionnaires all over the place. There's no chance we can get out of here before they blow the town, so we're going to hold out against them as long as we can. If anyone ever gets this, I'd like to make sure that Private Jeffery Hui and Corporal Marcus Christensen are commended for their valor and sacrifice. Both have upheld the ideals and honor of the New California Republic with distinction. Ranger Teresa Lutz, out.

YUP0000195	What does it mean? Why was there a blue star under my bottle cap? Are the Reds behind this? Is this part of their mind control? They must be making me see things now, things that shouldn't be there. The star shouldn't be there, why do I see a star? It won't go away. No matter how long I close my eyes it won't go away. I want the star to go away!
YUP0000196	Primm Slim: Howdy Partners! Welcome to the Vikki and Vance Casino and museum!

YUP0000198	Patient came to us claiming to be insane. Patient claimed he would often get the feeling of being 'outside' himself. This feeling was so intense that it would cause the patient to be off balance during episodes. Navigation through the clinic often difficult for him to achieve with out causing accidents.
YUP0000199	We regret to inform you that there is a problem with one of the water purification filters. We assure you that we are working diligently to fix this problem; however, until the filter has been fixed please try to keep water usage limited and report directly to the clinic if you begin to feel ill in any way.
YUP0000200	I've been getting headaches; I think someone is poisoning us. I've been up every night this week, and night after night, an extra boost of air comes through the vents, it lasts for about five minutes, and then turns off. I spoke with one of the neighbors; he said he noticed the same thing in his room as well. We made a report to the maintenance officer; he informed us that the system was running perfectly and that there was nothing to worry about, I don't believe him, maybe he's in on it.
YUP0000201	I've noticed an increase in the amount of smuggling of restricted items into the Strip. I'm increasing security at the checkpoints to prevent more of this. A report has been sent to Ambassador Crocker via Liza to address this.
YUP0000202	I turned in McCaffery's hat to Francine and received my reward.

YUP0000210	I couldn't care less about history - and even less about Caesar.
YUP0000211	I couldn't care less about all of this. Can I go?
YUP0000212	Uh... great. I don't want to hear any more about that.
YUP0000213	Fine. Would hate to have carved you up any more than you are.
YUP0000214	You didn't tell me your name.
YUP0000215	Raise that gun, and I'll kill everyone in here.
YUP0000216	I could use a bed and some supplies.
YUP0000217	Please, just leave me alone.
YUP0000218	I'm familiar. Do *you* know what a fish is?
YUP0000219	That's... rarely an issue.
YUP0000220	Soft men don't stay that way around me, I've found.
YUP0000221	As long as we keep it on that level.
YUP0000222	Miss Cassidy... are you flirting with me?
YUP0000223	<Lie> I was hoping you'd want to take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
YUP0000224	You know you can't supply all the West any more than the Republic can.
YUP0000225	Sure, let me take a look at those magazines.
YUP0000226	Vouch for me? How?
YUP0000227	I bet a sexy lady like you could tell me where I could find someone named Cachino.
YUP0000228	Tell me about yourself again.
YUP0000229	Hey, that wasn't the right response for the password!
YUP0000230	<Give 500 caps> Okay, make that 500 caps. I'm sure Contreras can skim for you.
YUP0000231	Oh, just delivering packages. No clue what's in em, but it's really important.
YUP0000232	Punk? That's my line.
YUP0000233	Tell me about the Vikki and Vance.
YUP0000234	40mm Grenade, Pla.
YUP0000235	40mm Grenade, Pul.
YUP0000236	Elijah obviously intended this to go to Veronica, but you earned it, right?[CRLF][CRLF]You've learned Elijah's secret technique and your Melee Weapon Critical Hits now do 25% more damage.
YUP0000237	You've learned to make a mysterious edible substance at a Camp Fire out of scrap materials (Cloud Residue, Tin Cans, Junk Food) that provides +40 HP, +4 END, and +2 STR... but watch out, it's also highly addictive (15% chance of addiction).
YUP0000238	You have received the specialized training needed to correctly move in any form of Power Armor. Equipped Power Armor will now provide a considerable increase to your carrying capacity.
YUP0000239	With each rank of the Demolition Expert perk, all of your explosive weapons do an additional 10% damage and have 10% larger area of effect.
YUP0000240	With the Cowboy perk, attacking enemies with revolvers, lever-action firearms, dynamite, knives, and hatchets does +20% damage.
YUP0000241	With the Plasma Spaz perk, you attack 20% faster with all plasma weapons (including grenades) and their AP costs are also reduced by 20%.
YUP0000242	With the Lead Belly perk, you take 50% less radiation when consuming irradiated food and drink, and no longer suffer negative effects from eating raw meat.
YUP0000243	The Meltdown perk creates a damaging corona of energy every time you melt a target with plasma.
YUP0000244	Hell if I know. I don't think it's serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.
YUP0000245	You're welcome to try. It's yours if you can get it working.
YUP0000246	If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share that information I have with you.
YUP0000247	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you look to be a trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
YUP0000248	You could route the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
YUP0000249	The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it's wise not to start up a war just as the lady has risen.
YUP0000250	Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looks all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
YUP0000251	The rumor is, is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
YUP0000252	He shuts himself back in the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
YUP0000253	And if you see a squad of veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
YUP0000254	Plenty of demand for them, seeing as how they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
YUP0000255	Nobody w-wanted to work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
YUP0000256	There's a NCR camp down on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think, try to find someone of authority there.
YUP0000257	Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tucson - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tucson, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
YUP0000258	A tribe came into Tucson one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
YUP0000259	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tucson and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
YUP0000260	I headed up into Tucson and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
YUP0000261	Well, one day the signal stopped, so I figured I'd try to find the transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before my eyes started to go.
YUP0000262	Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers chooses to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
YUP0000263	As far as the world knew, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tucson - not Two-Sun, by the way.
YUP0000264	Yeah, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
YUP0000265	The only reason why I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
YUP0000266	Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple of weeks back.
YUP0000267	Right now, that's all that's standing there - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
YUP0000268	I think you're cashed out enough to know my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
YUP0000269	My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half our prices.
YUP0000270	Right, it's one of two locations on Mr. House's network with non-standard hardware.
YUP0000271	I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure if he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
YUP0000272	I think you should visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
YUP0000273	Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly against soft targets at medium range...
YUP0000274	The override will enable me to control the entire dam's power output.
YUP0000275	I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training than any of the other guys here.
YUP0000276	The location by the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
YUP0000277	If you're looking for real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
YUP0000278	I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of his face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
YUP0000279	All right, then. Be patient since this will take a while.
YUP0000280	Have a seat. This will take a while.
YUP0000281	Once our forces are in place and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
YUP0000282	We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
YUP0000283	Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
YUP0000284	[SUCCEEDED] Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diane got your back. No sweat.
YUP0000285	You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about the life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
YUP0000286	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are gonna get killed.
YUP0000287	Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come in.
YUP0000288	Was part of a Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
YUP0000289	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week shaking down these assholes anyways.
YUP0000290	[FAILED] I'm not a stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
YUP0000291	What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
YUP0000292	She locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
YUP0000293	Do they? Look at my mother. All she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
YUP0000294	Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her around here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
YUP0000295	The east side gets a lot of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
YUP0000296	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill you right here, right now.
YUP0000297	I mean you've got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
YUP0000298	Give me a rifle and a clear line of sight, and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
YUP0000299	I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I could find your targets for you.
YUP0000300	Yeah. Lots of thoughts. All about the best ways to kill 'em.
YUP0000301	There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they would have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
YUP0000302	Th-thank you! I don't think we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
YUP0000303	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
YUP0000304	That part of my life's over now. And so is this discussion.
YUP0000305	The locals here are just an inconvenience to 'em, something to step over or stomp down. They're here for the resources, plain and simple.
YUP0000306	The best marksmen of the NCR are usually at the rear of any battle. The gun will allow us to strike at them.
YUP0000307	But lately, The Kings have started charging locals to use it - and NCR squatters twice as much. That'll come to no good.
YUP0000308	Okay, you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
YUP0000309	Does that sound like a democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
YUP0000310	The NCR has all the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
YUP0000311	I must insist that you stay long enough for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
YUP0000312	I must insist that you stay long enough for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
YUP0000313	I've been around long enough to observe the patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
YUP0000314	That's a good idea. I don't give out favors every day, so you probably shouldn't rush to pick something.
YUP0000315	I'll give it my best. You've earned that much. But that makes us even, you hear?
YUP0000316	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air over at that there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
YUP0000317	[FAILED] I'm sorry, but those are the only funds I was able to allocate. You'll have to make do with it. Besides, you may have other tasks soon.
YUP0000318	Excellent job. Where'd you learn to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
YUP0000319	Unfortunately, I don't have time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
YUP0000320	I remember coming in one morning and noticing my supplies were lower than they should have been.
YUP0000321	Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us both.
YUP0000322	All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest, until I gave him a mickey in the shape of a pulse grenade.
YUP0000323	Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are our best customers. It's complicated.
YUP0000324	From there it just took a couple of greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
YUP0000325	Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right and at the end of the hall.
YUP0000326	The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause more trouble than he's worth.
YUP0000327	How the hell did brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
YUP0000328	If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in, but it'll probably be too late for you.
YUP0000329	We need a regular supply of medicine organized, but the Crimson Caravan wants too many caps for what we need.
YUP0000330	And you most certainly fit the bill. Given your deeds on the Strip alone, I can safely say that you would be a prized addition to our honorary ranks.
YUP0000331	Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, come back and let me know if they will help us.
YUP0000332	This again? I thought this was all settled. I answered every one of that investigator's questions to his satisfaction and gave all the help I could.
YUP0000333	These are not people you want to mess with. But if lasers and such are your thing, the goods they sell are second to none.
YUP0000334	I haven't been there myself, but I hear security there is kinda tight.
YUP0000335	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, I was a traveling doctor for a spell.
YUP0000336	That'd be Victor. Curious fella. He's sort of odd. And I don't just mean 'cause he's a robot. I couldn't tell you much about him.
YUP0000337	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain. Here you go. Have a nice day.
YUP0000338	After the help you gave us at the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
YUP0000339	Ah, a job well done is its own reward. Good riddance to this rubbish.
YUP0000340	Southeast of here is Primm - can't miss it, since it has the giant old rollercoaster right in the middle of town. The NCR's got an outpost there.
YUP0000341	Wow, that seems dangerous, but if you really think it's safe, I'll trust you. You did make it here, after all.
YUP0000342	I led a team down to exterminate them, but there were... so many of them. We lost: Two killed, three wounded.
YUP0000343	Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no esprit de corps.
YUP0000344	Anderson. Is that the Followers of the Apocalypse Anderson?
YUP0000345	[FAILED] Help us first, then we'll give you the password, and don't think about killing me. It's all in my head.
YUP0000346	It was a massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
YUP0000347	You're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
YUP0000348	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you, my friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower, as if this city is more important.
YUP0000349	That light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
YUP0000350	We needed some place to put down some roots. I was having trouble keeping my people out of Westside.
YUP0000351	Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
YUP0000352	[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Well, let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
YUP0000353	Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
YUP0000354	Seem to recall a lot of them did business with those scavengers over on the West Side - Dermot and Saint James.
YUP0000355	Really now? We had our suspicions about that man, but he's got so many shipments going so many different directions it's been hard to track.
YUP0000356	Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he gets his hands on.
YUP0000357	Oh yeah. You can order up anything you want... as long as it's corn or beans! <Laughs>
YUP0000358	Oh, I've heard of a place called House Tools you could check out! It's an old factory on the north side of Vegas.
YUP0000359	Just a word of warning, though. I hear no one who goes in there comes back out. Could be traps, crazy robots, or who knows what's in that place.
YUP0000360	Here's what's currently available.
YUP0000361	Esteban's body is laid out between some of the buildings, east of the REPCONN headquarters. At least, that's what his squadmates said.
YUP0000362	Let's see here...
YUP0000363	Heh, an accomplice after all. Well, it'll save me some paperwork just killing you.
YUP0000364	Not the kind of things you like to see go missing.
YUP0000365	I don't know how long it'll be before the Legion crosses the river, but sure as fuck I don't want to be wearing an NCR uniform when they get here.
YUP0000366	And all of this... all this, requiring no more than a few drops of precious water, and the efforts of only a handful of human farmers. Impossible?
YUP0000367	[SUCCEEDED] Please do not make your way to the 2nd floor.
YUP0000368	They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in a kind of box canyon. Guess this is as fitting a place for that as any.
YUP0000369	I reckon that if they thought hard enough about it, they'd realize they got more bodies than we have bullets, but for now we're safe enough in here.
YUP0000370	There should. But we're not getting much power out of it so none of our enemies have big interest in it either. Not like Hoover Dam, anyway.
YUP0000371	We've never been on the Strip, either, so we don't know how many guards the casinos have. And I kept having these nightmares...
YUP0000372	My specialty is a radscorpion venom casserole. It's more appetizing than it sounds!
YUP0000373	He's rude. Don't tell him I said it. Primm has a sheriff now, just not as supportive as I would've hoped.
YUP0000374	Slim is alright, I don't wish him no harm, but the law to him is a set of logic.
YUP0000375	Simple! Up until now, we committed our crimes stealthily, leaving no evidence behind. So we never built a rep.
YUP0000376	But I only saw one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.
YUP0000377	But I like you. I think maybe it's time. All that's left is in the storage room here. You can buy the key from my store.
YUP0000378	Alright, it's on now!
YUP0000379	<Laughs> Yeah. I'm with you there.
YUP0000380	I got kicked outta Ultra-Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking freaks.
YUP0000381	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
YUP0000382	Think about it too hard and you'll get burned.
YUP0000383	Well howdy, pardner! Good to see you again. Boss is waiting for ya upstairs, so get a move on!
YUP0000384	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this. I'm not gonna be very good company right now.
YUP0000385	Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
YUP0000386	Man, are you turned around. Motor-Runner is on the other side of the complex.
YUP0000387	Humph... I see a lot of folks come and go, but none fit your type. Where you come from, stranger?
YUP0000388	This place doesn't have the glitter of the Strip, but I've got Joana - that's all I'll ever need.
YUP0000389	You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver a package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
YUP0000390	Your reputation with the NCR isn't exactly stellar, so I'll have to vouch for you. It'll make a scene, but it's worth it.
YUP0000391	Hey, so Hardin becoming Elder was because of you, huh? Good job. Now that the lockdown is lifted, I may get a chance to get into a real fight!
YUP0000392	You can just talk to the whores, you know. You and me, we don't need to talk unless there's trouble.
YUP0000393	You've done an excellent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
YUP0000394	One of these days I'll save up enough to get out of here. One of these days...
YUP0000395	Things have been a lot better since you helped with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So, what can I do for you?
YUP0000396	Welcome back, buddy!
YUP0000397	If you're looking for guns, talk to Mick. Otherwise, I've got a nice selection of general supplies.
YUP0000398	People are getting nervous about the Legion amassing on the other side of the river. I hope the NCR can hold against another attack.
YUP0000399	Sooooo... we can blow up the dam's generators, or I could route the dam's entire power output to the Fort.
YUP0000400	It's good to see such an outstanding citizen of the NCR. What can I do for you, my friend?
YUP0000401	Oh, hi. Thanks again for helping us with that data. I mean the feed only lasted about thirty seconds and it's not that useful, but... well, we tried.
YUP0000402	Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb of God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
YUP0000403	They're all dead. Guy must've had some kind of explosive on him, set off all the ordnance in this place at once.
YUP0000404	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, teaching a lesson, if you will.
YUP0000405	When you move on, teach everyone you meet the lessons Caesar's Legion taught here. Especially any NCR troops you run across.
YUP0000406	Pretty addictive, right? You do it once, it just makes you want to do it more.
YUP0000407	You and me, we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
YUP0000408	Cooke left the vault, good thing too, he was going to get us all killed.
YUP0000409	What the hell? Is that a half-robot dog?
YUP0000410	You better control that thing. Bots can't be trusted.
YUP0000411	It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
YUP0000412	I've never seen a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
YUP0000413	Hellooo, cowgirl! You mind if I talk to your lady friend a bit instead of you?

YUP0000440	What does it mean?  Why was there a blue star under my bottle cap?  Are the Reds behind this?  Is this part of their mind control?  They must be making me see things now, things that shouldn't be there.  The star shouldn't be there, why do I see a star?  It won't go away.  No matter how long I close my eyes it won't go away.  I want the star to go away!
YUP0000441	-Anthony House
YUP0000442	Building the things you need to build a better tomorrow!
YUP0000443	You have learned the advanced weapon handling techniques of the New Canaanites. For you, all shots with .45 Auto Pistols have less spread and are twice as likely to score a critical hit.
YUP0000444	When your health drops below 50% you gain +15% more damage, but you also suffer -2 to your Agility and Perception attributes.
YUP0000445	The Wild Wasteland trait converts a few normally "ordinary" occurrences into zany, wacky encounters. Do not take this trait unless you prefer your Fallout experience to be a bit more goofy than usual.
YUP0000446	Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I can fight them all.
YUP0000447	Yeah, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
YUP0000448	I'm sorry, but is this supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
YUP0000449	I'm one of a kind! I've been places, see? And done things - lots of them!
YUP0000450	First thing I'd say is get his sorry butt outta there.
YUP0000451	<Embarrassed beeping>
YUP0000452	PLEASE AVOID BOOM TOWN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WEAPON TESTING IS RESOLVED.
YUP0000453	*I don't know... might be some old Nuka-Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla bottlecaps lying around. It... It's not "currency" per se...*
YUP0000454	All right, all right... but you already have company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
YUP0000455	Odd Man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffeur driving you to the concert.
YUP0000456	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, any more than Dog can help himself.
YUP0000457	A fair point, but from the perspective of someone west of the Colorado, the man is clearly out of his mind.
YUP0000458	Yes, goodbye.
YUP0000459	That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liaison.
YUP0000460	Then we'll have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
YUP0000461	It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get your support.
YUP0000462	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out through a window, but everyone else....
YUP0000463	I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securitron's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
YUP0000464	I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravanners or guards, but I am in need of a runner.
YUP0000465	In fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
YUP0000466	[SUCCEEDED] I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
YUP0000467	I've been spying in the dam for quite a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
YUP0000468	The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into its back.
YUP0000469	Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
YUP0000470	Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into those caves.
YUP0000471	Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Etienne. Gets some help from of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
YUP0000472	Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Etienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
YUP0000473	[FAILED] I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
YUP0000474	Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionary's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
YUP0000475	While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to take no risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
YUP0000476	Before or after the human race shot itself in the foot? I've been around long enough to have both opinions, see.
YUP0000477	Santiago is here to please, my prairie flower. Just a few caps and I'm yours.
YUP0000478	You did? Hot damn! I've been looking for one of those for years!
YUP0000479	Oh, that's great. I sure could use some help. You see, I do explosives, and they have a special need for some big explosions.
YUP0000480	[FAILED]Yeah, I could build a nuke, but I'm not looking to turn the Mojave into a giant mirror.
YUP0000481	I apologize, friend, but that is absurd given the value of this information.
YUP0000482	I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarrassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
YUP0000483	At least a couple of doses of Fixer, a bottle of whiskey, and Rad-Away.
YUP0000484	[FAILED] You think Santiago is susceptible to such idle threats? Santiago laughs at your silly bluff.
YUP0000485	With Jacob Hoff sobered up, there are new drinks on the menu and sales are strong. People love the new Absinthe and Rum & Nuka.
YUP0000486	You do? That's wonderful! Let me see what you brought.
YUP0000487	I seriously doubt that it would be in my best interest to discuss the NCR with someone of your reputation.
YUP0000488	I got no fucking idea. They let him have the run of the place though. He seems like a nice guy, but he makes me nervous.
YUP0000489	[SUCCEEDED] Hah! I like your style, kid, but the best I can do is meet you halfway. 375 caps, and we can call it a deal.
YUP0000490	[FAILED] Heh, who are you shitting?
YUP0000491	[FAILED] Sorry excuses?.. That's does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
YUP0000492	That'll save us some caps and help offload a bit of our overstock.
YUP0000493	[SUCCEEDED] Fresh food and water is worth its weight in gold... You've got yourself a deal.
YUP0000494	There, that's got it. Don't be so eager to sample dangerous substances in the future, okay?
YUP0000495	But I guess they had to stop after the first few kids thought they were filled with Nuka-Cola and drank it down.
YUP0000496	What's the matter, dearie? Afraid grandma will embarrass you in front of your little friends?
YUP0000497	Couldn't even hide from a half-blind old ghoul. How embarrassing for you.
YUP0000498	Now hand that back, you low-down thief!
YUP0000499	Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's little else for us to discuss until you have.
YUP0000500	You again? What do you need?
YUP0000501	Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta write my mama and tell her I met you!
YUP0000502	Hi there. Welcome to the Westside Co-op. I'm Clayton Etienne. Let me know if you have any questions.
YUP0000503	The "great" republic couldn't find enough soldiers to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
YUP0000504	This console regulates the pumps keeping Lake Mead from flooding the Securitron storage galleries.
YUP0000505	Attn NCR Staff,
YUP0000506	We received nearly ten times the medical supplies requested. We had an incident of a broken leg - not a missile strike. Please arrange a supply shipment to redistribute - no doubt there's an NCR military camp that desperately needs the supplies.
YUP0000507	You'll be happy to know that our vault is packed and coasting along! Even with those legionnaires bad news we still get plenty of NCR squares down here. They are all chirpy and don't appear to mind that Caesar is crusin' for a bruisin' all over the place. Maybe the NCR is stronger than we thought, uh? Don't know... you think we can trust them over Mr. House?
YUP0000508	(Optional) Let Mick and Ralph know why the Omertas stopped buying their guns.
YUP0000509	Tell Caesar the the Securitron army is no longer a threat.
YUP0000510	It reminds you of being trapped in the Auto-Doc.
YUP0000511	I was planning on helping you get even deadlier creatures, but not without a raise.
YUP0000512	Why bother? You're embarrassing yourself enough as it is.
YUP0000513	<Lie>Troike wants to see about negotiating some lower prices for weapons for you guys.
YUP0000514	I'll find the Stealth Boy stockpile for you if your kin will leave this place.
YUP0000515	[FAILED] <Takes Contreras' package> Bullshit, let's see what you've got here...
YUP0000516	A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the NCR.
YUP0000517	A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts, I'll take the shells!
YUP0000518	And I'm desperate for spices or seasonings. Anything. Just something for the general mood around here.
YUP0000519	Brass won't say it to me straight, but they mean to leave Esteban out there. I can see that plain.
YUP0000520	But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Ain't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
YUP0000521	Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
YUP0000522	Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free. 
YUP0000523	Download all the information on the central server to your Pip-Boy. And you'll be certain to bring me any notes or samples that you find, won't you? 
YUP0000524	Fine by me. You the one missing out on all the exciting details.
YUP0000525	Friend, not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
YUP0000526	From there, it took just a couple of greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
YUP0000527	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look you over. Oh, and welcome back.
YUP0000528	Hah go!
YUP0000529	Hanlon, exhausted from a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
YUP0000530	Here's the key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
YUP0000531	Honestly, we're fighting a lot of fires right now. The Fiends keep pressing their position from Vault 3. 
YUP0000532	I ain't chasin' 'em. 
YUP0000533	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help us get out of here, but... it didn't work out.
YUP0000534	If you're in the neighborhood of Camp McCarran anytime soon, look for Dr. Williams. She was one of the few people there I could tolerate.
YUP0000535	If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us, and there's an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
YUP0000536	It started with the breakout from prison up the road. First there was just a few thugs rolling through town, but then they got organized.
YUP0000537	I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of Private Crenshaw.
YUP0000538	Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl? Yeah!
YUP0000539	Maybe you're right. Come on, boys, let's get the hell out of here before the law shows up.
YUP0000540	My husband... he's a Ranger, and he... he got murdered by a pack of Fiends. Goddamn savages laid his body out to rot. 
YUP0000541	My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligates you to deliver the Chip.
YUP0000542	No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up. 
YUP0000543	Now everywhere I go, folks I never even met shake my hand and call me "Mr. Gunderson." Don't quite know what to make of that.
YUP0000544	Oh you don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do
YUP0000545	Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted us on the ridge.
YUP0000546	One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal. 
YUP0000547	Seclusion has kept us safe, but the world around us is changing. Neon lights in the distance, patrolling robots, soldiers...
YUP0000548	She said that this day would come, and that any savage to reach our gates should be brought to her.
YUP0000549	Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magical angel wings.
YUP0000550	Show yourself, Outsider. 
YUP0000551	Ted Gunderson is his name. It would be simplest if we could convince him this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
YUP0000552	That's exactly what Leo told me to do!
YUP0000553	The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after a failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
YUP0000554	The resulting hybrid proved to be more adaptable than expected, however, and soon became a threat to humans.
YUP0000555	The whole point of killing the geckos was so that we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
YUP0000556	There was no choice in what I did. It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
YUP0000557	They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought the fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
YUP0000558	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
YUP0000559	We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf. 
YUP0000560	What in samhill?
YUP0000561	Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death.
YUP0000562	You... blew it up? That's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
YUP0000563	Actually let's talk about something else.
YUP0000564	Better for her to die than live as a Legion slave.
YUP0000565	He confessed it to me before he died. He used the word "frumentarius."
YUP0000566	He confessed it to me. Right before he died.
YUP0000567	I'm going to pollute the ventilation system with the stinking corpse of an NCR private.
YUP0000568	I've been fighting for the wrong side. Let me prove myself to you.
YUP0000569	Let's see... You've got that thingy... there. Power, uh, re-circulators here...
YUP0000570	RF detonator? Give me a second. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
YUP0000571	They have tons of vegetables and water. How about expanding your business?
YUP0000572	Wasn't it dangerous to be dressed so... noticeably?
YUP0000573	What happens if the Platinum Chip is lost?
YUP0000574	Yes. You can join them, but he says you would all still have to pass the initiation rite.
YUP0000575	I'm writing to you because, as of today (06/15/2077), I still haven't received the shipment. I'm fresh out of the kits here, and with the summer tourist season picking up I really need the new ones ASAP.
YUP0000576	Chief Hanlon is the head of the NCR Rangers and one of its longest serving members. He coordinates the actions of the Rangers from their headquarters at Camp Golf.
YUP0000577	The Meltdown perk creates a damaging corona of energy every time you kill a target with Energy Weapons.
YUP0000578	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
YUP0000579	But, if I get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
YUP0000580	We don't have money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
YUP0000581	I was never happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
YUP0000582	No, but there ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
YUP0000583	The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat will cost some serious caps.
YUP0000584	All his kind, they exist to be given orders. They're soldiers - simple, stupid. I ask him to fetch, and he did... even without the threat of death.
YUP0000585	Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off a cliff.
YUP0000586	Well he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of gentleman to me.
YUP0000587	Can't say I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
YUP0000588	But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
YUP0000589	His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
YUP0000590	She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions towards her aren't quite so innocent.
YUP0000591	[SUCCEEDED] Wow, our stockpiles mostly include full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
YUP0000592	[FAILED] Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still will with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
YUP0000593	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about you let me make this decision?
YUP0000594	For a while it seemed like we might even survive there, until... until Rafaela.
YUP0000595	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and I got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out through a window, but everyone else....
YUP0000596	I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off me so I can move a little more easily.
YUP0000597	Gah! Petro-Chico Boy! Petro-Chico Boy is here after my chicharrones! Oh. Just a dream. Just a dream....
YUP0000598	Also, before I forget, here's a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it on your map.
YUP0000599	Sorry, but I need to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
YUP0000600	I probably shouldn't be saying anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
YUP0000601	Oh you don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
YUP0000602	Well, it's been awhile. All right, let's do this.
YUP0000603	I'm honestly pleasantly surprised they would help us out, but I can see the Garrets aren't doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.
YUP0000604	Alright. I'll come quietly, but this is fucked.
YUP0000605	Yeah, sure fucking thing. I'll be waiting with bated breath for your schedule to clear up, ha ha.
YUP0000606	Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
YUP0000607	We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
YUP0000608	Thanks for your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
YUP0000609	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? 150 caps is my final offer.
YUP0000610	Looks like I got an eight, pardner.
YUP0000611	Looks like you got an eight, pardner.
YUP0000612	I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before I run you off the hard way.
YUP0000613	[?] Foot soldiers of the Legion are trained not to have to think for themselves - to have conflict removed from their minds.
YUP0000614	[?] No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
YUP0000615	Come to see the fights, or Red Lucy?
YUP0000616	Well, it's a part of life out here. Best to accept it.
YUP0000617	I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is on your hands.
YUP0000618	You've proven yourself to be a true friend of the Legion. We have a safehouse available to our agents in the Mojave - here's the key.
YUP0000619	At least with the lockdown lifted I'll be able to resupply my store more often. So what are you here for?
YUP0000620	Now what can I get for you?
YUP0000621	We've got nothing left to talk about.
YUP0000622	One of our caravans got hit a few months back, and the caravan'd been burned, too, along with the cargo.
YUP0000623	I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, and then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
YUP0000624	So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow brick road, and there's bad news at the end.
YUP0000625	That we hold Nelson, that is Caesar's will.
YUP0000626	Never once did I believe that Caesar was near death. I have friends in high places.
YUP0000627	This computer trap is disarmed and won't explode unless it is rearmed.
YUP0000628	Ranger Combat Helmet
YUP0000629	Vault Security Turret
YUP0000630	Card Remover

YUP0000640	<Attack> I'm taking over.
///MMUE	
MMU0000001	No one's going to put you out to pasture 'cause you're going to stay young (and level 30) forever! You'll never again become addicted. Additionally alcohol and chems will last twice as long... but after 30 you can kiss experience, perks, and skill points goodbye!
MMU0000002	Behind-the-scenes compatibility perk to ensure the Holorifle works with the Command perk
MMU0000003	Your brain is back in your body, but some of the advanced technologies remain: Your head still cannot be crippled, but you are only 10% more resistant to addiction now. Surprisingly your damage threshold has improved by 10% (minimum +1, maximum +6).
MMU0000004	Veronica gains +150% melee attack speed and 25% chance for melee attacks to knock down enemies.
MMU0000005	Do damage with Gun Runners' Arsenal Weapons.
MMU0000006	Kill Animals with the Fat Man or with Fat Mines.
MMU0000007	Veronica gains +4 DT.
MMU0000008	Veronica's Unarmed attack rate goes up by 30%.
MMU0000009	Maybe you were bad once, but you ain't like that now. Your Karma has been reset to 0, attacks cost 20% less AP, you regenerate AP 25% faster, and your attack speed is increased by 20%. You are also immune to critical hits. (Requires Bad Karma.)
MMU0000010	Having the Chem Resistant perk means you're 50% less likely to develop an addiction.
MMU0000011	With the Chemist perk, certain chems lasts twice as long.[CRLF](Cannot be used with Logan's Loophole).
MMU0000012	Your brain has been replaced with advanced technologies: Your head can no longer be crippled and is resistant to addiction (+25% resistance) and shock from bodily damage (+5% Damage Threshold, minimum +1, maximum +3).
MMU0000013	You've taken enough chems to know how to hang on to the effects just a while longer (+33% duration for certain Chems).
MMU0000014	...That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
MMU0000015	It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail. Hoh!
MMU0000016	It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out. What!?
MMU0000017	They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number! What!?
MMU0000018	I told my wife she was good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul. Aye-aye-aye!
MMU0000019	My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous. Hah-chacha!
MMU0000020	I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next door to a brothel. Oh no!
MMU0000021	I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest. Oh no!
MMU0000022	I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong? Oh!
MMU0000023	I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me! No!
MMU0000024	I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back. I did it!
MMU0000025	I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood. Aye-aye-aye!
MMU0000026	People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark! And it burns!
MMU0000027	So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole. Did he just say that!?
MMU0000028	I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown. I ate a person!
MMU0000029	A ghoul goes to a doctor and he says "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says "Son, that's called your face." Ding-dong!
MMU0000030	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you my friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower - as if this city is more important.
MMU0000031	Doesn't look like you've brought back the Platinum Chip!
MMU0000032	Things have been lots better since you helped with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So what can I do for you?
MMU0000033	Talk to Simon.
MMU0000034	Poison removed.
MMU0000035	Empty. Waiting for restock.
MMU0000036	The Thorn's fight has finished.
MMU0000037	Your weapons have been returned.
MMU0000038	ED-E has returned all of your items.
MMU0000039	Items retrieved.
MMU0000040	Follows-Chalk has returned all of your items.
MMU0000041	Waking Cloud has returned all of your items.
MMU0000042	Joshua Graham has returned all of your items.
MMU0000043	Your equipment has been returned.
MMU0000044	You found a Limited Edition Mojave Landmark Snow Globe!
MMU0000045	Some folks have asked - why not a Protectron with wheels? RobCo wasn't afraid to answer that question: The Protect-O-Bot is the answer. While safety standards prevented this free-wheeling dynamo from entering mass market production despite RobCo's best intentions and teams of lawyers, we take consolation in letting you can see this extremely well-funded experiment as it was intended - a robot moving so fast it looks like it's standing still!
MMU0000046	Addictions Cured.
MMU0000047	Health and Limbs restored.
MMU0000048	Fallout: New Vegas allows you to play in a new Hardcore mode that greatly increases the challenge of the game. In this mode, Stimpaks heal over time and cannot mend broken limbs, Rad-Away removes radiation over time, ammunition has weight, sleep does not heal and dehydration is a constant concern. This mode is only recommended for advanced players.
MMU0000049	Disabled body parts healed.
MMU0000050	Always remember: you are a member of two families now. And you have obligations to both. But your obligation to the Poseidon Family is greater, because while your children may misbehave and your friends may change and your wife may nag and cheat on you, Poseidon Energy will always be paying for and protecting your way of life. Don't tell anybody anything about the projects conducted at Poseidon Energy. When pressed, tell them that your job is repetitive and not worth discussing, but the Company is nurturing and gives good benefits and is always looking for new talent.
MMU0000051	Contreras insists that Keller must be killed, in order to avoid any further entanglements with the NCR.
MMU0000052	1. Aspartame Sugar Bombs.
MMU0000053	This map allows you to travel to Zion Canyon and also back to Mojave Wasteland.
MMU0000054	Tell James Garret that Fisto will be joining the Wrangler.
MMU0000055	Tell James Garret that Santiago will be joining the Wrangler.
MMU0000056	Tell James Garret that Beatrix will be joining the Wrangler.
MMU0000057	Tell James Garret that Old Ben will be joining the Wrangler.
MMU0000058	Return to Colonel Moore with news that the Great Khans have been dealt with.
MMU0000059	(Optional) Stabilize stealth field of prototype.

MMU0000069	How 'bout I help you take over this town?
MMU0000070	I have some questions about your ruined robot.
MMU0000071	The Legion caught him and crucified him.
MMU0000072	Look, what do you want?
MMU0000073	<100 caps> Let's do it.
MMU0000074	I found an assassin in the tower. 
MMU0000075	All right. I guess I believe you.
MMU0000076	Bullshit. If you're moving drugs, I'm going to have to report you.
MMU0000077	Lying bastard. I want cut in on this action.
MMU0000078	The law is the law. I'm done doing business with you.
MMU0000079	Some guy is standing in for Price. I didn't inquire further.
MMU0000080	Price wasn't there. I found some guy claiming to be his replacement.
MMU0000081	I convinced the Ranger to work with you. You're safe, but be careful.
MMU0000082	I'll return once I've spoken to him.
MMU0000083	Son of a... Sir, I didn't know anything about this.
MMU0000084	Close enough. Yeah, Contreras told me to give Price this package.
MMU0000085	I haven't spoken to him yet. I'll return when I have.
MMU0000086	<Draw Weapon>You'll never take me alive, pig!
MMU0000087	C'mon guy. You're no merchant. You've got Ranger all over you.
MMU0000088	<Give 250 caps>I'm sure Contreras would be willing to work with you...
MMU0000089	<Cover Package> Oh this? Nothing important.
MMU0000090	Here. Take this package Contreras gave me. I don't want any trouble.
MMU0000091	I was just told he was a local merchant I should check out.
MMU0000092	Oh, just delivering packages. No clue whats in em, but its really important.
MMU0000093	Price is being held by the NCR. A Ranger replaced him.
MMU0000094	We don't have to kill him. You could work with him and make caps.
MMU0000095	You took the package, remember?
MMU0000096	Killing a Ranger brings big risks. Killing gets expensive.
MMU0000097	The guy standing in for Price, Keller, is dead.
MMU0000098	Don't worry. I paid him off. He won't be a problem.
MMU0000099	He's looking to break up trafficking. Maybe there is money to be made here...
MMU0000100	I'll kill him. Consider it done.
MMU0000101	I've got connections. Maybe we could make an arrangement?
MMU0000102	I've got caps. Name your price.

WMX0000023	Please exit the Pip-Boy to access the Weapon Mods Expanded (WMX) uninstallation menu.
WMX0000024	The recommended method for uninstalling WMX is to first remove all attached weapon mods from your weapons. This requires the Weapon Mod Menu (link in WMX readme). Alternatively:
WMX0000025	WARNING: THIS IS IRREVERSIBLE.
WMX0000026	Once you have selected 'Uninstall WMX' below, you will need to load a save game if you change your mind.
WMX0000027	Uninstalling WMX requires first removing any weapons modified with WMX weapon mods (or with weapon mods that are not applicable to that weapon in the default game) from anywhere you can access them in-game, or else face crashes to desktop.
WMX0000028	Clicking on 'Uninstall WMX' will exit this menu and automatically open a container. Place all weapons you have modified with WMX weapon mods into this container. The container also holds weapons and weapon mods from the default game that you can take as replacements if you wish. If you can't find a particular weapon in the container, that means that it can't have WMX weapon mods applied to it, and you don't need to replace it.
WMX0000029	Uninstall WMX
WMX0000030	Cancel (exit menu)
WMX0000031	The WMX Uninstallation process has been initiated. You will need to load a save game if you have changed your mind about uninstalling WMX.
WMX0000032	To complete the uninstallation process, do the following:
WMX0000033	1. Exit this menu and save your game.
WMX0000034	2. Quit out of Fallout: New Vegas (FNV).
WMX0000035	3. Deactivate WeaponModsExpanded.esp (and any add-ons) using FOMM/NMM/the FNV launcher.
WMX0000036	If you need to access the container again, use the menu below.
WMX0000037	This menu will display every ten seconds (as a reminder) until WMX uninstallation is complete.
WMX0000038	Access container again
WMX0000039	Notes will be added shortly.
WMX0000040	Notes will be removed shortly.
WMX0000041	WMX Uninstall Menu will be added shortly.
WMX0000042	WMX Uninstall Menu will be removed shortly.

WMX0000054	WMX detects that you have equipped the Weathered 10mm Pistol. This weapon has an unfortunate (seemingly hard-coded) bug that means that any weapon mods applied to it will not be visible on the weapon.
WMX0000055	This menu allows you to swap the defective original Weathered 10mm Pistol for a fully-functional duplicate of it. Doing so will effectively erase any weapon mods already applied to the weapon, so it is recommended to remove them first using the Weapon Mod Menu. (Find a link to the Weapon Mod Menu on the WMX New Vegas Nexus page.)
WMX0000056	When you are ready to proceed, select the 'Swap Weapon' button. Select 'Cancel' if you are not ready to proceed (this menu will appear again when you next equip the bugged Weathered 10mm Pistol),

SPR0000044	You are currently in NoNVSE mode.  Certain features of Sprint mod require New Vegas Script Extender v1 or higher.  For instructions on how to get NVSE, see SprintReadme.txt
SPR0000045	In NoNVSE mode, you must bind the Vault-Tec Pedometer in your inventory to a hotkey.  To start sprinting, press the sprint hotkey and then move forward.  To stop sprinting, press the hotkey again.
SPR0000046	To bind a hotkey, hold down a number key while viewing the inventory and click on the item you want to bind.
SPR0000047	Sprinting takes action points, and if you run out, you'll have to wait for them to recharge.  The more endurance you have, the less AP it takes to sprint, and the more agility you have, the faster you'll go.  The amount of weight you're carrying also affects your speed.
SPR0000048	There are certain situations in which you will be unable to sprint, such as when your legs are broken, or when you're overencumbered.
SPR0000049	To access the menu, click on the Vault-Tec Pedometer in the apparel section of your inventory.
SPR0000050	You can set a sprint delay in the settings menu of the pedometer, which will allow you to run for a certain amount of time without sprinting.  So if you choose a delay of 2 you'll need to run forward for 2 seconds before you start sprinting.
SPR0000051	You are currently in NVSE mode.  That means all features are enabled.  Hooray!
SPR0000052	The sprint key replaces the run key.  Simply hold down run to sprint.  -OR-   If you would like to preserve the functionality of the run key, you can set a custom keybinding from the control settings menu of the pedometer.

WIL0000151	Dino Dee-lite Bungalow Key
WIL0000152	J.T. is is going to the Mojave Outpost.
WIL0000153	Do nothing...
WIL0000154	Willow relax in the bungalow...
WIL0000155	Willow stop relaxing and follow me again...
WIL0000156	Willow cook something at the stove...
WIL0000157	Willow sit down in her chair at the dining table...
WIL0000158	Willow get up from her chair at the dining table...
WIL0000159	Set out a meal for two of Willow's Ant Stew on the dining table...
WIL0000160	Willow cooks, sets the table with Ant Stew and sits at the table (return to menu to unsit her)
WIL0000161	Use this menu to have Willow do a handful of actions in the bungalow.
WIL0000162	NOTE: If you use this menu to have Willow sit in her chair at the table you MUST return to this menu to have her stand up out of the chair again.
WIL0000163	You are experiencing a pleasant afterglow...
WIL0000164	Willow used one Antivenom.
WIL0000165	You must clean up Willow's Campfire after she has set it up.  If you leave it in the gameworld, your saved games will get bloated.
WIL0000166	Also, when Willow sets out her campfire she will automatically remove her ingredients from your inventory so she can cook with them.
WIL0000167	Have fun and don't forget to clean up the campfires!
WIL0000168	Cook at campfire
WIL0000169	Clean up campfire
WIL0000170	You will be able to manage Willow's clothing via a menu and this wardrobe once you've reached BFFs with her and she's unlocked her clothing.
WIL0000171	Sleepwear (if conditions are met will be used when she sleeps in the bungalow)
WIL0000172	Intimate Moments (if conditions are met will be used in fade to black scene)
WIL0000173	Permanent Outfit (worn with all other outfits requires NVSE and UNIQUE SETUP)
WIL0000174	Put CLOTHING/ARMOR for Willow inside this wardrobe via this menu.  Once you have put items into the "drawers" you will be able to manage them in a topic in Willow's dialogue. An empty drawer will leave Willow naked if you choose that outfit in dialogue.
WIL0000175	PERMANENT OUTFIT: You MUST do the following to set it up: Dress Willow ONLY in the clothing items you want her to wear at all times. Use this menu & select Permanent Outfit. When you want to change it repeat that process. The script will return the old outfit to your inventory.
WIL0000176	Willow is now marked essential.  She CANNOT die.
WIL0000177	You've have fired Willow one too many times.  She has left the Mojave for good, never to return.
WIL0000178	Willow is is going to the Mojave Outpost.
WIL0000179	She has taken her perk with her.
WIL0000180	Firing Willow is serious business. You can only fire her once and get her back again.  After that she will not return to you.  She doesn't like being fired; you are rejecting her when you do it.
WIL0000181	If you need to adventure without her have her wait for you somewhere.  She will wait forever because she doesn't have a wait timer like the vanilla companions.
WIL0000182	You examine Willow's leg and see that the wound was never cleaned properly.  You clean the wound of debris and use antibiotics to clear up the infection. Willow should no longer experience any discomfort.
WIL0000183	Congratulations! You've convinced Willow to unlock her clothing early!
WIL0000184	Gecko Slayer Challenge Unlocked!
WIL0000185	Willow hates geckos and is happy to cook up any meat you bring to her, but do you possess the courage and determination to take it to the next level?
WIL0000186	If you do, show it by slaying enough geckos to bring her 100 pieces of gecko meat.  Do this and she will surely reward you.
WIL0000187	The Gecko Slayer Challenge is looking good!
WIL0000188	20/100
WIL0000189	40/100
WIL0000190	60/100

WIL0000192	You've given Willow the 100th piece of gecko meat.  Be sure to talk to her about it.
WIL0000193	Willow is storing the Gecko Meat you give her in the bungalow crafting cupboard above the stove.
WIL0000194	Willow has gone home.
WIL0000195	Willow has gone to the suite at the Lucky 38.
WIL0000196	Willow has gone to the Mojave Outpost.

WIL0000280	Willow watched you and Lucius while he taught you the Legion Assault special move.  Her Unarmed skill is high enough that she was able to learn quite a bit more from your session with him.  Her Unarmed skill has increased by 15.
WIL0000281	Willow watched you and Lucius while he taught you the Legion Assault special move.  Because her Unarmed skill is still below 50 most of what he showed you went over her head. Her Unarmed skill has only increased by 5.
WIL0000282	You are either missing NVSE entirely or could use a newer version to fully enjoy the features added to Willow via NVSE. The version you need for Willow is NVSE v2b12.  The information about where to download it is available on Willow's mod page at Nexus.

WIL0000305	Explorer Collectible Challenge Unlocked!
WIL0000306	There are 9 items spread throughout the gameworld for you to find which are tracked by this challenge.  They are distinguished by a present icon and a special sound when you pick them up. (There is a tenth untracked item available if you have the Wild Wasteland trait).
WIL0000307	You may keep these items for yourself or gift them to Willow.  If you choose to mark the bungalow as Willow's home they may be displayed there from her inventory, you may display them at any time.

WIL0000314	Stay where you are, please, and don't attack anything.
WIL0000315	Thanks for waiting, but I want your help now.
WIL0000316	Get out of there. Now!
WIL0000317	Stop fighting and return to my position.
WIL0000318	Keep doing what you're doing.
WIL0000319	Return to my position immediately!
WIL0000320	Willow has finished shopping.
WIL0000321	Congratulations!  You've completed Willow's shopping quest!
WIL0000322	If you decide to take Willow shopping in the future she will need to have caps when she enters the store or approaches the trader.  She needs 20 caps in each location.  If she doesn't have the caps she will not approach the trader.  If that happens, you will find a dialogue topic when you are in those locations, when she has insufficient caps, and you can use it to give her caps.  It prompts her to go talk to the trader.
WIL0000323	1) Willow will sleep/wait for you if you leave her while she sleeps.  Her location will be marked on your Pipboy.  You can wake her any time by talking to her otherwise she will sleep for approximately five ingame hours.
WIL0000324	2) You must use her special wake up dialogue to get her to follow you again. The companion wheel dialogue will not work to do this. The wake up dialogue is a greeting she will give you if you enter dialogue from the companion wheel. If you use her radio to call her when sleeping use this dialogue to get her dressed again.
WIL0000325	3) You must clean up the bedroll after she gets up or you will get bloated save games.
WIL0000326	Don't forget to clean up her bedroll and have fun!
WIL0000327	Willow, wait there. I'll come to you.
WIL0000328	Why don't you keep doing what you're doing now.
WIL0000329	Willow, please meet me at my current location. Thanks.
WIL0000330	Cook Ant Stew and set up meal for two on the table (requires ingredients for two batches of Stew)
WIL0000331	You can clean up the box when you are done with it.  If you do, maybe you'll get more presents from Willow...
WIL0000332	Open box
WIL0000333	Clean up box
WIL0000334	Congratulations! You've completed Willow's Teddy Collectible Challenge!
WIL0000335	Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a bear from the Nevada Bear Company's prestigious Gold Label Collection. This limited edition collection of seven bears was created exclusively for the Nevada Bear Company by our designers in consultation with many of today's most highly acclaimed experts and designers from fields as unlikely and diverse as Science, Architecture, Fashion Design, and the Military. We bring you this most unusual line hoping that you, the most discriminating collector, will enjoy them for years to come.
WIL0000336	You can gift the bears to Willow. If you mark the bungalow as Willow's home they may be displayed there from her inventory. You may display them at any time.  At the end of the challenge, they can be turned into nonquest items.
WIL0000337	Welcome to Willow's Gold Plated Cheater's Edition!  I'd suggest you don't cheat and play through properly if you haven't played the mod before.  However, if you choose to cheat, containers and a terminal will appear to help you.  First take Beauty, Moira and Chester from the gold ammo container next to the shelves and give them to Willow through dialogue.  Once that's done use the terminal to move to BFFs, talk to her again about being best friends and be sure to go back into dialogue after the fade to black kiss to choose the Romance or Friends path and then return to the terminal to choose what else to do (you won't be able to choose to skip ahead to finish the quest until you've made that decision). The Shopping Quest and Unarmed Quest can be completed at the terminal after you have received them in dialogue from Willow.
WIL0000338	I want to cheat! You can cheat other quests besides the main one (enables items necessary to do so)
WIL0000339	I changed my mind! I do not want to cheat!  (PERMANENTLY disables opportunity to cheat)
WIL0000340	I won't decide right now...
WIL0000341	You can change the quest status on the items given to you by Willow's mod with this menu.  The Radios, Points Checker and J.T.'s baseball can be managed here so that you can drop them or reverse that decision.
WIL0000342	Make Willow's Radio droppable (not a quest item)
WIL0000343	Make Willow's Points Checker droppable (not a quest item)
WIL0000344	Make Willow's Combat Menu droppable (not a quest item)
WIL0000345	Make J.T.s baseball droppable (not a quest item)
WIL0000346	Make Willow's radio undroppable (a quest item)
WIL0000347	Make Willow's Points Checker undroppable (a quest item)
WIL0000348	Make Willow's Combat Menu undroppable (a quest item)

WIL0000432	Willow, at a workbench, combine:
WIL0000433	3 Sticks of Dynamite
WIL0000434	Wires taken from Scrap Electronics
WIL0000435	A salvaged watch
WIL0000436	1 Teddy Bear
WIL0000437	Oh, be careful.  These are funny, but very powerful! I recommend that you throw the bear and run like hell the other way.
WIL0000438	- Ron
WIL0000439	I've thought about this a lot and have come to a decision you might not like, but I have to leave.  I won't be able to live with myself if I fight with you to support Caesar.
WIL0000440	As much as I love you, it cannot overcome how much I hate that man and what he stands for and what he does.
WIL0000441	Please, please forgive me.
WIL0000442	I'll be waiting for you so come pick me up after, okay?  Stay safe.
WIL0000443	Love, Willow
WIL0000444	My love,
WIL0000445	Congratulations!  You and Willow are Best Friends Forever!  She will never leave you unless you fire her.  She is completely loyal and devoted to you.
WIL0000446	[%]-
WIL0000447	12  Empty Nuka Cola Bottles  (they have to be Nuka Cola Bottles)
WIL0000449	I did the math and this is what I need to make as much Nuka-Star coffee as I would love to have for a month.
WIL0000450	4  Broc Flowers
WIL0000451	4  Xander Roots
WIL0000452	4  Pinyon Nuts
WIL0000453	4  Purified Waters
WIL0000454	4  Sunset Sarsaparilla
WIL0000455	4  Nuka-Colas
WIL0000456	12  Bottle Caps (no, not Star Bottle Caps even though my mom named it Nuka-Star Coffee)
WIL0000457	Willow's eating with you is for roleplaying purposes.
WIL0000458	She will try to sit down to do it.  If there is no appropriate seat nearby she won't be able to eat although she will remain standing and drink something.
WIL0000459	She will eat and/or drink for two minutes and then return to following you.  There is nothing more you need to do.
WIL0000460	:)  Have fun!
WIL0000461	You've helped Willow recover her stolen items and she is very grateful.  She now considers you a friend.  To help you on your way to becoming BFFs and beyond here is a list of the gifts you can give to Willow that are guaranteed to make her happy. A dialogue topic will appear when you have one or more of these items in your inventory.
WIL0000462	Teddy Bear, Intact Garden Gnome, Nuka Cola Quartz, Fancy Lad Snack Cakes, Bubblegum, Gumdrops and Junk Food.
WIL0000463	You can give no more than one present a day.
WIL0000464	Willow's shopping works like this:
WIL0000465	She will need 15 or 20 caps per trip.
WIL0000466	She finds caps of her own while following you, but she probably won't have enough if you take her shopping frequently.  When you enter the area where she is supposed to talk to the trader, if she does nothing, go talk to her.  She has a dialogue topic that allows you to give her caps if you want to.  That topic only appears in those locations. She also has an Idle Chatter topic that alerts you when she has fewer than 20 caps.
WIL0000467	The items she buys are ingredients for her own recipes and a couple of others that she will successfully cook if she has ingredients when you ask her to put out her campfire.
WIL0000468	However, she doesn't buy everything she needs.  Some things will need to be scavenged or gathered.
WIL0000469	I've decided to leave for the Mojave Outpost.  If you still want J.T. once you've gotten the 250 caps together meet me there.
WIL0000470	You will pursue Michael Jefferson, the ghoul that took and killed my two sons, into Nevada and capture him and bring him back to me alive.
WIL0000471	If you bring him to me alive I will give you $1000 NCR.
WIL0000472	If you kill him, or he is dead by someone else's hand, but you bring me his head, I'll pay you $500 NCR.
WIL0000473	Any other outcome and you will receive nothing from me.
WIL0000474	The latest intel I have from my investigator is that Jefferson is heading for a small town south of New Vegas. There's a cult there led by a ghoul named Jason Bright.  Jefferson thinks he will be safe hidden among the other zombies.  We bribed his lover for this information and we believe it to be reliable.
WIL0000475	John Williams
WIL0000476	Apple
WIL0000477	Nuka Cola
WIL0000478	Potato
WIL0000479	Sarsaparilla
WIL0000480	These are the ingredients I need to make my favorite recipes. I need more than one of some of them to make a batch of something and, of course, we'd need to use a campfire to cook.  I can set one up for us anytime.  Willow  :)
WIL0000481	My favorite recipes: all my own recipes but I also like to make Gecko Steak and Gecko Kebabs
WIL0000482	Carrot
WIL0000483	Boomtown!
WIL0000484	We were in Boomtown today.  What a place.  It's gigantic.  There's a plane there, which are things that are kind of like trains but they flew in the air like birds. They must have been so beautiful flying with those giant wings flapping in the sky.
WIL0000485	Oh!  Better than that, we met Pearl, who's this very, very old lady. She seems very nice, but she reminded me of Madame Zelda.  I kept expecting her to invite us to sit down so she could tell us our fortunes!  I had to fight hard not to giggle at her and ask her when she did palm readings.  Madame Zelda would only do them during the week of the full moon.  Bethie and I always made sure to go get our palms read.  It was so fun.  When she died we stole her crystal ball from her trailer.  I hope it's still in my room.  oh!  I hope mom hasn't cleaned my room!  I bet she has. Grr!  I'll get home someday and she'll have dumped half of my stuff!!!
WIL0000486	We've been doing stuff for the Boomers so they'll like us and we've been doing a LOT of walking around Boomtown.  It's so big!!! So, we helped Jack, he's this guy who watches girls through binoculars.  He fell in love with a girl at the Crimson Caravan (he saw her through his binoculars) and wanted help getting together with her. So [%] went to Crimson Caravan and talked to the girl and now she's gone to Boomtown to be with Jack!  It was very romantic (although a lot of work for [%] to pull together).
WIL0000487	Every time I see that little building Pearl lives in I want to go ask her for a palm reading or to have her tell my fortune.  I bet she'd be really good at it. Ha!
WIL0000488	We've been doing stuff for the Boomers and when we're there Cass is so crabby about them.  Sure, at first they were cautious, and yes, they have heavy artillery that they shoot at outsiders, but they aren't that bad once you're inside.  It's not like they're just waiting for us to let down our guard so they can attack; they're good people.
WIL0000489	All she wants to do is drink and complain about stuff.  She knows a lot of stuff and that's useful.  I have to give her that.  And she seems to like [%] even though she's kind of crabby about that too.
WIL0000490	I don't see how the two of us will ever get along, we are just so different.
WIL0000491	So now that [%] and I are staying friends forever, and our relationship isn't going any further, I wonder if it will be a problem that I like Boone?  I don't think Boone will ever notice me, but he's such a good man.  What he did for Carla was so  brave and noble and he's so skilled with his weapon (heh) and that voice!  Wow, so incredibly sexy.  I guess I'll just keep being nice to him and see what happens...
WIL0000492	Oh, no! [%] asked Cass to come with us!  I've never told [%] about the fight she and I got into at the MO that night.  I don't think Cass remembers me (she was so drunk) because I'm sure she'd be saying something to me if she did, but she's ignoring me, or maybe she's ignoring me because she remembers.  I don't know, but I don't want to talk to her after what happened so it suits me that she has nothing to say to me.
WIL0000493	Cass Caravan Site
WIL0000494	We found Cass' caravan site today.  The caravan had been totally destroyed.  She was very upset.  I felt bad for her.
WIL0000495	We found Chester today. I'm so happy.
WIL0000496	I'm starting to like [%] more and more all the time. I wonder if we'll ever be more than friends?  I think about it a lot.
WIL0000497	I had a pretty good day today, found a couple of little things and some caps. I don't do nearly as much scavenging as I'd like, since I'm sticking close to [%] but I manage to pick up some stuff. As always, my watch obsession keeps me looking for them tucked in the pockets of clothes I find. I'm hoping I'll be lucky enough to find dynamite or gun powder or maybe even some more pencils wherever we end up going.
WIL0000498	This journal belongs to:
WIL0000499	Willow Coleen Andersen
WIL0000500	It was given to me by my mom for my 17th birthday on, May 13, 2279 to take on my trip to New Vegas.
WIL0000501	Dex's Dogtags
WIL0000502	I've been thinking a lot about Dex lately. I don't know if I should tell [%] about him or not.  When I've talked about it before it didn't turn out so well and I don't really want that to happen again.
WIL0000503	The thing is Dex was in the NCR and then what he did to me, trying to rape me, that sounds bad, but what I did is so much worse. Or maybe it wasn't, because he said he'd kill me so I did it to save myself.  I hate to think about it anymore.  I've spent so much time thinking about it.  I like to think that I did the right think saving myself.  And it wasn't my fault he was an NCR trooper and not an evil Raider that everyone expects to be out in the world looking for women to rape.
WIL0000504	And that NCR captain was so mean about it (how did you manage to kill a trooper if you didn't plan it ahead of time? (I always carry a weapon with me that's why)  what were you doing out there alone with a man, anyway, if you didn't want to get raped? (what? is that a serious question?) Is that what you were wearing?  Isn't that what whore's wear? (I'm wearing regular clothes, no I'm not a whore, you asshole!)). He made me so angry. Blaming me because I was acting like a normal girl on a date with a (huh!) respectable NCR trooper at a NCR outpost.
WIL0000505	Thank goodness, though, that after he was so awful he decided to believe me (turned out Dex had been in trouble about girls before). I learned a lot about the NCR and life during that week, didn't I?  Yes, yes, I did.
WIL0000506	I don't know why I keep Dex's dogtags. Maybe it's time to get rid of the damn things so I can just forget about it.
WIL0000507	Bad dreams, bad sleep...
WIL0000508	I've been having trouble sleeping lately.  I keep dreaming about the day Big George died only instead of Big George I'm the one that falls off the edge of the trail and breaks my leg and maybe my arms too.  I'm not sure, I lay there and I can't move my body at all.  I can look around and it's very dark, which is weird, because the accident with Big George happened during the day, but it's night and I can hear something coming for me and I think it's the geckos.  I'm scared because I can't move and I keep trying to get to Beauty.  I can see it lying just out of reach on the ground and I'm getting more and more frantic and the approaching sounds get louder and louder and as I start to yell in frustration and fear I wake up.
WIL0000509	It's a little different every time (sometimes whatever it is that's coming almost gets close enough that I can see it and sometimes I wake up while I'm still trying to get to Beauty), but I've had it three or four times now and each time I wake up with my heart pounding and I'm so scared it takes me a long, long time to get back to sleep.  I'm afraid it's not geckos coming for me, but maybe deathclaws...if they reach me before I wake up one night, I'm worried I'll wake up screaming and crying out loud.
WIL0000510	Bad dream...
WIL0000511	I had a horrible, horrible dream last night.
WIL0000512	I'm at home in Klamath at our motel, in the courtyard looking toward the main lobby.  It's weird though, I seem to be high off the ground, because what I'm looking at is the spot on the wall where the roof meets the building.
WIL0000513	While I'm there looking toward the lobby my mom and dad exit the door and come and stand right in front of me.  Their heads reach only as high as my feet and they look up at me. They are shouting something, but I can't hear them, and they look angry which makes me very sad and I start to cry.
WIL0000514	While I'm looking down at them I see that my legs have rope around them and I turn my head to look at each of my arms and they are tied as well.  I'm hanging, crucified to a cross like the ones Caesar hangs people on.
WIL0000515	I cry even harder when I realize what's happened to me.  I ask my parents why they've done this to me.  They shout more and I still cannot hear what they say.  They throw things at me (I don't know what they are, but they are little and hurt where they hit me) and they laugh and mock me.  I beg them to stop and am crying.
WIL0000516	Then I woke up.  My heart was pounding and I was still crying.  Ugh.  It was bad.
WIL0000517	Weird dream!
WIL0000518	I just had the craziest dream!  It was like I was living another life completely, but [%] was in it.
WIL0000519	So the dream starts with us meeting, and we met the same way we met in real life.  [%] finds me and helps me and then we go look for my stuff and do whatever we do together.  It's very much like things have been in real life, except that [%] seems to be an entirely different person.
WIL0000520	So neat, except that it was also so weird.  But that's not the weirdest part.  After I was dreaming for awhile, It started over again.
WIL0000521	I met [%] again, as another person, with another name in the same place we met the first time.
WIL0000522	I woke up so happy. What a great idea, living many lives over and over again with the same person I like so much.
WIL0000523	J.T. is dead.  I'm so sad.  He was a very good dog.  I'll miss him very much.  Poor puppy.  I love you, J.T., wherever you are.
WIL0000524	The Big Guy and I only just got into the Mojave Outpost a couple of hours ago. We split up right away. I'm kind of sad to see him go. He wasn't much fun (hardly any talking! and he didn't ever tell me his name!), but he was a great comfort to have along.  I felt very safe with him around and it was nice to be with J.T. I didn't miss Big George so much.
WIL0000525	I've been on the road for almost two years now and still haven't found a great friend to bring along with me on my travels or someone to fall in love with and maybe even settle down with in a cozy home somewhere.  I don't think I'm ready to stop having adventures yet, but I do long to have someone special in my life and wouldn't mind having a place to call my own again.
WIL0000526	Anyway, enough of that!  I have practical things to worry about, like who to travel with next and where to go (New Vegas!!).  I'll do that in the morning after I get a good night's sleep. I can hardly keep my eyes open.
WIL0000527	Mojave Outpost Day 2
WIL0000528	I spent most of today talking to people finding out everything I could about the Mojave and New Vegas.  I got some good information.  I don't know why I did it, but I asked about Bethie. No one I talked to has seen her. I knew it was pointless to ask, but I couldn't help myself.
WIL0000529	I was happy to see the NCR folks here; they made me feel welcome, although they don't seem overly happy to be here in the Mojave.  There was a lot of legion talk, too.  I don't like showing up here when war's so close to breaking out, but it's a problem I'm not going to worry about until I have to or until I see a legion guy coming at me. That's a scary thought. But that's why I've got Beauty!
WIL0000530	Oh, and last night I was having a drink and got into a fight!  I haven't been in a fight in months.  She was drunk and mean and she called me stupid and naive!  Stupid and naive!  I've been on the road for nearly two years, that stupid red-haired brahmin!  We were both so angry I think it would have come to blows, but a Ranger came over and told us to calm down or he'd dump a bucket of water on us.  A bucket of water! I felt like a seven year old.  It was so embarrassing.  I haven't lost my temper like that in a long, long  time.  But, oh, she made me so mad!!
WIL0000531	Mormon Fort
WIL0000532	We went to the Old Mormon Fort today and I saw a man that looks just like Val!!  His name is Arcade and he's even a doctor.  It's so weird.  They even wear the same kind of glasses.  I ran over to talk to him when I saw him, but he wouldn't say much.  I don't know if I scared him or if he thought I was crazy because I was trying to talk to him even though I don't know him, but it was kind of funny the way he wouldn't say much to me.
WIL0000533	I miss Val.  I'd love to hear his voice and talk to him.
WIL0000534	The Fort is in Freeside.  Freeside is right outside The Strip, with rats running around on the street.  And The Strip, with all the money, is just behind a gate; not too different than some other places I've seen.
WIL0000535	Oh, and The Fort is very, very old.  It reminded me of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe  and fortresses and castles and towers.  But, too bad, there are no princesses or magic here.
WIL0000536	We went into Nelson today and killed the main legion guy there.  I have no idea what they call themselves; by rank I mean.  And, honestly, I couldn't care less.  They all wear red and should be shot as far as I'm concerned.  So we did that and Novac should be a lot safer which makes me very, very happy.
WIL0000537	That sounds cruel, I know, but the legion is cruel, and evil.  Hmm, two wrongs probably don't make a right, so I shouldn't gloat that real people, people that may have real families are dead, but the people of the Mojave deserve to be protected from Caesar.
WIL0000538	Later...
WIL0000539	Okay, I can't stop thinking about how the guys in the legion may have family too.  Family like me, you know?  Sisters. And now I feel terrible.  War is a horrible thing.  I did not want to get involved in this, you know?  I just wanted to go to New Vegas!! Although, legion sisters are going to be treated like slaves...Ugh.  I hate this.
WIL0000540	I'm not going to think about that.  The legion is evil.  I'll focus on that.
WIL0000541	I saw Nipton today.  Nipton's been destroyed by the legion.  Well, the buildings are fine, but all of the people are gone.
WIL0000542	I'd always heard the legion were evil, cruel, etc.  But hearing it and seeing it are two different things.
WIL0000543	What they did to Nipton is unforgivable.  There were crosses in town with people on them and fires and those that weren't killed were sent to be slaves. There must have been kids there too...whole families.
WIL0000544	I don't think I'm making sense.  I'm too upset to write much.  If I didn't hate them before I hate them now.
WIL0000545	We went into a place called Novac today.  There's a statue there that is completely amazing! It's so big there's a gift shop inside and snipers guard the town from inside its mouth!  It sits at the edge of the courtyard to the motel in town.  I loved everything about the motel.  It reminded me so much of home, but instead of just a sign there's a magnificent, friendly statue that says hi to you whenever you come near.
WIL0000546	Present
WIL0000547	I gave [%] a present today. I've been looking for just the right thing for awhile. I've never been so happy with a travel companion. I have fun every day and traveling is the adventure it should be. I love it.
WIL0000548	I gave [%] a present today.  I just couldn't help myself anymore and had to do something. I have such a crush. I'm just bursting.  I may start flirting soon to get things moving...I'm ready for more...a lot more.  Although, the timing has to be right, and the setting, and, oh, most of all I want it to be hot and steamy.
WIL0000549	Raul has been telling us his stories and they are all so tragic.  It's no wonder he's so sad all the time.  I wish there was more we could do for him.  What he really needs is a woman. Now!
WIL0000550	The Boneyard
WIL0000551	Mina, Jonathan and I split up yesterday.  We've been on the road together for about a week.  I wasn't sorry to see them go. Mina was starting to get jealous of the way Jonathan was being nice to me. He wasn't interested in me that way, but there was no telling her that. He only had eyes for her.  She's going to lose him if she doesn't stop acting like such a jealous bitch all the time.
WIL0000552	I started asking around for someone else to travel with and I've already found someone going my way.  I wish I had a big dog with me.  I sure miss Big George.  I'd have felt comfortable heading out towards Nevada on my own and picking up someone on the way with him along, but I don't really want to do that all alone.
WIL0000553	Anyway, this guy I've met and I are planning to leave tomorrow morning.  We're going to make a market run to buy some things on the way out of town.  He wants to get some new gear and I could use a new pack.  I've done really well on the road so far so maybe I'll splurge and get something that looks really nice with my Gecko jacket - stupid geckos :(
WIL0000554	The Great Robbery!!!
WIL0000555	I was robbed.  What a disaster! I lost Beauty, Chester and Moira; I'm heart broken.  I got hurt in the scuffle and my leg is sore.  I had enough stimpaks on me to heal up the worst of it, but it's really bothering me and is itching horribly. I hope that goes away soon.
WIL0000556	But, I think that there might be something good to come out of it, as crazy as that sounds.  How can losing Beauty be good? Well, someone found me on the road and is going to help me find my stuff.
WIL0000557	And the someone! I don't want to jinx it so I'm just going to say this. I'm excited and am hoping for good things to happen.
WIL0000558	First Night
WIL0000559	I'm so excited.  Big George and I are laying out under the stars together on my Bedroll.  I cooked our first meal on the campfire tonight (Big George had dog treats and some Brahmin Meat the traders shared with him) and I tried to make mom's famous coffee over the campfire.  It was a disaster.  It's hard enough to make at home on the stove, but tonight it tastes horrible! I'm going to have to practice a lot to make it taste good.  I assumed cooking on the campfire wouldn't be that different from cooking at home.  Boy, was I wrong!
WIL0000560	We're traveling with a caravan that we know from the Motel.  I'm not sure exactly where we are tonight but we're headed south from Klamath towards San Francisco. I plan to stop at many places along the way and maybe spend months at a time in some of them.  This isn't going to be a fast trip.  I may spend years away from home.
WIL0000561	This is the exciting beginning to a very exciting adventure!
WIL0000562	San Francisco
WIL0000563	I'm exhausted.  We got into San Francisco yesterday morning early.  I'm traveling with a guy named Harry, his brother Ron and their sister Joanne. They've been great companions.  We stay up late every night laughing and telling stories around the campfire.  It might be good to find someone new to travel with so I get some sleep for a change!
WIL0000564	I'm determined to have a jacket made out of the hides of the geckos that killed Big George.
WIL0000565	I've been carrying the gecko hides around with me since Big George was killed. The trader that told me it could be done gave me the name of the woman who can do it and told me she's here somewhere. I'm going to find her no matter how long it takes.  I'm going to wear a jacket made from those hides.  Poor Big George deserves to be remembered. Stupid geckos.
WIL0000566	:(  I sure do miss him.
WIL0000567	It's funny, but I never really liked gecko meat before, but since Big George died, I'm suddenly very fond of it and hunt them whenever I can. Maybe it's the sense of revenge I get every time I chew one of them into little bits.
WIL0000568	Hmm.  That sounds pretty savage.  But dammit, they killed my dog!
WIL0000569	Legend of the Star Bottle Cap treasure...
WIL0000570	I wonder if the legend of the Star Bottle Cap treasure is true?  And if it is, how much treasure is there and where it might be?  Would it be caps or would it be other things?  Is it buried and is there a map somewhere that you can find?  I wonder if it did exist once upon a time, but someone already found it and it's long gone now.
WIL0000571	It would be a scavenger's and adventurer's dream come true to find something like that!  Much better treasure than the stuff I've found before, like those dog toys from before the war that still squeak or my bottle of Nuka Cola quantum or even my necklace, which, no matter how much I love it, isn't real treasure!
WIL0000572	So there is this crazy radio station on the air run by a Nightkin named, Tabitha. Today we went up the Mountain where her radio station is located.  It took us awhile to reach the top of the mountain because of all the obstacles in the way.  Besides being attacked by supermutants and Nightkin along the way, there were also rockslides!! to avoid.
WIL0000573	And the Nightkin! They are so impressive the way they go invisible on you.  Who wouldn't want to be that powerful in combat?
WIL0000574	When we reached the top there was a lot of radiation and a couple of big craters where bombs must have hit during the Great War. Beyond the craters are the group of buildings and towers that Tabitha calls Utobitha.
WIL0000575	Tabitha was inside the radio station wearing a crazy wig and a pair of red heart-shaped glasses!  She went crazy (crazier?) and fought and died.  I feel sorry for her.  The Nightkin are so tortured, poor things.
WIL0000576	When we reached the top there was a lot of radiation and a couple of big craters where bombs must have hit during the Great War Beyond the craters are the group of buildings and towers that Tabitha calls Utobitha.
WIL0000577	[%] fixed Rhonda and took it back to Tabitha.  So, that was a happy ending for Tabitha, I guess, as happy endings go, although she'll still be crazy, since she's a Nightkin.  Oh, and Tabitha was wearing a crazy wig and a pair of red heart-shaped glasses!
WIL0000578	We went into Westside today to do some shopping.  I heard that the man who runs the liquor store there is named Klamath Bob!  He's from Klamath too!  Small world, huh?  It seems very poor, like most places I've seen, but the people seem happy enough, although they are worried about the fiends, who have territory nearby.   There's this giant supermutant there named Mean Sonofabitch.  He's so sweet, but very hard to understand, and a place called the Casa Madrid Apartments where there are some prostitutes.  I was a little anxious to see what [%] would do about them

WIL0000580	Enjoy your present!
WIL0000581	I hope you like this one!
WIL0000582	Just for you,
WIL0000583	Alright losers, like I said before, go out and get me good stuff.  I get tired of repeating myself so this is your last chance.  I want weapons, chems, stuff that I can use or sell.  Oh, and if you find anything nice I can give to Wendy that would be good. Jewelry or something she'll like.
WIL0000584	I'm not going to Primm with the rest of those losers from NCRCF, not with the NCR sitting right at the gate so you're going to have to track me down.  I'm going to catch up with Wendy and her friends.  They're usually at The Raided Farmstead or at a place up on Highway 95 just south of Novac. To get to the Raided Farmstead go along the road that Nipton's on. If you keep going east you'll come to it soon enough. It's south of the road.
WIL0000585	Find me when you have something good for me and I'll make it worth your while.

WIL0000587	-This is Willow's main quest in which you will gain Willow's friendship and perhaps more...
WIL0000588	-Some things you do will make Willow happy or unhappy. You will know when you've made her happy or unhappy by a sound that plays when points are awarded or taken away from you. This process begins as soon as you meet her.
WIL0000591	Good luck and have fun!

WIL0000604	Cazador Egg x1
WIL0000605	This recipe is very hard to pull off.  Well, it can be eaten no matter what, as long as you cook it until the egg is done, but it tastes best if you cook it just right.

WIL0000624	Completing this challenge has shown you that carrying a lot of little junk around requires creative packing. Items with a weight of 2 or less now weigh half as much for you.

WIL0000680	Just being friends with Willow has its rewards. Be nice to her and nice things may happen to you.
WIL0000681	To move on to BFFs, you must also complete one special task that will show Willow how much you like her. There are three choices available to you. You may also give her gifts. See note in your Pipboy for details.

WIL0000799	*smooch*
WIL0000800	I'm done. Is there anything you want to talk to me about?

WIL0000802	What is it? Do you see something?
WIL0000803	Do you want something Willow?
WIL0000804	I would so love to add a Dinky souvenir to my collection.
WIL0000805	I have a Dinky the Dinosaur for you!
WIL0000806	Ooh, thanks!  That is a quality collectible.  I am stashing that somewhere safe.
WIL0000807	Oh, there's nothing better than a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed.
WIL0000808	I could use some coffee.
WIL0000809	It's the asshole!  He's here!
WIL0000810	Oh, you are not really going to sleep with him! Just don't make me watch, okay?
WIL0000811	Can I borrow Beauty for a while, Willow?
WIL0000812	Yes, of course. Take good care of her.
WIL0000813	Do you want Beauty back?  I'm done with her.
WIL0000814	I would!  Thank you.
WIL0000815	He buried you in the cemetery. Ouch.
WIL0000816	I'm glad you got that off your chest, but I wasn't planning to go in there just yet.
WIL0000817	Listen, I do not like being out here and I don't trust Caesar.
WIL0000818	I don't think we should go in there. This cannot be a good idea.
WIL0000819	We can't turn back now.  I have to go in.  You can wait out here if you want to.
WIL0000820	I hate to do that.  I'm no coward, but I don't trust him, not at all.  If you want me with you I'll come.
WIL0000821	There's nothing to be afraid of, Willow.  I've got your back.
WIL0000822	That does make me feel better, but I'm worried about you too.
WIL0000823	If you want me with you I'll come.
WIL0000824	Why don't you wait for me here.
WIL0000825	Okay, I'll do that.  I would have come with you gladly if that's what you'd wanted, but honestly it's a relief to stay out here.
WIL0000826	I do want you with me.  Come on.
WIL0000827	Alright.  Let's get this over with. I hope we make it out of this free and alive.
WIL0000828	Why don't you grab something you can eat while we're on the move. I don't want to stop right now.
WIL0000829	Alright.  I can do that.  Maybe we can do the big thing later?
WIL0000830	But, I don't have my favorite snack right now.  I guess I can make do or wait.
WIL0000831	Yes, let's do that.
WIL0000832	Okay, I'll set it up right here.  You might want to back up a bit.
WIL0000833	Can you set up a campfire right here?  This is a good spot, don't you think?
WIL0000834	Yes, it's a great spot. I'll set it up right now. You might want to back up a bit.
WIL0000835	I'd like you to keep quiet when we're walking around. I like the peace and quiet.
WIL0000836	Oh...okay.
WIL0000837	You can chatter while we're walking around if you like.  It's kind of quiet around here.
WIL0000838	Okay, sure.
WIL0000839	You wanted some coffee?  I have one to share. Do you want it?
WIL0000840	Oh, it's coffee! Thank you.
WIL0000841	Coffee?  Oh, thanks!
WIL0000842	I want you to leave now and get to safety. Go!
WIL0000843	Okay. Stay safe!
WIL0000844	Let's go now. I want you back by my side.
WIL0000845	Okay, I've got your back.
WIL0000846	There's no place I'd rather be.
WIL0000847	Sure, I don't need to be a hero.
WIL0000848	Why are you standing there frozen like that? Let's get a move on!
WIL0000849	I need you to fight again. Now!
WIL0000850	Okay. I've got your back.
WIL0000851	Stop fighting.(Debug to stop combat greeting but should stop enemy hunting if you're not in combat.)
WIL0000852	Stay here, please, and don't attack anything. Take cover if you can.
WIL0000853	Got it. I'll stay here.
WIL0000854	Thanks for waiting here, but I want your help now.
WIL0000855	Let's talk about what you do for me when we fight together, okay?
WIL0000856	Hi, J.T. How ya doing, ya good dog?
WIL0000857	Would you mind cooking something for me? (you use campfire crafting menu in dialogue)
WIL0000858	No, not at all. As long as you have the ingredients I can make whatever's on the menu.
WIL0000859	Let's do it. You have what you need, right?
WIL0000860	I don't have everything I need, but I'll come back.
WIL0000861	Okay, I'm ready. May I see the menu?
WIL0000862	Yeah. I just need a minute to get my stuff together.  Hold on.
WIL0000863	I've cooked something on the campfire if you want to share.
WIL0000864	I didn't cook anything.  We don't have what I need.
WIL0000865	I'm ready, hon.
WIL0000866	Good news, Willow! I have one for you...
WIL0000867	Willow, come here...
WIL0000868	Can I talk to you about something for a minute...
WIL0000869	Would you do something for me?
WIL0000870	That was just what I needed.
WIL0000871	Hmm, that was good.
WIL0000872	So, I'm carrying this legion stuff to be helpful, right?  You're not gonna make me wear it, are you?
WIL0000873	Ugh.  Do I really have to wear this?
WIL0000874	I think we should stop traveling together.
WIL0000875	Seriously?  You want to stop traveling with me?
WIL0000876	Oh, no, that sounds very final, doesn't it. Forget I said anything. Stay with me.
WIL0000877	Okay, I will. Are you messing with me?
WIL0000878	Yes, I want you to leave. It's not you. It's me. I need my space.
WIL0000879	Fine. I'll go find someone else to travel with..are you sure this is what you want?
WIL0000880	Fine. I'll go find somebody else to travel with..I don't need you.  Are you sure this is what you really want?
WIL0000881	Yes, it's what I really want.
WIL0000882	Well, goodbye.  I don't know what else to say.
WIL0000883	No, I'm sorry.  I don't want you to go.  Please stay.
WIL0000884	Okay, I'll stay. Please don't do that again. I don't want to leave you...ever.
WIL0000885	Yes, I want you gone. (This choice removes her from your game forever in prep for removing mod)
WIL0000886	Okay, well, thanks for helping me find Beauty, and goodbye.
WIL0000887	No, I don't want you to go. Please stay.
WIL0000888	Alright. I'll stay.
WIL0000889	Would you please go back to the Suite at the Lucky 38 and wait for me there?
WIL0000890	Without you?  Alright, but it won't be any fun. I don't like it there.
WIL0000891	Your leg?
WIL0000892	Would you look at it for me?  I don't think it's healing right.  It's still bothering me a lot.
WIL0000893	No, I don't think I can do it.
WIL0000894	That should do it.
WIL0000895	Sure, I'll look at it for you.
WIL0000896	Do you want to grab a bite to eat?
WIL0000897	Oh, that's a great idea.
WIL0000898	Will you join me?  It's not as much fun eating alone.
WIL0000899	Of course! I'm always hungry.
WIL0000900	I hope you're done eating.  I'm ready to go.
WIL0000901	That was fabulous!
WIL0000902	Can you skip the dance, Willow?  I don't want to wait.
WIL0000903	Of course, honey, whatever you want.
WIL0000904	Will you dance for me?
WIL0000905	Yes, for you, anything.
WIL0000906	Wow, that was wonderful. You were wonderful. I hope we can do that again sometime.
WIL0000907	I'm ready. Let's do it here.
WIL0000908	I'm so excited. I've been planning this for awhile. I hope you like it. Stay right there and don't move.
WIL0000909	I'm going to do something for you and then to you.
WIL0000910	Willow, I want to make love to you.
WIL0000911	Say, yes!
WIL0000912	Oh, yes! Absolutely!
WIL0000913	You want to, don't you?
WIL0000914	Oh, not right now, honey, I'm not really in the mood.  Soon, though, I promise.
WIL0000915	It will be. I promise.
WIL0000916	I have some gecko meat for you.  I know you like to cook with it.
WIL0000917	Thank you! How many do you have for me?
WIL0000918	I have some gecko meat for you.
WIL0000919	Do you think I've finally brought you enough gecko meat?
WIL0000920	Yes!  And I love having all the meat, but the best part is it feels like you've been avenging Big George's death.
WIL0000921	I've found a couple of things that I'd like you to have as a thank you for what you've done. Here.
WIL0000922	I have one piece for you.
WIL0000923	I have five pieces for you.
WIL0000924	I have ten pieces for you!  Do I get something special for that?
WIL0000925	*laughs* I don't have anything special right now, but keep the meat coming and maybe I'll find something good, you never know!
WIL0000926	Here's ten pieces for you!
WIL0000927	Thanks!  Hey, let's have gecko for dinner.
WIL0000928	Take everything I have.
WIL0000929	Uh-oh, am I in trouble?
WIL0000930	May I please have my Lucky Figurine back? You know, I didn't show you my collection so you could ransack it.
WIL0000931	Are you teasing me?
WIL0000932	Did you have fun going through my stuff? I hope so, but I need these things back.
WIL0000933	I took your Cooking Supplies.  Sorry.
WIL0000934	Hey!  I need that! It's going to be difficult for me to do any cooking without it.
WIL0000935	Yeah, I have your Cooking Supplies again.  Sorry.
WIL0000936	Hey, I need that!  I use it all the time. There are some loose pages you can read if you want, but hands off the book, okay?
WIL0000937	Give me that back!
WIL0000938	You are such a tease!
WIL0000939	Would you mind going back to the house?  I'll catch up with you later.
WIL0000940	Alright.  I'll see you there later.
WIL0000941	Sure I can't talk you into coming with me? It's going to be really lonely without you.
WIL0000942	Please come with me? I think we can think of something to do while we're there.
WIL0000943	Would you mind keeping watch here for awhile?
WIL0000944	Yeah, I can do that. No problem.
WIL0000945	I have a surprise for you, Willow!
WIL0000946	Oh, what is it?
WIL0000947	I'd like you to consider this your home and a place to stay here in the Mojave.
WIL0000948	No one has ever offered me a home before. Thank you.
WIL0000949	We're moving! This is our new house.  I thought it was time for a change.
WIL0000950	That's great news! I love the bungalow!
WIL0000951	It reminds me of home so much. I know I'll be very happy here.
WIL0000952	Oh? I'll miss the bungalow. Is this a permanent move or will we go back to the bungalow someday?
WIL0000953	This is just temporary, Willow. We'll go back.
WIL0000954	I don't know if we'll go back or not, Willow.   We'll see.
WIL0000955	Hope you're hungry, the food's all done.  I put it in the oven.
WIL0000956	singing in the shower
WIL0000957	Would you cook something for us at the stove?
WIL0000958	Sure, I'd love to.
WIL0000959	I thought you wanted to go shopping.  What's going on?
WIL0000960	Can I borrow 20 caps? I can't go shopping. I'm broke.
WIL0000961	Sorry, Willow, not right now.
WIL0000962	Oh.  Okay.
WIL0000963	Sure, I'll give you some caps for that.
WIL0000964	Things are going to get tough around here, Willow, really Hardcore. Be prepared.(Set Essential)
WIL0000965	Watch yourself. Things are going to get tough around here, and you could get hurt.(Set Unessential)
WIL0000966	Oh, no!  J.T.!  No!  He's dead!
WIL0000967	Are you happy to have J.T. along with us?
WIL0000968	I am!  I missed him after The Big Guy and I split up. Thank you so much for buying him for us. I don't miss Big George as much when he's around.
WIL0000969	Now that we're best friends do we have some things to talk about?
WIL0000970	Yes, absolutely!
WIL0000971	Now that we're best friends are you willing to change your clothes?
WIL0000972	Okay, I don't know what all this fuss is about, but yes, if you're tired of seeing me in this outfit, I'm willing to change it. Happy?
WIL0000973	Willow, would you consider changing your clothes?
WIL0000974	Change my clothes? Do you know I killed the geckos that were used to make my jacket? I think that makes it pretty special.
WIL0000975	Willow, now that we're friends, are you willing to change your clothes?
WIL0000976	What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
WIL0000977	You've mentioned that you have a collection. What do you collect?
WIL0000978	When I scavenge for stuff to sell I look for special little things that I might like to keep.  I have a collection of those things.
WIL0000979	I haven't shown them to you because, well, a girl likes to have some privacy, and besides, not everyone I've traveled with has understood.
WIL0000980	Sure, I don't mind.
WIL0000981	I have a boxing magazine. Do you want to read it?
WIL0000982	Yes, I do.  Thank you.
WIL0000983	Willow, are you coming on to me?
WIL0000984	Yeah, I..yeah, I guess I am.
WIL0000985	That's for me, isn't it?
WIL0000986	I have another present for you. I found it.
WIL0000987	I'd love to hear how much you liked it, or didn't, so come back and tell me, okay?
WIL0000988	Do you want to know how I liked my present?
WIL0000989	Yes, I do. Tell me.
WIL0000990	Are we going to celebrate? Do I get a present or something special from you?
WIL0000991	Yes, you do. So the first present is I made you a sweetroll to celebrate. But I'd also like to do something for you from now on as your friend.
WIL0000992	I can cook you for, you know?  Anything you want. You'll need to bring the ingredients, but I'll do the rest.  What do you think?
WIL0000993	<kiss> I'm glad you found me that day.
WIL0000994	Willow, I have a present for you.
WIL0000995	You do? A present? I love presents!
WIL0000996	A present? What is it?
WIL0000997	I have a special present for you.  I think you're going to really love this!
WIL0000998	Here you go, it's a Sunset Sarsaparilla mug.  Do you like it?
WIL0000999	Thank you so much.  It's so special. I love it!
WIL0001000	Here you go, it's a Magic 8-Ball. I think it will answer questions.
WIL0001001	Thank you so much. It's so special. I love it.
WIL0001002	Here, they're colored pencils.  I thought you might like them to use in your journal.
WIL0001003	They're amazing!  Thank you so much!
WIL0001004	Here, it's a little toy horse.  When I saw it, I thought of you.  I hope you like it.
WIL0001005	Ah! That's amazing!  Thank you so much!
WIL0001006	This is for you. It's a lacey teddy bear.
WIL0001007	Look!  It's a tiny teddy bear!
WIL0001008	Here you go, it's a red toaster.  Do you like it?
WIL0001009	Here, it's a bottle of perfume.  I hope you like it.
WIL0001010	Look!  It's a giant panda bear!
WIL0001011	Here you go, it's the Sunset Sarsaparilla garden gnome. I want you to have it.
WIL0001012	You have a new recipe for me?
WIL0001013	Thanks to you taking me shopping so much I've been able to do some experimenting and I've created a new recipe!
WIL0001014	I've only used one new ingredient though, because we have to keep track of so many already.  It's Ant Stew!
WIL0001015	I know, it sounds kind of boring, but this is the first time I've tried to make something up on my own. I think it came out pretty good.
WIL0001016	Yes!  This one's more complex. I call it Willow's Mantis Casserole. The only new ingredient it uses is Mantis Leg.
WIL0001017	The Mantis meat gives it a very rich flavor.  It's tasty.  I think you're going to like it a lot.
WIL0001018	You have another new recipe for me?  How many are you planning to create?
WIL0001019	I think this will be last one, but I've had a lot of fun making up the new recipes for us.
WIL0001020	Although, the new ingredient I'm adding isn't so fun to gather, but it tastes so great it's going to be worth it.  It requires Cazador eggs.
WIL0001021	I know, I know, but they taste so good.  I'm calling it Willow's Cazador Egg Puff.
WIL0001022	What is going on with you and Red Lucy?
WIL0001023	It seems like almost every time we go in there you say something snide about her.
WIL0001024	She's interested in you, I know it!  And I don't like her...at all!
WIL0001025	You're jealous!
WIL0001026	Of course I am!
WIL0001027	No, I'm not.  But I don't like her and I'm concerned for you.  She's a bitch !
WIL0001028	Don't worry about it, Willow. I can handle Red Lucy.
WIL0001029	Are you sure?  I don't trust her.
WIL0001030	Alright, I'll try to behave.  It'll be hard, though.  I really don't like her.
WIL0001031	Ugh.  I hate him.
WIL0001032	I don't think he likes me.
WIL0001033	You've got my back, right, if he tries anything?
WIL0001034	Hmpf.
WIL0001035	Hi, how are you today?
WIL0001036	Hi,how ya doin?
WIL0001037	Hi! How are you today?
WIL0001038	Hi, Major Knight!  How ya doin?
WIL0001039	Hi, Major, good to see ya.
WIL0001040	Hey, big fella, how ya doin?
WIL0001041	Hi, how ya doin?
WIL0001042	I know!  I've seen them!
WIL0001043	Thanks, I'll be careful.
WIL0001044	Hi, NoBark, how ya doin?
WIL0001045	Why don't you relax here for awhile.  I'll be back for you later.
WIL0001046	Alright, I'll just wander around here and find something to do.
WIL0001047	I'm ready.  Let's go.
WIL0001048	Hi! I need to buy a few things. Here's my list.  If you could give me three or four things off of it that would be great.
WIL0001049	Hi! How ya doin' today? Here's my list. What have you got for me?
WIL0001050	Did you say something about trading?
WIL0001051	I'd like to do some trading. Do you think we could do that?
WIL0001052	I want to talk to you about your singing.
WIL0001053	Oh, do you have a request?
WIL0001054	Oh, you hate it don't you?  I know, I'm a terrible singer. I do it to pass the time.  It keeps me occupied. It's fun.
WIL0001055	I would like you to stop singing for awhile.
WIL0001056	Okay, I can do that.
WIL0001057	I'd like you to start singing again.
WIL0001058	Great!  I'd love to!
WIL0001059	You've been unusually quiet.  Everything okay?
WIL0001060	Oh, I don't know, I just haven't felt much like singing lately, that's all.
WIL0001061	Can you sing more often?
WIL0001062	I'd like you to sing less often.
WIL0001063	Sure!  I'd love to!
WIL0001064	I found a book about boxing. Do you want to read it?
WIL0001065	<Yawn> I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
WIL0001066	Come on, sleepyhead, let's go.
WIL0001067	<yawn>  I'm coming.
WIL0001068	Go back to sleep. Sorry I woke you up.
WIL0001069	<yawn> No problem.  See you in the morning.
WIL0001070	This is the last one!  I've been trying to decide how to thank you for taking me to all the traders.
WIL0001071	I think it would be great if you could have a hat like mine.  You know, it brings me good luck with traders.
WIL0001072	I never have to bargain very hard to get great deals, it's really no work at all. It's my hat.
WIL0001073	We're here!  I'm so excited. This is the first time I've been to a trader since I was at the Mojave Outpost.
WIL0001074	You know, I keep magazines with me wherever I go. I have ones about trading or negotiating. You might find the ones about trading helpful.
WIL0001075	I don't read them much.  I mostly study the negotiating ones.  Here, you can have one of the trading ones.
WIL0001076	I should probably just sell the trading ones I have, since I don't read them, but I keep thinking I will and then I don't. Ya, know?
WIL0001077	I've been thinking I'd like to create a couple of new recipes based on critters from here in the Mojave. Good idea, huh?
WIL0001078	I'll want to keep cooking if I'm going to be creating new recipes, so that would mean regular shopping trips. That'd be up to you.
WIL0001079	Look!  It's where you first found me! It looks so boring for such a special place.
WIL0001080	Oh, there's our tent! We should camp there some night.  I'll cook us dinner.  It'd be fun.
WIL0001081	I hope your hungry.  I've made us something to eat and I've set the table.
WIL0001082	*nervous humming*
WIL0001083	It's so depressing here.
WIL0001084	I'll keep my hands to myself while we're here.  Even if there was anything good to pick up, I couldn't do it.  They need everything they've got.
WIL0001085	I'm glad we're helping out around here.  This is one of the saddest places I've been.  The NCR has really let these guys down.
WIL0001086	I can't believe anyone would be so low that they'd steal medical supplies from the other troops here.
WIL0001087	This place is horrible.  How can the NCR treat its troop like this?
WIL0001088	Legion and their slaves...this place gives me the creeps.  They have slave pens here.  Cages...for people!  Ugh!
WIL0001089	Hmm....Deathclaws.
WIL0001090	It's okay, you can do this.
WIL0001091	Maybe we could go to the Wrangler sometime.
WIL0001092	I bet Rex would like to go see The King while we're here.
WIL0001093	Sounds like I'm not the only one who's happy you took care of Caesar.
WIL0001094	*hums*
WIL0001095	*sings with no words*
WIL0001096	You loved me so, but let me go. Now I'll never know how our love will grow.
WIL0001097	Like a fella once said, ain't that a kick in the head.
WIL0001098	Ick, rats!
WIL0001099	We're so close, can we go to The Strip?
WIL0001100	I like The King.  Maybe he should run things in The Mojave.
WIL0001101	Is it just me, or does it seem like we're always getting into situations like this?
WIL0001102	This is a nice little town, but you know what it needs?  A motel.  Everything's better with a motel.
WIL0001103	Wanna go by the Saloon for a drink?  I bet Sunny'd like to go.
WIL0001104	I'm so blue without you, thought our love was true, then you found someone new.
WIL0001105	Waiting, watching the stars above. Hoping that I could win back your love.
WIL0001106	You don't seem to mind coming back here at all.  But if I'd been shot, and buried, and left for dead somewhere I don't think I'd go back.
WIL0001107	Are you going to show me where you were buried? Oh, sorry I could have said that better. I'm just really curious.
WIL0001108	I'd like to go see Chet and do some shopping while we're here.
WIL0001109	If we're gonna go see Chet, I'm gonna need to borrow some caps.
WIL0001110	Want to take me out for a drink or a bite to eat in the Saloon?  What do you say?
WIL0001111	That dam holds a lot of water.  More than I've ever seen in one place at one time.
WIL0001112	This place is gorgeous.
WIL0001113	It's, uh, too bad the Suite doesn't look like this, huh?
WIL0001114	Looks like the legion might actually be able to win, doesn't it?
WIL0001115	*Hmm.
WIL0001116	This is...impressive.
WIL0001117	Do you think we'll run into anyone you know while we're here?
WIL0001118	Do you get homesick when you go into an NCR held location?  I sure do.
WIL0001119	I know I shouldn't scavenge here, but I'm not promising anything.  If I see something good I might have to sneak it out with me.
WIL0001120	I was so glad to see the NCR troopers when I first got here.  I felt right at home.
WIL0001121	I was trying to figure out how they built those two giant statues. I can't even imagine how they did it.
WIL0001122	The view up here?  It's gorgeous!
WIL0001123	NCR as far as the eye can see. You know, I feel right at home here.
WIL0001124	I'm glad we're helping out around here.
WIL0001125	Hey, you gonna be okay?
WIL0001126	I'm a walk walkin' and I'm walkin' some more, I'm walk walkin' and I'm walkin' some more cuz this place is enormous.
WIL0001127	How much are we going to have to do for them? To get them to trust us I mean.  Pfft.  Probably a lot.
WIL0001128	This place is pretty special.  It deserves a special name. I'm gonna call it Boomtown from now on.
WIL0001129	Exploding ants!  We can't miss that!
WIL0001130	The mural they have about their history, it's pretty, but I think I'll pass on the story next time.  It's hot in those little huts.
WIL0001131	Raising an airplane off the bottom of a lake seems like a big job! Why are we the ones that always end up doing this stuff?
WIL0001132	Is there any way to save the troopers? I felt terrible when we couldn't help the people in Nipton.
WIL0001133	Is there any way to save the troopers?
WIL0001134	I don't like the legion sitting here in Nelson.  It's too close to Novac.
WIL0001135	With the legion out of here, Novac should be safer, right?
WIL0001136	Boone, I agree with you.  I want to save them too.
WIL0001137	I've only ever heard about what the legion does to towns. This is horrifying.
WIL0001138	You know, guys.  I've only ever heard about what the legion does to towns. This is horrifying.
WIL0001139	We should go tell Ghost at the Mojave Outpost about this.
WIL0001140	You know, I don't think I'll ever forget this place.
WIL0001141	I'm so glad we fixed up the bungalow.  I love that pink bird we found.
WIL0001142	I'm worried about those legion guys out in Nelson.  What if they attack Novac?  It'll be awful!
WIL0001143	Maybe Boone could come with us when you're done helping him. He's so depressed.  It'd probably be good for him to get away from here.
WIL0001144	Can we go up in Dinky sometime just to look at the view?
WIL0001145	I wonder if No-bark's around today. He's always fun to talk to.
WIL0001146	I like it here.  Maybe it's because I grew up in a motel.
WIL0001147	So, our motel sign it had a couple of pine trees on it.  We didn't have anything as interesting as a big dinky.
WIL0001148	Maybe after I've seen the Mojave I'll come back here to live for awhile. Wouldn't it be fun to stay in one of the little bungalows at the motel?
WIL0001149	I love it here.  I know, I know.  It's dumpy and little.  But it's so cozy and homey.  Plus it's got a giant dinosaur. It's hard to top that.
WIL0001150	I wanna have some fun! Wanna go Brahmin tipping? You'll have to do the tipping though, I can never get the Brahmin to fall over.
WIL0001151	Thank you so much for helping to get the legion out of Nelson.  I'm sure all of Novac is grateful.
WIL0001152	So now that the NCR is occupying Nelson, Novac should be safe, right?
WIL0001153	Why don't you do right, like some other men do.  Get out of here, give me some money too.
WIL0001154	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed him and he kissed me.
WIL0001155	How lucky can one girl be?  I kissed her and she kissed me.
WIL0001156	What's not to like about a place that has a giant statue to greet people when they come into town?
WIL0001157	Radiation!  Great.
WIL0001158	Uh, getting a little worried here. Am I starting to glow?
WIL0001159	So, you know, I always wondered what it would feel like to be a ghoul...Um, I think we might find out soon.
WIL0001160	You doing okay?  Radiation!  What a pain in the butt.
WIL0001161	It's gorgeous here!  This may be the most beautiful place I've seen. In all my time on the road.
WIL0001162	These guys look tough...really tough.
WIL0001163	Just so you know, I plan to scavenge while we're here so don't give me away if you see me go for something.  Okay?
WIL0001164	I'm not taking anything out of here...these guys and their crosses?  I'm not messing with them.
WIL0001165	I can't be the only one wondering if we're going to come out of this okay.  We could end up dead.  Or worse.
WIL0001166	Huh.  Well, if this camp is any indication, Caesar's the monster I've always heard he is.  Look at this place.
WIL0001167	Wow!  Look at those legs! Ugh! But he's just a slaving s- I can't wait to get out of here.
WIL0001168	Be nice to get back out on the road again.
WIL0001169	You know, if I ever build a fort, the first thing I'm going to put up is some crucified bodies.  They're just so...welcoming.
WIL0001170	Those poor girls.
WIL0001171	Can't say I like how they treat their women around here.
WIL0001172	Everyone's talking about you, did you notice?  Well, maybe they don't know it was you that did it, but they're talking about Mr. House.
WIL0001173	I can't believe you stuck one of us in that freezer.  That was heartless.  I hope I don't have to worry about what you'll do to me.
WIL0001174	Hey, want to go get a drink?  I'm thirsty and Cass can always use more whiskey.
WIL0001175	Hey, did you hear that?  Somebody's talking about Caesar being dead.  You're a hero, just like I told you!
WIL0001176	What do you say, Boone?  Let's have some fun while we're here.
WIL0001177	Come on, let's have some fun.  What do you say?  Let's go jump in the fountain.
WIL0001178	You know, New Vegas is why I came to the Mojave, I've been hearing stories about it for years.
WIL0001179	We're going to go to a casino, aren't we?
WIL0001180	The lights are gorgeous.
WIL0001181	This place looks exactly like I imagined it would: drunks, lights, hookers.  It's perfect.
WIL0001182	If Veronica gets a dress I want one too.  Or maybe new shoes or a new hat.  I don't know, something pretty.  Please?
WIL0001183	Interested in taking me out for a drink in one the casinos?  That might be fun.
WIL0001184	I can't understand a thing Mean Sonofabitch says.
WIL0001185	Blue moon you saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.
WIL0001186	Have you noticed that no one's talking about you killing all those fiends?  Isn't that weird?  Should we tell someone about it?
WIL0001187	They're farmers!  Maybe we could get some fresh vegetables from them.
WIL0001188	Can we go shopping sometime soon?
WIL0001189	If we're going shopping, I'm gonna need some caps.
WIL0001190	They sure are worried about the Fiends around here.
WIL0001191	Hi, I'm Willow. It looks like we're going to be spending a lot of time together.  I hope we can be friends.
WIL0001192	I was very sorry to hear about your wife, Boone.  If you ever feel like talking to someone or ever need anything I'd love to help.
WIL0001193	Boone, I was born and raised in the NCR; in Klamath.  I'm guessing you're going to keep quiet and not tell me anything about yourself. Right?
WIL0001194	You're awful good, Boone. I can see why they wanted you in the 1st Recon. Maybe if we get a chance sometime you could give me some tips?
WIL0001195	Boone, you still look lost.  If I can help at all, just say the word.
WIL0001196	No, there's nothing bad waiting for you.  No punishment.  You're a good man.  You deserve peace of mind and a good life.  That's what you deserve.
WIL0001197	Okay, Boone, you are just too quiet.  If I confess to you that I hate Caesar and his legion will you talk to me?  Because it's true. I do hate him.
WIL0001198	I bet you miss your Dinky...oh, oops.
WIL0001199	If you could do anything at all right now what would it be?  I'd take a shower.  Doesn't that sound good?
WIL0001200	Do you think you'll ever marry again, Boone?  Maybe have kids?  You'd make a great father.
WIL0001201	Are you thirsty?  I have an extra Nuka Cola if you want it.
WIL0001202	I'm glad you're with us Boone.  I feel so safe with you here.
WIL0001203	Hi, I'm Willow.  It looks like we'll be spending a lot of time together.
WIL0001204	Because it's true.  We should do something about it.  Get you something that feels and looks good.  Right?
WIL0001205	Heck no, Veronica! Punch everything that gets in our way.
WIL0001206	Feeling guilty?  Did you punch one of us by mistake?
WIL0001207	No Veronica, I like you just the way your are.
WIL0001208	Nope, not today.
WIL0001209	Klamath.  In Oregon.
WIL0001210	Klamath.  I traveled through California to get here.  It took me about two years.  I stopped a lot along the way.
WIL0001211	Oh, me too!
WIL0001212	Ooh, and maybe some pretty shoes to go with it!  And maybe a great hat.
WIL0001213	And somewhere to go in the dress!  That'd be so great!
WIL0001214	Yes, and not too fussy either.
WIL0001215	Veronica, you have  been underground too long.
WIL0001216	Veronica, I'm sorry, I can't laugh with you about the legion. I don't find them very funny.  Okay, maybe those skirts are funny.
WIL0001217	After seeing Nipton there is no way I will ever think of the legion as silly.
WIL0001218	Hmm.  Nope, can't think of anything interesting.  Oh, wait, Cass has been drinking again.
WIL0001219	You know Red Lucy at the Thorn, right?  Ugh, I can't stand her, but don't tell, okay?
WIL0001220	You know Red Lucy at the Thorn, right? She's so sexy. I'm really worried about it, but don't tell, okay?
WIL0001221	Mr. House is a computer! Well, okay, maybe not, but when you talk to him he's just a picture on a screen. There's no way to tell if he's real or not.
WIL0001222	Turns out Mr. House was just this helpless old guy crammed inside a box. We found him tucked away inside the Lucky 38. It was kind of sad.
WIL0001223	Me and the Courier.  We finally...you know. I'm so in love.
WIL0001224	Hmm.  Nope, can't think of anything interesting.
WIL0001225	I really like Boone, but he's still so sad about his wife.  I don't think he'll ever notice me.  Don't say anything to him, though, okay?
WIL0001226	Raul seems kinda depressed. I wish we could do something for him.  I think he needs a woman, but maybe he'd take some Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
WIL0001227	I grew up with a big family too.  I have five brothers.  We lived above ground though.
WIL0001228	Because it's true?
WIL0001229	I'd like you to carry this for me. Please don't use it.
WIL0001230	Fine.  I won't touch it. I promise.
WIL0001231	Can I see your collection again?
WIL0001232	Can I see what you've scavenged lately?
WIL0001233	Remember you promised to travel with me whether we found Beauty or not?
WIL0001234	I am traveling with you.
WIL0001235	I want to talk to you, again, about traveling with me, properly, without Beauty.
WIL0001236	I thought we covered this?  I am traveling with you.  What more is there to say.
WIL0001237	You still don't have Beauty and nothing's changed between us. We need to solve this.
WIL0001238	Fine. Let's solve it.
WIL0001239	You should ask Veronica to train you. She loves punching things. I'm sure she could teach you a lot.
WIL0001240	I'm going to go ask her about it right now.
WIL0001241	When I draw my weapon, draw yours, okay?
WIL0001242	You can stop taking your weapon out when I do.
WIL0001243	He's still alive!  Can we help him?
WIL0001244	I think the NCR might be upset about a dead ambassador.
WIL0001245	Oh!  I bet this is where they test the eye lasers.
WIL0001246	That has got to be a wig!
WIL0001247	We made it!
WIL0001248	Heads?  You're going after heads? Actual human heads.  I hope that's something you're planning to carry yourself.
WIL0001249	Well, that settles that.  Mr. House is definitely not a computer.
WIL0001250	Um, the...the crosses.  Should we help those people?
WIL0001251	Oh!  Do you see that giant, uh, gecko, whatever that is, over there?  Can we go see that? I bet you can go inside.
WIL0001252	Oh, I like it here!  It reminds me of my family's motel back home.  Maybe we could stay in one of the bungalows?
WIL0001253	You know there are girls here, right?  Ones you can pay for sex.  You wouldn't do that would you?
WIL0001254	Pfft. And people think the NCR is difficult!
WIL0001255	Are you planning to sleep with her?
WIL0001256	Yes. I know you don't like her, but what if I wanted to? Would you have a problem with that?
WIL0001257	Yes.  I mean no. I mean...we're just friends, but I definitely don't want to watch you having sex with her. I'm going home. I'll see you there, okay?
WIL0001258	Yes. I know you don't like her, but I want to do this. Are you going to have a problem with that?
WIL0001259	Yes, I'd have a problem with that!  What are you gonna do?
WIL0001260	I wonder what's next.  This place is crazy.  So far we've seen a ghoul in a wig, a human who's convinced he's a ghoul and now, demons!
WIL0001261	I thought the other guy was the crazy one, but demons?  He can't be serious.
WIL0001262	Okay, this one is definitely the craziest.  Too bad he and Antler can't come with us. They'd be interesting travel companions.
WIL0001263	I like him, and Antler too.  They're crazy, but it's too bad they can't come with us, huh?
WIL0001264	I'm sure that's not true, but, maybe you'll feel more like talking if we meet again.
WIL0001265	I sure hope we can do something to help Rex.
WIL0001266	I want a rocket souvenir too! For my collection!
WIL0001267	Sarah wants to have sex with you!
WIL0001268	Here, this might help when you go in with him. It's up to you, but I find talking is sometimes better than whacking.
WIL0001269	Sloan? Ah! This is where the Deathclaws are! We should leave. Now!
WIL0001270	That was nice of you.
WIL0001271	Okay, I got the pink bird for you.
WIL0001272	Thank you, Willow.
WIL0001273	You're welcome.  I hope you like it.
WIL0001274	Two months?  That long, huh?
WIL0001275	Willow Bedroll
WIL0001276	Willow's Side
WIL0001277	Eyelashes
WIL0001278	Unique Shorty 9mm Silencer
WIL0001279	We've been together for two months now! I got you a present to celebrate.  It's in the kitchen on the counter.
WIL0001280	I want you to know. I love you very much. More every day.
WIL0001281	A month?  That long, huh?
WIL0001282	Well, it's been a month since we sealed our friendship!  And I have a present for you to celebrate!  I hope you like it!
WIL0001283	Yes!  We've been together for a month now and I have a present for you to celebrate!
WIL0001284	It's kind of corny and romantic.
WIL0001285	Hopefully you'll like it enough to wear it because I want you to think of me every time you do and remember this:
WIL0001286	You hold the key to my heart and I love you very much.
WIL0001287	I'd like to hear more about where you grew up, Willow.
WIL0001288	The trees around Jacobstown remind me of home. You already know about the caravans, but hunting's a big thing in Klamath too.
WIL0001289	You have some strong opinions about the Legion considering you just got here. Want to tell me why?
WIL0001290	You want the short answer to that or the story-of-my-life answer?
WIL0001291	Is there something going on between you and Boone?
WIL0001292	Well, I do like him a lot.  He's brave and handsome. I feel so sorry for him.  He's so tortured. I just wish I could help him.
WIL0001293	No, not at all. I'm just being nice to him because he's so sad and tortured.  Poor guy.
WIL0001294	The bungalow?  What about it?
WIL0001295	I love it, don't get me wrong, but it could use some improvements, don't you think?
WIL0001296	We could go collect some plants and transplant them into the planters.  Maybe go find a mailbox and put it by the door?
WIL0001297	Ooh, and maybe we could keep our eyes open for something special to put outside.  Are you interested?
WIL0001298	No, I'm not really interested in putting any time into the bungalow.
WIL0001299	Look at the cave fungus! It looks great, doesn't it?
WIL0001300	I've got the Banana Yucca plants.  Where to now?
WIL0001301	The next place on my list is Silver Peak Mine.  It's up the road a ways.  We should find Xander Root plants there.
WIL0001302	Got the Xander Root Plants.  What's next?
WIL0001303	I've been thinking I'd like to have some Cave Fungus inside the bungalow where it'd be all glowy. The pamphlet says there's some in Charleston Cave.
WIL0001304	I've got the Cave Fungus.  Where are we headed to now?
WIL0001305	We're going after Broc Flower plants. It's quite a long way; south of a trainyard according to the pamphlet.
WIL0001306	Too bad we can't grow our own pinyon nuts, huh? That'd make life easier.
WIL0001307	Are we going to be carrying much else?  Those broc flower plants are big.
WIL0001308	Well, that's it for plants.  The last thing I want is a mailbox.  You never know, if we have one, maybe we'll get some mail!
WIL0001309	I know that probably sounds really silly.
WIL0001310	But when I was little me and my friends would leave each other notes and presents in our mailboxes.  I can't imagine having a house without one.
WIL0001311	Look at the pink bird! We have to take that, don't you think?  It would look great next to the planters!
WIL0001312	I think that's it!  I'm not sure we could carry much more than this.
WIL0001313	Wanna go back to the bungalow now?  We can get everything set up.
WIL0001314	Yes, let's do it.  The bungalow could use some work.
WIL0001315	Do you want to talk about Caesar?
WIL0001316	Yeah. I want to know what you think about him.
WIL0001317	Here...take this. I can't say it outloud. You're..you'll have to read it.
WIL0001318	We're almost to the end aren't we?  I mean to the battle at The Dam.  I want to talk to you before we go.
WIL0001319	The legion wants to see you?  That's serious business. We need to be careful.
WIL0001320	Do you want to talk about Mr. House?
WIL0001321	Yeah, what did you think? I don't like him. How do we even know he's human?
WIL0001322	You wanted to talk after we left The Fort.  What is it?
WIL0001323	I need to know how committed you are to Caesar.
WIL0001324	We need to talk before you do anything to Caesar, but we can't talk here. Please talk to me before you do anything.
WIL0001325	Lucky you!  I've never found a robot in a closet who offered to help me take over the world!
WIL0001326	The Ambassador, huh.  Think maybe we should go talk to him?
WIL0001327	I have a special present for you.
WIL0001328	You do?  A present! I love presents!
WIL0001329	Did you say something about Star Bottle Caps?
WIL0001330	Yeah, Star Bottle Caps.  Do you believe in the treasure? I do and I think it's out there waiting for someone to find it.
WIL0001331	Is this it?  Do you think this is the treasure? Disappointing, right? Don't get me wrong, the gnome's cute, but its not what I'd hoped we'd find.
WIL0001332	But, you know, the trip doesn't have to be a total waste.
WIL0001333	If you pick up a couple of those badges and bring me some duct tape I'll turn them into something we can wear.
WIL0001334	You can do that?
WIL0001335	Sure, I stuck the flower on my hat and it's stayed there for months. So, if you're interested bring me two badges and a roll of duct tape.
WIL0001336	Here are the badges and duct tape.  Can you make us badges now?
WIL0001337	Sure! This is so easy to do I can do it right now.
WIL0001338	It'll just take me a second, so hold on.
WIL0001339	Here you go, the new badges are done!
WIL0001340	Great!  I'd love to have a Nuka Cola.
WIL0001341	Great idea.
WIL0001342	Great!  I could use a drink, but I don't want Nuka Cola, I want...whiskey!
WIL0001343	I'll have my usual...whiskey.
WIL0001344	No, we don't have time right now.
WIL0001345	Okay, maybe next time.
WIL0001346	No, I didn't get one.
WIL0001347	Here's a Nuka-Cola for you.
WIL0001348	Here's a Whiskey for you.
WIL0001349	Wait!  I have a question.  Are you planning to kill those officers for that Legion guy?
WIL0001350	Yeah, let's go.
WIL0001351	I'm ready. Let's go.
WIL0001352	I'm done.  Do you have anything to talk about?
WIL0001353	No. I'm good. Thanks.
WIL0001354	Alright. See ya later.
WIL0001355	I found Beauty and you helped me so much! Thank you.
WIL0001356	You're welcome, Willow.
WIL0001357	I promised I would travel with you if we found Beauty. So, should we talk about this?  Iron out some details?
WIL0001358	Yes, let's go.
WIL0001359	No.  I'm not coming back with you.  You sent me away and said you didn't want to be with me any more.
WIL0001360	So, if you want me back you're going to have to do something to prove to me you want me back.
WIL0001361	Forget it. I don't want you back that much.
WIL0001362	Yeah, I figured as much.
WIL0001363	Okay, tell me what you want me to do and we'll see.
WIL0001364	I want enough supplies to make enough coffee to last me for a month.  Here.  I'd already written up the list in case you showed up.
WIL0001365	So, will you do it?
WIL0001366	I've found Beauty.
WIL0001367	I have Chester.
WIL0001368	Thank you for helping me.  It means the world to me that you took the time to do this.
WIL0001369	I have Moira.
WIL0001370	I'm thrilled to have Moira back, but I'd still like to find Chester.
WIL0001371	Hey! Give her back! I can't believe you took Moira from me!
WIL0001372	Did you find Moira or Chester?
WIL0001373	I forgot to ask.  What's your name?
WIL0001374	My name's [%]
WIL0001375	Thanks, again, for your help.
WIL0001376	Are you still interested in me giving you some hand-to-hand combat training?
WIL0001377	Yes! Can we do it now?
WIL0001378	Sorry, we'll have to do it later.
WIL0001379	Oh, alright. But don't forget.
WIL0001380	Let's do that training now.  Are you ready?
WIL0001381	Yes! Absolutely!
WIL0001382	Okay, sure, we can do it now.
WIL0001383	You're angry.  I'm sorry.  Can we start over?
WIL0001384	Yeah, I am angry. You were an ass.  But since you've apologized and you seem sincere enough, sure we can start over.
WIL0001385	So, here's the deal.  I found this.  I've lost a bunch of stuff, including my favorite rifle and I want to chase down these guys and get it back.
WIL0001386	I need ammo, if you have it, for the pistol I'm carrying and backup if you're interested. So, what do you say? Oh, and my name's Willow, by the way.
WIL0001387	I'll do it...if you sleep with me. <huge laugh> I'm just kidding. Let's go get your stuff back.
WIL0001388	Seriously?  And you don't want anything in return from me?
WIL0001389	I need to see that pistol of yours. I don't know if I have ammo for it or not.
WIL0001390	Oh, sure, of course.
WIL0001391	Great!  Listen! I want to tell you exactly what I lost so you'll know what to look for, okay?
WIL0001392	You know about my rifle, Beauty.  That's what I call her. And there are two other things. Chester, a teddy bear I've had forever, and Moira, a doll.
WIL0001393	I hope we find the toys. I'm embarrassed to admit this and know it sounds stupid, but I do love them.
WIL0001394	I'm sleepy.  Are we going to stay out all night?
WIL0001395	Yawn,  I sure could go for some coffee.
WIL0001396	Oof.  It's hot.
WIL0001397	*yawns*
WIL0001398	My mom, Coleen, makes the best coffee I've ever tasted. Everybody loves it, not just me. I try to make it, but it's never as good as hers.
WIL0001399	Hold up.  I'm thirsty and want a drink. I can't keep up the pace and drink at the same time.  I'll fall flat on my face.
WIL0001400	I'm getting soaked back here! Were you thinking maybe we'd take a break inside, somewhere? Sometime? While it's raining, maybe?
WIL0001401	Have I ever told you about the time my dog, Big George, cornered a baby molerat and its mom got so mad she nearly killed us both?  I sure miss him.
WIL0001402	I'm famished.  Do you think we could stop for a campfire and a proper meal?
WIL0001403	It's so cool up here. It's a nice break from the heat.
WIL0001404	I love to collect things. You should see my room back home. It's so stuffed with junk I can't get to my bed. My mom is always complaining about it.
WIL0001405	I told you about the motel my parents own, right? My mom does most of the cooking for the guests. She's the one that taught me how to cook.
WIL0001406	You know I want to learn to box, right? Well, I have 4 older brothers who used to beat me up as a kid. I'd love to pay them back when I get home.
WIL0001407	Do you eat Pre-War food? I don't trust most of it, but I can't resist Fancy Lad Snack cakes, or gumdrops, or Junk Food, ooh but Salisbury Steak? Ugh.
WIL0001408	One time, when I was out exploring with one of my brothers, we found some Pre-war dog toys. A couple of them still squeaked.
WIL0001409	I only have brothers. Five brothers.  Four older ones and a baby brother who's five years younger than me. I always wanted a sister.
WIL0001410	I'm sneaking up behind a gecko, right? And I'm about to break cover when suddenly a Deathclaw runs up and grabs it. I swear I peed my pants.
WIL0001411	I wonder if those ants at Boomtown really explode.  If it's true, that'd be worth seeing, don't you think?
WIL0001412	I can't believe we're getting ears for that guy at Camp Forlorn Hope. It's disgusting.  I don't want to carry 'em, you know.
WIL0001413	Hold up.  I'm thirsty and want a drink.  You look like you could use one too.
WIL0001414	Ears for the guy at Camp Forlorn Hope. Heads for the guy at McCarran.  The NCR is more bloodthirsty that I thought!
WIL0001415	Maybe after I've seen the Mojave I'll go back to Novac to live. Wouldn't it be fun to stay in one of those little bungalows at the motel?
WIL0001416	You know, sometimes I really miss Boone.
WIL0001417	Hey, if we run into any geckos I could use some meat. For cooking.
WIL0001418	My oldest brother, Val, is a doctor.  He tried to teach me some doctoring, but I just couldn't get the hang of it.  He says I'm all thumbs.
WIL0001419	So, one day this lady runs into Val's clinic yelling her head off that her baby's sick. Val unwraps the blanket and inside he finds a baby Molerat!
WIL0001420	My brothers, Sam and Dean, once hunted down a giant Gecko that was terrorizing the Grazing Grounds in Klamath.  They got a big reward for it.
WIL0001421	Chuck told me that he once kicked a guy so hard in the head that his helmet flew up in to the top of a 50 foot tree and got stuck there.
WIL0001422	Someday when I have kids I want to have five or six.  I love my big family.  There's always so much going on. It's never boring.
WIL0001423	When my friend Bethie and I were little we used to go visit this old lady named, Madame Zelda.  She lived with nine molerats!
WIL0001424	Madame Zelda made potions and she would read our palms and tell our fortunes.  Her predictions came true a lot!
WIL0001425	Madame Zelda once told me that I'd travel to New Vegas and meet the love of my life there.  Interesting, huh?
WIL0001426	Did I tell you that Brian played the guitar? Because Madame Zelda once told us that Bethie would marry a guitar player.
WIL0001427	It's quiet in the Mojave.You know, some places you go it's noisy; there's more birds, plants, animals and they all make noise. I like the peace here.
WIL0001428	Poor Kimball.  It's too bad the solution had to be so final.
WIL0001429	So, you're passing bad Intel to the NCR from the legion? Hmpf.
WIL0001430	Exploding ants aren't as much fun as I thought they'd be.
WIL0001431	Raising that plane off the bottom of the lake was one of the neatest things I've ever seen.  Whoosh!
WIL0001432	I'm sure Caesar is going to be very proud of you for killing Kimball.  I hope he rewards you well.  Better than when you saved his life.
WIL0001433	Have you noticed Lucy's voice?  It's so deep. I wonder if maybe she's really a boy dressed as a girl? That'd be a big surprise for someone, huh?
WIL0001434	How old do you think Lucy is?  Doesn't she seem old to you?  She seems old to me.
WIL0001435	Lucy's hair is a funny color. It doesn't look real to me. I wonder if she puts color on it somehow. I bet she has gray hair because she's so old.
WIL0001436	Deathclaw eggs!  She doesn't want much, does she?
WIL0001437	I will be so happy when we're done running these errands for Lucy.
WIL0001438	Have I told you about the time that...wait do you hear that?
WIL0001439	I'm starving.
WIL0001440	I'm hungry.  Oh, that's all I talk about, huh?   Food.  I guess I should talk about something else once in awhile.  But, I like food a lot.
WIL0001441	It's too bad the Fiends are such assholes.  I like those scary helmets they wear.  I'd love to wear one.
WIL0001442	I hate being stung by those stupid things. It ruins my whole day.
WIL0001443	A guy at the Mojave Outpost told me there's some horrible nest of Deathclaws near a place called Sloan.  We're not going there are we?
WIL0001444	I sure miss Big George sometimes. He was such a great dog.
WIL0001445	Did you hear that?  Huh. Maybe I imagined it.
WIL0001446	Do you smell that? Ugh, it's awful!
WIL0001447	Did you see that?  I have never seen two of anything doing that before.  Wow.
WIL0001448	Ow!  Dammit!
WIL0001449	Why don't you do right, like some other men do. Get out of here, give me some money too.
WIL0001450	I'm gonna have a Dog Biscuit, do you want one too?
WIL0001451	I'm going to eat the present you gave me.  Thanks again for being so sweet to me.
WIL0001452	Thanks again for my present. I'm snacking on it right now.
WIL0001453	I know you're carrying dogmeat on you. I sure hope you don't expect me to cook that for you.  Eww, or watch you eat it.
WIL0001454	I had fun with you and Red Lucy, but I still don't want you to pay too much attention to her, okay?
WIL0001455	Wow, Sarah is bad at sex!  She's as bad at sex as she is with giftshops.
WIL0001456	The Nightkin are amazing when they sneak, aren't they?
WIL0001457	It's the guys who took my stuff!
WIL0001458	Great! I'd like that. Things are a mess around here.
WIL0001459	No, Willow, I don't want to help the NCR troops.
WIL0001460	Okay, it's up to you.
WIL0001461	You wouldn't have a problem with that would you?  It's not like we're married.
WIL0001462	Fine. You're right, we're not married. Go ahead and keep sleeping with whoever you want, you should be happy.
WIL0001463	It's just, you know, I thought we had something special.
WIL0001464	I like my freedom, Willow. You should go on home,
WIL0001465	Fine.  I'm going home.
WIL0001466	Willow, I didn't realize it was so important to you.  I don't need anyone but you. Okay?
WIL0001467	No, I haven't decided that, you don't need to worry about it. Why do you ask?
WIL0001468	Well, I'm from the NCR!  I don't want to be shooting them and I don't want them to be shooting at me!
WIL0001469	And, oh my gosh, if family knew I was fighting against the NCR they would be so mad at me!
WIL0001470	Yeah, I am. Why?
WIL0001471	And, oh my gosh, if family knew I was fighting against the NCR they would be so mad at me! But at the same time, I've seen how things are here.
WIL0001472	And, the NCR probably doesn't belong here, and I trust you, but I don't really want to get tangled up in this war.
WIL0001473	...please just tell me everything's going to be okay and that I'm not a bad person.
WIL0001474	Willow, you need a drink!  Let's go get you one.
WIL0001475	Yes! A drink.  Let's do that.  Have I ever told you I like whiskey?
WIL0001476	Willow, everything is going to be okay and you aren't a bad person.
WIL0001477	Thank you.  I...I just needed to hear that.  You're so sweet.  My parents!  The thought of them is just haunting me.
WIL0001478	Willow, we all have to make hard choices sometimes, this is yours to make. I can't make it for you.
WIL0001479	Are you planning to keep working with the legion or are you done with them?
WIL0001480	You're a hero! I'm so proud of you!
WIL0001481	No, I'm just working with them for a while, why?
WIL0001482	Yes, why?
WIL0001483	Well, I'm not excited about getting involved in this war, and I wish we didn't have to do it.
WIL0001484	And I probably don't even need to say this, but  if we have to get involved I'd rather fight for the NCR.
WIL0001485	I'm done with them.
WIL0001486	I'm so proud of you.
WIL0001487	Um, I plan to keep working with them.
WIL0001488	No, why?
WIL0001489	Well, like I said, you don't need to worry about it.
WIL0001490	Okay, I trust you.
WIL0001491	(Lord Death Perk) You'd make an easy kill, that's why.  You should be wearing proper armor.
WIL0001492	(Cherchez La Femme) I'd hate to see any part of you injured.  You should have proper armor.
WIL0001493	(Lady Killer) Willow, every lovely part of your body is too precious to risk. You need proper armor.
WIL0001494	Yeah?  Ya, think?
WIL0001495	Yes, Willow?  You want to talk about Unarmed training?
WIL0001496	You know how you've been helping me learn to fight better with my fists?  Well, I think I'm good enough to do it for real now.
WIL0001497	And look what I've been saving to use someday.  So, I can fight now, any time with them.  Pretty exciting, huh?
WIL0001498	Oh, if you ever want to borrow Beauty from me, feel free, because I can use these.
WIL0001499	And, I've been thinking about it, you know, now that I'm trained to fight up close, I think I could handle a knife or a something like that.
WIL0001500	No offense, but you don't seem injured and you still have your gear. Is this some kind of scam?
WIL0001501	I used all my medical supplies on my leg.  That's why I'm moving around so well, but it's still sore.
WIL0001502	And it's impossible for me to prove I've been robbed. You'll just have to believe me.  I am telling the truth.
WIL0001503	Oh, wait.  I found this.  They dropped it.  The thieves dropped it.
WIL0001504	Maybe you should have stayed put. Sounds like things didn't work out like you planned.
WIL0001505	No. I didn't plan to lose my favorite rifle, run out of ammo and get injured.   I have never been this unlucky on the road before.
WIL0001506	I suppose you'd like me to help you fix your problem?  Give you a weapon and ammo or caps maybe?
WIL0001507	No, I don't need caps, but my pistol is currently useless to me. So, I do need ammo or a different weapon to go after them.
WIL0001508	Don't look at me. I have my own problems to handle. It was nice meeting you, but I'm leaving now.
WIL0001509	Wait!  I have a pistol, but no ammo and I'm still injured.
WIL0001510	Is there something I can do to help you out of this situation?
WIL0001511	Yes! Look at this. One of them dropped it. I think they'll be going to one of these places.  I want to start looking for them at the closest one.
WIL0001512	However, I have a problem.  I have a pistol, but no ammo.  That's gone too.
WIL0001513	Nothing.  I'm not going to do anything. You should trust me.
WIL0001514	I'm sorry honey, I'll try.  It's hard not to be jealous you're just so wonderful I think everyone wants you as much as I do.
WIL0001515	Hey, did you see a couple of guys on the road just now?  They robbed me!  Bastards.
WIL0001516	Are you thinking of chasing these guys down alone?
WIL0001517	I'd rather not do it alone, but I will.  I want my stuff back.
WIL0001518	I'm not going to GIVE you anything.  But maybe we could work out a deal if you want my help.
WIL0001519	I have no caps to pay you, so how about this? After we get my stuff back I'll travel with you for awhile.
WIL0001520	I'm a great shot. I started hunting with my Dad was I was a little kid. Plus, I'm a lot of fun to have around.
WIL0001521	Sorry.  I'm out of here.
WIL0001522	Please. I need to go after my stuff.  Maybe I could trade you something for your help.
WIL0001523	No, I didn't see anyone.  Are you alright?
WIL0001524	No, I'm not alright. They took my favorite rifle and some other stuff. I do have a pistol with me, but I've got no ammo for it and my leg is hurt.
WIL0001525	Have you been traveling for a long time?
WIL0001526	Nearly two years. Usually I talk my way out of any problems, but these guys jumped me from behind. I didn't get the chance.
WIL0001527	Maybe I can help you get your rifle back...for a price.
WIL0001528	I have no caps to pay you, so how about this? After we get my stuff back I travel with you for a while.
WIL0001529	You're in a really tough spot. What can I do to help you out of this?
WIL0001530	I want to go after the guys who took my stuff. They dropped this. Will you come with me?  Maybe give me some ammo or a different weapon?
WIL0001531	So you want me to supply you for this little adventure and come with you?
WIL0001532	I'd love it if you came with. As for ammo I'll say this: I'm crap with a knife and I'm only a little better with my fists. So, it's up to you.
WIL0001533	But I'm willing to earn what you give me.  I'll travel with you for awhile if you like.  I'm a great shot and I'm great company.  What do you say?
WIL0001534	Alright.  That sounds good.  Let's get the equipment all sorted out and then we can leave.
WIL0001535	Okay, and thank you so much. My name's Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you. But, please do hurry.  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL0001536	How about this?  You sleep with me and then I'll do whatever you need to get your stuff back?
WIL0001537	How about this?  No and goodbye.
WIL0001538	Okay.  Sleep with me and I'll help you.
WIL0001539	No. I'll go back to the Mojave Outpost and find someone there.  I wanted to do this right now and not waste all that time.  But, no and goodbye.
WIL0001540	If you agree to travel with me for awhile I'll help you out. I could use the company on the road.
WIL0001541	Travel with you?  Okay, after we get my rifle back, I agree to travel with you for awhile.
WIL0001542	You're telling me the truth aren't you? Okay, I'll help you. But I want something in return.
WIL0001543	I have no caps to pay you. So how about this?  After we get my stuff back I'll travel with you for awhile.
WIL0001544	You sound awfully confident.  What if we don't find your stuff?  How will you repay me?
WIL0001545	What if I agree to travel with you for awhile whether we find my rifle or not. I'm a great shot and I'm a lot of fun to have around.
WIL0001546	Okay, I'll agree to that.  Let's get organized and then we'll get going.
WIL0001547	Thank you so much.  My name's Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you.  And, can we hurry?  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL0001548	And here. You should see this. They dropped it. I'm guessing it's where they're headed. I want to start looking at the closest location.
WIL0001549	You need me to supply you in order to follow these guys?  Do you also want me to come with you?
WIL0001550	Yes!  I would be so grateful.  Maybe I could repay you some way.  I don't have caps, but would you be interested in some company on the road?
WIL0001551	I'd be willing to travel with you for awhile, take night watch, kill critters, stuff like that.  I'm fun to have around. What do you say?
WIL0001552	What if we don't find your stuff?  I want your word that you will travel with me either way.
WIL0001553	I don't want to think about that possiblity.  But, alright, yes, you have my word.  I'll travel with you either way.
WIL0001554	I want your word that you will travel with me whether we find your rifle or not.
WIL0001555	I don't even want to think about that possibility, but, yes, I agree to travel with you whether we find my rifle or not.
WIL0001556	No, I don't want anything from you. I feel really bad about what I said to you.
WIL0001557	Thank you.  That's very sweet of you. I appreciate it very much.  I'd love to leave as soon as possible.
WIL0001558	I won't lie.  I think you're very attractive.  But I don't want anything from you for this.
WIL0001559	Oh, thank you. Your not so bad yourself. Do you think we could leave as soon as possible?
WIL0001560	Okay, I'll do it. Let's get ready to go.
WIL0001561	I'm Willow, by the way.  It's nice to meet you.  And thank you so much.  This means the world to me.
WIL0001562	I'll agree to that.  But what if we don't find your stuff? Then what?
WIL0001563	I don't want to consider that possibility. But I'll travel with you for awhile whether we find my stuff or not.  That seems fair.
WIL0001564	I do want something from you.  But not as payment.  Let's just see how things go.
WIL0001565	Oh, well, uh, alright.  We'll just see how things go, then. Can we leave as soon as possible?  I'm anxious to get my stuff.
WIL0001566	Okay.  I'll help you.  Let's go get your stuff.  And don't worry about paying me back.
WIL0001567	Why are you being so generous?  This is a lot to do for someone you don't know for nothing in return. Not that I'm not grateful.
WIL0001568	I acted like an ass earlier.  I'd like to make that up to you.
WIL0001569	Thank you.  I appreciate that very much.  Can we leave soon?  I'm anxious to get going.
WIL0001570	I like you and I'd like to spend more time with you.  Even if it does involve chasing criminals.
WIL0001571	Well, thank you, you're not so bad yourself.  Can we start chasing those criminals soon?  I'd really like to get outta here.
WIL0001572	I do want something from you, but not as payment for anything. We'll just have to see how things go.
WIL0001573	Thanks for helping me, but, yeah, we'll just have to see what happens. And do you think we could leave soon?  I'm anxious to get out of here.
WIL0001574	Would you stay here and wait for me?  I'll be back for you later.
WIL0001575	Alright, if that's what you want. But don't leave me here long, okay?
WIL0001576	Can I look at what you're carrying right now?
WIL0001577	Um, sure.
WIL0001578	Would you wait here for me? I'll be back for you soon.
WIL0001579	I will, but please hurry.
WIL0001580	I don't know where Chester is, we've followed the trail we had. Do you have any ideas?
WIL0001581	Uh, well, yeah, I do, actually.  It's kind of embarrassing. I think the guy I was traveling with might have him.  He was helping me carry my stuff.
WIL0001582	We parted ways at the Mojave Outpost.  He was the big, strong quiet type.  Great for carrying stuff, but not a lot of fun. He didn't talk much.
WIL0001583	I have an idea where we might find him.  He wouldn't say much about himself, but he did talk a little bit about where he was going.
WIL0001584	I have something to tell you. I will ask you to carry items I don't want you to use or touch.
WIL0001585	Well, that's no fun, I can look at them can't I? Alright,  I'm willing to do that.
WIL0001586	[Lie] I don't have Moira.  I'm sorry.
WIL0001587	I don't believe you. I think you have her.  We will not be traveling together long if you plan on lying to me very often.
WIL0001588	We didn't go to both places listed on the note. We can keep going if you'd like.
WIL0001589	That's a good idea. But, I've been thinking about it, and, although, this is very embarrassing to admit, I don't think I had Chester with me.
WIL0001590	I think the guy I was traveling with might have him. He was carrying some of my stuff for me. We parted ways at the Mojave Outpost.
WIL0001591	He's the big, strong quiet type. Not much fun, but great for carrying stuff. I didn't get many details out of him, but I think I know where he is.
WIL0001592	I'm sorry about Chester, but I need to get on with my business now. Maybe we can look again later.
WIL0001593	You might not be interested, but there's something I want to tell you.  I don't think I had Chester with me when I was robbed.
WIL0001594	I think I left him with the guy I'd been traveling with. I put Chester in with his stuff. It was a joke. I think I forgot him there.
WIL0001595	I feel stupid I made such a mistake and do still want to find Chester. If you ever change your mind I'll be ready.
WIL0001596	Are you suggesting we track him down to get Chester?
WIL0001597	Well, yeah, I am. If you decide you're interested, I'll tell you everything I know about where he may be.
WIL0001598	So maybe we shouldn't bother looking anymore and just find this guy?
WIL0001599	I can't swear he has Chester, but he was carrying him at one point. It was a joke and then I forgot he had him. I just can't remember for sure.
WIL0001600	You sound so uncertain.  I'll think about it.
WIL0001601	Okay, but I'm willing to talk about it again at any time.  I still want to find Chester very much.
WIL0001602	I think we should try looking at the other location and then decide what to do.
WIL0001603	Talk?  What is there to talk about?  You're going to follow me around and do whatever I say, right?
WIL0001604	Um, no.  I have no intention of doing that. We definitely need to talk.
WIL0001605	Oh, your teasing me, aren't you?  That was a good one. Yeah, you got me. Right? That was a joke.
WIL0001606	Um, okay. You caught me. I do have her.  Sorry about that.
WIL0001607	You were an ass earlier and now you've lied to me. Lie to anyone else, but not me. I don't like traveling with someone I can't trust.
WIL0001608	And for now, while we are traveling together, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to keep looking for Chester.  I've had him since I was a little girl.
WIL0001609	Please don't lie to me.  Lie to anybody else, but not me. I want to be able to trust the person I'm traveling with, okay?
WIL0001610	And I'm still very interested in looking for Chester.  Can we make time for that in our travels?  I've had him since I was a little girl.
WIL0001611	[Lie] No, really, I don't have her.  You're wrong.  I wouldn't lie to you.
WIL0001612	Alright, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  But if you do have her, and I find out for sure, I won't just forgive and forget.
WIL0001613	Yeah, sure.  Whatever you want.
WIL0001614	Hey, I'm trying to be serious here. We should probably get some things cleared up before we hit the road.  I want us to get along.
WIL0001615	Yes, let's do this.  I'd like to be very clear about how we're going to do things.
WIL0001616	Oh, good.
WIL0001617	Do you have anything else?
WIL0001618	I have something for you.  It's a radio.  My dad got them for me.  One for me and one for whoever I was traveling with.
WIL0001619	He was worried about me going out on my own and thought this might make me that much safer.
WIL0001620	They're broken now and can only receive messages, but since you have that computer with you we'll be able to use them.
WIL0001621	You'll be able to talk to me because of it. I met someone else with one of those and it worked great.
WIL0001622	Is there anything in particular you want to talk about?
WIL0001623	Yes!  I can't fight with anything other than a gun. I'm lousy at anything else.  Okay, I can fight with my fists if I'm cornered... by a radroach.
WIL0001624	I'd love to learn more, and would be willing to study, but for now I'm pretty useless. I just wanted to be really clear about that.
WIL0001625	So, don't expect me to fight with anything other than a gun. Okay?  I won't do it.  Not with my skills the way they are now.
WIL0001626	Okay.  What if we trained you somehow?  Is that possible?
WIL0001627	Yeah, I read books and magazines about Boxing to learn what I can. But, they're hard to find.  I've only ever found a couple.
WIL0001628	But if I can read enough of them I figure eventually I'll get good enough to be able to use better weapons and kick some ass in a fight.
WIL0001629	Oh! Oh, oh, oh!  You know what would be even better?  If we found someone to train me! Are you any good with your fists?
WIL0001630	No problem.  I don't really care.  I prefer guns myself.
WIL0001631	Oh, I'm glad you don't mind.
WIL0001632	I read books and magazines about Boxing to learn what I can. But, they're hard to find.  I've only ever found a couple.
WIL0001633	I'm not happy about this, Willow. What else won't you do?
WIL0001634	Hmm, what seems like the best plan? I could fight with my fists if you asked me to, probably getting really hurt in the process and doing you no good
WIL0001635	or since I'm a great shot, I can use a gun, and effectively protect myself and you. It seems silly for me to use anything but a gun right now.
WIL0001636	But, if you only travel with people who can use a knife or their fists then, yeah, I'm not your girl. Unless you're willing to train me up.
WIL0001637	No, sorry I can't train you.  I don't have the skills.
WIL0001638	Oh.  Well, maybe we'll find someone else who can.
WIL0001639	Train you?  How would I do that?
WIL0001640	Just give me any books or magazines you find about boxing I'll read them.
WIL0001641	Eventually I figure I'll learn enough to use better weapons and be able to hold my own in a fight.
WIL0001642	No, I don't want to worry about training.
WIL0001643	Fine, forget I said anything about it. But I won't fight with anything but a gun.
WIL0001644	I might have. What did they look like?
WIL0001645	I don't know.  They looked like regular guys. There were two of them. One had very bright red hair and the other one was wearing some kind of helmet.
WIL0001646	Alright, if that's everything I guess we should consider ourselves partners on the road for awhile.
WIL0001647	I can't think of anything else, let's go.
WIL0001648	I didn't mind.  It was fine.
WIL0001649	I loved it! Thank you. Those exploding Teddy Bears were great. Do you know how I can get more?
WIL0001650	I thought you'd like those, aren't they fun? I didn't tell you the scariest part. I made them! I thought you might not use them if I told you that.
WIL0001651	I can give you this so you can make them and I'll keep looking for the parts you'll need. Oh, and I wanted to ask you something else.
WIL0001652	Would you like to finally see my collection? I keep talking about it but I still haven't shown it to you.
WIL0001653	Yes, I do have the skills.
WIL0001654	Oh, that's great news!
WIL0001655	Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
WIL0001656	No, I mean, really travel with me.  Working with me cooperatively and everything...
WIL0001657	I'm not being cooperative?
WIL0001658	You could be more cooperative. You promised you would be even if we didn't find your rifle.
WIL0001659	Are you even trying to find Beauty for me or did you just think since I agreed to come either way you wouldn't even try?
WIL0001660	You could be more cooperative. You promised to work closely with me if we didn't find your rifle.
WIL0001661	I did say that, it's true.  But we haven't been looking all that long.  We can talk about this again soon.
WIL0001662	I don't really like what you're wearing and want you to wear something else.
WIL0001663	Oh, yeah?  Well, I like it. This jacket means a lot to me and I'm going to keep wearing it. For now anyway.
WIL0001664	[Lie] I don't have her.  I really don't.
WIL0001665	And, since you don't have her, we'll keep looking for her then, right? And I want to keep looking for Chester too. I've had him since I was little.
WIL0001666	Alright, yes, I do have Moira.  You can have her.
WIL0001667	I didn't like it at all. Sorry.
WIL0001668	Oh, I got it that wrong.  Hmm. Well, I have something else you might like. Here.
WIL0001669	Would you like to see my collection, finally? I keep talking about it but still haven't shown it to you.
WIL0001670	Yes. You're fine. I just want you to know I'm looking forward to when that happens.
WIL0001671	To when what happens?
WIL0001672	To when we find Beauty and everything works really well between us.
WIL0001673	Oh, okay. Thanks.
WIL0001674	I know you don't have Beauty yet, but I'm not happy with our situation. I want more from you, now.
WIL0001675	I'm not ready to give up looking for Beauty. I think if you get what you want we won't look for her anymore. So, no. I won't.
WIL0001676	You promised me. It bothers me that you are breaking that promise.
WIL0001677	I'm sorry, but I have my reasons for acting this way. Just give me more time, okay?
WIL0001678	Can't we make this work for both of us?
WIL0001679	No, probably not.  Not unless you have Beauty behind your back and you're just playing games with me for some reason.
WIL0001680	So you have no intention of fulfilling your promise?
WIL0001681	I didn't say that. I just want to keep looking for a while longer before I commit myself to anything, that's all.
WIL0001682	I just want you to know that I understand why you are holding back right now.
WIL0001683	Sure. You think if you give it all up right away I won't look for Beauty.  So, don't worry.
WIL0001684	Something has to change. I'm very unhappy with this arrangement.
WIL0001685	I want to find Beauty, and, I want to find her more than I care about breaking my promise to you. Sorry.
WIL0001686	I'm not going to change the way things are without my rifle.  You can say what you like about me and my integrity.
WIL0001687	Okay, okay. We'll go find Beauty.
WIL0001688	We will?  You mean it? I didn't mean to lie when you first found me. I really meant what I said.
WIL0001689	I'm sorry if I've been terrible to you.
WIL0001690	Liar. I'm done with you. Go back to the Mojave Outpost and find somebody else to travel with.
WIL0001691	Fine. I will.
WIL0001692	Are you happy with the way things are between us?
WIL0001693	No, I'm not happy.  But I'm more unhappy that I don't have Beauty.
WIL0001694	Why were you alone when I found you?
WIL0001695	I hadn't been in the Mojave long. I'd arrived at the Mojave Outpost a few days before and had already split up with my last travel companion.
WIL0001696	I tried to find a new companion but couldn't, so I packed up and headed out. It was very unlucky that I got into trouble.
WIL0001697	I've been on the road for almost two years now and that was about as bad as it's ever gotten for me.
WIL0001698	Although, I did lose my dog, Big George, on the trip. He was killed by geckos. That was my worst day.
WIL0001699	[Charisma] You're my girl, Willow, I won't forget you for one moment.  Say you'll do it.
WIL0001700	Alright, you sweet talker, I'll do it.  This might turn out to be fun for both of us. I hope you know I'd only ever do something like this for you.
WIL0001701	What got you interested in traveling?
WIL0001702	I grew up in Oregon. My family runs a motel that lots of caravans and sometimes travelers come through.
WIL0001703	So, I spent my childhood listening to stories of life on the road. I can't remember a time when I didn't want to leave and live out those stories.
WIL0001704	Are you from the Mojave?  Will you be able to fill me in on details as we travel around or are you a newcomer like me?
WIL0001705	How do you support yourself on the road?
WIL0001706	I learned a lot about trading and bargaining from the caravans and traders that stayed with us while I was growing up.
WIL0001707	I scavenge things of value as I go and when I meet someone to trade with I bargain for the best prices I can get. I do pretty well that way.
WIL0001708	What haven't they understood?
WIL0001709	That it's fun to find pretty or interesting things and keep them and a couple of the people I've traveled with have made fun of me for it.
WIL0001710	I don't collect anything, but why would I make fun of you for doing it?
WIL0001711	You don't keep anything? You don't even keep things like the glasses your favorite grandmother wore?
WIL0001712	Or maybe the outfit you wore during a significant event, or a cigarette lighter that somebody gave you?  Nothing?
WIL0001713	I like to collect things too.
WIL0001714	I'm so excited you collect stuff too. What's your favorite thing to collect?
WIL0001715	No, I just pick up stuff to sell.
WIL0001716	Hmm. Interesting.
WIL0001717	You have a collection of junk that you haul around with you?  What's the point?
WIL0001718	Great. Forget I said anything.
WIL0001719	Armor and weapons.
WIL0001720	I have some good stuff at home.  I don't pick those up on the road. They weigh too much.
WIL0001721	You definitely chose the right kind of thing. Thank you.
WIL0001722	Oh, I'm so glad you liked it. I have something else I found that I think you might like too. Here.
WIL0001723	Teddy Bears and Toys.
WIL0001724	Oh, so you collect toys like I do.
WIL0001725	Do you have anything better to give me?
WIL0001726	No, I don't have anything better to give you.
WIL0001727	Miscellaneous Items.  You know, your basic junk.
WIL0001728	Junk?  I love junk. I have a spork in my collection and I love coffee mugs. I have to keep myself from picking them up.
WIL0001729	Things I think are special. If an item catches my eye and it interests me I'll keep it.
WIL0001730	Those are my favorites too.
WIL0001731	Now that you've asked me to pick I favorite I can't. I think I like to collect everything.
WIL0001732	That's funny. It must be hard for you to not get overloaded most of the time.
WIL0001733	Nothing, I just want to see you naked.
WIL0001734	What?  Did you really just say that to me? Go find a picture of a naked girl to look at. I'm not taking my clothes off for you.
WIL0001735	Please?
WIL0001736	Eh, maybe someday.  Not today.
WIL0001737	You have a lot of food with you.  Do you cook for yourself?
WIL0001738	Yes!  I really enjoy doing it too.  I can set up a campfire anytime.  Just ask.  I'll want to cook regularly to keep up my supply of food.
WIL0001739	Do you cook?
WIL0001740	That's a difficult question to answer.
WIL0001741	Why's that?  It's seems easy enough to me.  Either you're from here and you know the Mojave or you're not and you don't, right?
WIL0001742	Yes, Willow?  Is this about us?
WIL0001743	I'm ready for us to be more than just friends.
WIL0001744	Sure, where do you want to go?
WIL0001745	When I was at the Mojave Outpost I talked to Major Knight about where I should go.  He game me three names.
WIL0001746	No, I don't want to take you shopping.  That sounds very boring to me.
WIL0001747	Even if it means I'm cooking more food to share with you?
WIL0001748	Like I said, it's difficult to explain, Willow.  I took a shot to the head doing my job.
WIL0001749	That's terrible.  Who shot you?  Was it an accident?
WIL0001750	No, it wasn't an accident.  He shot me, buried me and left me for dead.
WIL0001751	But, why?  That's so cruel.
WIL0001752	Yes, even then.
WIL0001753	Okay, it's your choice.
WIL0001754	I was a courier and he wanted what I was carrying.  It was robbery.
WIL0001755	So, how did you survive a shot to the head that damaged you so badly?
WIL0001756	It happened in Goodsprings and the doc there patched me up.
WIL0001757	Do you know who shot you?
WIL0001758	That's too bad about your dog.  I'm sorry.
WIL0001759	Thank you.  I miss him a lot.
WIL0001760	Do you want to tell me what happened to your dog?
WIL0001761	He got ahead of me on the trail and got the scent of the Geckos.  I'm not sure exactly what happened because he was ahead of me.
WIL0001762	But I heard a yelp and I came around a bend in the trail and he'd fallen off the edge of a little precipice.  The Geckos were below with him.
WIL0001763	By the time I got down to them and shot all the geckos he was dead.  He'd broken one of his legs in the fall and he couldn't defend himself.
WIL0001764	I buried him as best I could and slept there that night with him and then, the next morning, I said goodbye and left him forever.
WIL0001765	Oh, well, when you put it like that I should say yes. Who do you want to go and see?
WIL0001766	Great!  It has been too long since I've been to a trader.
WIL0001767	Yes, I do.  I'm glad to hear you can build us a campfire.
WIL0001768	That'll be fun. We can cook together over my campfire.  If I have the ingredients I cook something whenever I set it up.
WIL0001769	Do you want to see what I use the most?  Those are the ingredients I use for my favorite recipes. Maybe we could trade stuff we don't use.
WIL0001770	Would you be willing to do that? I'm happy to give you things that I don't use. Would you do the same for me?
WIL0001771	What are you doing out here all by yourself?
WIL0001772	I have my reasons. I'm not thrilled about being alone, but I wasn't going to sit around in the Mojave Outpost because of it.
WIL0001773	Yes, and I'm going to pay him back for what he did to me.
WIL0001774	I'll help all I can. What an asshole.  Him, not you.
WIL0001775	Yes, and he's dead.
WIL0001776	Yes, but I don't want to talk about it.
WIL0001777	No, I'm still trying to figure that out. You'll be with me while I do it.
WIL0001778	I'll help you any way I can. What an asshole thing to do to you.
WIL0001779	Do you know anything about this guy at all?
WIL0001780	In that case can I have your scavenged food? I'll give you a list of ingredients for my favorite recipes and you'll know what I need?
WIL0001781	Oh, I guess that means I assume you scavenge. You do, don't you?  Doesn't everyone? And then, if we set up a campfire I'll be able to cook my food.
WIL0001782	Sure, I could do that.
WIL0001783	Great. Here's the list of ingredients. I'll be happy to share the food I cook with you.
WIL0001784	No, I don't want to do that.  Why can't you scavenge your own ingredients?
WIL0001785	Well, I can do that, I suppose.  I don't know how much I'll be able to find following you around. There is an advantage to you sharing though.
WIL0001786	I'll share what I cook with you, if you want it.
WIL0001787	Alright. I'll do it.  If I find ingredients you want I'll give them to you.
WIL0001788	No, I am not interested in doing that Willow.
WIL0001789	Oh, fine.
WIL0001790	What will you do while you're following me and don't have much freedom to scavenge?
WIL0001791	I've done different things in the past with different companions.  With people who like to stay close together I expect to find less stuff.
WIL0001792	While I'm with you I'll keep my eyes on the ground and look for caps, small things we can sell or cooking ingredients.
WIL0001793	If I'm lucky I might find a small, special item here or there to add to my collection.
WIL0001794	Can I ask you about something else?
WIL0001795	Sometimes.  It's not something I go out of my way to do.
WIL0001796	Oh, that's too bad.  I like it so much I cook something whenever I have the ingredients and can set up my campfire.
WIL0001797	Since you don't like it too much, what if I gave you my list of ingredients?
WIL0001798	Maybe, when you're scavenging, if you find some of them, you could give them to me, instead of doing something else with them. What do you say?
WIL0001799	Thank you, Willow, that's very sweet.
WIL0001800	Oh, good.  It'll be fun.
WIL0001801	Thank you. I like you too, Willow. I'm glad we're friends.
WIL0001802	Maybe, one day, we'll be more than friends.
WIL0001803	Okay.  Great.  I might take you up on that sometime.
WIL0001804	Oh, okay.  I hope you decide to do it.
WIL0001805	Oh, no, I didn't.  I'd like it if we could be more than friends one day. (Romance Quest)
WIL0001806	I'm not ready to take that step yet, let's just see how things go.
WIL0001807	I'm flattered, Willow, but I'd like to stay friends with you. (Be friends with Willow. No Romance.)
WIL0001808	Okay.  I'll be sure to save all my affection for special occasions.
WIL0001809	No. I don't have either of them.
WIL0001810	They didn't have them?  Are you sure?
WIL0001811	Let's talk about something else (Let's you skip personal topics and unlocks items from them for you)
WIL0001812	It's not the hat, Willow.
WIL0001813	It is!  I'm sure it helps.  But I still need my hat. I do have another one just like it to give you, though.
WIL0001814	I want you to take it and try it out, okay?
WIL0001815	Why are carrying two identical hats?
WIL0001816	Huh, well, that's a long story.  I don't know that I want to tell it or that you want to hear it.
WIL0001817	Yes, that sounds like a fun.  I'm happy to share with you.
WIL0001818	No, I'm not too interested in sharing.  Why don't you plan to take care of your own needs.
WIL0001819	Okay, I'll try it.
WIL0001820	Yes, you can count on it.
WIL0001821	Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
WIL0001822	Now? Now's a terrible time! But, I want to! We'll have to do it later.
WIL0001823	I'll be waiting for you.
WIL0001824	Yes! I've been waiting for you to come to me!
WIL0001825	Well, I'm here now. I have a surprise for you and would love some privacy. Should we do it here or go some place else?
WIL0001826	Let's do it here.
WIL0001827	I want to go somewhere else.
WIL0001828	Lead the way, Lover.
WIL0001829	Willow, I'm not interested in doing it again. I hope you understand.
WIL0001830	Fine.  We won't then. And as far as I'm concerned, we are nothing more than friends from now on, I hope you understand?
WIL0001831	What's with all the pencils? You've got about ten of them.
WIL0001832	I like pencils.
WIL0001833	You like pencils?
WIL0001834	I do write in my journal. But, have you noticed when you need one it's never there?  Well, if you have ten, or more, there's never a problem.
WIL0001835	I notice you have a lot of dog biscuits too.  Why so many of those?
WIL0001836	I love them!  I made up the recipe for Big George, my dog, but they're so tasty I carry a bunch with me all the time. They're my favorite snack.
WIL0001837	It's a teddy bear. I hope you like it.
WIL0001838	I do, thanks!
WIL0001839	I found a garden gnome. Don't you think he'll go nicely with Moira and Chester?
WIL0001840	Yes, I do!  Thank you.
WIL0001841	They're good, huh? Can I try one?
WIL0001842	Oh, please do.  We can always make more.
WIL0001843	Hmm. Think I'll pass on the dog's food.
WIL0001844	Why?  I cook them properly.  I make them with Gecko meat, Blamco Mac & Cheese and flour. It's not like I make them with Salisbury Steak. Ugh.
WIL0001845	Oh, well, that's alright then.
WIL0001846	You might want to consider a name change for them.  Dog Biscuits isn't so appetizing, is it?
WIL0001847	I think I'll leave it for now.  In remembrance of Big George.
WIL0001848	It's a Nuka Cola Quartz.
WIL0001849	Thank you!  I'm going to drink that right away!
WIL0001850	I love you too.
WIL0001851	Come even closer.  I want a kiss.
WIL0001852	Ooh, I like that idea!
WIL0001853	Oh, anytime lover.
WIL0001854	I found something for you to put into your collection.  I think it's pretty special.
WIL0001855	I have a surprise for you!  Remember you asked for a dress like Veronica or something pretty?
WIL0001856	Yes!  You have something for me?
WIL0001857	[Change mind] Um, oops, I guess I don't have something to give you after all.  I'm sorry, Willow.
WIL0001858	Can I keep it?  Please?  I'll take good care of it.  I promise.
WIL0001859	Yes, you know, you can have it. I got it from a trader and it's never been especially dear to me.  Maybe you'll like it more than I have.
WIL0001860	I was just curious about it.  You can have it back now. Where did you get it?
WIL0001861	I got that from a trader.  I don't find everything I have.  Moira came from a caravaner who used to stay with us in the motel, but she was a gift.
WIL0001862	But, the lighter? I definitely want that. It was my grandfather's.
WIL0001863	Are you trying to tell me something? You've been flirting with me for awhile now.
WIL0001864	It's true, I have been flirting.
WIL0001865	I have some to share.  Here, have one of mine.
WIL0001866	You are not making this easy for me!  You know I want you, right?
WIL0001867	Yes, I know.  I feel the same way.
WIL0001868	That sounds good.  I don't want to stop right now.
WIL0001869	You must know by now how much I like you. And if you don't know, let me say it again. I do like you.
WIL0001870	You do? I'm so glad. You'd said so before, and you've done so many nice things for me, that, I'd hoped you still did. But, I wasn't sure.
WIL0001871	You do know, as soon as you give me the ok, I'm going to be all over you. And I mean, ALL over you.
WIL0001872	Oh. Maybe we should do something about that.  Soon.
WIL0001873	How soon Willow? Now? Because I want it to be now.  Come here.
WIL0001874	Soon is good, but I want you to be ready. I'll be here when you decide to come to me.
WIL0001875	I'll come to you when I'm ready, I promise.
WIL0001876	Yes, I still do like you. Will you come here and let me show you how much?
WIL0001877	Yes!  I've been thinking about this for a long, long time.
WIL0001878	And because I've been thinking about it for so long I've had time to plan something special for you.
WIL0001879	I'd like to do it somewhere private.  But, you choose. Should we do it here or go somewhere else?
WIL0001880	I do still like you, a lot, but I want you to come to me. Whenever you're ready I'll be here.
WIL0001881	Are we going to do something about it or are you going to keep flirting forever?
WIL0001882	I'm not ready yet. When I am I'll come to you, I promise.
WIL0001883	Great. Let's do something about it. Come here and let me show you how much I want you.
WIL0001884	Let's go somewhere else. Come on.
WIL0001885	Do you ever get lonely traveling by yourself?
WIL0001886	Yes, I do, even though I'm rarely alone. I had hoped to meet someone special. Maybe someone who would want to come with me on the road.
WIL0001887	Or maybe someone would like me enough to want me stay with them. But even though I've met and traveled with a lot of people in the last two years,
WIL0001888	I have been unlucky in love and friendship.
WIL0001889	I'm sorry. I'm sure it will happen for you someday.
WIL0001890	Yeah?  I hope so.
WIL0001891	Maybe you'll get lucky sooner than you think.
WIL0001892	What? Sorry, I got distracted by something over there behind you. You were saying?
WIL0001893	Oh, nevermind. I was just rambling. It wasn't important.
WIL0001894	Look, Fancy Lad Snack Cakes. One of your favorites.
WIL0001895	I know that Raul likes sweets a lot and he seems so sad, would you consider giving it to him instead?  It would mean a lot to me.
WIL0001896	So you're serious about having me stay here in the Mojave with you?
WIL0001897	Yes, I am, very much.
WIL0001898	This means a lot to me.  Thank you.
WIL0001899	And I love the bungalow.  It reminds me of home so much. I know I'm going to be very happy here.
WIL0001900	Sure. If you want to stay that would be fine with me. I'm happy to have you share my house with me.
WIL0001901	Having you here will make things easier for me while we're traveling together.
WIL0001902	Oh.  Well, thanks.
WIL0001903	I have some GumDrops for you.
WIL0001904	Maybe we can.  Let's find whoever's in charge around here and ask.
WIL0001905	Great!  I'd like that. Things are a mess around here.
WIL0001906	I got you some Bubblegum.
WIL0001907	I found some Junk Food. You want it, don't you?
WIL0001908	Of course I do.  Thank you.
WIL0001909	Yeah.  What's going on?
WIL0001910	I told you when we first started traveling together that it wouldn't be for very long, but I'm having so much fun with you.
WIL0001911	And, you've become very special to me. I think of you as a friend, as a best friend actually, and I don't want to leave you or the Mojave.
WIL0001912	So, what do you say? Should we make it official?  Shall I stay and keep following you around?
WIL0001913	Now's a bad time, Willow.  We'll have to do it later.
WIL0001914	Okay, but don't forget.
WIL0001915	You have something important to talk about?
WIL0001916	Yes. Why don't you stay.  It's working out well for me too.
WIL0001917	Great! We'll be best friends forever!
WIL0001918	I very much want you to stay with me.
WIL0001919	Sure, you can stay.
WIL0001920	I didn't like them very much.  Sorry.
WIL0001921	Alright.  Go do it now.
WIL0001922	Wait.  Now's not a good time.  Do it later.
WIL0001923	I know he wears a checkered coat and that I should look for him in Novac. That's about it.
WIL0001924	I see a trip to Novac in our future.
WIL0001925	I know he wears a checkered coat and I've heard he's in New Vegas.
WIL0001926	New Vegas!  We could kick his ass and then go see the sights!
WIL0001927	I know he wears a checkered coat.  That's about it.
WIL0001928	Look!  I've been doing some scavenging myself and I've got 50 pencils for you. You'll never run out!
WIL0001929	Oh! Thank you so much! I love them.  It's one of the best presents I have ever gotten.
WIL0001930	It reminds me of my twelfth birthday, when my best friend, Bethie, went all over town and found me 12 bottles of Wonderglue.
WIL0001931	It must have taken you so long to find all of these. I appreciate it so much.  You'll just never know how much.  I love them.
WIL0001932	I have a new outfit for you to try on if you want. I think it will look great on you.
WIL0001933	That sounds fun.  Let's do it.
WIL0001934	Sure, but I might need a hand getting into it. You up for that?
WIL0001935	Sure.  You'll see me again when I have everything on that list.
WIL0001936	Forget it!  I'm not getting all that stuff for you.
WIL0001937	I might still be here if you change your mind.
WIL0001938	I've got all the ingredients you wanted.
WIL0001939	Wow! Look at that!  Well, I guess you were serious then, so I'll come with you like I promised I would.
WIL0001940	Great, I just wanted to come by and see if you were still here.
WIL0001941	Yeah, I'm still here.  I haven't had any luck finding anyone to travel with yet.
WIL0001942	I've got something for you. I saw it and immediately thought of you.
WIL0001943	Thank you. That's so thoughtful!
WIL0001944	Yes, I do.  Here you go!
WIL0001945	Alright.  This is it.
WIL0001946	Of course.  Here it is.
WIL0001947	Here it is.
WIL0001948	Okay, do whatever you want.  But, I'd try the hat if I were you.
WIL0001949	Um...no?
WIL0001950	Oh!  I'm so glad to hear you say that!
WIL0001951	Oh, don't be like that honey.  What if we took her to bed together? I think you'd enjoy it.
WIL0001952	And you'd enjoy it. You wouldn't ignore me and just pay attention to her would you?
WIL0001953	[Lady Killer] I won't ignore you, I promise. But maybe you'd ignore me some, huh?  What do you say?
WIL0001954	[Cherchez LF] I love you Willow, how could I possibly ignore you for another girl?  Will you do it?
WIL0001955	Wait.  I don't want to.  Let's get out of here together.
WIL0001956	Alright.  I'll see you at home later.
WIL0001957	Willow, it's not like we're married.  I'm free to do what I want.
WIL0001958	Fine. You're right. We're not married. I understand now how things are. I thought you loved me, but I guess I was wrong. Have fun. I'm going home.
WIL0001959	I'm sorry. I didn't think about how you'd feel. Don't leave. I'll come with you.
WIL0001960	I want my freedom. I'm going to sleep with her. If you don't like it you should go home.
WIL0001961	Fine, I'm going home.
WIL0001962	Yeah, that's a great idea.
WIL0001963	No, I want you to have it Willow.
WIL0001964	Okay.  Thank you!
WIL0001965	Oh, come on Willow it'd be fun!
WIL0001966	No, I don't want to join you in a threesome with her!  What I want to do is go home.  I thought you loved me!
WIL0001967	Nevermind
WIL0001968	Oh, come on, Willow, we're best friends.  Tell me.
WIL0001969	It started before I left home.  I wasn't supposed to come to New Vegas alone.  My best friend Bethie, she was supposed to be here with me.
WIL0001970	We spent months getting ready to go. My dad made us the radios, we collected gear we wanted to take, we talked to caravan guards about routes.
WIL0001971	And that's when things went wrong.
WIL0001972	Something happened with one of the caravans?
WIL0001973	Brian, one of the guards we talked to, liked Bethie right away and started coming 'round to see her. She never said anything about it.
WIL0001974	So I kept talking about our trip, finishing up plans and getting ready to go.  About two weeks before we were supposed to leave Bethie disappeared.
WIL0001975	Poof! She was just...gone.
WIL0001976	She ran off and left you?  What a terrible thing to do!
WIL0001977	Yeah, I was devastated.  She'd been my best friend since we were little kids. I couldn't believe she'd leave without any kind of goodbye.
WIL0001978	She took off with Brian didn't she?
WIL0001979	Yeah, she left with Brian on one of his caravan routes.
WIL0001980	Oh, no!  Bethie got killed by Geckos!
WIL0001981	No, only Big George got killed by Geckos.
WIL0001982	So, what did you do?
WIL0001983	I decided to chase her.  It took me about a week to finish getting ready and then I left.
WIL0001984	I knew where Brian's caravan was headed so that's where I went, but he left the caravan and I never did find her.
WIL0001985	The second hat was supposed to be hers. We thought matching hats would be fun.
WIL0001986	But, the hats aren't really that identical anymore. The one I've given you is nice and clean.
WIL0001987	It hasn't been torn up by geckos or gunshots.
WIL0001988	So, what did happen to Bethie?
WIL0001989	Yeah, I want to help him every way I can.
WIL0001990	I just can't get over it. That you believe in him.
WIL0001991	I'm getting tired of you complaining about it. Why don't you leave already?
WIL0001992	Do you want me to go?
WIL0001993	Yes, forever.  (Willow leaves your game.  You can't get her back).
WIL0001994	Alright.  Fuck you.  I am leaving and we are never, ever, ever getting back together.
WIL0001995	Yes, go home. I'll catch up with you later.
WIL0001996	No, but I could stand less complaining from you about the Legion.
WIL0001997	I'm sorry. I did tell you I wasn't thrilled about being involved with Caesar.  Don't forget I love you, okay?  It's why I'm here.
WIL0001998	No, I want you to stay with me.
WIL0001999	I want that too.
WIL0002000	Well, I do.  Follow me, follow him.  That's the way it's going to be.
WIL0002001	Okay, don't forget I love you.  That's why I stay.
WIL0002002	I don't want to have anything to do with that.  It's one thing to kill people who are trying to kill us, but to go in cold...
WIL0002003	I'm gonna sit this one out.  I'll be waiting for you at home.
WIL0002004	I do, I'm confident the NCR can win this.
WIL0002005	You know, I was never excited about getting involved in this war, but after everything we've seen...
WIL0002006	Driving the legion out of the Mojave is the right thing to do.  If I die, doing it, it would be for something worthwhile.
WIL0002007	Yes, it's almost time to go.  We can talk now if you want.
WIL0002008	Are you worried at all about dying?  I'm worried about you and me too.  It's scary to think both of us might not make it through this.
WIL0002009	I have some more work to do before we'll go to The Dam, can we talk later?
WIL0002010	Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
WIL0002011	Oh, I do! I don't want to die. But I do want to talk to you about the possibility.
WIL0002012	I'm not too worried about it. I think we have the advantage of strength on our side.
WIL0002013	I'm glad you're feeling confident about our chances, and you must feel committed to your cause to be risking your life.
WIL0002014	Even against the NCR?
WIL0002015	Yeah, that is hard for me, but after everything we've seen?  I agree, they shouldn't be here.
WIL0002016	But, this isn't what I want to talk to you about.
WIL0002017	Of course!  It's scary as hell!  But we'll be okay.
WIL0002018	I want to make sure you know how I feel about you, just in case one of us doesn't make it through this.
WIL0002019	You've been a great friend to me, like the sister I never had and I love you.
WIL0002020	You've been a great friend to me and I love you very much.
WIL0002021	Well, when it occurred to me that you might die I got so sad!
WIL0002022	I love you so much.  I was thinking, if we both make it through this maybe we could talk about making our relationship a more serious one.
WIL0002023	Maybe we could talk about staying together forever.
WIL0002024	But for now,  I want you to take this and wear it. Maybe it'll keep you safe.
WIL0002025	Think of it as my promise to you that I'll love you forever no matter what.  Because I do and I will. I'll be wearing one too.
WIL0002026	I want to make sure you know I love you very much.  You've been a wonderful friend to me.  Thank you.
WIL0002027	I do!  Thanks for the ones you've given me so far.
WIL0002028	You're welcome!
WIL0002029	Well, you're spoiling me Willow. It's too much.
WIL0002030	Do you want me to stop?  I will if you want me to.
WIL0002031	Yeah, that would be best.  (turns gift giving in the mailbox off)
WIL0002032	No, please don't.  It's a lot, but I like it. (Willow will continue to leave gifts in the mailbox)
WIL0002033	Do you know exactly what you want or do you plan to just wander around? The Mojave's a big place.
WIL0002034	Oh, I know what I want and where we should go to get it.  When I was at the Mojave Outpost I picked up a NCR pamphlet.
WIL0002035	It talks about the flora and fauna of the Mojave and where to find stuff.  It's very informative.
WIL0002036	I've planned our little mission based on what I've read in the pamphlet.  Hopefully it won't send us on a wild goose chase.
WIL0002037	The first place we're headed to is Ruby Hill Mine to get a couple of Banana Yucca plants.
WIL0002038	Because he's evil and if the legion wins the war they'll destroy everything that's good in the Mojave. You can stop it.
WIL0002039	If you kill Caesar now you will destroy the legion.  You have to consider it.
WIL0002040	No, way!
WIL0002041	It's the best option for the Mojave. The legion will destroy everything here. You know that's the truth.
WIL0002042	Remember that chatty robot in the closet in Benny's room?  He offered to help you take over New Vegas and make it your own.
WIL0002043	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the Mojave. You'd be a hero.
WIL0002044	What?  Why would I do that?
WIL0002045	Killing Caesar won't destroy the legion.
WIL0002046	Okay, maybe it won't destroy it, but it will weaken it, and you can leave them, and if you must fight in this war fight it another way.
WIL0002047	Remember that chatty robot? The one in the closet in Benny's room?  He offered to help you take over New Vegas and make it your own.
WIL0002048	If you do that you can make things right for New Vegas and the entire Mojave.   You'd be a hero.
WIL0002049	That's it! You've gone too far! I should tell you to leave and never come back!
WIL0002050	Oh, I'm sorry!  Don't make me go!  I love you!  I take it back!
WIL0002051	Oh, I'm sorry!  Please, don't make me go! I take it back!
WIL0002052	You've gone too far and you're going to pay the price!  (kill her)
WIL0002053	You're so unhappy, just go.  I do love you, but this will be better for both of us. (leaves forever)
WIL0002054	Okay. You know, I could never leave you on my own, but, you're right,  it's probably for the best.
WIL0002055	I do love you.
WIL0002056	You've been a great friend to me. I'll miss you.
WIL0002057	You can't take it back.  It's over.  Just go.  Now. (leaves forever)
WIL0002058	Alright, fine!  But I don't want to hear any more about killing Caesar.
WIL0002059	I promise, I won't mention it again. I'm so sorry.
WIL0002060	I don't need any time to think about it! I'll stay with you forever if I make it through this!
WIL0002061	Ah! Oh! I love you!
WIL0002062	Thanks, Willow.  If I get through this, I'll think about what you've said.
WIL0002063	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called A. Tom McTed.
WIL0002064	Ooh, thanks! That is a quality collectible.
WIL0002065	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Bearly.
WIL0002066	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Cy Bear.
WIL0002067	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Pvt. Bear.
WIL0002068	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Golf R. Bear.
WIL0002069	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called Plush E. Bear.
WIL0002070	It's a very special bear.  He has a name.  He's called S.W. Bear.
WIL0002071	Yes, I want to see a Mojave free of both the Legion and the NCR.  A truly independent New Vegas.
WIL0002072	I've never been excited about getting involved in this war. But,  I'm committed to supporting you.  I'll do whatever it takes.
WIL0002073	I am committed.  I think Mr. House is the right choice for the Mojave.
WIL0002074	I've never been excited about getting involved in this war. But, I'm committed to supporting you.  I'll do whatever it takes.
WIL0002075	No, I don't think it's out there waiting to be found.  I think it's just a story.
WIL0002076	Really? But it could be something exciting that hasn't been seen since before The Great War.  I can't even imagine what that might be.
WIL0002077	Aren't you even a little curious?
WIL0002078	Hunting?
WIL0002079	Yeah, geckos, mostly. That's why my dad taught me to shoot as soon as I could handle a weapon.  He was looking to train us to be hunters.
WIL0002080	He didn't really like doing all the hunting for the motel himself so he was looking for help from us kids.
WIL0002081	I didn't like hunting all the time though, I preferred hanging out and working with my mom in the motel so that was my job.
WIL0002082	Dad got his wish though, two of my brothers really took to hunting. That's Sam and Dean.
WIL0002083	I don't know if it exists or not, but we can look for it together if you want.
WIL0002084	Woo-hoo!  We are huntin' for treasure!
WIL0002085	No, not really.  I won't stop you looking for it, but I'm not going to help either.
WIL0002086	Oh, well, be that way. I'm going to keep looking for it.
WIL0002087	Well, okay, maybe a little.  What if we look for it together?
WIL0002088	What about your other brothers?
WIL0002089	Val's a doctor, Chuck's a caravan guard and my little brother, Bobby? He's probably running around still being useless most of the time.
WIL0002090	Definitely the story of your life.
WIL0002091	Okay, so, I grew up in the motel that my parents run, right?  Well, my dad loves the guests.
WIL0002092	He sits around the fire at night with the caravaners and asks them for news from along their routes. He's always done it since I was a little girl.
WIL0002093	My mom and oldest brother, Val, they love it too and the three of them and the guests will sit up late into the night talking.
WIL0002094	And arguing.  They love to argue about the NCR and what it does or doesn't do and whether the legion is evil or not.
WIL0002095	They'll talk and argue about just about anything, but their favorite subject is politics.
WIL0002096	Did you ever get involved?
WIL0002097	I was there, but I didn't say too much. I just wanted to be close to my dad. As I got older I helped my mom more and more and saw him less and less.
WIL0002098	So if I wanted to be with my dad I'd have to grab time with him at night when he was with the guests.  I fell asleep more often than not.
WIL0002099	But, you know, I was awake often enough to learn that Caesar leads a group of brutal, killing slavers.
WIL0002100	Of course he's human! Mr. House isn't just a man.  He's a great man.
WIL0002101	Alright, even if he is, he seems awfully full of himself.
WIL0002102	He's interesting that's for sure.
WIL0002103	It'd be interesting to know if he's human or not.
WIL0002104	I want the short version.
WIL0002105	My dad.  He and the caravaners would talk about news from along their routes and I heard what they said.
WIL0002106	They'd talk about Caesar and the legion so I've heard enough about them to know I don't trust them and I know they're brutal, murdering slavers.
WIL0002107	We don't.  And without seeing him we can't be sure.
WIL0002108	Hmm.  Maybe we can do something about that.
WIL0002109	He's rich and powerful and he's been running things for a long time.
WIL0002110	So? Because he has a lot of money he gets to tell people how to live?  That doesn't seem fair.
WIL0002111	It's more than that. He's smart and he cares about New Vegas.
WIL0002112	He seems kind of like a bully to me.
WIL0002113	Willow!  I respect Mr. House!
WIL0002114	No, not a bully.  He's more like a father who wants to protect and care for New Vegas.
WIL0002115	Oh! When you explain it like that he doesn't seem so bad.
WIL0002116	It's okay, but he's not a bully.
WIL0002117	So if he's not a bully, what's he doing?
WIL0002118	He's trying to keep New Vegas safe and functional. He has its best interests at heart.
WIL0002119	Okay, I'll take your word for it.  But he's not my favorite guy.
WIL0002120	I liked him.
WIL0002121	Seriously?  Huh.
WIL0002122	Be respectful. He's earned it.  He planned ahead and protected New Vegas and is still protecting it.
WIL0002123	Okay, sorry.  He's smart.  But he's only one guy trying to tell everyone else what to do. So, why isn't he a bully?
WIL0002124	I like what he has to say.
WIL0002125	But, he's a killer, no better than a raider...worse.  He and the legion wipe out entire tribes.  They torture and maim.  They're slavers.
WIL0002126	But he's a killer. And look at how he treats women!  Do you honestly think you're different from the others?
WIL0002127	Because he has the best interests of New Vegas at heart.  This is his home.
WIL0002128	But he has reasons for why he does the things he does. I admire him.
WIL0002129	Wow.  So you are seriously considering getting involved in this war.  Against the NCR.
WIL0002130	Yes, I'm seriously considering it and I want you to stay with me even if I decide to do that.
WIL0002131	What?  Why would I want to do that?
WIL0002132	[LadyKiller]Because, we're destined to be together.  You've known it since you first saw me, Willow.
WIL0002133	You're right...I can't leave you.
WIL0002134	But, I came here to see New Vegas, not to get involved in a war and I don't want to get involved with the legion.
WIL0002135	[BFF]Would you really walk out on your best friend?  I mean more to you than the NCR, don't I?
WIL0002136	Yes, of course you do! You're right. I'll stay with you no matter what.
WIL0002137	[Romanced]Do you really want to fight over politics? We mean more to each other than that, don't we?
WIL0002138	Oh!  You're right!  I love you! I'd die for you.
WIL0002139	I think he's human, Willow.
WIL0002140	Maybe.  I do like his casino.  Maybe we can avoid HIM in the future.
WIL0002141	I don't plan to have much to do with him so we don't need to worry about it.
WIL0002142	Good.  That settles that.
WIL0002143	I'm not going to work with him, but he was much more reasonable than I expected him to be.
WIL0002144	Yeah, right?  I expected him to be a slobbering, yelling maniac, but he wasn't so bad.
WIL0002145	Don't get me wrong, he didn't win me over.  He just wasn't as bad, or scary, as I expected him to be.
WIL0002146	He's smart and articulate.  It was interesting to talk to him.
WIL0002147	Interesting.  I didn't expect that.  Smart, yeah, but I expected you to tell me he's a raving monster.
WIL0002148	He's a bossy motherfucker, that's for sure.  I'd like to kill him.
WIL0002149	That's a great idea!  You'd be a hero!
WIL0002150	I have no intention of working with him if that's what you're worried about.
WIL0002151	I'm happy to hear it, but I didn't think you would. So, what did you think of him?
WIL0002152	[Strength] I'll protect you. You have nothing to be afraid of while I'm with you.
WIL0002153	Alright, I'll trust you to keep me safe.
WIL0002154	We work well together.  I don't want to lose you over a political difference of opinion.
WIL0002155	This is more than politics!  The legion treats women like dirt and they're slavers! They take whatever they want without consideration for anyone.
WIL0002156	I'd never feel safe is we were spending time around them.
WIL0002157	Yes, because he's impressed with what I've done.  I don't think he's lying about that.
WIL0002158	Yeah, right.  He's a lying killer! Did you see any women in charge? All I saw were female slaves!
WIL0002159	And you want me with you while you follow him? Why would I do that?
WIL0002160	[Intelligence] And the NCR doesn't "take whatever it wants without consideration for anyone?"
WIL0002161	How can you say that?  They aren't like the legion.  They don't turn people into slaves!
WIL0002162	Maybe not.  But they came into the Mojave and took what they wanted.  They weren't invited.
WIL0002163	I don't understand.  How is coming into the Mojave the same as making someone a slave?
WIL0002164	The NCR have forced themselves onto the Mojave. The Mojave didn't choose. Just like a slave doesn't.
WIL0002165	I've never heard anyone compare the NCR to slavers before.
WIL0002166	Yes, I am. Deal with it.
WIL0002167	Are you telling me I have to accept Caesar and his legion if I'm going to stay with you?
WIL0002168	[CherchezLaFemme] Because we're destined to be together. You've known it since you first saw me.
WIL0002169	You're right...I, I can't leave you.
WIL0002170	Yes.  You can follow me and shut up about it or leave.
WIL0002171	I can't believe you're talking to me like this, but if you're interested in following Caesar I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
WIL0002172	Look, I have no intention of shutting up about this.  We can talk about it or I'm going to leave.  Choose now.
WIL0002173	Leave then.  (Willow leaves your game forever; good riddance)
WIL0002174	Leave then.
WIL0002175	Alright, calm down. Let's talk about this. (negotiations commence; Willow will stay with you)
WIL0002176	Okay, but why do I want to get involved in this war, and why on the side of the legion?
WIL0002177	So will you stay?
WIL0002178	Yeah, let's see how it goes. I like you a lot, and I'd rather be with you than argue about politics.
WIL0002179	Yes.  I will.  I love you, and I'd rather be with you than argue about politics.
WIL0002180	Willow, stay with me because you like me.  That's more important than politics any day.
WIL0002181	You're right. I do care more about friendship than politics and I don't want to fight about it.
WIL0002182	The memorial reminded me of my brother, Chuck.  From the time he was little all he wanted to do was join the NCR and become a Ranger.
WIL0002183	My dad wouldn't let him do it, though.
WIL0002184	Why wouldn't your dad let him do it?
WIL0002185	He didn't want Chuck to die fighting for the NCR.  Dad wanted him safe at home, which it turns out he didn't get after all.
WIL0002186	Chuck's a caravan guard now. He loves it. I think he thrives on danger.
WIL0002187	He almost died a few years ago in a fight, but he has this big scar to show for it.
WIL0002188	The thing is the scar's left him dangerous looking and he knows it so he plays it up and acts tough. He's a handful, but girls love him.
WIL0002189	Heh. Willow you didn't stay home safe either!
WIL0002190	Yeah, you're right.  My dad did mention Chuck when I told him what I wanted to do.
WIL0002191	I can understand why he wanted to protect Chuck.  It'd be hard to lose a child.
WIL0002192	Yeah, and if I ever have a baby, and I want to someday, I hope he or she won't do the crazy stuff Chuck and I do.
WIL0002193	I'd worry myself sick.
WIL0002194	Your dad should have let Chuck go fight.  There's honor in fighting.
WIL0002195	Yeah? And death?  If I ever have kids, and I'd like to someday, I'd want to keep them safe too.
WIL0002196	But it's pretty certain he's dead, right?  So you must have a pretty good reason for staying here.
WIL0002197	Great. Can you answer some questions for me?  Wow, you have unusual hair for a ghoul.
WIL0002198	I take great care of my appearance. I was a performer on The Strip for quite a long time before I came her to be with Jason and the Followers.
WIL0002199	Back then, my looks kept me employed...and busy...and near the bright lights and interesting people...but I shouldn't go on about that.
WIL0002200	I'll just say, thank you, as a lady should.  I really think it's my best asset after my smile.  Don't you agree?
WIL0002201	Oh, yes, absolutely.  I'm looking for someone.  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL0002202	<laughs nervously>  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL0002203	I'd say your hair is your best asset, since you're asking. I don't see the charm in rotting teeth.
WIL0002204	Well, your manners aren't the best, but you're honest.  What can I do for you?
WIL0002205	You mean Jefferson isn't here?
WIL0002206	I told him that Jefferson had gone out into the Mojave, as other Followers have done before him, but that he had never returned.
WIL0002207	We assumed he had died.
WIL0002208	Ok, thanks.  Why are you here?  Why didn't you go off in the rockets with Jason and the others?
WIL0002209	I missed the launch.  I was away in the Wasteland and I don't know, really, what to do with myself...now.
WIL0002210	I'd like to go with him.
WIL0002211	But I don't know if he'll take me.  I haven't the courage to ask him.
WIL0002212	Ok, thanks. What is this place?  Why are you here?
WIL0002213	This is the home of the Bright Followers.  Jason Bright is the leader.
WIL0002214	I'm tired of Jason, and this place, and the Followers and would love to run away with him.
WIL0002215	But, I don't know if he'll take me I haven't the courage to ask him.
WIL0002216	Do you know why he keeps coming back everyday if Jefferson is dead?
WIL0002217	No, I don't know why he keeps coming back.  But, I like seeing him so I haven't tried to make him stop.
WIL0002218	When do you expect him today?
WIL0002219	I really don't know. Some days I don't see him until three or four in the afternoon.
WIL0002220	I do know he stays out at that camp by the gate.  There's a bed. He sleeps there.
WIL0002221	Ok, thanks.  Bye.
WIL0002222	I'm looking for someone.  Have you seen a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat?
WIL0002223	Yes, he comes by everyday to see me.  Well, not me, he's looking for that Jefferson fellow.
WIL0002224	But I like to think he's looking for me. I have such a crush on him. He's so big and tall and handsome.
WIL0002225	Would you like me to talk to him for you? I can ask him to take you with him when he leaves.
WIL0002226	Yes, that would be wonderful.
WIL0002227	Thanks for your help. Goodbye.
WIL0002228	You killed him?  Well, fuck you!
WIL0002229	Oh, what's your name?  I'll be sure to ask him when I speak to him.
WIL0002230	It's Jessica, and thank you for helping me.
WIL0002231	Ok, thanks. Why are you hanging around out here?
WIL0002232	He says he'll take you with him when he leaves.  Great news, huh?
WIL0002233	Here, please, take this.  It's not much, but it's all I have.  I'd like to give it to you as a thank you for what you've done.
WIL0002234	[Lie] He doesn't want anything to do with you. I tried to get him to change his mind. Sorry.
WIL0002235	Thanks for trying...can you leave me alone now? Just go away.
WIL0002236	Do you have it?  Will you give it to me?
WIL0002237	She's madly in love with you and wants to run away with you.
WIL0002238	You might want to consider asking her to go away with you.  I think she likes you.
WIL0002239	[Lie] She says the Bright Followers want you to leave here.  Now.
WIL0002240	She does! And she's so pretty. She's got that great smile and that hair! You should go for it.
WIL0002241	You're right. I should.
WIL0002242	So are you going to take her with you when you go?
WIL0002243	Willow told me you wouldn't say much.  She was right.
WIL0002244	But, he's dead.  You're wasting your time. Are you going to keep standing here hoping he'll show up?
WIL0002245	Yeah, I am.  What of it?
WIL0002246	I saw the note. You must be desperate for the money to keep hanging around like this.
WIL0002247	Leave.  It would be the best thing for everyone involved.
WIL0002248	Would he follow me and obey my commands?
WIL0002249	They don't want you here. She doesn't want you here.
WIL0002250	What is with you? Just give it up already. Jefferson's dead.
WIL0002251	You're probably right.
WIL0002252	Are you telling me you won't go? She's asked me to take care of you if you won't agree to leave.
WIL0002253	I won't.
WIL0002254	I think it's time for me to do something about you since you are being so uncooperative.
WIL0002255	I'll give you some time to think about it.
WIL0002256	Let me take him, huh? He knows Willow and she likes him.  He'll be happy with us.
WIL0002257	I don't have the money with me.  I'll have to come back to pay you.
WIL0002258	I know about Jefferson and the bounty you've lost.  You can use the money. Let me have him.
WIL0002259	I know about the reward for taking him back, but he's dead. You're never going to see that money.
WIL0002260	You have Jessica now, you don't need J.T. any more, right? Let me take him.
WIL0002261	I have to return to pay you.  I don't have the caps with me.
WIL0002262	You've given it your best shot. You've done everything you could. You should just leave now.
WIL0002263	You're right.  I should.
WIL0002264	Forget it.  I don't want to do this afterall.
WIL0002265	Later
WIL0002266	Nothing, I just thought you might like to talk about your problems. Willow warned me you were quiet.
WIL0002267	Huh. That's an odd response. Most people are proud of their animals. You do like him don't you?
WIL0002268	Is he smart? He seems well trained.
WIL0002269	I've heard about the ghouls outside of Novac.  I know where they are.
WIL0002270	You have?  That's great.  Can we go there?
WIL0002271	The Bright Followers aren't there any more.  Well, most of them that I know about anyway.
WIL0002272	I don't think that matters.  It doesn't mean that he hasn't gone there looking for his friend.
WIL0002273	Let's go find your friend. What's his name?
WIL0002274	His name.  Yeah, well, I just call him The Big Guy.  He never told me his name in all the time we were together. Weird, isn't it?
WIL0002275	So, I guess you'll need his description. He's very tall, and he wears a cowboy hat with a feather.  Oh, and he's a ghoul.
WIL0002276	Thanks for filling me in.  We'll check it out if I get the time to do it.
WIL0002277	Oh, alright.  I hope there's something to find when we finally get there.
WIL0002278	Yes.  We can go there and look for Chester.
WIL0002279	We can? Right now? Well, let's go.
WIL0002280	Oh, and you'll want to know who you're looking for, right?  He's a big, tall ghoul and he always wears a cowboy hat with a feather in it.
WIL0002281	I don't know his name, if you can believe it.  I just called him The Big Guy the whole time we were together. He has a dog with him named J.T.
WIL0002282	Eventually.  We'll get there when we get there.
WIL0002283	Okay, I understand.  I'll try to be patient.
WIL0002284	I agree.  I think we should go there now.
WIL0002285	Great.  Let's go.
WIL0002286	It's true.  But he's probably left by now.  There's no need for us to rush to get there.
WIL0002287	Fine.  I sure hope there's some trace of him when we finally get there.
WIL0002288	I want you to go home for awhile...
WIL0002289	I want you to go home and wait for me there.
WIL0002290	I want you to go to the suite at the Lucky 38 and wait for me there.
WIL0002291	I want you to consider this your home.
WIL0002293	We're moving, J.T.  This is our new home.
WIL0002294	Bark, bark!
WIL0002295	Things are going to get tough around here, really Hardcore.  Be prepared. (Set Essential)
WIL0002296	Watch yourself, J.T.  Things are going to get tough. You could get hurt. (Set Unessential)
WIL0002297	Whine.
WIL0002298	Forget it. You're good.
WIL0002299	I want you to follow me again.
WIL0002300	J.T. while you are following me I don't want you to attack anything.  At all. Understood?
WIL0002301	J.T. I'd like you to fight with me again.
WIL0002302	Good dog!
WIL0002303	You're a good looking fella, arenft you?
WIL0002304	Pant, pant.
WIL0002305	Wish I had a dog biscuit for you, buddy.
WIL0002306	Pant, pant, pant.
WIL0002307	Would you like a dog biscuit, boy?
WIL0002308	Whine!
WIL0002309	Stupid mutt, you don't know what I'm saying, do you?
WIL0002310	growl...
WIL0002311	Pant, pant, pant
WIL0002312	No, I wasn't wondering that. He would have been asking about ghoul activity in the area.
WIL0002313	Oh, that.  Lately there's been talk of ghouls just a bit west of Novac up in the mountains.
WIL0002314	Has a tall ghoul in a cowboy hat been in here asking questions?
WIL0002315	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs if that's what you're wondering.
WIL0002316	I'd like to rent the deluxe bungalow on the end.
WIL0002317	I can't afford 150 caps right now.
WIL0002318	Great! Here ya go.
WIL0002319	Did a big, tall ghoul in a cowboy hat come in asking about the ghouls up at REPCONN?
WIL0002320	I'd like to rent the deluxe bungalow.
WIL0002321	Did a ghoul in a cowboy hat with a feather come and ask you some questions?
WIL0002322	Who sent you? I ain't talking. They tried to get me to talk before, but I didn't say nothing, and don't aim to now, by gum.
WIL0002323	You bastards.
WIL0002324	Stopping to talk to me was a big mistake...it makes you a better target.
WIL0002325	Give me what you've stolen from Willow and I'll let you walk away from here.
WIL0002326	I thought for sure one of us was gonna die back there.
WIL0002327	Whoa! That was a workout, wasn't it?
WIL0002328	I hate it when you get beat up like that during a fight.
WIL0002329	Damn legion!
WIL0002330	No, no, no, no, no. I..I'm out of here!
WIL0002331	No, I...I don't want to die, I don't want to die!
WIL0002332	Boy am I glad to see you. I have been so bored.
WIL0002333	Hey, I'm glad you're back.
WIL0002334	I hope you had some fun while you were gone.
WIL0002335	I missed you.
WIL0002336	I don't want you to use your mask when we are in irradiated areas (she won't put on her mask).
WIL0002337	Use your own mask when we're in irradiated areas (she'll use her mask)
WIL0002338	<Turn off Radiation comments and mask>
WIL0002339	<Turn on Radiation comments and mask>
WIL0002340	I'm all ears.  What's the plan.
WIL0002341	Okay, but I do not like being Deathclaw bait.
WIL0002342	Let's get outta here.
WIL0002343	Pant, pant
WIL0002344	Sorry,  I'm not gonna do it. Remember? We talked about it?
WIL0002345	Great!  I'll just sit back and take it easy.
WIL0002346	Great. I love, love my gun.
WIL0002347	Great idea.  I love it.
WIL0002348	Sure.  Do you want me to get really, really close?
WIL0002349	Great.  I like the company.
WIL0002350	Sure, what do you want to talk about?
WIL0002351	Oh, flank, flank, flank.  I hate it back there. You're just so far away.
WIL0002352	Alright, if that's what you want.
WIL0002353	No, I won't trade with you. <laughs> Gotcha.
WIL0002354	Trade? Ha! You wanna give me something heavy to carry, don't ya?
WIL0002355	Yeah, of course.
WIL0002356	Okay. I'll be right here. Waiting. For you.
WIL0002357	You're leaving me here alone? I'm sure there's something we can do together.
WIL0002358	Okay!  I'll keep myself busy while you're gone.
WIL0002359	Okay! I love you. See you soon.
WIL0002360	Okay.  I'll see you later.
WIL0002361	<sigh> Why do I have to miss all the fun.
WIL0002362	Let's talk about your outfits we put together in the bungalow.
WIL0002363	Okay, which one?
WIL0002364	I'd like you to change into Outfit 1.
WIL0002365	I'd like to do something with Outfit 1.
WIL0002366	Please take off Outfit 1.
WIL0002367	I'd like you to change into Outfit 2.
WIL0002368	I'd like to do something with Outfit 2.
WIL0002369	Please take off Outfit 2.
WIL0002370	I'd like you to change into Outfit 3.
WIL0002371	I'd like to do something with Outfit 3.
WIL0002372	Please take off Outfit 3.
WIL0002373	I'd like you to change into Outfit 4.
WIL0002374	Great, I'd love to.
WIL0002375	I'd like to do something with Outfit 4.
WIL0002376	Please take off Outfit 4.
WIL0002377	I want you to change into your intimate moments things.
WIL0002378	I'd like to do something with your intimate moment things.
WIL0002379	Please take off your intimate moment things.
WIL0002380	I'd like you to put on your permanent wear items.
WIL0002381	We can only set up your permanent items when we're in the bungalow.
WIL0002382	I'd like you to put on your Sleepwear.
WIL0002383	I'd like to do something with your sleepwear.
WIL0002384	Please take off your sleepwear.
WIL0002385	I'd like you to put on your Swimwear.
WIL0002386	I'd like to do something with your swimwear.
WIL0002387	Please take off your swimwear.
WIL0002388	See ya, later.
WIL0002390	Hi, have you been missing me?
WIL0002391	How ya doin'?
WIL0002392	Bark
WIL0002393	How ya doin?
WIL0002394	<Yawn>
WIL0002395	Do you have my drink?
WIL0002396	I am so hungry!  Can we make that meal now?
WIL0002397	I like it up here. It reminds me of home.
WIL0002398	Pfft!  It's hot!
WIL0002399	Radiation. Always good for a few laughs, huh?
WIL0002400	Ugh! Radiation!  Are you set for chems?  I might have some extras in my scavenged stuff.
WIL0002401	Hope you didn't mind the big kiss.
WIL0002402	These guys make me nervous.  Stay close, okay?
WIL0002403	So, we're back here again.
WIL0002404	So, how's Lucy today?
WIL0002405	Can we leave soon? I'll be a lot happier when we get out of here.
WIL0002406	Good job killing that Nipton-destroying Legion scum. I hope you took his stupid hat.
WIL0002407	It's beautiful up here, isn't it?
WIL0002408	I wish there was something we could do to help out around here.
WIL0002409	I'm glad we're helping these guys out.
WIL0002410	It's such a waste.  The whole town just gone.
WIL0002411	This place is so big.
WIL0002412	I hope you had fun.  I'm still mad at you.  And it'll be a couple of days before I'm done being mad at you.
WIL0002413	Hi there, handsome!
WIL0002414	It's depressing here, isn't it?
WIL0002415	You've never said anything about it. Do you like the presents I've been giving you in the mailbox?
WIL0002416	Boone's story about his wife is so sad.  I'm glad you're helping him.
WIL0002417	My brother, Chuck, wanted to fight for the NCR.
WIL0002418	Whatever you did for Boone at Bitter Springs, it was good.  He seems much better now.
WIL0002419	I'm not sure what you did to Boone at Bitter Springs, but he seems worse than ever.  Weren't we trying to help him?
WIL0002420	Hey, we got a lead on the guy in the checkered coat!  That was a good break, huh?
WIL0002421	Hi! Can I do something for you...or to you?
WIL0002422	Hi lover, need something?
WIL0002423	Mr. House isn't asking for much is he?  Just kill the entire BOS.  I think he's been a machine for so long he's forgotten what it's like to be human.
WIL0002424	So you're definitely going to work against the NCR?
WIL0002425	I know you like Caesar, but did you have to fix his howitzer for him?
WIL0002426	I don't think bombing the monorail is going to send the NCR running back to California, do you?
WIL0002427	Tell me what you want and I'll do it.
WIL0002428	Are you planning to ally with the NCR, is that why you're running these errands for them?
WIL0002429	Hey, Bud. What's up?
WIL0002430	Hey, Hon. What's up?
WIL0002431	You're wearing the suit.  He's dead isn't he?  Good.  He deserved it.
WIL0002432	So Benny's dead.  I'm glad. He deserved it.
WIL0002433	Hey, you've got a plan, don't you?
WIL0002434	Do you have a minute? I have something I want to talk to you about.
WIL0002435	Don't you look gorgeous?
WIL0002436	Hey! How's it going?
WIL0002437	I can't believe what they did to this town.
WIL0002438	The Nightkin are amazing!  The way they sneak...it gives them such an advantage.
WIL0002439	This place is kind of weird.
WIL0002440	I wouldn't mind leaving soon.  It's kind of quiet up here.
WIL0002441	Are we going to have a drink?
WIL0002442	NCR as far as the eye can see.  You know, I feel right at home here.
WIL0002443	What's next?  A little gambling?  A little drinking?
WIL0002444	These guys don't seem so bad, huh?  They aren't high on chems. They aren't  trying to eat us. It could be a lot worse.
WIL0002445	I feel like we're walking around inside a tin can in here.
WIL0002446	The legion made quite a mess here, didn't they?
WIL0002447	This place is a mess.  You doin' okay? Think there's enough radiation around here?
WIL0002448	This is quite a show isn't it?
WIL0002449	What's next?  Gambling? A show? A drink?
WIL0002450	You did it!  You killed Caesar!
WIL0002451	Hey, I could use a hand over here!
WIL0002452	Veronica, I've heard you guys can shoot lasers from your eyes, is it true?
WIL0002453	Hi, my name's Willow. What do you do around here?
WIL0002454	I want...a dress.
WIL0002455	Boone, tell me about Carla.  Where did you meet her?
WIL0002456	Boone, have you figured out yet how I feel about you?
WIL0002457	Boone, you were very brave to do what you did for Carla.  I admire you for it. Not every man could have done that. You're a true hero.
WIL0002458	Um, I like you a lot, Boone.  I was hoping that maybe after we're out of this mess we could get to know each other a lot better.  What do you say?
WIL0002459	Boone, you can't blame yourself for Bitter Springs. You aren't responsible for what happened there. You're only one man and you're a good man.
WIL0002460	Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California.
WIL0002461	Ooh, got any juicy gossip?
WIL0002462	You haven't answered me about the eye lasers.  Can you? Can you shoot things with your eyes?
WIL0002463	Veronica, about the eye lasers. Come on, tell me about them.  Please?
WIL0002464	Veronica! I've got it! The eye lasers are weapons you carry or wear like helmets! They aren't IN your eyes; that was just dumb.
WIL0002465	Hi, Sarah.  I'm crashing the party.  I think we'll have a lot of fun.
WIL0002466	I haven't been doing it very long, but I like to punch stuff too.  Maybe not as much as you do, but it is fun.
WIL0002467	You aren't trusted here profligate.
WIL0002468	How's it goin?
WIL0002469	Careful! They got spies all over!
WIL0002470	You doin okay?
WIL0002471	Where'd you come from?
WIL0002472	Veronica, we have to do something about your outfit.  It's tragic. You look like a potato with a face.
WIL0002473	So this is home, huh? I can see why you like to get out.
WIL0002474	You are going to think I'm such a coward right now, but I am very scared. This place is so spooky.
WIL0002475	This is not a gift shop.
WIL0002476	Maybe it's just me, but don't you want to walk right up to the Nightkin and stare right at them to see what they'll do?
WIL0002477	Worst gift shop ever.
WIL0002478	*Screams* What was that?  Did you hear that?  Sorry, I am so jumpy. I do not like it in here.
WIL0002479	Of all the places you've taken me, this, well, not my favorite.
WIL0002480	It's great to be among NCR folks again.  I feel right at home.
WIL0002481	Hmpf.  Who does she think she's impressing with this place? I'm not impressed.  You're not, are you?
WIL0002482	Should we be searching for survivors?  Maybe somebody managed to hide somewhere.
WIL0002483	I hate vaults.  They are so creepy.
WIL0002484	That Haversham is crazy.  Who'd want to be a ghoul?
WIL0002485	This place hasn't been totally picked over. There's still some good stuff left to take out of here.
WIL0002486	Bright is nuts too.  It's like we've stumbled into crazy town and he's the mayor.
WIL0002487	They were thorough.  It sure  looks like everyone's been wiped out.
WIL0002488	I'll take a cave over a vault any day.  Caves usually have critters, which are not creepy.  Vaults...creepy.
WIL0002489	I am so glad you're with me.  I'd hate to be in here alone.
WIL0002490	Those ferals are tough!
WIL0002491	I hate Deathclaws.  I peed my pants!
WIL0002492	I hope Dr. Henry can fix Rex.
WIL0002493	Dr. Henry is an interesting guy, isn't he?
WIL0002494	Invisible Nightstalkers. I wonder if that could ever happen to a human?
WIL0002495	Do you ever wonder what it was like to come to a place like this before The Great War?
WIL0002496	That Haversham is crazy.  Who'd want to be a ghoul? Ah!  Oh, Raul, I'm so sorry!
WIL0002497	Oof.  It's cold in here.
WIL0002498	I've got nothing against the girls.  But I think, if someone has a girl of their own, they don't belong with a prostitute.
WIL0002499	This is a twitchy bunch. I don't trust them.
WIL0002500	We should be ready for anything in here, you know?
WIL0002501	I hope you think it's okay to scavenge for stuff in a prison.  Don't give me away if I grab something, okay?
WIL0002502	Remember those guys that took my stuff?  This is the place Stan talked about in his note.
WIL0002503	I can't wait to see what we'll find. Do you think it's the treasure?
WIL0002504	I wonder what it will be?  Something really exciting I'm sure.  Why else would it have been hidden for so long?
WIL0002505	You know what this place needs?  More Sunset Sarsaparilla lamps.
WIL0002506	The robot, game thing?  He gives me the creeps.
WIL0002507	Eh, poor guy.
WIL0002508	Did you see the car over there on display?  It's on display because it has bullet holes in it.  My hat has bullet holes in it.
WIL0002509	I'm in love with that cowboy robot.
WIL0002510	I like these guys.
WIL0002511	Lakelurks!  That sound they make is incredible.  Does it vibrate through your whole head, too?
WIL0002512	Hey, does that robot cook for us?
WIL0002513	We haven't seen any kids. Do you think they took them?
WIL0002514	You doing okay?  Radiation!  What a pain.
WIL0002515	Okay, I have a question.  Am I starting to glow?
WIL0002516	I always wondered what it would feel like to be a ghoul...I think we might find out soon.
WIL0002517	I always imagined a vault would be a terrible place to live. You know, cuz deserted vaults are so creepy.
WIL0002518	It's really nice in here.  Way better than I'd imagined a vault could be.
WIL0002519	Fiends, ugh.  I thought they smelled bad outside.
WIL0002520	Looks like everyone of these guys uses chems. Look at their eyes, their really messed up.
WIL0002521	I don't like vaults.  Even when they're crowded like this one.
WIL0002522	This place is enormous.
WIL0002523	Ever heard of toilet wine?  Inmates make it.  I wonder if anyone makes it here?
WIL0002524	This is quite a show, isn't it?
WIL0002525	I used to hate ferals until one day I found one with a teddy bear.  Now I feel sorry for them. Although, I still hate to get into a fight with them.
WIL0002526	I wonder what happened here. They must have set up all these traps for a reason.
WIL0002527	There are a lot of dead ghouls in here.  Hey, you don't think the ferals killed them, do you?
WIL0002528	This place seems kind of cruel if you ask me.  Well, I'll make an exception for geckos and Deathclaws.
WIL0002529	Robots, traps...I wonder what else we'll find in here?  Ooh! Maybe we'll find a safe filled with some really great loot!
WIL0002530	It's kinda dreary up here.
WIL0002531	I hope our mystery man turns out to be worth all of this.
WIL0002532	How could any woman run a place like this? It's so barbaric?
WIL0002533	Uh!
WIL0002534	Nice.
WIL0002535	Ugh!  Dammit!  That...really....hurts!
WIL0002536	Uh, dammit.
WIL0002537	Groan.
WIL0002538	Well, that was a nice nap.  Now what?
WIL0002539	Damn Deathclaws!
WIL0002540	Uh.  My head.
WIL0002541	Tell me about Chester.  Where is this guy you were traveling with?
WIL0002542	He wouldn't say much. Mostly when I asked him something all he'd say was,"Not your business." But, I did get a few details out of him.
WIL0002543	Apparently he has a brother, or maybe it's a friend, who's a ghoul, who came here to join some cult.  The Bright Followers or something.  Near Novac.
WIL0002544	He's going there to find the brother, or friend, to take him home again, I guess. That was all I could get out of him.  He wasn't much of a talker.
WIL0002545	Thank you so very much. I must get ready to go now.
WIL0002546	We're hanging out here for a little while before we move on.
WIL0002547	Yes, I can see that.
WIL0002548	I'm no threat.  I'm not feral.
WIL0002549	Where are you two headed?
WIL0002550	We're headed back out to where he came from; some place in the NCR.  I hope everything turns out okay.
WIL0002551	I tried to talk him into going back to New Vegas with me or maybe settling down in the Mojave somewhere but he wasn't interested so off we go.
WIL0002552	That's quite an outfit you're wearing. Does that offer you much protection on the road?
WIL0002553	It's all I had when I left the Bright Followers.  It's one of the outfits I used to wear when I performed on The Strip.
WIL0002554	Besides, he likes the way I look in it and I've got him to keep me safe. What more does a girl need?
WIL0002555	I've talked to him.
WIL0002556	I didn't think we'd ever find you.  Do you still have Chester, my teddy bear?
WIL0002557	Willow and I are traveling together and we've tracked you down to see if you have her teddy bear.
WIL0002558	You know that girl, Jessica, the Bright Follower? The one that waits to see you everyday?
WIL0002559	I hear you're looking for a man named Jefferson.
WIL0002560	I'd be interested in buying J.T. from you for 250 caps if you'd be willing to discuss it.
WIL0002561	I have the money with me to pay for J.T.
WIL0002562	That's a good looking dog you have.
WIL0002563	smooch.  That's a big hug and a kiss thank you.

WIL0002567	Put outfits for Willow inside this wardrobe via this menu.  Once you have put items into the "drawers" you will be able to manage them in a topic in Willow's dialogue. An empty drawer will leave Willow naked if you choose that outfit in dialogue.
WIL0002568	PERMANENT OUTFIT: You MUST do the following to set it up: Dress Willow ONLY in the specific items you want her to wear at all times. Come to the menu and select Permanent Outfit. When you want to change it repeat that process. The script will return the old outfit to your inventory.
WIL0002569	Your barter skill has been raised +10.
WIL0002570	Congratulations!  Willow has taught you to smooth talk your way to better deals.
WIL0002571	While Willow is your companion you gain +10 points to your Speech skill and +1 to Charisma.
WIL0002572	Looks like you've received Willow's sweetroll!  Congratulations! Willow's secret recipe has given you the ability to take 50% less radiation when consuming irradiated food and drink.
WIL0002573	Boneyard
WIL0002574	12  Empty Soda Bottles (they have to be Nuka Cola Bottles NOT Sunset Sarsaparilla Bottles)
WIL0002575	12  Bottle Caps  (no, not Star Bottle Caps even though my mom named it Nuka-Star Coffee)
WIL0002576	8  Pinyon Nuts
WIL0002577	So I did the math and this is what I need to make as much Nuka-Star coffee as I would love to have for a whole month.
WIL0002578	I think 3 coffees per week is enough.  If I drink more than 1 per day I shake like a leaf! And I don't drink one every day.
WIL0002579	I wonder if the legend of the Star Bottle Cap treasure is true?  And if it is, how much treasure there is and where it might be?  Would it be caps or would it be other things?  Gold or jewelry or...what?  Is it buried and is there a map somewhere that you can find?  I wonder if it did exist once upon a time, but someone already found it and it's long gone now. It would be a scavenger's and adventurer's dream come true to find something like that!  Much better treasure than the stuff I've found before, like those dog toys from before the war that still squeak or the dynamite we found as kids (we were kids; it was treasure to us) to blow up that car on the edge of town (boy did we get into trouble for that!).

WIL0002581	The General Store in GoodSprings
WIL0002582	She may need additional help getting enough of an ingredient to make an item sometimes. For example, she does not buy the expensive drink ingredients for her Nuka-Star coffee recipe, but scavenges for those.
WIL0002583	Willow has arrived home.
WIL0002584	Willow is set to be Essential by default. She cannot die in Hardcore mode.  You may change this in her Tactics menu when you are in Hardcore mode.
WIL0002585	J.T. is set to be Unessential by default.  He CAN die in Hardcore mode.  You may set him to be essential in his Tactics Menu when you are in Hardcore mode.
WIL0002586	You cannot give her a present more than once a day.
WIL0002587	To reach 100 points, the task(s) you do will give you points (if you do them in a way that pleases her), but you might also like to give her presents, as they make her happy as well. Here is a list of things guaranteed to make her happy (a list will also be added to your Pipboy)...
WIL0002588	To become best friends you need to reach 100 points and complete a task that shows her just how much you want to be her best friend. You should be able to figure out the task by thinking about the things you've learned about her so far.  There are a few choices available to you.
WIL0002589	You've helped Willow recover her stolen items and she is very grateful.  She now considers you a friend and you have unlocked new things to do with her in dialogue.
WIL0002590	I'm ambushing now...
WIL0002591	I'd like to clean up the mattress now.
WIL0002592	I'd like to sleep here now.
WIL0002593	The are many benefits of gaining her friendship and you will discover most of them over time through dialogue with her as your relationship with her progresses.  You will also receive notes in your Pipboy at important points in your journey with her.
WIL0002594	Your goal in this quest is to get Willow to like you so much that she wants to be your best friend forever (BFF). This point is reached when you've done a few specific tasks for Willow and have gained 100 points towards making her happy.  You will know when you've made her happy or unhappy by a sound that plays when points are awarded or taken away from you. Once Willow has joined you, there will be an item added to your apparel inventory that you can equip, at any time, to get the number of points you have at that time.
WIL0002595	Welcome to She Likes You, She Likes You Not...
WIL0002596	You've found 20 pencils for Willow! You're half way there!
WIL0002597	Enjoy your new canine companion!
WIL0002598	The Big Guy has given you J.T.'s squeaky baseball.  He likes the squeak and will return to you promptly if you use it. This stays in your possession when he is following Willow and continues to work for you.
WIL0002599	Also, J.T. will be able to follow Willow if you wish.  Tell him to do so in conversation and he can follow her just as if he is following you.
WIL0002600	You will not be able to fire him, but only send him off to wait for you. You will be able to set a house marker for him or send him to the Lucky 38 suite to wait.
WIL0002601	You are now a proud dog owner and as such J.T. will be your responsibility until he dies.
WIL0002602	The two of you successfully convinced the doctor to heal her during your visit.  Congratulations!  You've received two doctor visits for the price of one.  Expect this same service wherever you take her throughout the Mojave.  You two are just that good at barter and persuasion.
WIL0002603	Willow went with you to see the doctor.
WIL0002604	Willow's health has been fully restored.
WIL0002605	You've failed this task.  Willow didn't not like that answer.  You'll need to do one of the other two tasks to get to be Best Friends with Willow.
WIL0002606	Don't forget and have fun!
WIL0002607	The latest intel I have from my investigator is that Jefferson is heading for a small town south of New Vegas. There's a cult near there led by a ghoul named Jason Bright.  Jefferson thinks he will be safe hidden among the other zombies.  We bribed his lover for this information and we believe it to be reliable.
WIL0002608	J.T. has arrived at the Lucky 38.
WIL0002609	You've received Willow's BFF Sweetroll Perk.
WIL0002610	I'd like to clean up the campfire now.
WIL0002611	I'd like to use the campfire.
WIL0002612	I do not detect bed locations in the game.  It is up to you to choose where she will sleep.
WIL0002613	Willow's sleeping is for roleplaying purposes.  You will not be able to fast travel away from her while she sleeps or she will follow you because of the way NV has set up fast travel and companions.  I could not change the set up successfully.  You can ask her to sleep and she will sleep for one minute real time.  You may talk to her at any time to wake her up.
WIL0002614	2) You must clean up the bedroll after she gets up or you will get bloated save games.
WIL0002615	1) Do not fast travel away from Willow while she sleeps
WIL0002616	Willow Beginning of Combat Timer has kicked in...
WIL0002617	Willow's training has taught you to charm traders for better deals.  You've received the Smooth Talker Perk which adds +10 to your Barter Skill.  This is a permanent increase to your skills.  Willow doesn't take the Perk with her if she is fired.
WIL0002618	You've received medical care from a professional and Willow will benefit from this as well.  Her health will return in a few seconds.
WIL0002619	While she is your companion you gain +10 points to your Speech skill and +1 to Charisma.
WIL0002620	J.T. has arrived home.
WIL0002621	for Nuka-Star Coffee for Willow. You can rehire her now.
WIL0002622	Congratulations! You've found all the ingredients
WIL0002623	Willow has arrived in the suite at the Lucky 38.
WIL0002624	Willow has arrived at the Mojave Outpost.
WIL0002625	Willow was successful. So successful that Veronica spent several hours with Willow and taught her many useful tricks, moves and attacks. Willow's Unarmed skills have increased.
WIL0002626	Congratulations! You've found all the ingredients for Willow. Return to her.

WIL0002650	I think that's it.  I'm not sure we could carry much more than this!
WIL0002651	I'd love to have a garden gnome too, but we can find one another day.
WIL0002652	You're a good looking fella, aren't you?
WIL0002653	Bright is nuts too.  It's like we've stumbled into crazy town and he's the major.
WIL0002654	Shit!  You look like you could use a hand!
WIL0002655	Thinking about having a little fun, huh?
WIL0002656	How was it?  I bet something interesting happened.
WIL0002657	Have you been travelling for a long time?
WIL0002658	I hope we find the toys. I'm embarrassed to admit this and know it sounds stupid, but I do love them.  Thanks again for helping me.
WIL0002659	<yawn> I sure could go for some coffee.
WIL0002660	I'm having fun, are you having fun?
WIL0002661	This is a nice spot.  I like it here.
WIL0002662	Are we getting ready for a fight?
WIL0002663	Okay, I'm ready for anything.
WIL0002664	Thanks again for your help.
WIL0002665	You want me to put my foot where? There. Uh, I can't get it straight!
WIL0002666	Ow!  That hurt!
WIL0002667	Oh, I like that one!  I'm gonna be using that one a lot!
WIL0002668	Thanks.  That was great.
WIL0002669	Yes, Willow?  Is there something going on?
WIL0002670	Now that we have a house you should know where you're sleeping.  This is the bed you should use.
WIL0002671	It's great.  Thanks.
WIL0002672	Now that we have a new house you have a new bed.  Here it is.
WIL0002673	Let's go to Novac. We can ask about ghouls in the area and about your friend. What's his name?
WIL0002674	Thanks for filling me in.  We'll check it out if we make it close to Novac in our travels.
WIL0002675	Stupid mutt, you don't what I'm saying, do you?
WIL0002676	Yawn.  That was nice.
WIL0002677	Yawn.  It's so early.
WIL0002678	How ya feeling?  Rested?
WIL0002679	Think I'll have some coffee.
WIL0002680	Hmm.  That was good.
WIL0002681	I'm very excited about the whole punching thing.
WIL0002682	I guess we have that in common then.
WIL0002683	Yes, right now, after all, you know so much and she wants to learn. Seems perfect.
WIL0002684	I want you to teach Willow some of your punching skills.
WIL0002685	You want me to put my foot where? There? Uh, I can't get it straight.
WIL0002686	Ow! That hurt!
WIL0002687	Thanks, Ranger Andy.
WIL0002688	I grew up in Oregon.  My family runs a motel that lots of caravans and sometimes travelers come through.
WIL0002689	Oh, so you collect toys like I do, that's so awesome.  Did you like Moira when you saw her?  She's so unusual.
WIL0002690	What did you think of that guy with the star bottle cap story?
WIL0002691	I don't believe in the treasure.  But I'd say pick up the caps when you see them...just in case.
WIL0002692	Let's talk about our housing situation...
WIL0002693	Okay...
WIL0002694	Okay, I don't have a problem with that.  This place seems great.
WIL0002695	No, not really.  I don't usually do that indoors.  Do you?
WIL0002696	Willow, can you do me a big favor?  When I draw my weapon would you draw yours too?
WIL0002697	Sure, I can do that for you if it makes you happy.
WIL0002698	Okay. If you want me to do that again, though, just let me know.
WIL0002699	You can stop taking your weapon out when I do. I liked it for awhile, but I'm tired of it now.
WIL0002700	<Scream> What was that?  Did you hear that?  Sorry, I am so jumpy. I do not like it in here.
WIL0002701	Hiya, robo-pup.
WIL0002702	I have a Dinky the Dinosaur Souvenir for you...
WIL0002703	Here.  I want you to see Chester before I tuck him away somewhere safe.
WIL0002704	You want Chester back don't you?
WIL0002705	Yeah, I do.
WIL0002706	He's pretty old and beat up isn't he?
WIL0002707	How about you sleep here tonight?
WIL0002708	howl
WIL0002709	Yes, Willow?
WIL0002710	I wasn't paying any attention to what you were doing!  I bet I could have gotten you a better deal from that trader.
WIL0002711	If you're interested I could teach you how to get better deals from traders. Do you want to?
WIL0002712	Let's do that some other time, okay? (Barter Perk - Yes Later)
WIL0002713	Okay, we can do it whenever you want.
WIL0002714	Okay, that sounds great.  Do you want to do it right now? (Barter Perk - Yes)
WIL0002715	Yeah, let's do it right now. So there are three things that are most important for you to know..
WIL0002716	Will you give me some pointers for getting a good bargain from a trader?
WIL0002717	And that's really all there is to it.
WIL0002718	Would you mind cooking something up for me?
WIL0002719	He's crazy.
WIL0002720	Do you think those funny hats the Fiends wear is supposed to scare us?
WIL0002721	Why are you following me, J.T.?
WIL0002722	Yes, I have a present for you. It's a sweetroll. I made it for you special because we're best friends now and I want to show you how much I like you.
WIL0002723	I've been thinking about all the things you've done for me and I'd like to do something for you in return.
WIL0002724	I'd like to cook for you more often.  Anything you want that I can make. You'll need to bring me the ingredients but I'll do the rest.
WIL0002725	You can carry your weapon openly again.
WIL0002726	Hmm, that was good.  Ready to go?
WIL0002727	That's a difficult question to answer, Willow.
WIL0002728	I was shot in the head. Before the injury I had a job and knew the place. After, I didn't know it.
WIL0002729	It happened in Goodsprings and the doc there patched me up, but he couldn't fix my memory.
WIL0002730	No, I'm still trying to figure that out. You'll be with me while I do that.
WIL0002731	You have something you want to talk to me about?
WIL0002732	I've heard of some traders that I'd like to visit and shop with to get ingredients from for cooking.
WIL0002733	I thought we could go to see them when we were out traveling around doing things. I don't want to go by myself.
WIL0002734	Sure, if we're in the area we can go. Who did you have in mind?
WIL0002735	The guy at the Westside Coop for one. But not just there.  I've made a list of who I'm interested in going to see. Here.
WIL0002736	Great!  I haven't been shopping in such a long time!  I will need caps to do it so I might need to borrow some if I'm running short.
WIL0002737	That was...surprising.
WIL0002738	You do! A present? I love presents!
WIL0002739	Oh, no, I didn't.  I'd like it if we could be more than friends one day.
WIL0002740	Well, once in awhile is alright, but I don't want you to make a habit of it, okay?
WIL0002741	Well, yes, I find it annoying.  Could you stop singing.  I'd appreciate it.
WIL0002742	Alright. If that's what you want.
WIL0002743	No, that's not it at all. You don't need to apologize for singing. I like it when you sing.
WIL0002744	Oh, well, thank you.
WIL0002745	Oh, nevermind.  I don't want to get into it.  Just keep doing what you're doing.
WIL0002746	I am.  I missed him when The Big Guy and I split up, but it's not the same as having my own dog.  He does belong to you after all.
WIL0002747	Oh.  I thought you'd be thrilled.
WIL0002748	Really? Sorry to disappoint you, but I want my own dog.  One that is loyal to me.  Like I said, I'm happy to have him, but it's not the same.
WIL0002749	I want you to stop following Willow around and follow me again.
WIL0002750	Bark!!
WIL0002751	What's going on, Willow?
WIL0002752	I want you to stop following me for awhile.
WIL0002753	You've done nothing wrong. I want you to follow Willow for awhile.
WIL0002754	Come on, J.T.
WIL0002755	You know, when J.T. follows me it's just like I have my own dog again. Thank you.
WIL0002756	Yes! When J.T. follows me it's just like I have my own dog again. Thank you.
WIL0002757	Now are you happy about J.T. following us?
WIL0002758	Willow, honey, are you in the mood for some lovin?
WIL0002759	Okay, I'm not wearing my old clothes anymore. What do you think? Do I look okay? What about my butt?  Does it look too big?
WIL0002760	You're not allowed to carry your weapon openly here.
WIL0002761	Things are going to get tough around here, Willow, really Hardcore. Be prepared.
WIL0002762	Willow, watch yourself.  Things are going to get tough around here, and you could get really hurt.
WIL0002763	Thank you.  That's very generous.
WIL0002764	Oh.  Well, thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
WIL0002765	I like those skirts. They look good on the guys.
WIL0002766	You know, the NCR guys are always complaining about how hot it is.  Maybe they should start wearing skirts.
WIL0002767	Come on, let's have some fun. What do you say? Let's go jump in the fountain.
WIL0002768	J.T. stay here with me.
WIL0002769	I think I can handle her.
WIL0002770	That outfit you're wearing, Veronica, it is so bad. You look like a potato with a face.
WIL0002771	Do you still want that beer?
WIL0002772	Yeah, bring it on!
WIL0002773	Yeah, but you're going to join me, right? You're not going to leave me here drinking alone like some sorry ass loser, are you?
WIL0002774	Screw 'em.  I want you to come in with me.  Let's see what they do about it.
WIL0002775	Okay, I'll come with you.
WIL0002776	Okay, why don't you wait for me here.
WIL0002777	Great. I'll do that.
WIL0002778	I'm not going in there so we don't have to deal with that right now.
WIL0002779	Oh, alright. Problem solved.
WIL0002780	You still have my Spiked Knuckles.  I'll want those back sometime, 'kay?
WIL0002781	I'll do the healing around here!
WIL0002782	Yo!
WIL0002783	You do it.  You get hurt too much, you big baby!
WIL0002784	I don't think I should go in the tent.
WIL0002785	Things are going to get tough around here, J.T., really Hardcore.  Be prepared.
WIL0002786	Watch yourself, J.T.  Things are going to get tough around here. You could get really hurt.
WIL0002787	Look!  I've been doing some scavenging myself and I've got 40 pencils for you. You'll never run out!
WIL0002788	Let's go, J.T.
WIL0002789	Bye, J.T.
WIL0002790	I know. I love you too.
WIL0002791	Oh, okay!
WIL0002792	Oh, that...that  is special! Thank you so much!
WIL0002793	I accidentally grabbed your radio. Here, you should take it back.
WIL0002794	Hell no, Veronica! I'm your biggest fan!  You punch everything that gets in our way.
WIL0002795	By too much, do you mean you're feeling bad for missing your target and punching one of us again?
WIL0002796	<laughs> No Veronica. I like you just the way your are.
WIL0002797	Oregon originally.
WIL0002798	You mean just now? I was over there, Veronica.
WIL0002799	<laughs> I hope so!
WIL0002800	Yes, something has got to be done about that.  It's terrible.
WIL0002801	Thanks, Willow, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested. (Barter Perk - No)
WIL0002802	Oh. Okay.
WIL0002803	Willow, you're hurt, shouldn't you do something about that?
WIL0002804	Yeah, I would if I had a Stimpak on me. Do you have one you could spare? I don't feel so great.
WIL0002805	Willow, you're hurt.  Take this Stimpak and use it, okay?
WIL0002806	Oh, thank you. I appreciate it.
WIL0002807	No, I'm sorry, I don't have one for you.
WIL0002808	No, I don't hate it.  Please, do it more often. I love it when you sing.
WIL0002809	Stay here and take it easy here for awhile.
WIL0002810	J.T. while you are following along I don't want you to attack anything.  At all. Understood?
WIL0002811	I'd like to see if you got your weapons back when we left.
WIL0002812	Can I take a look then?

VAN0000034	Have a look!
VAN0000035	How many up there?
VAN0000036	Alright! I'll start cooking!
VAN0000037	Let's hit the road!
VAN0000039	Bravo Bravo to you! It was probably very difficult! Here's your prize: A beautiful coffee mug Dinky!
VAN0000040	But you also gain this mysterious key! But what will it open? It opens the trunk with all Dinkies inside of it!
VAN0000041	Also, since you refused the mapmarkers, we offer 500 caps and more !! Again, congratulations for your masterful performance!
VAN0000042	Congratulations to you! To congratulate you, we offer this beautiful coffee mug Dinky!
VAN0000043	But you also win this mysterious key! But what will it open? It opens the trunk with all Dinkies inside of it! Congratulations to you!
VAN0000044	Stop making fun of me! You can not hide anything from me! Everyone wants to participate in the great, the wonderful Dino Game!
VAN0000045	Let's take a look!
VAN0000049	You what? You went through my things? Oh, it's good you feel right at home! Is it comfortable? Give it back to me! Now, Six!
VAN0000050	Great! Let me take a look it. Hm, it talks about a German robot. Its name is ironically creepy... I can't wait to see this. We could go, if you want.
VAN0000052	What may I serve you?
VAN0000053	It's Regis my goule pet.
VAN0000054	He follows me everywhere, like a dog, you know.
VAN0000055	Yes! I like... experiences! The other day I found a recipe. Something very cool. But, there's a problem...
VAN0000056	Nothing very important, but it can be annoying...
VAN0000057	The positive effects are very good, really! But the visual effect can interfere with your sight...
VAN0000058	So, I created an antidote. It's a bit complicated, but it works. First, you drink the whiskey, and next, the antidote!
VAN0000059	I'll give you a note: the recipe for the Mushroom Whiskey, and a recipe for the Cat Antidote.
VAN0000060	Yes. "Mushroom Whiskey," because you need one whiskey, one cave fungus, and one fission battery.
VAN0000061	And "Cat Antidote" because you need one cateye and one cherry bomb.
VAN0000062	...Don't ask me how this works. Like I said, it's complicated.
VAN0000063	I want to Kill Everybody!
VAN0000064	Amazing! Fifty 8-Balls! Wow, it must've been quite the challenge. Here, take this. It's for you! My Teddy Bear. His name is Booba.
VAN0000065	Keep him in your bag. He's here to help you!
VAN0000066	Well, that was... intense as fuck! It was awesome!
VAN0000067	Well, it is better...
VAN0000069	Myself? Well, lemme see...
VAN0000070	I was born not far from here.
VAN0000071	My father left when I was a kid... I searched for him from coast to coast. I eventually found my way to Washington, DC...
VAN0000072	I'm behind you!
VAN0000073	Fine, let's go!
VAN0000075	Okay, I'll come with you. Can't be worse than wasting my time in a bar!
VAN0000076	You're a real asshole sometimes, aren't you?
VAN0000077	You've got to change your act, or else!
VAN0000079	Whatever you need, I don't have it!
VAN0000080	Now, please, let me drink my glass alone, in peace.
VAN0000081	Oh, my God! You again?
VAN0000082	I told you my conditions...
VAN0000083	Yes one of our best customers but also a collector, learned that a very sought painting were in the private part of Gommorah ...
VAN0000084	You will be paid for this work 500 caps.
VAN0000085	Fantastic, let me take a look.
VAN0000086	Wow this painting is definitly beautiful... I'm almost sad to let it go. Anyway, great work Six. Here you payement.
VAN0000087	Yes, today it's a bit special ...
VAN0000088	Some fiends from the Miner's cove former supermarket stole Nabilla's weapon.
VAN0000089	Sid said the lock is blocked. but he saw a guy getting out, close the door and leave for Poseidon Ring ...
VAN0000090	So that key is probably somewhere around here, not very far.
VAN0000091	You first need to find the key, then enter the old supermarket and try to find the weapon ...
VAN0000092	You will be paid 500 caps for that.
VAN0000093	Thank you a lot. Nabilla will be very happy. Here's your money.
VAN0000094	Ants? Well you made a great job again Six, thank you, here 100 caps and a drink for you and for Vanessa. You must be thirsty.
VAN0000095	Oh yes, old stuff.. I will throw them to the garbage can...
VAN0000097	Mhm...
VAN0000098	What a good idea!
VAN0000099	And you are right it is a very nice area! But my house is not a museum so if you could go visit somewhere else, it would be very nice!
VAN0000100	Holy shit! This is the most beautiful dress I have ever seen!
VAN0000101	Actually... that's the only one I have seen...
VAN0000102	But it's simply gorgerous! Thank you so much!
VAN0000103	A beer, thanks. Cheers!
VAN0000104	I will sit... somewhere. Take whichever seat you want. This will be perfect!
VAN0000105	Whoa! What happened to your head? You've got a pretty bad scar!
VAN0000106	Tonight's hot as hell. And this is a lousy room, in a lousy part of a lousy town. It's... perfect.
VAN0000107	Croa
VAN0000108	Of course!
VAN0000109	The name's Sideny, Six, nice to meet you, thank you for helping me, it's been lonely without them.
VAN0000110	The name's Sidney. Six, Nice to meet you. Thank you again for helping me. It's lonely here without them.
VAN0000111	Excellent! Thank you so much. I hope they won't leave me again.
VAN0000112	Oh well...
VAN0000113	Sure, darling!
VAN0000115	Eat somewhere, with you? What a perfect idea!
VAN0000116	The Gourmand? Thanks, monsieur! Follow me!
VAN0000117	The Gourmand? Thanks, mademoiselle! Follow me!
VAN0000118	The meat is fabulous! I wonder what they used to season it...
VAN0000119	I don't know Peter, Arrrrggg stop staring at me like that! And even if I knew, I would not tell you because I don't like the way you look at me.
VAN0000121	Rose of Sharon...
VAN0000122	Thank you very much Six! Here, take these 600 caps.
VAN0000123	This guy comes into a bar, and walks up to the bartender. He says, "bartender, I got me a bet for you."
VAN0000124	"I'm gonna bet you $300 that I can piss into that glass over there and not spill a single, solitary drop".
VAN0000125	The bartender looks at the glass. I mean, we're talking, like, this glass is like a good ten feet away!
VAN0000126	He says, "now, wait... let me get this straight. You're tryin' to tell me you'll bet me $300 that you can piss, standing over here...
VAN0000127	Way over there into that glass, and not spill a single drop?"
VAN0000128	Yes I saw him, he was going to Poseidon Ring. He does this traject regularly.
VAN0000129	Sure! I'll read it right now. Thanks!
VAN0000130	I have no money to offer. But I have a key ... Do you really have to look at me like that way? I mean... with your eyes ... it's annoying.
VAN0000131	Not bad, not bad at all... especially from a human!
VAN0000132	Here is the key, as I promised ... I don't know what you'll find behind that door ... but you will surely find something.
VAN0000133	Human, what you've brought me... That big blue piece of meat. I can't believe it... Hi, my name is Vicky.
VAN0000134	Okay. I'll keep this place safe!
VAN0000135	Don't be too long... I don't like to wait!
VAN0000136	Okay, but don't be too long.
VAN0000139	I'm here if you need me.
VAN0000140	If I must...
VAN0000141	Grrr
VAN0000143	Okay, you can sleep. I'll keep our guard up.
VAN0000144	Okay, cool. Where is the bar?
VAN0000145	Now we're talking!
VAN0000146	Music to my ears!
VAN0000147	Oh, yes, baby! Oh, yes!
VAN0000148	Glamorous!
VAN0000150	Yes he came here, he was going to Poseidon Ring.
VAN0000151	He usually takes a break here.And he also takes a break here when he returns, this are old habits. But this time, I have not seen him.
VAN0000152	I have no egg anymore. I've lost Nevermore.
VAN0000153	Well I ... like botanic. I didn't know you'll drink it, I'm sorry. Take this schematic, can I have the bears please?
VAN0000155	I can do that!
VAN0000158	Oh, yes!
VAN0000159	Oh, but it would have been my pleasure give you what she needs, yet I have an urgent order to finish and I'm missing some leather ...
VAN0000160	Fantastic, thank you!
VAN0000161	Here, some eggs and a little gift to cook them.
VAN0000162	What's the problem with my tactics?
VAN0000163	I'll help you, if I can. What do you need?
VAN0000164	Welcome to my clinic!
VAN0000165	Okay. Don't move - the doc is drunk today... Like every day. [hic]
VAN0000166	I just hope I'm not too drunk for that!
VAN0000167	I'd love to do it!
VAN0000168	Yes, but...
VAN0000169	We rule!
VAN0000170	I'm EDV5, here is the common place of the Dino's Canyon.  I sell suplices and you can sleep for free.
VAN0000171	Thank you, I'll be as quick as I can, come back in a few days, I'll have finished by then.
VAN0000172	Very good, come back when you have them.
VAN0000173	Really? You want me all naked...? Okay...
VAN0000175	You don't have all the ingredients I asked you. Come back when you have them. One whiskey, one MedX and 1 Stimpak.
VAN0000176	Alright!
VAN0000177	Sure, darling.
VAN0000178	Can't you see I'm very busy doing... nothing?

VAN0000194	Don't mind trailblazing as long as we got the ammo.
VAN0000195	Fuck That!
VAN0000196	Oh my fucking god, get away from me... all three... four of you.
VAN0000197	Alright then! I already have a head start but I go first anyway.
VAN0000198	I think I'm gonna be sick...
VAN0000199	just...doesn't feel right.
VAN0000200	...just...doesn't feel right.
VAN0000201	Oh god, I think I'm gonna be sick...
VAN0000202	haha
VAN0000203	Smells like deathclaw....

VAN0000206	Watch for dogs!
VAN0000208	What did you just say to me cause you sure have my attention now.
VAN0000209	You're challenging me?! Serious now!
VAN0000212	You want...Wanna drink more?
VAN0000213	You...You alright?
VAN0000214	But, I will say you better keep your eyes to yourself because if you don't I'm liable to shoot you square in the face!
VAN0000215	Adult supervision is required
VAN0000216	If you keep talking like a bitch, Im gonna slap you like a bitch!
VAN0000217	Shut your raggety-ass up!
VAN0000218	Damn, if you aint so sweet,you'd make sugar taste like salt
VAN0000219	Don't forget the whiskey!
VAN0000220	Uh ... But ... You are not here for the great and fabulous Dino Game? Oh ... You've at least heard about it?
VAN0000221	Ah little prankster! Of course you've heard about the great, the immense Dino Game!
VAN0000222	Really? How surprising ... and how lucky you are to be able to discover ... Dino Game!
VAN0000223	The Dino Game is a great quest through Canyon Park and through Poseidon Ring!
VAN0000224	You must find the 12 lost Dinkies to receive ... a wonderful surprise!
VAN0000225	Well, of course ... The concept of a surprise is that no one knows exactly what it is!
VAN0000226	But you can choose between a big surprise and a little surprise!I can either tell you on a map where the Dinkies are ..
VAN0000227	Or I let you find out! What do you prefer?
VAN0000228	Very good little player, let's go!
VAN0000229	Ahh, gentleman player! Good luck to you, the game has just begun!
VAN0000230	Get yer ass back over here!
VAN0000231	Hey Barkeep! Get yer ass back over here, I want scotch!
VAN0000232	Hey Barkeep! Where the hell ya goin'? Get yer ass back over here, I want scotch!
VAN0000233	It's the factory ... It's the 3rd time in 2 months!
VAN0000234	I don't know, there must be some kind of beasts eating things they should not...
VAN0000235	Hi Sid!
VAN0000236	So.... You're a Sidney's friend?
VAN0000237	His Traveller Gnomes? Do not trust him, he was just drunk again and he lost them all! Isn't it true Sid?
VAN0000238	Yes, and it was a great job. So welcome to Poseidon Ring!
VAN0000239	Ta note.. Let's talk about your credit.... You own me 225 caps Sidney.
VAN0000240	Welcome to the Poseidon's Saloon!
VAN0000241	Hi, it's actually really nice to meet all of y'all
VAN0000242	Let's get a drink!
VAN0000243	The customer looks up and says, "that's right". The bartender says, "young man, you got a bet!"
VAN0000244	The guy goes, "okay. Here we go, here we go..." and pulls out his thing.
VAN0000245	He's lookin' at the glass, man. He's thinkin' about the glass. He's thinkin' about the glass. Glass.
VAN0000246	Thinkin' about his dick. Dick, glass, dick, glass, dick... And then, foosh! He lets it rip. And he...
VAN0000247	he pisses all over the place, man! He's pissin' on the bar. He's pissin' on the stools, on the floor, on the phone, on the bartender!
VAN0000248	He's pissing everywhere, except the fucking glass! Right? Okay.
VAN0000249	So, the bartender. He's laughing his fuckin' ass off. He's $300 richer! He's like, "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" with piss dripping off his face.
VAN0000250	"Ha, ha, ha, ha!," he says. "You fucking idiot, man! You got it in everything except the glass! You owe me $300!"
VAN0000251	Guy goes, "excuse me just... one little second!" He goes to the back of the bar. There's a couple of guys playing pool. He walks over to them.
VAN0000252	He then comes back to the bar. And goes, "Here you go, Mr. Bartender. $300."
VAN0000253	And the bartender's like, "What the fuck are you so happy about? You just lost $300, idiot!"
VAN0000254	The guy says, "Well, you see those guys over there?
VAN0000255	I just bet them $500 apiece that I could piss on your bar, piss on your floor,
VAN0000256	piss on your phone, and piss on you.
VAN0000257	And not only would you not be mad about it, you'd be happy!"
VAN0000258	Nice painting!
VAN0000259	Nice painting
VAN0000260	Tasty!
VAN0000261	It's good to see you, my dear sister, I got your note, you're delicious.
VAN0000262	Oh, my God! Thank you so much!
VAN0000264	The badder they are, the bigger the reward.
VAN0000265	Ah shit, this is disgusting...
VAN0000266	Ah shit, that's just disgusting...
VAN0000267	All this light!
VAN0000268	If that person is still alive, untie them or kill them, but don't leave em hanging like that
VAN0000269	These poor people...
VAN0000270	Well, kiddo, you thought wrong!
VAN0000271	I'm a killer. A murderous bastard. You know that! And there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murderous bastard...
VAN0000272	I'm pretty sure you don't want to experience one of them.
VAN0000273	Are you serious?
VAN0000274	At first, you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.
VAN0000275	Let's get a drink! So! What do you want? Whiskey, Vodka? God, there is everything we need here!
VAN0000276	Alright. My life is in your robotic claws, Doc. So... try not to kill me.
VAN0000277	Is that countin' Benny?
VAN0000278	So, that means there could be up to seven guys up there?
VAN0000279	Yeah ... we should have fuckin' hid weapons. Or...
VAN0000280	Or, you fuck with him... and then during his sleep... boom!
VAN0000281	But, if you do that... fuck with Benny... you may feel a slight sting. A kind of... heaviness in your chest.
VAN0000282	You wanna know what that is?
VAN0000283	That's pride fucking with ya. But... fuck pride. Pride only hurts. Forget pride, it never helps.
VAN0000284	You just... fuck Benny... and then kill him. Pride... you fight through that shit.
VAN0000285	No... just curious...
VAN0000286	You just fuck Benny... and then kill him. Pride... you fight through that shit.
VAN0000287	Sure, sweety.
VAN0000288	Are you serious? You're indoors.
VAN0000289	Here is no cannibalism in the Mojave, absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount.
VAN0000290	I believe that if ever I had to practice cannibalism, I might manage if there were enough tarragon around.
VAN0000291	One day in DC, a friend killed a raider....he ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti...
VAN0000292	Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken NCR soldier.
VAN0000293	Falling in love is like falling into the arms of a starving cannibal. It's the only time when dinner for two is dinner for one.
VAN0000294	Is it progress if a cannibal uses a fork?
VAN0000295	A Cannibal is a person who walks into a restaurant and orders a waiter.
VAN0000296	Genuine polemics approach a book as lovingly as a cannibal spices a baby.
VAN0000297	You've been amazing... This bitch deserved to die.
VAN0000298	How about a drink?! How about a couple is what you mean!
VAN0000299	Line the bottles up, I'm ready!
VAN0000300	Smells like some weird fried meat...
VAN0000301	What? Fuck it!
VAN0000302	Read a book...
VAN0000303	Sorry, travelling the Mojave don't exactly leave me smelling like a rose.
VAN0000304	ahh No there goes the pain!
VAN0000305	Now
VAN0000306	ah that is a spot
VAN0000307	Pass the bottle!
VAN0000308	Bottoms up!
VAN0000309	Caesar, or... Caesar? What is that stupid name from the Old World?
VAN0000310	And there, on the horizon, this is Arizona!
VAN0000311	I'll help you if I can. What do you need?
VAN0000312	The New Vegas Team!
VAN0000313	Mmm, that smell!
VAN0000314	Mmm!
VAN0000315	I'll start cooking!
VAN0000316	Alright, like what?
VAN0000318	If I must..
VAN0000319	Hey Six, before that bighorner looks like a groomed poodle. Maybe we could find another way to train you?
VAN0000320	Work is the curse of the drinking classes, isn't it Vanessa?
VAN0000321	Is that a pistol in your pocket or are you happy to see me?
VAN0000322	That cunt has got two jobs: kiss good, and make sure king's hair don't get wet.
VAN0000323	So your name's Vanessa...I'm gonna give you somethin' you can't take off.
VAN0000324	Fucking Bastard
VAN0000325	You redneck! Lunatic bastard!
VAN0000326	I may be a bastard, but I'm not a fucking bastard.
VAN0000327	Here to do business? Maybe an antique horoscope. Or an antique sandwich.
VAN0000328	Wow I like that antique... uhhh something, but it's antique! I take it, thx!
VAN0000329	Hey six, isn't it antique as hell?
VAN0000330	Shit I need to take a piss!
VAN0000331	That's a little bit more information than I needed, but go right ahead.
VAN0000332	I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
VAN0000333	Don't forget to tip the barman.
VAN0000334	Tipping... That shit is for the birds, man.
VAN0000335	Hey Barkeep! I want scotch!
VAN0000336	I got this young nineteen year old country girl named Sheronda. I took her to my place in Freeside, told her it was The strip.
VAN0000337	She believed you?
VAN0000338	Hell yeah! To her dumb country ass, Freeside is The strip; closest she's ever been anyway.
VAN0000339	Dixon,Your whiskey tastes like piss
VAN0000340	I know because I piss in it
VAN0000341	Do you want me?
VAN0000342	Okay! I like that place!
VAN0000343	I can't show my femininity in this cruel world. I fear for myself...
VAN0000344	I don't want to be raped, or captured... or become a sex slave, like Clover in Paradise Falls...
VAN0000345	Yes. On the other side of the wasteland.
VAN0000346	It's a long story...
VAN0000347	I'm single. Most of the time, nothing serious.
VAN0000348	A boyfriend, or a girlfriend... When I'm drunk, I don't care who's in my bed!
VAN0000349	Don't play with me. Wait... you're serious?
VAN0000350	I suppose it is!
VAN0000351	Hope you're ready... I want you to make me scream...
VAN0000352	You don't have all the ingredients you need. No flour.
VAN0000353	Thank you so much for your help!
VAN0000355	What? You want to do... what? No way! Are you a barber or something? You're not! Forget that stupid idea!
VAN0000356	That's a good idea. In Freeside, the King has a personal barber, Sergio. Maybe he can help.
VAN0000357	That's a good idea. In Freeside the King had a personal barber, Sergio. Maybe he can figure out something...
VAN0000359	That's a good idea, Six, let's do this! Can I buy some popcorn first? I think I will enjoy the show...
VAN0000360	Here is a book, and now we will (vewy, vewy) quietly take that book. Because we don't want to kill anybody. And nobody wants to die.
VAN0000361	You found the heart? Great! 'Cause I don't know how much longer I can last...
VAN0000362	Hey six!
VAN0000363	Hey, do you wanna fuck?
VAN0000364	That gets me really hot...
VAN0000365	I feel a bit like Althea Flynt right now.
VAN0000366	Why didn't you just ask me, then?
VAN0000367	Yeah. These dialogue options suck, right? But that's no reason to pry into my business! Anyway...
VAN0000368	So... You read this letter, and the wonderful story about these fiends. Nice story, isn't it?
VAN0000369	I thought I was going to die like an idiot. Wondered if I would either die by myself, or if the fiends were going to help me...
VAN0000370	Neither one nor the other...
VAN0000371	That's why you found me getting hammered in a bar, waiting for some unknown miracle... I've crossed the wasteland. I've never backed down.
VAN0000372	No son of a bitch has ever managed to make me flinch...
VAN0000373	And now... I feel like a fool... stuck in a tired body. My heart is a piece of shit.
VAN0000374	And I do not like talking about it.
VAN0000375	Perhaps we could go to the fort in Freeside. "Mormon" something or other?
VAN0000376	I think I know this guy the Doc is talking about. If it's him... Pfft, boring. But you'll judge by yourself.
VAN0000377	Thank you. It's nice of you, really.
VAN0000378	Uh... You know, even if it means being butchered by a robot with a nauseating penchant for scientific experiments worthy of the worst freak show...
VAN0000379	I'd rather love having the finest piece of meat of the Mojave!
VAN0000380	Ultra-Luxe?
VAN0000381	No, I'm not. Well... yes. Actually... I can't prove it. But I'm not stupid... even if I pretend to be.
VAN0000382	People talk, you know? Especially in bars, and especially when they try to drink with me.
VAN0000383	Alcohol turns guys into limp dicks. But it also loosens the tongues... It depends on how you see it, I suppose.
VAN0000384	Personally, right now... I know I don't look like much... sexually.
VAN0000385	With this damaged heart... I would die on the spot. Pleasant death, indeed...
VAN0000386	The result is that I listen more than I act. And I learn interesting little secrets.
VAN0000387	Can we check the kitchens of the Ultra-Luxe restaurant?
VAN0000388	It's... strange. I don't know how to say this, but... I feel... hope.
VAN0000389	I had forgotten that feeling... Having hope. Imagining a future that would not stop overnight.
VAN0000390	It took me three years to get back to Nevada. I felt the symptoms appearing slowly...
VAN0000391	The beings of flesh get used to everything. Even the worst. Nature is surprising...
VAN0000392	Resignation comes... gradually. It's barely noticeable.
VAN0000393	But... today, I feel weird. I think I'm... happy.
VAN0000394	The guy with the glasses... He might be the man with the book...
VAN0000395	I'm hurt...
VAN0000396	Oh, my God...
VAN0000397	Magic mirror on the wall, who is the hangoverest one of all?
VAN0000398	The face is the mirror of the mind, and eyes without speaking confess the secrets of the heart.
VAN0000399	Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?
VAN0000400	I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck, but my lawyer thinks he can get me five.
VAN0000401	The best mirror is an old friend.
VAN0000402	You've never seen death? Look in the mirror every day and you will see it like bees working in a glass hive.
VAN0000403	You mirror what the world mirrors to you?
VAN0000404	Monkeys are superior to men in this: when a monkey looks into a mirror, he sees a monkey.
VAN0000405	I'm really just using the mirror to summon something I don't even know until I see it.
VAN0000406	Hold up a mirror and ask yourself what you really care about. Then take the initiative, don't wait for someone else to ask you to act.
VAN0000407	There are few people who look into the mirror and say 'That person is a monster' instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do.
VAN0000408	Interesting...
VAN0000409	Okay, then. Let's go!
VAN0000410	Okay, but take care of my stuff!
VAN0000411	I'm hungry. Let's get a taco
VAN0000412	Somebody left the cork out of my lunch
VAN0000413	Sometimes, i think that I drink to make other people interesting...
VAN0000414	I try not to drink too much because when I'm drunk, I bite
VAN0000415	Richard Burton said that When he played drunks he had to remain sober because he didn't know how to play them when he was drunk.
VAN0000416	I'm drunk, Shhh don't tel anyone this could ruine my reputation hahaha
VAN0000417	I'm like the drunk in the bar who wants just one more for the road.
VAN0000418	All is fair in love and whiskey.
VAN0000419	Drink what you want; drink what you're able. If you are drinking with me, you'll be under the table
VAN0000420	24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence?
VAN0000421	When you stop drinking, you have to deal with this marvelous personality that started you drinking in the first place
VAN0000422	It's fine to drink. At least you have something to blame everything on
VAN0000423	Maybe talking when I'm piss ass drunk isn't entirely bright.
VAN0000424	You know, I've never been drunk, but often I've been overserved
VAN0000425	Thinkin' about his dick. Dick, glass, dick, glass, dick... And then, foosh! He lets it rip. And he... he pisses all over the place, man!
VAN0000426	He's pissin' on the bar. He's pissin' on the stools, on the floor, on the phone, on the bartender!
VAN0000427	Mhm.
VAN0000429	Now I have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho!
VAN0000430	.44 magnum is the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself one question: "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?
VAN0000431	The Hell's Grannies, let's make them eat Their teeth!
VAN0000432	Yes i am, I'm simply awesome... I haven't used my skills for such a long time now.
VAN0000434	Of course, I'm ready, I've always been ready, where is the body?
VAN0000435	I need a new heart... come back when you have one.
VAN0000436	Prefect lay on that bed Vanessa... and don't worry.
VAN0000437	Amazing!
VAN0000438	I've been simply awesome, she's fine, except a little liver problem...but who needs a liver hahaha?
VAN0000439	Oh by the way, inside this bocal, you'll find a little part ... i don t know exactly where it was...
VAN0000440	Anyway... she looks fine ... But if she vomits some green liquid, or has some spasms ... send her back here.
VAN0000441	Hmm, this looks & smells like burgundy pork, a delicious meal, if you want the recipe, it would be my pleasure to give it to you!
VAN0000442	Hey vanessa! I've got some awesome new weapons to show you.
VAN0000444	AK-47! The very best there is. When you absolutely, positively, got to kill every motherfucker in the room; accept no substitutes.
VAN0000445	Mister Cuddles, right? If I was a little boomer, I'd play where the planes are... Like the south hangar!
VAN0000447	You don't have all the ingredients you need. You need a Nuka Bottle, Flamer Fuel, and lingerie.
VAN0000448	Mmm! That smell!
VAN0000449	You don't have all the ingredients you need.
VAN0000450	The NCR seems to like you... Maybe you're right. They can help. But... keep your head level, okay?
VAN0000451	This is not a giant gecko. It's a tyrannosaur.
VAN0000452	You've got some 8-Balls?
VAN0000454	Yes...
VAN0000456	I have the drive for this shit!
VAN0000457	Do you know of a pre-war book with a crow named "Nevermore"?
VAN0000458	A challenge? What a good idea!
VAN0000459	Okay, but what do you want to drink? We need at least four whiskey bottles, don't you think?
VAN0000460	Alright, but be careful! I have the drive for this shit!
VAN0000461	How much we bettin'? 100 caps? 100. Yeah, it seems good to me!
VAN0000462	Fine, let's go.
VAN0000463	Done in one!
VAN0000464	Come back when you have them!
VAN0000465	[hic]
VAN0000466	I think so.
VAN0000467	Cheeeeers!
VAN0000468	Hmm! That smell!
VAN0000469	Whiskey.... whis... whiskey!
VAN0000471	Ugh...
VAN0000472	Thiiiiis was a bad idea... Awww, shiiiit...
VAN0000473	Holy shit... Aww... Wa... wait...
VAN0000474	I need this! I'll get better... Damn, you look sooo fine...
VAN0000475	Well... now it's better...
VAN0000476	Take your money. It's... it's yours... definitely.
VAN0000477	Well, guess you're a little tougher than I thought... Though it looks like you're feeling it, eh, slick?
VAN0000478	Nobody won, I guess...
VAN0000479	What? You...you alright? You face looks a little weird...
VAN0000480	Come here! Doc Vanessa will heal you!
VAN0000481	Now, give me my money!
VAN0000482	Wh... why is everything moving around my bottle?
VAN0000484	A creature stoned me!
VAN0000485	I'd prefer the stings of all the mercenaries in Vegas, they'd hurt less!
VAN0000486	God... dammit!
VAN0000487	God... dammit
VAN0000488	You'll do that for me?
VAN0000489	Oh, right! A tri...! Aw, aw, aw! Arrgh! Shit!
VAN0000490	I don't know what to say... Thanks, Six! For everything!
VAN0000491	What the hell is that shit?
VAN0000492	What do you wanna know?
VAN0000495	Do you have any more questions?
VAN0000496	I love 8-Balls. I collect them, y'know.
VAN0000497	They're stupid, unuseful, and heavy... but I love em.
VAN0000498	You can place them in my collection inventory, if you come across any.
VAN0000499	So... if you want to help me, and get me about... hm, 50 of them, I'll give you a present!
VAN0000500	Well... He's just a wise guy who wanted to play with the big boys...
VAN0000501	You can be as sweet as a woman can be, and then... just kill him, as he killed you.
VAN0000502	Yes... I know what you do. Eat his heart for me, and we'll throw the body to the dogs.
VAN0000503	If you want, I have an idea. I'll share a glass with you, before... if you need. Because you'll have to be strong.
VAN0000504	Be as sweet as a woman like you can be, and have sex with him. That dog trap only deserves your body, dead or alive, for one goal: his own death.
VAN0000505	But... promise me one thing. Only eat his dick once he's dead. Keep it for your own pleasure.
VAN0000506	Be cautious with House. A guy in a screen who needs a sex-bot is hardly trustable!
VAN0000507	Joke apart? Well...
VAN0000508	The Legion is asking for a serious kick in their fuse box... Just sayin'.
VAN0000509	The new "Old-World Democracy" is back... and in a rad-infested desert, like Nevada...
VAN0000510	It's just a vicious cycle that we're doomed to repeat. Because war... war never changes.
VAN0000511	And humans will never change.
VAN0000513	They think they're doing pretty well, but... the problem is not the soldiers, really.
VAN0000514	It's their hierarchy.
VAN0000515	They will do exactly as their predecessors of the ancient world did.
VAN0000516	And we all know how well that ended... which was very badly, by the way.
VAN0000517	"Ni dieu ni maitre!" Coined by the socialist Auguste Blanqui in 1880, when he published a newspaper by that name.
VAN0000518	I found a lot of these old magazines in the ruins of DC...
VAN0000519	Look, just... do the best for yourself first. And be a good leader.
VAN0000520	Yeah! Y'know: be the leader of New Vegas. You're a good person... I know you could do it.
VAN0000521	Yes! I'm here if you need me, and others are there, too.
VAN0000522	You are respected.
VAN0000523	If you stay true to yourself, everything will be just fine.
VAN0000524	I've nothing special to say about me, you know...
VAN0000525	You could give me some books to read. Or teach me yourself, if you got the skills... That would be awesome!
VAN0000526	There I found friends, adventure, and money... But not my father. Or my sister.
VAN0000527	Then, a friend helped me with my research, and we were able to locate her.
VAN0000528	So, I came back here...
VAN0000529	I won't lie. I really miss DC, but... I love the Mojave. It's my homeland!
VAN0000530	Yeah, I have a half sister. Same father, different mothers.
VAN0000531	Say... Have you read a book called, "The Grapes of Wrath"?
VAN0000532	No. Not at the moment.
VAN0000533	Guten Tag!
VAN0000535	Escuse me?
VAN0000536	Ah! Mission!
VAN0000537	A robotics engineer will spend the majority of their time designing the plans needed to build robots.
VAN0000538	They also design the processes necessary for the robot to run correctly.
VAN0000539	Some of these professionals are also responsible for designing the machines that actually assemble the robots.
VAN0000540	Once the design phase has been completed, only then do they move toward assembling the unit.
VAN0000541	This type of engineer is responsible for creating several different types of robots that are used to complete a variety of different tasks.
VAN0000542	Prior to a robot being constructed, the engineer will have first researched and determined exactly what the robot will be used for,
VAN0000543	and the manner in which it will accomplish its goal.
VAN0000544	For these professionals, the building process will take a great deal of time.
VAN0000545	Robots are highly technical and difficult to create, and the task can be very tricky.
VAN0000546	For this reason it's not uncommon for a robotics engineer to only work on a handful of projects throughout his or her entire career.
VAN0000547	Professionals in this field need to be very patient.
VAN0000548	Mr Robert House.
VAN0000549	Mr Robert House attended the prestigious Institute in Massachusetts and founded RobCo Industries on his 22nd birthday.
VAN0000550	Within five years, it was one of the most profitable corporations on Earth.
VAN0000551	By 2065, House was certain that an atomic war would soon devastate the planet.
VAN0000552	At great personal expense, he developed technologies to ensure the structural integrity of the city of Las Vegas (as it was known at the time).
VAN0000553	On the day of the great war, 77 atomic warheads targeted the city. Mr. House defeated them all. Talk about vision!
VAN0000554	The Institute was born from the Commonwealth Institute of Technology, or CIT, a renowned university based in Boston, Massachusetts.
VAN0000555	Robert House attended it in his youth.
VAN0000556	During the Great War, a number of CIT personnel survived by taking refuge in the underground level of the campus.
VAN0000557	In 2110, the survivors and their descendants founded the Institute, an organization dedicated to furthering pre-War science.
VAN0000558	In its early days, as the very first Generation 1 synths were being built,
VAN0000559	the Institute reached out to aid the people of the Commonwealth in rebuilding civilization, but mutual mistrust quickly doomed that Enterprise.
VAN0000560	Soured on any further cooperation with the surface, the Institute withdrew into the shadows and adopted a new purpose:
VAN0000561	to annihilate every last trace of the pre-War culture they blamed for ending the world, and recreate the surface in their own image,
VAN0000562	based on their ideas of a utopian society.
VAN0000563	Synths created by the Institute, are classified into one of two generations depending upon their complexity.
VAN0000564	Generation 1 synths like this one are purely mechanical humanoids with skeletal appearances; consequently,
VAN0000565	they are crude representations of living humans.
VAN0000566	Like their predecessors, Generation 2 synths are also mechanical,
VAN0000567	but have more advanced frames that are partially or fully covered in plastic "skin" panels;
VAN0000568	they might pass for humans if not closely inspected.
VAN0000569	This is crazy. One day, I'll return to the east and I'll investigate about the institute.
VAN0000570	No. Just curious...
VAN0000571	You impress me! I like smart people.
VAN0000573	Something. God, don't you hate that?
VAN0000574	Uncomfortable silence. Why do we feel that it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
VAN0000575	Oh, but the answer is so simple! That's when you know that you've found somebody really special.
VAN0000576	You can just... shut the fuck up for a minute. And comfortably share pure silence.
VAN0000577	Hey... you wanna fuck?
VAN0000578	I see the way you look at me. I can just tell. So... do you want to...?
VAN0000579	They have rooms for rent here. You lead, and I'll follow you.
VAN0000580	I bet... in places like this, you can really cut down on the "pride" factor! That's a good thing!
VAN0000581	I hope!
VAN0000582	If you show me respect, then I'll give you respect. Simple.
VAN0000583	If you have a question, ask me whenever you need!
VAN0000584	Yeah, I'm a great shot! And I have my own strong weapons.
VAN0000585	If you ask me, I'll equip them.
VAN0000586	Just be sure I have some ammo. My own weapons require 5.56mm and 10mm.
VAN0000587	You can talk to me with that wheel...
VAN0000588	Y'know, the companion wheel.
VAN0000589	The wheel you pull up that helps you give me commands?
VAN0000590	The one you pull up when you don't want to constantly skip my opening dialogue just to get me to do something, or even give me something?
VAN0000591	That companion wheel?
VAN0000592	Yeah... Apparently, it did...
VAN0000593	I can heal myself in battle just fine. Just ask me to, and be sure I have some stimpaks in my bag.
VAN0000594	When we're not in combat, I'll eat the food that's in my inventory.
VAN0000595	Be cautious, bud. I really like whiskey. It's a... a bad family habit...
VAN0000596	And if you leave a bottle in my inventory, I will drink it. No doubt about it.
VAN0000597	Have you heard about this story about the Sunset Sarsaparilla star bottle caps?
VAN0000598	Anyway, you can give me all your Sarsaparilla. I won't touch 'em!
VAN0000599	I don't want to lose a star cap!
VAN0000600	I'll give you the recipe for my whiskey. And 3 bottles to test it!
VAN0000601	So, I think I told you everything... Do you have any more questions?
VAN0000602	Mhm!
VAN0000603	What a tremendously hostile world that a rat must endure. Yet not only does he survive, he thrives.
VAN0000604	Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.
VAN0000605	While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
VAN0000606	"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door, Only this and nothing more."
VAN0000607	And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
VAN0000608	So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating" 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door.
VAN0000609	Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door. This it is and nothing more."
VAN0000610	Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"Sir", said I, or "Madam", truly your forgiveness I implore;
VAN0000611	But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
VAN0000612	That I scarce was sure I heard you" here I opened wide the door. Darkness there and nothing more.
VAN0000613	Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
VAN0000614	But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
VAN0000615	This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" Merely this and nothing more.
VAN0000616	Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
VAN0000617	"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
VAN0000618	Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore.'Tis the wind and nothing more!"
VAN0000619	Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
VAN0000620	Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he. But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door.
VAN0000621	Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door. Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
VAN0000622	Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
VAN0000623	"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore.
VAN0000624	Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
VAN0000625	Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
VAN0000626	For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
VAN0000627	Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as "Nevermore."
VAN0000628	But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
VAN0000629	Nothing farther then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered. Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before.
VAN0000630	On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before." Then the bird said "Nevermore."
VAN0000631	Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"Doubtless" said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store
VAN0000632	Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
VAN0000633	Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of "Never, nevermore"."
VAN0000634	But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
VAN0000635	Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
VAN0000636	What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
VAN0000637	This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
VAN0000638	This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining. On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
VAN0000639	But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,She shall press, ah, nevermore!
VAN0000640	Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
VAN0000641	"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee, by these angels he hath sent thee Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
VAN0000642	Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
VAN0000643	"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
VAN0000644	Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted. On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore
VAN0000645	Is there, is there balm in Gilead?-tell me-tell me, I implore!"Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
VAN0000646	"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!-prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore
VAN0000647	Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
VAN0000648	Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore." Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
VAN0000649	"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting- "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
VAN0000650	Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
VAN0000651	Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
VAN0000652	And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
VAN0000653	And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
VAN0000654	And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted - nevermore!
VAN0000655	Riot shotgun... If used properly, it can remove fingerprints.
VAN0000656	Ahahah
VAN0000657	Yes, sure. But take care! You'll run really fast!
VAN0000658	I won't touch anything!
VAN0000659	Don't play with my heart...
VAN0000660	What the hell is that...? Gngh...
VAN0000661	I'm gonna be sick...
VAN0000662	Gngh...
VAN0000663	No... not yet... Ugh...
VAN0000664	Do you... it... Oh...
VAN0000665	Let's go Bernard!
VAN0000666	They are my gnomes ... well, they were my gnomes ...
VAN0000667	One day they got itchy feet and left ...
VAN0000668	I did not ask you for your opinion ...You're the one asking questions. If you don't like the answers, that's not my problem.
VAN0000669	Yes ... they wanted to see the world ... I can understand! This place is a deathtrap ... But I miss them.
VAN0000670	Ok bye .... Oh and if you see some of my gnomes, tell them I miss them.
VAN0000671	They send them to me, to show me they're having a good time!
VAN0000672	That would be great ... I'll pay you for it, one second please...  I have a key for you...
VAN0000673	I see you have a pipboy also. I will add the supposed location to your pipboy map.
VAN0000674	Come with you? Why not .... Let me grab my stuff and I'll be ready. Here take this it may come in handy.
VAN0000675	Whatever ... I'll be here ...Hopefully I'll get more pics from them.
VAN0000676	I don't have much,  but I can give you something... How about this Gnomestick and 200 caps.
VAN0000677	You're welcome. Thank you for your help.
VAN0000678	We have to go to the bar and get a drink together when we get the time. I'll send you a message on your Pipboy!
VAN0000679	But for now, I'm sorry but I have to take care of the gnomes. Goodbye, Six and thanks again.
VAN0000684	Hmm ... Well don't piss on my carpet ...the toilet's just there.
VAN0000685	Who could resist the idea of a cold drink? Isis is back: You're going to meet her.
VAN0000686	TRIP ON
VAN0000687	Whiskey all around, on me!
VAN0000688	Now, sit still!
VAN0000689	I wanna sit somewhere...
VAN0000690	Uhmm
VAN0000691	It stinks in here! Or is that me? Oh, no. No, it's not me.
VAN0000692	I smell jet... and some sort of tox. You'll probably find some medicine here!
VAN0000696	Be my guest
VAN0000698	I'm hungry. Let's get a taco!
VAN0000699	I want Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
VAN0000700	Tasty...
VAN0000701	Add some whiskey to the mix and I'm game!
VAN0000702	I just hope I'm not too drunk for that.
VAN0000703	Pan!
VAN0000704	The adventure continues!
VAN0000705	Sex?
VAN0000706	Sex is part of nature. I go along with nature. I'm not a lesbian. I'm not bisexual. I'm not straight. I'm just curious.
VAN0000707	Sex is like a pre-war Chinese dinner. It ain't over 'til you both get your cookie.
VAN0000708	Love is an ice cream sundae, with all the marvelous coverings. Sex is the cherry on top!
VAN0000709	You'll be the girl with the most cake.
VAN0000710	The most powerful weapon on earth is... the human soul on fire.
VAN0000711	Sex is an ice cream sundae, with all the marvelous coverings. Love is the cherry on top.
VAN0000712	Yes, I think so too. You just need a bit of training. But... I'm not your teacher. I'll go back to Goodsprings.
VAN0000713	You realize that we could never just be friends?
VAN0000714	What I'm saying is that men and women can't be friends, because the sex part always gets in the way.
VAN0000715	You don't get it.
VAN0000716	I can't trust you... So no, you don't.
VAN0000717	You only think you do, but you fucking don't!
VAN0000718	Because a man cannot truly be "friends" with a woman that he finds attractive. And vice-versa...
VAN0000719	They'll always want to have sex with each other. It's just human nature.
VAN0000720	No. You pretty much want to nail 'em, too.
VAN0000721	Doesn't matter. 'Cause the sex thing is already out there, and the friendship is ultimately messed up.
VAN0000722	I guess not.
VAN0000723	Yeah... but you can still fuck me, y'know.
VAN0000724	Don't play with my heart.
VAN0000726	Thanks for the Salisbury Steak.
VAN0000727	Jingle!
VAN0000728	Booom!
VAN0000729	Weird sound!
VAN0000730	Gotta say, this whole strong, silent type thing you got going on is actually pretty cute... Just saying.
VAN0000731	Mmm... Mmmm!
VAN0000732	You look like one of those Enclave eyebots from DC... Good thing you don't spout their nonsense.
VAN0000733	So, you're part of the Followers, huh? Good... we need more people like you around.
VAN0000734	Hey Lily, that bonnet on your head actually suits you. You know that?
VAN0000735	Were you a gunslinger in the Old World? You look like you could've been a gunslinger...
VAN0000736	Who's a cute little robotic doggy? You are! Oh, yes, you are!
VAN0000737	So, you're a Scribe for the Brotherhood, huh? I wonder how they're doing now...
VAN0000738	Do I have time to bang this chick?
VAN0000739	Victor...
VAN0000741	What do you mean I didn't get me a bottle of scotch?
VAN0000742	Where did I put my bottle of scotch? What do you mean I didn't get me a bottle of scotch?!
VAN0000743	I can cook a special whiskey - 100% addiction-free, with no bad side effects.
VAN0000744	It took me a long time to create the recipe... trust me.
VAN0000745	I had a science lab in DC...
VAN0000746	Why is everything around... in my bottle...?
VAN0000747	Don't drink it! Oh...
VAN0000748	Why are you looking at me like that? What do you need?
VAN0000750	It's me!
VAN0000751	Y'know... I feel like dancing...
VAN0000752	Well where did I put my bottle of scotch?
VAN0000753	Waste of ammo!
VAN0000754	Are you drunk! It's me!
VAN0000756	Hey, that hurts!
VAN0000757	Did that bullet to the head really damage your brain cells?
VAN0000758	If you shoot me again, I'll make sure I won't miss, like Benny did!
VAN0000759	We're getting so drunk...! [gasp] We could get paid for that!
VAN0000760	It's not just any whiskey! It's THE Vanessa's Whiskey!
VAN0000762	Down in one!
VAN0000763	You're on a good way to become a ghoul! But who needs skin, after all?
VAN0000764	OK, but let me warn you about something. Sometimes, I can bug out if I do that. Ask me not to draw my weapon when you do - that will fix the problem!
VAN0000765	Of course I saw him, he was going to Poseidon's Ring he always comes here to grab some food for the road.
VAN0000766	Why are you looking for him? Is he in troubles?
VAN0000767	I understand. I hope nothing wrong happend. Keep me informed please.
VAN0000769	I'm Vanessa, by the way. Nice to meet you.
VAN0000770	I can heal you if you need it.
VAN0000771	Nevermore is my raven. He's gone. I don't know where he is.
VAN0000772	As you noticed, there is no chicken in the Wasteland. So we eat raven's eggs. It's very good!
VAN0000773	Sadly he's not here anymore. We miss our Nevermore.
VAN0000774	Nevermore without Nevermore.
VAN0000775	And if you see him, bring him back here. I'll cook you something.
VAN0000776	That's fantastic, now you have to wait 4 days and I'll cook something for you!
VAN0000777	I cooked some eggs for you.
VAN0000778	Here we go! Take this box for Pansea, and here, 12 cooked eggs for you.
VAN0000779	Great! Thank you! Do you want to buy some eggs?
VAN0000780	Alright then, come back when it's done!
VAN0000781	Alright then, maybe next time!
VAN0000783	There is Sidney, he's weird sometimes but he keeps the fiends away, he's a great shot. People don't mess with him.
VAN0000784	There is Isis, she runs the saloon. She's cool. She also has a raven!
VAN0000785	There is Nabilla, I don't really know what's her job, but some people come inside her mobilehome then left.
VAN0000786	There is Becky, I mean Miss Van De Pute. Her husband is dead.
VAN0000787	There is Vicky. She's lunatic and aggressive, I don't like her. But I love Aristote, her rat! Give him some cheese if you meet him, he loves it!
VAN0000788	And there was Mr Jack the butcher... But Sidney killed him, he said some people are better neighbors dead than alive.
VAN0000789	Ok then, let me know.
VAN0000790	No, it's not weird, he just likes me...
VAN0000791	I think he likes me...
VAN0000792	[SUCCEEDED] Yes, he's... he's my brother...
VAN0000793	[FAILED] That's none of your business!
VAN0000794	Thank you.. Yes, this happend 4 years ago. Our parents were killed by ants when I was a baby. Regis raised me as his own son, he was only 12.
VAN0000795	But one day, I decided to take a look around. I waited a moment Regis was gone and I escaped. I knew it was dangerous... and I saw that big hole...
VAN0000796	The one with the radiations. I was very close to fall inside when I felt Regis hand on my shoulder. He was very angry about me...
VAN0000797	I've been punished in my room for 2 days... But the second day, Regis decided to cover the hole, that way nobody would fall into it.
VAN0000798	But he did it... He felt... And as I was punished in my room... I was afraid to go out you know... he was already very angry.
VAN0000799	Yes, I waited in my room for 2 days... until Pansea came in our house: She has always been around since our parents died. She's my second mother.
VAN0000800	She found me, starving in my room. She was very anxious for Regis. But she took the time to cook something for me before looking for him.
VAN0000801	She found him inside the hole... he was... as he's now. As a goule. But he wasn't aggressive. He was very friendly. So we kept him with us.
VAN0000802	We lived in Pansea's house until I was old enough to take care about Regis alone. Now we live here.
VAN0000803	When I travel with him, the other goules never attack me. So we can say he also take care of me.
VAN0000804	Yes, I saw him... he was talking with Vicky...
VAN0000806	Uhhh... Yes,That's my book, why?
VAN0000807	I found it in the Pawn Shop, I think... I'm sorry I can't help you...
VAN0000808	Yes, I love it, why?
VAN0000809	Wow that's awesome! Thank you very much!
VAN0000810	It's so beautiful I mean look at that view!
VAN0000811	Look at that view!
VAN0000812	Luck's about to change! I can feel it!
VAN0000813	Fine, thank you.
VAN0000814	Move along, please. I have to clean the room.
VAN0000815	Come on! You're just being nice!
VAN0000816	You've been so nice to me! Let me give you something.
VAN0000817	It's my 8-Ball! With it in your bag, you'll be the luckiest in the wasteland!
VAN0000818	Hahaha! Tried to kiss a deathclaw, huh? Wow!
VAN0000819	Okay, okay. Let's talk about something else.
VAN0000820	The guy who did it is a real asshole. And a noob with a gun. Just saying...
VAN0000821	Y'know... I feel like dancing... Do you love me, Six? Hmm? Tell me what you want, what you desire... Do you want me?
VAN0000822	Ya see? I know exactly what you want!
VAN0000823	I'll take good care of you now, baby...
VAN0000824	Now, just relax right here, on the bed. We have quite the adventure ahead of us tonight.
VAN0000825	Wait, from just having sex with me? Look, I know I was good, but damn...
VAN0000826	Oh, great! Well, you know... I can help with that.
VAN0000827	I'm a doctor. I can heal you, if you need it.
VAN0000828	I assume we're a bit more than friends now...
VAN0000829	I'll shut my mouth if I want. It's none of your business.
VAN0000830	Don't you ever talk to me like that again!
VAN0000831	Oh, yes baby! Oh, yes!
VAN0000832	That's not your business.
VAN0000833	Yes, sweety.
VAN0000834	What now? Let me tell you what now.
VAN0000835	The adventure continues! We will continue busting the troublemakers and avenging the victims of all the dog suckers, haha!
VAN0000836	Hey... you hear me talkin', Six?
VAN0000837	This poor kids...
VAN0000838	Don't touch this!
VAN0000839	With bubbles!
VAN0000840	You got a problem with my outfits?
VAN0000841	As long as I'm not naked, I can wear whatever you want!
VAN0000842	It's not your business!
VAN0000843	I'm not sure that's your business.
VAN0000844	Yes, sweety?
VAN0000845	Okay. But I will lose some carrying capacity.
VAN0000846	Sure! Now I can hold more stuff!
VAN0000847	Let's kick some ass!
VAN0000848	How do ya like the bounty hunting business?
VAN0000849	Of course
VAN0000850	Okay. I'll try that!
VAN0000851	Shit! My weapon is broken!
VAN0000853	A sober woman might take insult at that. {Serious}Me, I might just bust you one.
VAN0000854	Gift from my Dad, along with my name. {Wistful}Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
VAN0000855	Mom said he got the name out of some Old World book about dirt pilgrims. {Beat}Name sure sounds sweet, though.
VAN0000857	Very. So take a little break here, the place is fine, I  personally take care of the household, if you see what I mean.
VAN0000858	Oh, but you must be hungry!
VAN0000859	I have food in the fridge, take what you want, you can also relax on my bed.
VAN0000860	The sheets are clean as I changed them two weeks ago just after the invasion of Radroaches.
VAN0000861	My name is Courtney Taylor.
VAN0000862	Yes, actually it was my name when I was a human. Soldier Courtney Taylor.
VAN0000863	My garrison and I were one day sent to the Mariposa Military Base.
VAN0000864	We were fighting - ironically - a supermutants army that seemed to come from Mariposa.
VAN0000865	We had heard that Grey was conducting experiments of FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) on human combayes. We had to investigate.
VAN0000866	But ... what we found there ...
VAN0000867	T'was... A shapeless mass that was .... called in all simplicity "The Master" ...
VAN0000868	He told us what had happened to him: He Was plunged into a vat of FEV by a robotic arm.
VAN0000869	Floating in the vats for almost a month, the FEV transformed him into an amorphous Grey, blob-like being ...
VAN0000870	He expanded to reliable biological mass by absorbing other creatures and people that came near the base.
VAN0000871	And bionically merging itself with computer equipment from the base.
VAN0000872	The ones he Consumed also became parts of its multiple personalities ...
VAN0000873	It also began capturing humans that stumbled upon its lair and intentionally exposing them to the FEV.
VAN0000874	These initial mutated humans were incredibly flawed, and the newly named Master consumed them rather than letting them live.
VAN0000875	I became one of them ... almost.
VAN0000876	I thought I should flee, while others foolishly followed orders. During a mission, I had the opportunity to flee. It is what I did.
VAN0000877	On the road, my new look, I was not facilitated with contacts. In fact I was so afraid that people might shoot me on sight.
VAN0000878	So I went from California, to the east. On my way I found Vegas, my husband and eventually this canyon.
VAN0000879	No, I think he was killed by a Vault Dweller ...
VAN0000880	There are some fiends here but they do not bother me, it does not come so far. Each territory ...
VAN0000881	At least these junkies have the merit of treating everyone the same ... mutant, human, ghoul or brahmin, they shoot!
VAN0000882	We can say that in the circumstances, life was rather pleasant here ...
VAN0000883	Yes, my husband, Peter, left  two weeks ago to Poseidon Ring. It's strange, he's never that long normally.
VAN0000884	He went there to sell stones.
VAN0000885	Yes, precious stones. If you happen to go so far, that you have gone through the industrial area of Buena Vista?
VAN0000886	You do not miss the great area full of Deathclaws? A girl at the Poseidon Ring buys precious stones, she actually bought anything of valueble object.
VAN0000887	I think that some people even have to pass it. The other day my husband told me he had to go to Vegas:
VAN0000888	A collector would have mandated to find some old things lost by the time.
VAN0000889	Some people have not forgotten the old world and probably ready to pay dearly for these relics ....
VAN0000890	I also know that she has more doubtful contacts, we have seen in dealing with the Omerta Gommorah.
VAN0000891	It would be very kind of you. Poseidon Ring to get there, all you have to cross is the canyon, be careful, there are lots of fiends:
VAN0000892	Their territory has extended since he put a fire and blood camp near the NCR, I thought that the soldiers would return but not in strength.
VAN0000893	I think they have enough to do with the Legion these days. At the bottom of the canyon, you will find a cave, enter it. You will come to Miners Cove.
VAN0000894	There are two tents, you can use it. I cloned a key, if you lose it, there is a double in the lobby of the hotel Poseidon Ring.
VAN0000895	If you go, pay attention, you will probably see the goalkeeper, he is there for a very long time ... too long if you ask me ...
VAN0000896	I therefore give you the keys to the tents, and make yourself at home.
VAN0000897	Not exactly no, but Poseidon Ring is not very big you will see!
VAN0000898	There are plenty of strange nooks and disreputable places, but it is quite "concentrated" so to say.
VAN0000899	You should find it easily.
VAN0000900	Thank you. Take what you want here, there are nourishments, ammunition. Make yourself at home.
VAN0000901	Oh my God, Peter! You're back!
VAN0000902	All right!
VAN0000903	Are we going somewhere special?
VAN0000904	I really like that Gecko Armor.
VAN0000905	Everything will be just fine...
VAN0000907	I've already made it a human generality ...
VAN0000908	A woman?
VAN0000909	Hair? Diego likes hair.
VAN0000910	Uuhhh .... A woman for Diego ... Diego would be glad to fuck woman ... Diego follow you humans.
VAN0000911	It's very nice to meet you Vicky.
VAN0000912	Have a look
VAN0000914	Well, okay...
VAN0000915	I can do that...but I may...die!
VAN0000916	I don't know what to say...
VAN0000917	Good moms let you lick the beaters... Great moms turn them off first.
VAN0000918	What's the difference between snowmen and snowladies? Snowballs.
VAN0000920	I went to the mall the other day and saw a hot chick, but when I brought up my V.A.T.S. it said I had a 0% chance of hitting that.
VAN0000921	In Vegas, they'll bet on anything. One casino was ready to let me bet on whether I'd win or lose there.
VAN0000922	Broken pencils are pointless.
VAN0000923	A blind man walks into a bar. And a table. And a chair.
VAN0000924	How many Omertas does it take to screw in a light bulb? 4. One to screw in the lightbulb and 3 to dump his body afterwards.
VAN0000925	How many Kings does it take to screw in a light bulb? 2. One to screw in the lightbulb and 1 to wipe off the hair gel.
VAN0000926	How many Nightkin does it take to screw in a light bulb? I have no idea, it was like the damn thing screwed in by itself!
VAN0000927	How many Legion does it take to screw in a light bulb? Are you kidding?! That's women's work!
VAN0000928	How many NCR does it take to screw in a light bulb? 10. One to screw in the lightbulb and 9 to collect the illumination tax.
VAN0000929	Did you hear about the cannibal who passed his brother in the woods?
VAN0000930	Why don't cannibals eat vegetables? They're too hard to get out of the wheel chairs.
VAN0000931	Goddammnit! Youve been fartin around like a goddamn packbramhin
VAN0000932	I'd love to do it.
VAN0000933	Well... okay.
VAN0000934	Are you joking?
VAN0000935	Okay. I'll go back home.
VAN0000936	Okay. I like that place!
VAN0000937	I can heal myself in battle just fine. Just be sure I have some stimpaks in my bag.
VAN0000939	Sure. I'll now heal myself when at about 30% health, and use 2 Stimpaks.
VAN0000940	Glad to see you! You slept a long time. So how was the effect?
VAN0000941	It is for you to tell me.
VAN0000942	Yes, uhhh, that is ... We lost you for a few hours, we couldn't find you for a while...
VAN0000943	You run away, saying that the jars were explosives. From there you repeated that mama bear looking for his babies.
VAN0000944	Yeah. You told me you heard the cub crying.
VAN0000945	It looked downright creepy your story Six, you scared me enough anyway.
VAN0000946	I wanted to stop you, but you got angry, I really thought you were going to shoot me.
VAN0000947	Yeah .. but I do not know what is in this potion you drank but it was nag I can tell. Some kind of DatuRad maybe.
VAN0000948	I saw fiends make concoctions of it when they ran out of jet.
VAN0000949	The result is not pretty to see. This is extremely dangerous.
VAN0000950	You ran away in the caves near the coast. I lost sight of you for a second and you disappeared.
VAN0000951	I found you 5 hours later, sleeping on the beach, you wore this bear costume and you squeezed a key and a weird teddy bear in your arms.
VAN0000952	A ranch?
VAN0000953	Yes .. I see ... Anyway, I found the lock! It was easy, the key is the twin of the key of this tent. It opened the tent just next!
VAN0000954	So I allowed myself to install a few stuff.
VAN0000955	But why do you repeat everything I say? Are you okay? You're sure?
VAN0000956	Yes, I placed some stuff, small things, I cooked a bit too, I thought you'd be hungry once you awakened.
VAN0000957	Check in the fridge if you want!
VAN0000958	hahaha yes. Come eat, if you could see your head, if it was not already the case, I would bet that someone just exhumed you.
VAN0000959	You want me to go with you? What a joke. You don't know me...
VAN0000960	Okay. But, you know... I'm like an old Plymouth. I need some fuel.
VAN0000961	Bring me back 6 whiskeys, 6 MedX and 6 Stimpaks...
VAN0000962	and maybe I'll follow you.
VAN0000963	You have the things I asked you? Well, shit...
VAN0000964	I thought you were kidding! I just said that to make you go away!
VAN0000965	But... now that you're here, and with all this... well...
VAN0000966	I will make some bottles of my special whiskey!
VAN0000967	Let's hit the road together, my dear, weird new friend!
VAN0000968	Courier... 6? Pfft. Whatever floats your boat, man. Anyway, let's get out of here!
VAN0000969	Well if you want. But be cautious, the beasts of the Ring are made of sterner stuff than Most.
VAN0000970	I give you the key of Vertibird, just look around and you'll find it. But please come back with the vertibird, don't jump, please.
VAN0000971	Ok then, but for now, if you do not want to end up turned into a disgusting ghoul, we have to go to the basement, it will be safer ...
VAN0000972	Except that damn .. ah ... fuck it we don't have a choice, Go, Lead the way Six, I'll shut the door behind us.
VAN0000973	Glamorous... Sid, I prefere to warn you: I won't clean anything or babysit anyone.
VAN0000974	Ok then, I put the location on your pipboy.
VAN0000976	Oh Shit, again?!
VAN0000977	Wait one second, please...
VAN0000978	Wait one second ..
VAN0000979	Shut up Nabilla, you're mess when you're drunk!
VAN0000980	Sid, you said Six made the job? Maybe it's time to share our secret?
VAN0000981	Yeah.. At the moment we just have to wait and find something to do. Welcome to the brothwood, Six.
VAN0000982	Come here! Good Doc Vanessa will heal you!
VAN0000983	I've got the drive for this shit!
VAN0000984	I won't say that it won't hurt... 'Cause it will. Good luck!
VAN0000985	If I don't take care of that now, it will never heal properly. It'll hurt every time you breathe...
VAN0000986	Don't be scared of this long, rusty needle...
VAN0000987	You're lucky! I kept some whiskey just to disinfect wounds!
VAN0000988	Everything will be just fine!
VAN0000989	Okay. Which of your three arms will I sting? Damn, this needle is completely rusted...
VAN0000990	Oh my God! Who are you?!
VAN0000991	Oh... Excuse me, I am troubled, I am bereaved. My dear husband just passed out.
VAN0000992	Please take a seat, I'll fetch you some coffee.
VAN0000993	Burial place next Tuesday ... it will be very moving. You are invited, if you wish.
VAN0000994	I hope at least that the sun will be on hand, it's more cheerful.
VAN0000995	Oh no that 's my dog.
VAN0000996	It was a very good dog.
VAN0000997	My poor Emile, they cut him in pieces with a sickle ... but in totality, he was very handsome man. Sugar?
VAN0000998	That would be wonderful!
VAN0000999	Just a finger...
VAN0001000	Yeah, yeah, give me some whiskey
VAN0001001	In a old building in Miner's cove. We were going to grab some stuff around there, but we were attacked by a bunch of fiends.
VAN0001002	Take this key, that's all that I was able to save from his scattered body.
VAN0001003	Uh...their...heads? That's very nice, but maybe you could just kill them... or just bring me back the finger of their leader. I'll give you 200 caps?
VAN0001004	With pleasure.
VAN0001005	Very good, good luck!
VAN0001006	Thank you very much, it was not too hard?
VAN0001007	Oh I'm sorry, yes of course, take it, 300 caps.
VAN0001008	I'm sorry, Here 200 caps.
VAN0001009	Yes it is a very old machine. Unfortunately I can not use it.
VAN0001010	I miss some things to make it work. Wire and scissors. Pretty annoying.
VAN0001011	Maybe, I think that Pansea in Miner's cove should have it.
VAN0001012	You still want to do me a favor? That's very nice. So yes, thank you: I put her address on your PipBoy.
VAN0001013	Oh you know I like to stay at home. I haven't seen anybody in a while.
VAN0001014	Isis? She's been gone for over a week.
VAN0001015	Yes I don't know exactly what she does but if you ask me, the bar is just one of her various activities ...
VAN0001016	I mean that bar is not her only business, I think she's hidding something.
VAN0001017	Come back when you want.
VAN0001018	Thank you so much, place them on the table with the machine please.
VAN0001019	Please take this armor it's for your Irish friend.
VAN0001020	Fuck it!
VAN0001021	No, the last time I saw him, he went.
VAN0001022	No, I'm sorry.
VAN0001023	Some gecko's skins would be perfect ... Maybe you hunt the gecko by chance?
VAN0001024	Three would be enough.
VAN0001025	Not yet, very soon!
VAN0001026	Yes! Here, take the scissors and threads to Miss VanDePute and say hello to her for me!
VAN0001027	Thanks God, I did not know how to get rid myself of this bitch!
VAN0001028	Six, Well, thx again. Tell me, just out of curiosity, how did you convince this crackpot?
VAN0001029	Excellent, well done Six. All ends nicely for everyone!
VAN0001030	A shovel? She has a face you wanna hit with a shovel.
VAN0001031	I would even say that her face is asking for shovels ... Sorry ... It was a bit too much.
VAN0001032	I'll take it easy soon, but for that, I have to go home and tell to my wife I'm fine.
VAN0001033	Isis? Yes I saw her, but she left. Are you interested in finding her?
VAN0001034	Good if you're ok, I can't wait to go home!
VAN0001035	You will definitly find her. But if we could go quickly, I really want to go home.
VAN0001036	You have no idea ... Let's go!
VAN0001037	Courtney! I'm finally back home! we can thank Six, you're even more beautiful than when I left you!
VAN0001038	I've got a new home now!
VAN0001039	Yeah I'll have a drink. There's nothing else to do.
VAN0001040	So who else wants a drink? Cass? Whiskey I suppose?
VAN0001041	So who else wants a drink?
VAN0001042	Let's play a little game... Just to know who's the worst alcoolic.
VAN0001043	Six, do you want something? Try this, it's Isis's special brew.
VAN0001044	Do you wanna try it, Cass?
VAN0001045	So, ladies, check out the sign it's true.
VAN0001046	Actually, those gnomes we hunted... they didn't go by themselves...
VAN0001047	Isis and I, work together. We keep our eyes peeled for high quality loot.
VAN0001048	We stole them! Well actually YOU stole them... But In a wonderfull way.
VAN0001049	So, when she came back home, Isis and I had a talk, about you. If you want, you can work with us.
VAN0001050	Yeah, that's it!
VAN0001051	That's fantastic! Of course you can refuse any mission at any time. So welcome to our little brotherhood!
VAN0001052	Oh before I forget: There is an old building in the canyon  ...
VAN0001053	You know, just next door to Courtney and Peter's home: you can't miss it there is a huge satellite dish on the roof.
VAN0001054	Years ago, a hitman went missing in that building, and rumors has it he was carrying good equipment: good armor and some weapons.
VAN0001055	The place will be infested by goules and other disgusting creatures ... It may be just a myth ...  maybe not.
VAN0001056	We found the building but the doors are locked, so we had to steal the keys.
VAN0001057	Here is the key as a welcome gift.
VAN0001058	And I'll put the address on your PipBoy.
VAN0001059	For your first mission you'll need some intel. But you'll need to see Isis to get it. You'll have to wait until the factory's safe.
VAN0001060	Too bad.  Just grab a matress and take a nap.
VAN0001061	Keep it down, no sudden movements we don't want to scare him off, try to lure him into a dark corner, then grab him.
VAN0001062	Try to lure the gnome behind the tall shelves, the cashier won't see a thing.
VAN0001063	Quiet I see him...  just over there.
VAN0001064	In the cage!
VAN0001066	Don't give them to me .... I don't want to be responsible if they run off again.
VAN0001067	Uh ... I ... uh ... I'd prefer you to hold on to them!
VAN0001068	You're a real pal Six!
VAN0001069	He nailed it.
VAN0001070	She nailed it.
VAN0001071	No I have not seen any mutant here ... Just Vicky, the nighkin.
VAN0001072	Many people come to see Isis you know ...
VAN0001073	She's not here yet, come back later, she may be here.
VAN0001074	Isis is my sister. She runs the bar in front of my house. She was away on business, she just returned.
VAN0001075	Chop chop! I need to wet my whistle!
VAN0001076	Famous? What do you mean?
VAN0001077	Nothing, Isis is my sister.
VAN0001078	All this robbing is bad karma for us.
VAN0001079	Didn't your mother teach you it's wrong to steal.
VAN0001080	My mother taught me to fend for myself in life, it was a lesson well learnt.
VAN0001081	Okay, great! Do you want a cigarette?
VAN0001096	Shhh... we're very stealthy
VAN0001102	Starting combat! {Teasing, singsong}Just kidding!
VAN0001122	All out of Stimpaks
VAN0001133	We're out of Stimpaks. {Quiet, depressed}Maybe you'd be better off with an Auto-Doc suit....
VAN0001141	This is my new home....Do you like it?
VAN0001142	Hurry, I don't like having strangers in my house and Pamela is in a bad mood today...

VAN0001146	Yes I know, Pamela I'm .. I'm just a loser ... I haven't been able to keep him... I will stay alone until the end of my life.
VAN0001147	Aarrrgg !!! Human, disgusting human, with those eyes watching me !! You want him right? You want my Peter? Then take this key and find the lock!

VAN0001151	Pamela says that he will be a good husband, he just needs some time to get ... used to the situation...
VAN0001152	Pamela says men are rare here ...
VAN0001153	[FAILED] Arrrg Dirty human! Get the fuck out of my view!
VAN0001154	A deal? With a human?
VAN0001155	I have nothing to lose I think.. Arrrggg Stupid human.. No..  I .... yes, yes ... Pamela said she agrees.

VAN0001162	Yes Pamela says men are rare here. She says I have to find a husband.
VAN0001163	If you find one and if you bring him to us here, Pamela and I will let you take Peter home.
VAN0001164	A big, blue and sexy one!
VAN0001165	[FAILED] Arrrg disgusting dirty humans. Hate the habit they have, looking at me with their eyes... Pamela Pamela Arrrg ok ok, ok...

VAN0001167	Pamela says 50 caps and one husband for me.
VAN0001168	It opens ... ggggrrrr Pamela told me that it opens an old building in the canyon ... She says... there is probably a lot of things inside.
VAN0001169	Pamela is never wrong. We will give you this key if you help us.
VAN0001170	We need 4 stealthboys.
VAN0001171	You want a job, this is what we propose.
VAN0001172	Perfect. Go now, human, your eyes makes me feel really uncomfortable.
VAN0001173	Yes, human. surprisingly enough, you did a good job.
VAN0001174	Now I should keep to my word too, here is the basement key, Peter is inside... and forget about the caps... Diego is an amazing gift.
VAN0001175	Don't be too long! I don't like to wait!
VAN0001176	Well he's there, the one with the hair and wandering like a lost soul!
VAN0001177	I recently met a Nighkin he was on the road to Jocob's town.
VAN0001178	So that's very nice, my outfits begin to smell seriously rancid. Thank you.
VAN0001179	Time for some sneaky sneaks!
VAN0001180	Shhhhhh! Be very, very quiet! I'm hunting wabbits!
VAN0001181	Shhhh
VAN0001182	Keep it down.
VAN0001183	Hey, I'm not some pack brahmin, Six!
VAN0001184	I can't hold anymore...
VAN0001185	I'm not a brahmin.
VAN0001187	Mmm...
VAN0001188	Mm... Mmm!
VAN0001189	I don't have any more ammo!
VAN0001190	Shit... I need to take a piss...
VAN0001191	Okay... I need a fucking drink...
VAN0001193	Ok then I'm off to Vegas.
VAN0001194	Damn! You're high as shiiiiit!
VAN0001195	Ok, cool!
VAN0001197	Ok, I'm all over it like a rainbow on an oil slick.
VAN0001198	What the hell is that shit? That s what I'm already doing.
VAN0001200	Dude, make up your mind, are you a sandwhich short of a picnic or what?
VAN0001201	Ok.. Then I'm off
VAN0001202	Ok, cool.
VAN0001204	What's the plan Stan?
VAN0001207	Okidoki, let's roll
VAN0001208	Okay, I'll try that!
VAN0001209	Do you know Vanessa, the Reaper?
VAN0001210	I'll do my best!
VAN0001211	Well... okay!
VAN0001212	Ok, if I have to.
VAN0001213	Just be sure I have some ammo. My own weapons require 5.56 mm and 10 mm.
VAN0001214	That's what I'm talking about.
VAN0001215	Mmh...
VAN0001220	I like the way you die, boy!
VAN0001222	Take that!
VAN0001223	Do they really have to die?
VAN0001224	Let's take out these assholes!
VAN0001225	Get ready to fly, bitch!
VAN0001226	You wanna piss me off?
VAN0001227	Let's go to work!
VAN0001228	Hello, you poor devil!
VAN0001229	Waste of ammo...
VAN0001231	Duty calls!
VAN0001232	This is gonna end in a bloodbath!
VAN0001233	I ain't got time to bleed!
VAN0001234	Say hello to my little friend!
VAN0001235	Let's swim a bit, shall we?
VAN0001236	Look at that clear water!
VAN0001237	Rectification: this is not the Wizard of Oz... This is... I don't know what the hell it is. But, it's asking for a bullet.
VAN0001238	The Legion's crazy. It seems that they have planned a little sordid game.
VAN0001239	Bitter Springs was a big mistake, but what happened here is atrocious... and it was intentional.
VAN0001240	Ah, shit! This is disgusting! I gotta have a shot. I don't wanna puke my guts out!
VAN0001241	What the hell happened here?
VAN0001242	Oh, shit. House finally got lupus... That's just disgusting.
VAN0001243	The Great Khans relocated here after the Bitter Springs Massacre... That's when the NCR killed a large number of non-combatants.
VAN0001244	Hey, Mister Wizard. I wonder what would happen if I leaned on this button...
VAN0001245	If we untie them, they'll die...
VAN0001246	This is horrible!
VAN0001247	HELIOS One was constructed before the war by Poseidon Energy.
VAN0001248	For the past century, Bitter Springs was used by the Great Khans as a semi-permanent community.
VAN0001249	Today, Bitter Springs hosts refugees from settlements that have fallen to Caesar's Legion; a situation that is becoming increasingly untenable...
VAN0001250	There were some recent incursions here, between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel... NCR can be a real damn pain sometimes...
VAN0001251	The Big Horn Saloon. Hells, yeah! Let's get a drink!
VAN0001252	Since the Bitter Springs Massacre, the Great Khans have been resorting to petty drug dealings and battles by proxy with the NCR...
VAN0001253	If someone wanted to know what a fish is, there is definitely some here... Just saying.
VAN0001254	Be careful. The road to the west of the cemetery is a dangerous place.
VAN0001255	The Bitter Springs Massacre... all caused by the NCR's 1st Recon, who mistakenly shot down dozens of young, old, and wounded Khans...
VAN0001256	The old world democracy is back...
VAN0001257	Bitter Springs... with a name like that...
VAN0001258	Okay, I need a fucking drink.
VAN0001259	The wasteland can be beautiful and horrible at the same time...
VAN0001260	I have some medicine if the cazadores attack you. Just ask me if you need it.
VAN0001261	I love the Mojave.
VAN0001262	Do you have some whiskey, or something?
VAN0001263	I need a drink. Hey, Six! Did you hear me? I can say that for hours if you don't give me any whiskey! Hey! I'm talking to you!
VAN0001264	Hey, Six. Six. Six? Six! Gimme some whiskey. Gimme some whiskey! Gimme some whiskey right now! Ugh!
VAN0001265	Baby... I need some whiskey in my life. Oh, oh, oh, oh, baby! I cannot live without you, oh whiskey, baby. damn, I'm thirsty, and bored.
VAN0001266	Do you have some whisk... oh, fuck it! I feel like I say that all the time! Just give me some God-damn whiskey, and I'll stop complaining about it!
VAN0001267	Okay, now I need a drink!
VAN0001268	I miss DC... but I love the Mojave.
VAN0001269	I think I'm gonna be sick.
VAN0001270	The Legion's crazy! It seems that they have planned a little sordid game.
VAN0001271	It is here that someone tried to put a bullet in your brain?
VAN0001272	This war totem... Y'know, my mother was from a tribe. Dad always liked savage girls... Must've been because of their exotic beauty or something.
VAN0001273	I need to go wee... Y'know, tinkle...?
VAN0001274	I dream of a hot bath... with bubbles.
VAN0001275	It's so beautiful! I mean, just look at that view!
VAN0001276	Do I have time to bang one of these chicks?
VAN0001277	Uh... uh...
VAN0001278	Tasty... Shit, did I say that out loud?
VAN0001279	All right, ramblers! Let's get rambling!
VAN0001280	Wow. It'is hot in here, don't you think, Six?
VAN0001281	Doc Mitchell is awesome!
VAN0001282	Well, I see a campfire, if we need it.
VAN0001283	I will fall flat on my face...
VAN0001284	Shit, I need to take a piss.
VAN0001285	I'm just plastered...
VAN0001286	Wow! Wait!
VAN0001287	People here were not the best humans we can imagine, but nobody deserves this...
VAN0001288	Goodsprings and its crows... Do you know a pre-war book with a crow named "Nevermore"?
VAN0001289	I smell jet, and some sort of tox... you'll probably find some medicine here.
VAN0001290	It stinks here... or is that me? Oh, phew, no... No, it's not me.
VAN0001291	Take care with House. A guy in a screen who needs a sex-bot is hardly trustable...
VAN0001292	I love this place!
VAN0001293	Its betta than safe, its death proof
VAN0001294	I've seen another guy in a screen, in DC... the Enclave... Not a great memory!
VAN0001295	I can't believe I'm in the Lucky 38!
VAN0001296	I never thought I'd be here one day. It's incredible!
VAN0001297	If you go to Nellis, take this rocket souvenir with you. I hear the kids there like them.
VAN0001298	This "House" is probably an asshole, but this flat is awesome!
VAN0001299	This" House" has some real good arguments to convince you, I confess...
VAN0001300	The real Wizard of Oz! Awesome! So... Okay. Where is the bar?
VAN0001301	You have a new friend. A guy... in a box. That's great.
VAN0001302	It smells like weird fried meat...
VAN0001303	Kids here like toys.
VAN0001304	Take care here. You could be smashed in one second!
VAN0001305	I hate these animals. They're not a dog nor a gecko. It's just too weird!
VAN0001306	I like coyotes... I don't like to kill them.
VAN0001307	I smell a deathclaw...
VAN0001308	It smells like there are ants in here... Stay alert!
VAN0001309	The Kings... They keep the water for themselves. If you want to buy some, it's really expensive.
VAN0001310	It's not a giant gecko. It's probably a tyrannosaur.
VAN0001311	I think the kids would love your rocket souvenir.
VAN0001312	I love that giant dino.
VAN0001313	Dinky, the Dino!
VAN0001314	The NCR made a big mistake in Bitter Springs. It's time they atone for their acts.
VAN0001315	Nice painting...
VAN0001316	What a cute place!
VAN0001317	Atop of this hill is a longhouse where Papa Khan, leader of the Great Khans, holds "court," so to speak.
VAN0001318	You've been amazing!
VAN0001319	New Vegas at night is like nothing else!
VAN0001320	The Khans were a rude gang, but now they've changed.
VAN0001321	There is a nice super mutant here.
VAN0001322	What a beautiful place!
VAN0001323	This place was a vacancy station in the Old World.
VAN0001324	The Red Rock Canyon. I love this place! Just so beautiful...
VAN0001325	If we could kindly move out of here... I hate this place.
VAN0001326	I hate this place. It smells like jet, psycho, and tox rolled into a nasty-ass joint.
VAN0001327	If we could kindly move on outta here now...? I hate this place.
VAN0001328	If you want to go inside one of these casinos, keep a hidden weapon on you... you never know!
VAN0001329	Watch your caps. They go quick here!
VAN0001330	It stinks in here! Or is that me? Oh, no, it's not me!
VAN0001331	It smells bad in here.
VAN0001332	Look at these slaves. It's a real shame.
VAN0001333	The Legion...
VAN0001334	These guys are a bunch of frustrated misogynists.
VAN0001335	This place is just freakin' creepy.
VAN0001336	There is everything we need here!
VAN0001337	Look at that! We can see all of the Mojave from here!
VAN0001338	This place should be open to public! What an amazing potential! I think your Wizard... I mean... Mr. House, is definitely looking for something else.
VAN0001339	Let's get a drink. So, what do you want? Whiskey? Vodka? God, there's everything in here!
VAN0001340	Hey Barkeep!! Get yer ass back over here, I want scotch!!
VAN0001341	This House has some real good arguments to convince you, i confess...
VAN0001342	They keep the water for themselves. If you want to buy some, it's really expensive.
VAN0001343	Freeside... The King... that place is more violent than ever!
VAN0001344	Just be sure I have some ammo.
VAN0001345	Of course Sir.
VAN0001346	Of course Madame.
VAN0001347	Maybe actually. I need some eggs.
VAN0001348	Could you find Billy in Poseidon's Ring and ask her if she kept some eggs left for me, please?
VAN0001349	Thank you, I'll cook something for you!
VAN0001350	Take care of my stuff!
VAN0001351	Depends on the question.
VAN0001352	I'm not sure that's your business...
VAN0001353	Stop it!<Karma>
VAN0001354	Don't you ever talk to me like that again!<Karma>
VAN0001355	Let's trade equipment!
VAN0001356	You can also give me some food. If I'm not in combat, I'll heal myself.
VAN0001357	Hey! Ugh! Ah well
VAN0001358	What's yours is mine.
VAN0001360	Hand it over.
VAN0001362	Hehehe, of course!
VAN0001363	Oh, your video card probably can't handle my jewelry. Here, I'll take 'em off.
VAN0001364	Croa!
VAN0001366	Excellent
VAN0001367	Stop being such a pussy.
VAN0001370	Let's go
VAN0001371	Oh, yes.
VAN0001374	Okay. Don't forget the whiskey!
VAN0001375	Okay, but be careful. I can't heal you all the time!
VAN0001376	Okay. Now, where is the bar?
VAN0001380	Croaw
VAN0001381	Come back if you need anything else.
VAN0001383	Take care, a good customer is a customer alive!
VAN0001384	Have a nice day in the canyon!
VAN0001385	Yeah yeah..
VAN0001386	Yeah, stranger? What do you need?
VAN0001387	Yes, stranger? Do you need something?
VAN0001388	What's up, Six?
VAN0001389	Isn't it fine to chill out with me? Huh, Six?
VAN0001390	Hey Regis, let's play a game!
VAN0001391	Let's go Regis!
VAN0001392	I like your hair!
VAN0001393	What's up Vanessa?
VAN0001394	Hi Vanessa!
VAN0001395	What's up Sid?
VAN0001396	Hey Cass! How are you?
VAN0001397	Hi Veronica, what's up?
VAN0001398	Hi Rex! Good boy!
VAN0001399	Hey Raul! What's up?
VAN0001400	Six, thank you for giving me back my Peter!
VAN0001401	I will never forget what you made for us.
VAN0001402	Thx again for what you did, you're a real friend.
VAN0001403	Hey Six, my friend, what's up?
VAN0001404	You're a real friend, Six.
VAN0001405	Are you drunk? It's me!
VAN0001407	Oh, don't look at me like that. What do you need?
VAN0001408	Is that a pistol in your pocket, or are you happy to see me?
VAN0001409	I told you to change, but you're definitely a degenerate son of a bitch!
VAN0001410	A cap for your thoughts?
VAN0001411	Some assholes are shooting at us... Just saying...
VAN0001412	This is really nice!
VAN0001413	You know, I like the Atomic Wrangler. For people looking for a little peace and quiet, this is an ideal place!
VAN0001414	The NCR seems to like you... Maybe you're right, they can help. But keep your head level, okay?
VAN0001415	Victor... This little robot is obviously hiding something. We need learn what it is, soon.
VAN0001416	Whoa! It's the monorail to the Strip!
VAN0001417	The Legion is calling you, right? We should use them, and when they're yours... you kill them all! These assholes deserve it. Show em no mercy, Six.
VAN0001418	Well, that was... intense as fuck. It was awesome!
VAN0001419	At least we're still alive.
VAN0001420	At least we made it another day!
VAN0001421	Can't you see I'm very busy doing... nothing? Wait... haven't I said that before somewhere...? Ah, nevermind.
VAN0001422	You know I love chatting with you, but do you really think this is the best moment?
VAN0001423	It's not the best moment to flirt with me...
VAN0001424	You smell like jet... or psycho, or some of  that shit...
VAN0001425	Are you drunk? I can smell the whiskey from here!
VAN0001426	Your breath is getting me drunk...
VAN0001427	Okay, we're both drunk as hell!
VAN0001428	Great, you're back!
VAN0001429	Shall we go?
VAN0001430	As you can see, I'm very busy doing... nothing.
VAN0001431	Oh, dammit! What?! Can't you see we're hunting shitheads?
VAN0001432	What? We're fighting now, not drinking tea with your grandma!
VAN0001433	Uhh?
VAN0001436	Amazing, but what do i see here? Some sick people!
VAN0001437	Hi
VAN0001438	Bonjour?
VAN0001439	Hello sweat heart.

VAN0001447	Nevermore is doing her job. And it's because of you, thank you again.
VAN0001448	Did you see Nevermore?
VAN0001449	Hey, you're back, thank you for Nevermore! You're awsome!
VAN0001450	Hey how are you? want to buy some eggs?
VAN0001451	Hey, are you hungry?

VAN0001453	Hey, what's up? Did you bring the eggs to Pansea?
VAN0001454	Welcome stranger, what can I serve you?
VAN0001455	Hi, what can I serve you?
VAN0001456	Hi, what can I do for you today?
VAN0001457	Welcome to the common house stranger.
VAN0001458	Don't look at me like that!
VAN0001459	Hello! I'm not even going to ask you what you're doing here, your face speaks for you! The road has been difficult, has it not?
VAN0001460	Do you have news of Peter?
VAN0001461	Hey my friend, how are you?

VAN0001466	Hello! So, did you turn this zombies into dead meat?

VAN0001497	Vanessa is gone to the L38.
VAN0001498	What a charismatic person you are!
VAN0001499	You seem less charismatic...
VAN0001500	Vanessa didn't show anything ... but she was sad.
VAN0001501	But as you didn't lie to her, she respects you.
VAN0001502	You'll find some new options in her dialogues menu.
VAN0001503	The Anarchist CookBook, first published in 1971, is a book that contain instructions for the manufacture of explosives, rudimentary telecommunications phreaking devices, and other items. The book also includes instructions for home manufacturing of illucit drugs, including LSD. It was written by William Powell at the apex of the counterculture era in order to protest United States Involvement in the Vietnam War.
VAN0001504	Give that book to Vanessa and let it in her inventory, maybe it could increase some of her skills and capacities if she reads it, after all, her friend Jessy, gave her some tips in DC... ;)
VAN0001505	Remove the Rug
VAN0001506	Hide the door
VAN0001508	Inside this book, you find an note from Vanessa about her dad:
VAN0001509	Dad claimed his father named him after his favorite comic book character, Proinsias Cassidy, an Irish vampire from this comic book series preacher", created by Gath Enis and Steve Dillon."
VAN0001510	The Saloon is temporary closed, come back later.

VAN0001535	Once Upon A Time,
VAN0001536	A nice bear mum lost her 12 babies.
VAN0001537	People say we can hear them crying in the night.
VAN0001538	Please, Find her 12 babies.

VAN0001544	One day I found a big book buried deep in the ground. I opened it but all the pages were blank.
VAN0001545	Now Vanessa and you are friends:
VAN0001546	You can acces to a part of her apparel menu and she can heal you!
VAN0001547	That's weird, I already saw that book when I was on drug...
VAN0001548	It's exactly the same bottle of potion than in my dream.
VAN0001549	Billy the kid is definitly involved in the creation of the potion I drunk.
VAN0001554	You fixed the radio.
VAN0001556	Place the thread spools and the scissors
VAN0001571	Sidney: Poison Removed!
VAN0001572	Vanessa likes you more now.
VAN0001573	You can acces to all her apparel menu and some other functions!
VAN0001574	All Lights
VAN0001575	That wall can be destroyed. Maybe with some C4.
VAN0001576	Vanessa won't craft if she is in combat mode.

VAN0001581	Vanessa is Dead!

VAN0001584	Lucky 8 Ball! Your chance has increased!
VAN0001585	You seem less lucky...
VAN0001586	For a minute Rose of Sharon sat still in the whispering barn. Then she hoisted her tired body up and drew the comfort about her. She moved slowly to the corner and stood looking down at the wasted face, into the wide, frightened eyes. Then slowly she lay down beside him. He shook his head slowly from side to side. Rose of Sharon loosened one side of the blanket and bared her breast. You got to," she said. She squirmed closer and pulled his head close, "There!" she said. "There." Her hand moved behind his head and supported it. Her fingers moved gently in his hair. She looked up and across the barn, and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously."    John Steinbeck.

VAN0002167	Unlike a fragmentation grenade, stun grenades are constructed with a casing made to remain intact during detonation, containing most of its explosive force and avoiding shrapnel injuries, while having large circular cutouts to allow the light and sound of the explosion through.

VAN0002190	Things fall apart, the CENTRE CANNOT HOLD
VAN0002191	Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world

VAN0002201	A shape with lion body and the head of a man,

VAN0002217	Maybe I should lay off the whisky. Just a little...! Cannot remember where I put my guitar.
VAN0002218	This nice lady with the pretty hair borrowed it. She wanted someone to play for her on the radio.
VAN0002219	But I don't think she asked him because a ghoul cannot play a guitar. He'd lose his fingers.
VAN0002220	But I can play for her if I could remember where she lives.
VAN0002221	Any maybe get a pair of cute glasses like hers...
VAN0002222	Dear Jessi
VAN0002223	How are U?
VAN0002224	My heart problems...I had almost forgotten them when i was in DC. Sadly, they've come back thx to this heat... I definitly have  the family's heavy heritage.. With the swelling and edema. Don't i just feel so sexy? Last week, I thought the Grim Reaper was gonna get be for sure. I was trying to track down a bunch of junkies... But i was sweating so bad  that one of them had the gull to jokingly ask me if I was suffering from withdraw symptoms... I felt dizzy, Everything was blur... My chest ached so badly that i had to cling to a wall to keep me from falling. I must've brought back some memories because that jeckass decided to dangle a dose of psycho in my face... I could hear his sarcastic laughter tinkling in my ears as he walked away from me. And I just stood there, leaning against that wall in the ruins... After that, i decided to find a safe place to stay for a while.
VAN0002225	I found a nice little town, with a nice little bar that sells nice little bottles of whiskey. I kept enough caps and medicine on me, just to be safe, but there is a doctor here, Doc Mitchell. He helped me as much as he could even if he didn't have the skills for the heart surgery i need. Though he did tell me about a guy in Freeside who kept a pre-war book on Advanced surgical methods and robots in his bag...Here's hoping I don't have a new crisis by then...

VAN0002786	Vanessa, please, try to understand me. I'm sorry...
VAN0002787	I'm sorry. If you want to leave me now... you can.

UNC0000026	Trade secret. I'm running a reputable business here. It's all above board - which is why that wasn't your stuff. Just looked like it, is all..
UNC0000027	Thanks for getting me outta there! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
UNC0000028	Expanding isn't a bad idea... Alright then.
UNC0000029	Huh, Very well.
UNC0000030	[SUCCEEDED] ... I suppose it's alright.
UNC0000031	[FAILED] I don't think so... Crazy wastelander.
UNC0000032	Hey, that sounds good to me... Thank you kindly!
UNC0000033	Yeah... Anything else I can do for you?
UNC0000034	Fine by me. Anything else I can do for you?
UNC0000035	Really? Huh... Let me see what I can do.
UNC0000036	You got it... Let me see what I can do.
UNC0000037	[FAILED] No deal. Will there be anything else?
UNC0000038	Sure, we got a deal! Pleasure doing business with you.
UNC0000039	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I suppose I can cut you a deal.
UNC0000040	You drive a hard bargain. Here you go... Have a nice day.
UNC0000041	Only thing that's not right here is you. Better go find that brahmin you lost, huh?
UNC0000042	No no.. you don't understand, I can't.. He, he'll..
UNC0000043	[SUCCEEDED]O-ok. Name's Tom Dooley. Tough guy. Ex-military or something, don't know for sure. Heard rumors he killed some girl. Stabbed his own gal!
UNC0000044	I lost near everything when I first came here and so I looked after the brahmin.. That dried up, then he came by.
UNC0000045	He saw how well trained I had Betsy and had an idea.. It just seemed like a way out! I didn't mean nothin'! But he's a mean sort! I can't cross him!
UNC0000046	[FAILED]Haha, you think? He'll kill you, and I'm next! You know what? I'm gonna get me a headstart!
UNC0000047	You showed him the note already? Oh lord, I'm a dead man. Take the damned brahmin, I wish I'd never set eyes on it!
UNC0000048	N-Now let's not be hasty here! He was probably the one who rustled her in the first place! I just found her wandering around, I swear!
UNC0000049	You better know what you're doing. I'll be waiting here... for now.
UNC0000050	Really? Thank you so much, I feel like I've got a second chance on life... Don't know if I deserve it, all things considered...
UNC0000051	Take Betsy, she deserves an owner with a good heart like you. I loved that old heifer, but I need to get away from all this now. Good luck to you.
UNC0000052	Well... I guess that's good! Thanks, I'm sorry I ever crossed you. I guess I'll be leaving this place now.
UNC0000053	Well ok, but please, for my sake, don't you dawdle.
UNC0000054	Then I'm a dead man... Thanks for nothing.
UNC0000055	You tricked me! I trusted you! You son of a bitch! If i'm going to hell, I'll be taking you with me!
UNC0000056	A snake! A no-good snake that's what you are! Nothing good will come of this, I warn you!
UNC0000057	Son of a bitch... I'm ruined..
UNC0000058	He-he forced me to! I couldn't say no! I didn't mean nothing personal! I got no pull with him, I'm real sorry but you'll have to get it back alone.
UNC0000059	You want the brahmin, you take her! I'm gone!
UNC0000060	If I told ya, I'd have to kill ya!
UNC0000061	Oh yeah? You're messing with a guy who specializes in the sale of weaponry - I guess you get to sample the merchandise!
UNC0000062	You want this stuff, you pay for it.
UNC0000063	[SUCCEEDED] ...Yeah, this ain't worth it. Was a bunch of useless junk anyway. Take it.I hope you choke on it.
UNC0000064	[FAILED] A hustler in Freeside? Someone alert the media! You want this shit back, you can pay for it. Idiot.
UNC0000065	Hmm.... I'm listening.
UNC0000066	[SUCCEEDED]Yeah...You look the type, and you had some good gear. If you can get stuff of this quality on a regular basis.. It's a deal kid!
UNC0000067	In fact, fuck it, to show there's no hard feelings I'll even give you a few more caps per item than I normally would.
UNC0000068	Anyways, this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!  Don't let me down.
UNC0000069	[FAILED] Haha bullshit kid, what was the last thing you stole? Candy from a baby?
UNC0000070	You mean you didn't work it out yet? That hayseed Hargrove out past the gate there is working for me. It's his brahmin.
UNC0000071	I'll tell that useless hick Hargrove to give you the brahmin back too - assuming you didn't already do for him. Ha - If you did, good on you!
UNC0000072	The brahmin scam ain't nowhere near as profitable as it used to be, and that heifer of his is getting ornery. Maybe it's got a conscience, haha!
UNC0000073	Wait a minute here friend, let's not get too hasty. I know what NCR pay is like, couldn't afford some of the fine stuff I got for sale. Good stuff.
UNC0000074	Lot of crazy stuff happening lately. All the violence around here, people just disappearin'. If I were to disappear, who'd even notice?
UNC0000075	Haha, now that's the NCR I know and love. Now if you'll excuse me, I got a train to catch.
UNC0000076	[The Brahmin pays you no attention]
UNC0000077	[Looks sheepish]
UNC0000078	<Eager moo>
UNC0000079	<Forlorn moo>
UNC0000080	<Grave silence>
UNC0000081	Name's Hargrove. Kevin Hargrove. Don't recollect seeing you around here.
UNC0000082	Then again, so many faces pass by and with the way my memory is, that ain't saying much.
UNC0000083	Well you see, I look after pack animals for the traders round here when they got business in town.
UNC0000084	Well, since the Crimson Caravan got big a few years back they deal with this kind of stuff in house, in that big compound of theirs a-ways from here.
UNC0000085	To be honest, these days I just get the scraps.
UNC0000086	500 caps even.
UNC0000087	You look the prospector type - I can see from all the junk you're carrying. You could be moving ten times the haul each salvage trip.
UNC0000088	You need yourself a gen-u-ine pack animal. Lucky for you, I got one.
UNC0000089	Think carefully friend, a chance like this could change your life better than any Vegas card game.
UNC0000090	Well ok.
UNC0000091	Does it now. Well I assure you that you never seen that brahmin before. In fact, come have a look for yourself.
UNC0000092	Nope, sorry. Maybe rustlers. Maybe coyotes. Maybe someone was hungry, wanted themselves a brahmin steak.
UNC0000093	I..I had no idea! I just saw a brahmin wandering round and took her in! They all looks the same, right?
UNC0000094	It was already gone, I swear! Look, take the brahmin, I don't know nothin' of no other stuff!
UNC0000095	Alright, let's do business!
UNC0000096	Let's do business!
UNC0000097	Good choice, stranger.
UNC0000098	Good choice!
UNC0000099	Hehe, you're gonna like this stuff.
UNC0000100	Satisfaction guaranteed!
UNC0000101	Ralph, huh? Is that what you do once you smell him? They ain't even on my radar.
UNC0000102	Huh, slander from jealous rivals. Sad really, they can't compete with my superior stock. So they stir shit instead of finding a source as good as mine.
UNC0000103	Haha, Jesus kid, you think those boy scouts are going to do anything? President Kimball is going to come down and give me a personal talking to?
UNC0000104	This is Freeside! NCR don't mean shit here! Get outta my sight.
UNC0000105	Oh.. Oh.. OHH FUCK! I..  Sorry Pal! This is all one big misunderstanding! Here, take it all!
UNC0000106	Whoa whoa! Now I remember, this is the wrong box of stuff!
UNC0000107	I was going to keep this load safe until the owner came by but this guy gave me some junk to sell in another box and I got the two mixed up!
UNC0000108	All a misunderstanding! Here's your stuff. Tell your boss to keep up the good work!
UNC0000109	[SUCCEEDED] [Looking closely at the brahmin you recognize tell-tale markings. This is definitely Betsy]
UNC0000110	[FAILED] [You realize one brahmin looks pretty much the same as the next. You cannot determine if this is Betsy or not]
UNC0000111	Ain't much to tell. They call this town Freeside. The dregs around the stink-hole.
UNC0000112	Folks come here to make it big in New Vegas, get washed up here instead. A lot of dreams died in this town. A lot of dreams[%]
UNC0000113	Well, there's been trouble stirring up lately between locals and NCR squatters, then there's your usual trouble with any town full of junkies.
UNC0000114	That's why you buy yourself one of the fine pieces I'm sellin', then you'll have the edge on any back-alley asshole you could hope not to meet round here.
UNC0000115	<Snorts assuredly>
UNC0000116	Warning! Room breach detected. Unauthorised personnel in restricted area.
UNC0000117	[Betsy is overburdened and is having difficulty keeping up with you.]
UNC0000118	<Smacks lips hungrily>
UNC0000119	However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 10 a tip, now. You game?
UNC0000120	<Happy Grunt>

UNC0000139	<Angry moo>
UNC0000140	<Wary moo>
UNC0000141	The stuff you've been giving me has been selling like hotcakes. I got a lot of new customers and I can afford to spend a lot more on.."stock" now.
UNC0000142	Hey, the last lot of stuff you sold me made a good profit. I've got more caps for... acquiring items from you now.
UNC0000143	So? What happened?
UNC0000144	You looking for top quality pre owned adventure gear? You've come to the right place! If not, then get lost!
UNC0000145	You got something good for me?
UNC0000146	Hey! Forget paying those dolts to be safe around here, you need to take matters into your own hands with my quality pre-owned weapons and equipment!
UNC0000147	Hey friend, I just got a big haul in - everything you need to keep yourself alive in a place like this.
UNC0000148	See? It's ok, these brahmin all look the same - s'easy to get confused.
UNC0000149	Hey, friend! You looking for top quality pre owned adventure gear? You've come to the right place!
UNC0000150	Hey there, don't suppose you'd be looking to buy a brahmin?
UNC0000151	Well you gonna have a look or not? I thought you were the expert?
UNC0000152	You got your brahmin back - now leave me in peace.
UNC0000153	Get lost, creep!
UNC0000154	I think you're confusing me with someone else.
UNC0000155	<Friendly grunt>
UNC0000156	<Disinterested grunt>
UNC0000157	[Betsy eyes you warily]
UNC0000158	Betsy has died.
UNC0000159	Betsy has returned to Freeside.
UNC0000160	Betsy
UNC0000161	Due to her size, Betsy is unable to enter the interiors of most buildings. She will wait for you outside.
UNC0000162	You step outside only to find Betsy - and all the gear in her saddlebags - nowhere to be seen.
UNC0000163	In the dust you see regular hoofmarks heading away from you.
UNC0000164	With Tom Dooley's passing away you can now get your equipment back from his dumpster.
UNC0000165	You already have a non-humanoid companion, so Betsy cannot come with you at this time. However, as you now own Betsy, she will be available to hire from this location if you return with a free companion slot.
UNC0000166	Betsy has given you the Trade Prices perk.
UNC0000167	You have lost Betsy's Trade Prices perk.
UNC0000168	Betsy has been sold.
UNC0000169	You wake up and look around only to find Betsy - and all the gear in her saddlebags - nowhere to be seen.
UNC0000170	Betsy has given you the Water Boy perk.
UNC0000171	You have lost Betsy's Water Boy perk.
UNC0000172	As the creature slumps lifeless to the ground, you swear you hear a distant wail of animalistic anguish, as if in her wrath mother nature herself had sent forth a being forged in the unspeakable energies released by man's arrogant abuse of nuclear power - and put it on your trail.

UNC0000235	I'm working for Tom now. He says to give me the Brahmin.
UNC0000236	500 caps for that pile of old bones? I'll give you 250 tops.
UNC0000237	I found a note of yours. I know what you're doing and I want my brahmin and my stuff back.
UNC0000238	I don't care. After all you've done you deserve everything that's coming to you. Now who is he?
UNC0000239	<Lie> I'm Lt. Anderson, NCR military police. you're under arrest for murder and desertion.
UNC0000240	Betsy, I need to go on alone. You gonna be okay, girl?
UNC0000241	Those things are mine. They were stolen from me, and now you're going to give them back.
UNC0000242	I know all about your plot with Kevin to rip people off using his brahmin.
UNC0000243	Tell me about this brahmin.
UNC0000244	Let's talk about me buying your brahmin
UNC0000245	The Brahmin you sold me - Betsy - is missing.
UNC0000246	Wait a minute... all the things you're selling belong to me!
UNC0000247	Where did you get my stuff from?
UNC0000248	I am looking for someone to buy my brahmin.
UNC0000249	Just look at her. A top quality breed and worthy of at least 1500 caps!
UNC0000250	I want 1500 caps. She's a good brahmin.
UNC0000251	She's worth at least 1000 caps and not one less.
UNC0000252	On the other hand, I rather don't.
UNC0000253	I sell my brahmin.
UNC0000254	Something's not right here. I don't know what it is, but I'm going to find out.
UNC0000255	The note said my goods were sold to a man called Tom, who is he?
UNC0000256	It's ok. Work with me here, I can get us both out of this.
UNC0000257	I already got my stuff back off of a guy called Tom. You sold it all to him, didn't you?
UNC0000258	Some guy by the north gate had the items from her saddlebags. Care to explain how he got them?
UNC0000259	Some guy called Tom has everything that was on Betsy. You sold it all to him, didn't you?
UNC0000260	Military, you say? I might have a plan...
UNC0000261	He won't show his face around here for a long time.
UNC0000262	I killed him. He won't be bothering anyone anymore.
UNC0000263	Sorry, I haven't dealt with him yet.
UNC0000264	Sorry, I got my stuff back but he's still in business in Freeside.
UNC0000265	Hmm, well you see I'm alright, Jack. Guess this is what you get for being an asshole.
UNC0000266	We came to an agreement. Now give me the brahmin and get out of here, old man.
UNC0000267	Oh well, easy come easy go. Now give me what's mine.
UNC0000268	Some guy called Tom has everything that was on Betsy. I know you sold it all to him.
UNC0000269	You are right. Guess what? I better put an end to you instead. <Attack>
UNC0000270	And what source might that be?
UNC0000271	I hope you sell a shovel, because someone's going to need one to bury you. <Attack>
UNC0000272	This isn't over.
UNC0000273	Give me everything back right now or everyone in this town will know the kind of scum you are.
UNC0000274	Umm, I'm gonna tell anyone who'll listen what a dick you are unless you give me my stuff!
UNC0000275	Wait, I often come across... "pre-owned" items myself. This could be worth both our whiles.
UNC0000276	Give me my stuff back, and I'll fence the best things I steal through you.
UNC0000277	Forget it, I've changed my mind.
UNC0000278	One more thing - do you know where the brahmin this stuff was on went?
UNC0000279	On the contrary, you're being made an example of to deter other deserters now battle is certain.
UNC0000280	You're a smart guy. I guess if you gave me those items I could claim I found you dead in a gutter.
UNC0000281	Hey Betsy... That's you, ain't it?
UNC0000282	I don't know what the deal is between you and that guy, but I'm willing to give you a second chance.
UNC0000283	I won't force you to do anything, but I'd sure appreciate it if you'd come with me again.
UNC0000284	You stupid heifer, I should turn you into a leather jacket for what you did!
UNC0000285	You belong to me now, understand? Run away again and I'll turn you into ground beef.
UNC0000286	All a misunderstanding! Tell your boss to keep up the good work
UNC0000287	Business doesn't exactly seem to be booming.
UNC0000288	How much for the brahmin?
UNC0000289	What would I want a brahmin for?
UNC0000290	I don't need a brahmin. Let's talk about something else.
UNC0000291	Nevermind, I'd like to talk about something else.
UNC0000292	That Brahmin in your pen looks awfully familiar.
UNC0000293	Do you have any idea where she could be?
UNC0000294	I KNOW that's Betsy. I'm taking her back.
UNC0000295	I don't believe you. Now where's my gear?
UNC0000296	I have items to fence.
UNC0000297	Not Interested. Goodbye.
UNC0000298	Competition must be fierce with Mick & Ralph's nearby?
UNC0000299	A little bird told me there's something fishy about the goods you sell.
UNC0000300	[NCR] The Republic doesn't take kindly to robbery and extortion carried out against its citizens.
UNC0000301	[Legion] I am the will of the mighty Caesar. For you there will be no refuge, and no agony spared.
UNC0000302	[Kings] Don't be cruel. The King won't stand for this - make it right or it's gonna be cryin' time.
UNC0000303	[Inspect the Brahmin to make sure whether it's Betsy or not]
UNC0000304	Is Freeside really that dangerous?
UNC0000305	Don't shoot! Here you go. <Give Caps>
UNC0000306	Go home to your pen and graze for a while.
UNC0000307	You ready to hit the trail again, old girl?
UNC0000308	<Companion Protocol->Conflict::Betsy>
UNC0000309	Stay close, I need quick access to my equipment.
UNC0000310	Hang back a-ways - you never know when there could be trouble.
UNC0000311	Let's see what's in your saddlebags, girl.
JSA0000001	You're in the company of a master of the advanced weapon handling techniques of the New Canaanites. As long as Joshua Graham is your companion, all shots with .45 Auto Pistols have less spread and are twice as likely to score a critical hit.
JSA0000002	Fine. You'll be back.
JSA0000003	Let's not waste any time.
JSA0000004	You are kind to offer, but no, there's nothing you can do. We don't use chems, but I learned long ago that I'm immune to their effects.
JSA0000005	It's been some time since I've visited... civilized places. I don't have fond memories of them.
JSA0000006	But I have always seen these places from the outside. Fair enough. Go with God, brother.
JSA0000007	But I have always seen these places from the outside. Fair enough. Go with God, sister.
JSA0000008	You're not so certain. Fair enough.
JSA0000009	All right. Go with God, brother.
JSA0000010	All right. Go with God, sister.
JSA0000011	The Lord's work must be done.
JSA0000012	The choice is yours, of course.
JSA0000013	Joshua Graham has returned to Zion.
JSA0000014	Joshua Graham has gone to the Lucky 38.
JSA0000015	You seem much more religious than most people I've met.
JSA0000016	What's that gun you have there?
JSA0000017	I'd like you to go back to the Lucky 38 on the Vegas Strip for now.
JSA0000018	I'd like you to go back to Zion for now.
ULY0000001	Caesar's words... I honored them. I believed in what I followed then.
ULY0000002	But no, I cannot go back. I wandered too far, far enough to know my home was lost to me.
ULY0000003	It's where my tribe was taken. Where another history was put to the blade, lesson taught.
ULY0000004	Now it belongs to Legion... and all the death there now belongs to them as well.
ULY0000005	Done with blame, and Caesar was big on strength making right.
ULY0000006	That history has been written, its lessons learned. Not revenge... just the way of things when you own them.
ULY0000007	Didn't think I'd be breathing to hear you say that. {Beat, [%]...?Message isn't important, meaning is.
ULY0000008	Keep the walks short. Until then, I wait and watch.
ULY0000009	The Mojave awaits.
ULY0000010	We've shown them fear, but not enough. More will come. Lanius... the "Butcher." Monster, Terror of the East.
ULY0000011	Hoover Dam. It's the wall by which this age will be measured, the gravestone of the Mojave.
ULY0000012	If your path takes you there, know you're not the only one. I will not let America die here. Let's end this, Courier, you and I.
ULY0000013	So be it. Until then, I wait and watch, see what the road brings.
ULY0000014	Not my way. If my life burns out here, so be it.
ULY0000015	Still... to have helped carry out such an act, then not face it...
ULY0000016	There is truth in your words. There is a shadow of a nation behind you, the hope of a people...
ULY0000017	Your actions have carried strength. If we must survive to carry its message... then that is what shall be done. I will not let America die here.
ULY0000018	Let's make something new from the old. The Mojave awaits.
ULY0000019	Speeches are things of NCR, words without strength. Actions would have had more voice.
ULY0000020	Lanius. You have forgotten all you were, traded glory for savagery. I'll end you - and your history.
ULY0000021	Vegas is born of the corrupt, the blind, lost, that gather to it. Without them... it would fall dark.
ULY0000022	Yet... You believe. If you believe in something enough, you must be willing to let it burn, lest it claim you.
ULY0000023	There might be something saving in them. That is what you proved to me at the Divide.
ULY0000024	Let its light give you what strength it can. Not for House, but for the families on the Strip.
ULY0000025	If you believe that Vegas does not deserve to die as the Bear does... then I will listen. It is enough.
ULY0000026	The Legion... they carry Old World ideas into an age that no longer needs them, where they cannot live.
ULY0000027	Caesar's words... I honored them. And Caesar was big on strength making right.
ULY0000028	Your actions have carried strength. More importantly... there is conviction in your words, enough to rival a Legate, perhaps Caesar.
ULY0000029	There might be something saving in them. That is what you proved to me at the Divide. Perhaps the shadow of the Bull does walk with you.
ULY0000030	If you feel I do not know the Legion's strength - then I will listen. It is enough.
ULY0000031	The Bear grows without structure, follows a symbol without knowing its history.
ULY0000032	Same symbols as before the war, now a flag carried by a tribe of children.
ULY0000033	Still... There might be something saving in them. That is what you proved to me at the Divide.
ULY0000034	There is nothing more to be said between us. Speeches are things of NCR, words without strength.
ULY0000035	Your actions have carried strength. More importantly... You came from the West, walked there.
ULY0000036	If you speak for the two-headed Bear, I'll hear your words. It is enough.
ULY0000037	There's a strength in that... lack of attachment.
ULY0000038	The Old World died long ago. Anyone who believes they can make it return and everything will be as it was...
ULY0000039	The West. The East. It doesn't matter - the death of either one kills the other, Vegas along with it.
ULY0000040	After this, only one flag will remain over the Mojave. Let it give you what strength it can.
ULY0000041	If we cannot prevent what comes, then let us make our stand here. Two Couriers, together. What I do now is an act of conviction.
ULY0000042	Watch the shadows.
ULY0000043	Perhaps the shadow of the Bull does walk with you.
ULY0000044	Nothing to be gained by me holding them, and more will surface in time.
ULY0000045	Hard to kill... like Couriers.
ULY0000046	I will not let America die here.
ULY0000047	I thought it was the end.
ULY0000048	If my life burns out here, so be it.
ULY0000049	Back to symbols and history, then. Still... it's important to see.
ULY0000050	Then that is what shall be done.
ULY0000051	Didn't think that would matter any more to you.
ULY0000052	There... is a strange honor in that.
ULY0000053	I'm not one for it, either.
ULY0000054	Can do that and one better. I'll meet you above Hopeville, near the Canyon Wreckage.
ULY0000055	Not my way. Just you and me - Courier to Courier.
ULY0000056	Then I will listen.
ULY0000057	Why do you care?
ULY0000058	Didn't think I'd be breathing to hear you say that.
ULY0000059	Just you and me, then.
ULY0000060	Courier to Courier.
ULY0000061	Then there is nothing more to be done.
ULY0000062	This is the ending they deserve.
ULY0000063	Justice of a sort.
ULY0000064	What you did was for the best.
ULY0000065	You have forgotten all you were, traded glory for savagery.
ULY0000066	Something else to answer for.
ULY0000067	If you want these Old World relics, they're yours.
ULY0000068	Can hear the weight in your feet - you're bound for that Old World wall. Hoover Dam.
ULY0000069	But even if there is hope in change... it may not matter.
ULY0000070	That's part of why I'm here. I do this because I care, because I believe it must be done.
ULY0000071	And when I saw the Divide you made, I saw a second chance, a new way of thinking.
ULY0000072	Comes down to perspective, how far one's walked, and what they've left behind. History has proven this. Our history.
ULY0000073	To Courier Six
ULY0000074	Shadow of the Bull
ULY0000075	Why did you help me kill Caesar? You were once Legion.
ULY0000076	I've gathered some materials here. Can you make anything with them?
ULY0000077	House is dead by our hands. What do you make of that?
ULY0000078	How do you think Caesar's death will affect the battle for Hoover Dam?
ULY0000079	I'm sure, but I want you to stay in the area. Lay low in your old camp at Wolfhorn Ranch for now.
ULY0000080	I'm sure, but I want you to stay in the area. Make camp somewhere in the Mojave and lay low.
ULY0000081	You could come with me, you know. Be there at Hoover Dam and help me change the symbols of men.
ULY0000082	Exactly. If what we did at the Divide is to matter, we need to cement it with a victory at the Dam.
ULY0000083	What will history say about you if you spend its most pivotal moments sitting here doing nothing?
ULY0000084	You hypocrite. You say actions show strength, but you want to sit it out while I change the world?
ULY0000085	I'm consolidating the Mojave under House's control. Is this going to be an issue between us?
ULY0000086	I'm going to claim the Dam for the Legion. If this is a problem, speak now.
ULY0000087	I intend to take Hoover Dam for the NCR. Will this be a problem?
ULY0000088	NCR, Legion, House - I've had enough of them all. I'll keep Vegas independent, no matter what.
ULY0000089	I'm sure. For now, go back to the Lucky 38, and see New Vegas for all that it is. Know its history.
ULY0000090	On second thought, never mind. I'm not one to break a partnership when there's still work to do.
ULY0000091	Yes, I'm sure. Return to the Divide and keep watch there until I'm ready for us to travel again.
ULY0000092	Let's get moving. There's a lot of work left to be done in the Mojave.
ULY0000093	Enough talk for now. Let's get back on the road.
ULY0000094	Ulysses' experience as a former Frumentarius of the Legion has left him with a wealth of knowledge in the arts of assassination and subterfuge. While Ulysses is a companion, the damage of your sneak attack criticals is raised by 25%.
ULY0000095	Ulysses has given you the Shadow of the Bull perk.
ULY0000096	You have lost Ulysses' Shadow of the Bull perk.
ULY0000097	Ulysses has gone to the Lucky 38.
ULY0000098	Ulysses has returned to the Divide.
ULY0000099	Ulysses has returned to Wolfhorn Ranch.
ULY0000100	Ulysses has died.
ULY0000101	If you're reading this, I didn't make it to the end of the road with you. Expected as much. Your road is to be walked alone - to join you on it is a death sentence. Others probably feel it too. But I do not regret walking the long road with you. You gave me another life at the Divide - only fair I give you the same in exchange.
ULY0000102	No, you gave me more than that at the Divide. Showed me a world that could be. A world that is waiting to be born. A world made from conviction and action, that stands tall above the ruins of old. Too many chain themselves to the Old World - they borrow ideas, beliefs, appearances, identities from a world that died long ago. But not you. You leave it behind, learn from it without becoming a slave to it.
ULY0000103	Who are you, that do not know your history? A question I asked the Old World. A question I asked you. A question I asked myself. So many in the Mojave do not know the answer. They carry flags without knowing their history, they follow symbols without knowing their meaning. That is why so many - like me - are drawn to follow you. You carry the shadow of a nation to be - you are a nation unto yourself, unbound by the weakness and prejudice of the Old World. You are the voice of the New World, and whatever flag you follow, the Mojave will bow before it.
ULY0000104	To us, America is not dead. I carried it on my back, and now you carry it in your actions and words. You will remake it in your image. America will be whatever you choose to make it. The Mojave is only the beginning. You are the first breath of a new nation. That is your road. I am proud to have walked a part of it with you, as one Courier follows another.
ULY0000105	- Ulysses
