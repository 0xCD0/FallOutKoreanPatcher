1DE0000453	At the center of Megaton's crater sits an undetonated atomic bomb, a remnant of the great conflict that destroyed the world.
1DE0000454	Some of Megaton's first settlers were lured by the misguided hope of entering the nearby Vault 101.
1DE0000455	Some Megaton residents wonder who's really in charge -- Sheriff Simms, or saloon owner Colin Moriarty...
1DE0000456	The members of the Church of the Children of Atom worship Megaton's atomic bomb.
1DE0000457	Word is that Moira Brown, the eccentric owner of Craterside Supply, is looking for assistance on a new project.
1DE0000458	The residents of Megaton feel safe behind their metal walls. Ironic, considering their proximity to a live atomic bomb.
1DE0000459	The fore section of Rivet City is split from the rest of the carrier, and occupied by hostile Mirelurks.

1DE0000462	Rivet City has no holding facilities for criminals, and zero tolerance for crime.
1DE0000463	Underworld has become a haven for disenfranchised Ghouls throughout the Capital Wasteland.
1DE0000464	Underworld was formed in the remains of the Museum of History's special exhibit, which showcased different civilizations' views on the the afterlife.
1DE0000465	The Ghouls of Underworld generally aren't bothered by D.C.'s Super Mutants, but resent the Brotherhood of Steel for turning their back yard into a warzone.
