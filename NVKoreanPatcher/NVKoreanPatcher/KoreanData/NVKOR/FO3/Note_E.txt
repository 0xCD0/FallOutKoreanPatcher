1NO0000007	Note(s):
1NO0000008	During tow, perp entered into a screaming match with the driver claiming presence of an infant in the vehicle.  Upon further inspection after the tow, her baby was indeed in the back seat.  We've since moved the child into the lost and found and are holding it until Ms. Wilkins pays impound fines and retrieves her automobile.
1NO0000009	I'm recording this as a formal complaint on behalf of the U.S. Department of Records. Med-Tek Labs has just sent their last shipment of Fruit Mentats to load into the Prize Redemption Terminal outside of the Rotunda. I do not appreciate this monument to U.S. History being used as a testing ground for Med-Tek. This is supposed to be a place of solemn introspection, not a laboratory. In the future, when we choose sponsors for our exhibits, I'd appreciate being consulted beforehand.
1NO0000010	Please note that the Rotunda cargo lift has now been fitted with a full security lockout system to prevent unauthorized access and tampering. As of today the only way to use the lift from the Rotunda side is to patch a maintenance terminal directly into the floor data ports.
1NO0000011	If anyone has information regarding the swapping of the voice software from our Thomas Jefferson Protectron performer with a radio uplink and frequency software, please stop by my office. I can appreciate humor just as much as anyone, but certain individuals working at this facility feel the need for constant mischief and it has to stop.

1NO0000054	I can't believe I went through all that trouble to leave Navarro and make my way across the country just to get stuck in this shithole. I'll be damned if I'm going to die here.
1NO0000055	Now that we're cut off from Lesko and Wilks, I think we're on our own. The damn ants keep trying to find a way to get inside the house. Even as I'm typing this, I can hear them scraping the walls looking for a way through. I don't know how much longer we can last.
1NO0000056	I'm going to have to find a better way to protect Sheila and Will from those ants. Ever since Lesko came to town, I'm certain they're getting more and more aggressive. Wasteland ants are bad enough, but at least you can run away from them. These would seem to pursue you to the ends of the earth if they could. Call me crazy, but I swear I saw one start a fire the other day. I don't know how this could be happening.
1NO0000057	I've decided to dig up my old sidearm and keep it hidden on me at all times. If those things get too close, I'll blast the antennae right off their ugly heads.
1NO0000058	Some scientist named Lesko moved in with the Wilks family across the street. They are helping him make some sort of a structure on the old lot near the diner. Lesko offered to pay me caps if I helped, but I declined. I dunno who he's working for, but I don't think they're still looking for me.
1NO0000059	Our supplies are running low, and I need to begin foraging for food and some better drinking water. I'd have an easier time if it wasn't for the damn ants. I swear they have a nest around here somewhere.
1NO0000060	These ants are becoming a real pain in the ass. So much so that I had to take a trip to Megaton and buy a better gun to protect my family. It cost me a small fortune... I had to trade every bit of ant meat I had collected, but it was worth it. I'm teaching Frank and Sheila to use it just in case something happens to me. If one of you two are reading this, and I'm gone, I keep the gun in the kitchen behind the old fridge.
1NO0000061	The Nuka-Cola Corporation is pleased to announce to all it's employees that the first shipments of our Nuka-Cola Quantum  are on their way to retailers in the Washington D.C. area! This flagship test market program is the culmination of a three year research program to bring the refreshing taste of Quantum to market. Congratulations to all employees on a job well done!
1NO0000062	The following locations have been accepted into the flagship Nuka-Cola Quantum test program. Please ensure that 1 (one) crate of Quantum is included with their regular deliveries along with the advertising package provided by our Marketing Department.
1NO0000063	1. Paradise Falls Shopping Mart
1NO0000064	2. Super Duper Mart
1NO0000065	3. Old Olney Grocery
1NO0000066	Stage One of the Nuka-Cola Quantum marketing will include: 2 (two) 15 (fifteen)-second television commercials, 4 (four) 10 (ten)-second radio commercials and a highway billboard campaign.
1NO0000067	The spots on TV and radio will tease the consumer with the blue glow of the new drink, never showing the bottle in an illuminated environment. The billboard will show the bottle's blue silhouette on a black background.
1NO0000068	The tag line will be "Try something new... Go Blue!". The name will not be revealed until Stage Two.
1NO0000069	Stage Two of the Nuka-Cola Quantum marketing will include: 2 (two) 30 (thirty)-second television commercials, 4 (four) 15 (fifteen)-second radio commercials and a highway billboard campaign.
1NO0000070	In this stage, the name "Quantum" will be revealed and the bottle shown in full view. We will emphasize the drink's new energy content and flavor.
1NO0000071	The tag line will be "Take the leap... enjoy a Quantum!"
1NO0000072	Stage Three of the Nuka-Cola Quantum marketing will include: 4 (four) 30 (thirty)-second television commercials, 4 (four) 15 (fifteen)-second radio commercials and a highway billboard campaign.
1NO0000073	In this final stage we will aggressively compare the drink to other competitors and show their inferiority using hired actors at "taste tests". The actors will read pre-written scripts approved by our department. The text should give an authentic "on the spot" impression but still clearly point out Quantum's strengths.
1NO0000074	The tag line will remain: "Take the leap... enjoy a Quantum!"
1NO0000075	Test subjects in the Nuka-Cola Quantum program are responding well to the reconfigured taste and the new isotope. The only listed side effects from the group are: 3 cases of dizziness, 1 case of nausea and 1 case of impaired vision. We find from a sampling of 50 that this is an acceptable number of cases and approve this product for production.
1NO0000076	Isotope CE772 has proven too damaging to the initial test group which now needs to be disbanded due to their reluctance to continue in our program. This group has suffered 4 fatalities, 12 major internal organ failures and 32 internal radiation burns. This is an unacceptable number of issues in a given test group and recommend we switch to an alternate isotope (such as CE774 or UR993).
1NO0000077	Isotope CE770 has proven to be a disastrous failure. All of the test subjects suffered severe internal organ failures and died within three days of ingestion. We recommend the immediate destruction of container A32 in the production rooms and suggest switching to isotope CE772. Please send standard "Nuka Condolences" Fruit and Cheese Packages to test group member's families.
1NO0000078	Vampires are beings based in folklore that prey on humans for the purpose of obtaining their blood. In these fictitious stories, the blood serves as both a food source and a center of power for the vampire. It is a common motif in these tales that a victim could become a vampire if bitten by one. Other noted attributes of the vampire are its abilities to change into the form of a bat or a wolf, to become gaseous at will, the ability to hypnotize the opposite gender and increased life span.
1NO0000079	It is interesting to note that the vampire is traditionally regarded in literature as having an aversion to sunlight. Many people believe this may stem from the misunderstanding of common phobias such as photophobia and heliophobia or even the actual physical issue of photosensitivity. In all of these accounts, the subject withdraws from daytime activities and is rarely seen outdoors. In the 18th century, with medical science in its infancy, this commonly gave rise to ridiculous accusations by the uninformed that these people were "strange" or "cursed". This is likely the reason vampires are awarded this attribute in their stories.
1NO0000080	Depending on the cultural source, there are several ways to kill or destroy a vampire. The most common is by driving a wooden stake usually composed of ash, hawthorn or oak through the vampire's heart. In some cultures, the stake was driven through the mouth or stomach as well. Other tales tell of decapitation or immolation being the preferred method of destruction along with anything else that can completely annihilate the vampire's physical form.
1NO0000081	Recovery of the Declaration of Independence seems to be a loss. That damn woman I hired, Sydney, she said she could do it. Haven't seen her in months. I bet she's dead or ran off with the advance I gave her. That's the last time I trust someone. Told Harkness to keep an eye out for her just in case she ever comes back to the city. That's what I get for sending a woman to do a man's job!
1NO0000082	Came to find out through the grapevine that there are a bunch of Lincoln's artifacts still in the Museum of History. I think I may branch out from just collecting documents if I could get my hands on those gems. Only problem is I have to find someone braver than me who can get to the museum in one piece.
1NO0000083	Bumped into a traveler a little while ago who showed me what he said was a fragment of the actual Liberty Bell! Poppycock! The Liberty Bell is still intact and laying in the ruins of Philly. I have funded an expedition to that dump in hopes of having the entire bell brought back to my museum.
1NO0000084	The Constitution of the United States was drafted in 1786 and adopted a year later by the Constitutional Convention of Philly. This document defines the organization of the U.S. government and sets forth the rules and regulations, known as articles. In addition, there are modifications made to the articles by ruling Presidents during their reigns known as amendments. The society owns the only known copy of the document to exist which was retrieved from the ruins of the National Archives in 2256.
1NO0000085	The Emancipation Proclamation was a document issued by the breathtakingly charismatic President Abraham Lincoln in 1862. This executive order was the beginning of the end of slavery in the United States. Although it was issued during the Civil War, making it a war measure, it paved the way for the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution which completely abolished slavery once and for all.
1NO0000086	The Capital Preservation Society is proud to have in its possession a copy of one of the most iconic and prolific speeches in United States history. This speech, given by the astonishingly intelligent Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, November 19, 1863, laid the groundwork for what would later become the basis of democracy in the United States and set the standards for a country with a government "by the people, for the people."
1NO0000087	The Monroe Doctrine was presented in 1823 by the average and unremarkable President James Monroe. The document warns the European powers of the time not to interfere in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere, citing the examples of colonization and puppet governments as possible intolerances.
1NO0000088	Part of our collection is a copy of the formal declaration of war made on Germany during World War II on December 11, 1941 by the government and endorsed by the President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  While the document doesn't evoke the brilliance of other masterworks like the Emancipation Proclamation, it still served as a reminder to the world that the United States wasn't a power to be trifled with.
1NO0000089	Although it is uncertain when the Declaration of War on China was made (some say 2066 when they invaded Alaska, others say 2067 when the first Power Armor suits were deployed to counter their forces), it is the last known document of note authored by the United States Government before the bombs fell. Had the Declaration had the tenacity and might of a stronger President behind it, say Abraham Lincoln, who's to say what the outcome of those tremulous years would have been?

1NO0000093	To: Dan Kobachesky
1NO0000095	From your last mail, it seems we have a deal. I'll give you everything on your list in exchange for the weapon we discussed. Things are getting worse in this Vault with almost half of the residents going crazy. I just want to be prepared. Don't worry, I'll lock the gun in my safe so no one can easily trace it back to your department.
1NO0000096	To: Section 4 Lab Assistants
1NO0000097	From: Professor John Malleus
1NO0000098	Congratulations on a job well done, everyone! It seems like the current WN tests are a complete success, with less than a 1% margin of error. We still have much to do analyzing the data, but I think all of you deserve a pat on the back for excellent work. Let's keep it up!
1NO0000099	To: Richard Rubin, Overseer Vault 92
1NO0000101	Here is the data on Subject V920717 as requested. We are completely baffled as to why someone would behave in this manner after being subjected to the WN experiments. As soon as our autopsy is complete, we'll try and piece together why he went insane. I'm sorry about this, Rick. We'll get to the bottom of it soon.
1NO0000104	We have a serious problem on our hands, and you have yet to answer my last several intra-vault mails or even see me. I have seven more dead. Three other Vault 92 residents have suffered the same symptoms as Subject V920717. How many more of these people have to die before you realize we're in deep trouble? We're alone out here, no one will come to our rescue... if anyone is even left. We have to deal with this ourselves. Please, I beg you to see me immediately and call your goon squad off your living area doors!
1NO0000107	Section 4 is under heavy guard now. I can't even get in without a personal escort. It's my estimate that over thirty percent of the Vault's entire population is now clinically insane and poses a real danger to the rest of us. We have to consider the possibility we may need to abandon the Vault completely. Better to take a chance outside than in here. You still won't speak to me, and any attempt I've made to see you have ended in scuffles with your guards. It's obvious something's going on and I'm going to find out what.
1NO0000108	The command phrase is no longer working against the crazies. I don't know what the hell happened, but I'm losing control of the situation. If we don't get things under control soon, we're going to have a huge revolt on our hands. Malleus is inciting the rest of the Vault into action. I'm afraid by the power invested in me by the Vault-Tec Corporation, I have no choice but to have him killed. What a waste.

1NO0000115	Issue: Air Conditioning System Odd Smell
1NO0000116	Engineer: Zack Foxworthy
1NO0000118	This was nasty. Seems when Vault-Tec built this place, they decided to go ahead and parallel route the waste disposal dumping system with the air conditioning ducts. In some places, the ductwork is corroding, which has spread to the waste pipes. So now we have the waste products leaking into the venting. The airflow through the ducts is carrying the smell into most of Men's Dormitory 1, 2 and 5. Had to climb in there and patch it all up.
1NO0000120	Issue: Wall Deterioration D Level
1NO0000123	Ongoing. I have stress fractures and water seepage in three areas on D Level. I can only conclude that there is an adjoining underground spring or lake that is putting pressure on the concrete walls. I have already patched the stress fractures and used the metal plating that we normally use for flooring to shore it up for now. I recommend we get all the engineers together on this issue and come up with some sort of a more permanent solution, otherwise we'll be knee deep in nasty groundwater or worse.
1NO0000124	Maintenance Code: RL00 Green
1NO0000125	Issue: Squeaky Office Chair
1NO0000128	This huge emergency was immediately addressed by our crack engineering team. We ran up to Professor Malleus's office and deployed the Fluidic Lubrication Injector in an effort to stop impending doom from destroying us all. Okay fine, we oiled his damn chair. Is this really the kind of crap that's worth submitting a trouble ticket for?
1NO0000129	To: Hilda Egglebrecht
1NO0000130	From: Parker Livingsteen, Studio Supervisor
1NO0000131	Hi Hildie. Just wanted to send you a quick note. Our "session" together yesterday was wonderful! I'm glad the studio doors lock, otherwise some of your stuffier fellow musicians might not appreciate how closely you and I work. Make sure when we meet tonight, you bring your delicate instrument, and your violin too. I have an idea of something we can do with the bow; a new technique I've always wanted to try...
1NO0000132	It's so wonderful to be surrounded by all this talent! Little old me, who can barely play the violin, is sitting among some of the world's greatest musicians. I still can't believe my luck!
1NO0000133	Today was great too. I was able to record an entire symphony... Haydn's Symphony No. 3 in d minor. It was so beautiful! I could barely keep up with everyone else in the string section, but they were so nice. They encouraged me instead of being stuffy jerks or something. Best of all, they record all of it and then let you hear yourself play on the studio's speakers. I can't wait until tomorrow... I hear we're doing a piece from Dvorak!
1NO0000134	I've been feeling a little sick lately. Kind of woozy after playing in the studio usually. It gets so stuffy in that place, but it's sure worth it. I know I'm getting better just from watching my fellow violinist's techniques. They don't even mind giving me some pointers. Tonight, a bunch of us girls from the string section are going down to the rec hall for a dance. I hope that cute sound guy Parker asks me to dance. He's dreamy.

1NO0000147	Nan needs to cut it with these crap stories about beasts lurking in the depths of the cave.  Nonsense is scaring the children.  I've set up make-shift barriers until we have time to make permanent ones.  The barriers are there more for my own sanity than anything.
1NO0000148	We've been in this cave for a month now and we've finally been able to get everything settled.  It's nice to be inside and not have to worry about raiding parties overrunning our camp at night.  We're safe here and that's all that matters at the moment.
1NO0000149	The unit designated BGWIN009 "Button Gwinnett" is suffering from a system memory leak. I've had to flush the unit's core CPU several times last month; it's getting all of its orders and directives confused. The unit's reenactment subroutines are interfering with its tour guide subroutines, causing conflicting actions and scaring the visitors to our galleries. Recommend shutdown of this unit and replacement of central core.
1NO0000151	TRT007, one of our automated turrets, is constantly locking in its reset position. It is not responding properly to calibration nor will it track the test targets properly. This is likely due to its tracking array being misaligned with its targeting laser (a common problem in all of our automated turrets). Recommend replacement of tracking array.
1NO0000153	EMT002 unit "Nightingale" is back online after an extensive refit. I've replaced its surgical arm, injector units, gyro-stabilizer system and thruster number three. The unit's central core has been reset and is now ready for service.
1NO0000155	The BGWIN009 Button Gwinnett Unit is designed primarily as a participant in our reenactments of the signing of the Declaration of Independence show.

1NO0000157	The RC hydroponics have been restored to basic functionality - easy enough after all our research. The limited amount of clean water we can produce is enough for growing basic foodstuffs.
1NO0000158	Still no progress on any mass-purification tests, and with all of the maintenance that has to be done around here, there's hardly any time to attempt new experiments.
1NO0000159	In any case, RC wouldn't work as a location for truly large scale decontamination. The infrastructure just isn't here, and the idea of recreating it again is too daunting to convince the rest of the council.

1NO0000169	* Attempts to clear out the Mirelurk infestation in down-below continue as usual. Harkness and team is able to contain them and occasionally wipe them out, but they continue to nest in the area, posing a theoretical risk if they ever turn aggressive towards higher decks.
1NO0000170	* Bannon suggests closing off lower deck fore. Vote fails.
1NO0000171	* Funds and ammunition allocation for a Mirelurk cleaning operation proposed by Harkness. Vote passes.

1NO0000178	* Trader relations good - we continue to be one of the only reliable sources of clean vegetable foodstuff.
1NO0000179	* Bannon proposed raising price of exported fruit by 50%. Vote fails.
1NO0000180	* Li reports progress made with new tweaks to hydroponics system. Further testing necessary before complete success, she says.
1NO0000181	* Danvers reports necessary ship maintenance in hangar deck level. Proposes increased allocation to internal maintenance to prevent decay from progressing to a dangerous point. Vote succeeds.
1NO0000182	* Rumors of increased slave, raider, and Super Mutant activities in DC have prompted Danvers to renew combat training for city guards.
1NO0000183	* Dr. Li called away to handle hydroponics system shortage.
1NO0000185	Apart from the standard dangers, Rivet City provides a few uncommon problems for long-time residents:
1NO0000186	* Lockjaw: Muscle spasms, especially of the jaw, from getting cuts on the rusty ship hull. Treat with penicillin, when available.
1NO0000187	* Red-lung: Respiratory problems from regularly inhaling rust particles - particularly a problem for hangar deck residents and shut-ins. Treat with steam therapy and time outside to flush system.
1NO0000188	* Fish poisoning: Less of a problem nowadays, but occasionally someone finds a fish in the river and is dumb enough to try to eat the thing. Radiation levels spike and mercury poisoning drives most victims crazy. No cure, but at least people nearby get a reminder not to do it.
1NO0000189	Bannon: Still suffering from his "social problem." Keep on penicillin, and try to convince him to watch out in the future.
1NO0000190	Brock: Another day, another broken nose. Rare to see him as a patient, but at least the people he "refers" are still alive. Barely.
1NO0000191	Cantelli, Paulie: Treatment for the steady stream of his addictions would be a steady income, but I can't waste the resources on him if he's just going to get hooked again.
1NO0000192	Holmes, Seagrave: Chronic case of red-lung from all his repairs below-decks. Prescribed a few hours of fresh air up top every night.
1NO0000193	Staley, Gary: Exhaustion. The man really needs to take a rest at some point. But then again, who doesn't?
1NO0000194	Trinnie: Surprisingly healthy, apart from the alcoholism and other chronic dangers of her line of work. Guess they grow them strong in Lamplight.

1NO0000267	An alliance of rebels has formed in my Vault, dedicated to the wholly destructive goal of re-opening the Vault to the outside world. Amata and Edwin Brotch are the leaders of the band, with those ridiculous Tunnel Snakes making up its muscle, along with a handful of other youths and naive idealists.
1NO0000268	Attempts to isolate and demoralize the group are proceeding apace: Edwin Brotch has been jailed for his attempt to lead a direct attempt to open the Vault's door, and their members have holed up in the old clinic and schoolroom. Their dwindling food and proximity to the dangerous "Dr. Andy" are sure to drain the morale from their rebellion, until they give up and are welcomed back into our happy family again.
1NO0000269	It pains me dearly to know that Amata is behind the rebellious element in my Vault. If she weren't their leader, it would be a simple matter to break their spirits and bring them back in line with the Vault's time-proven isolation plan.
1NO0000270	But with her as a central figure in their rebellion, I must refrain from the more persuasive tactics at security's disposal. I will not repeat the mistakes of that night again. The Vault cannot afford it, and I cannot bear to drive my daughter further away from me.
1NO0000271	Despite everything, I take great pride in her natural talent for leadership. When she inevitably comes around, I feel she will make a worthy successor to the position of Overseer.
1NO0000272	The Vault recently received unexpected radio contact over the governmental Vault-Tec frequency, from an organization calling itself "The Enclave."
1NO0000273	Governmental codes are valid according to the Vault's ancient records, and The Enclave put forth an offer of amnesty and unity with the official remnants of the American government, in exchange for access to the Vault and its data stores. They claim that our Vault passwords no longer match their records, preventing them from extending their offer in person.
1NO0000274	After brief negotiation, I have refused entrance to this "Enclave." I cannot trust my Vault and its inhabitants to an unknown factor, much less one that would so gallantly suggest abandoning our vault's great mission.
1NO0000275	All the more reason to prevent the rebels from opening the Vault to the likes of them.

1NO0000277	TOP-LEVEL SECURITY ONLY!
1NO0000278	From: Chief Officer
1NO0000279	Subject: Raid on Rebels
1NO0000280	In light of increased agitation from the rebel elements, I have come to the conclusion that we can no longer afford to be merciful to this scum. While some may hold out hope for a peaceful resolution, it's only a matter of time before they decide to take the fight to us. Or, worse yet, our families.
1NO0000281	I propose a midnight raid into their compound - live ammo, zero tolerance. Make an example of the first two who fight back, and the rest will fall in line. We may lose a kid or two, but we'll save the Vault as a whole, and that's what counts.
1NO0000282	You are not to inform the Overseer and some of our softer security guards about this plan, as they will only object and ensure our defeat. Once the deal's done, they'll see it was worth the price.
1NO0000283	This'll show those scum what happens when you step out of line in our Vault.

1NO0000285	I've finally found a quiet place for my family. We've been running from one settlement to the next, just trying to keep out of sight. Now that I'm on the other coast, I feel mush safer.
1NO0000286	The family across the way from us seems pretty decent. Their kid, Bryan, likes to play with my son, which is great. It's hard for Will to make friends because we haven't stayed in one place long enough. Maybe we can finally put down some roots here in Grayditch.
1NO0000287	I was scavenging some of the nearby buildings for junk to sell and came across a working radio. No sooner did I turn it on than I heard the familiar patriotic anthems they used to play whenever Richardson would give a speech. But this was different. Who the hell is President Eden? When did that happen? Are they on this coast too? Most importantly, will they come looking for me?
1NO0000288	I hope this journey wasn't a huge mistake.
1NO0000289	Dr. Braun,
1NO0000290	Here is the revised code for the military training program you've expressed interest in. I'm not sure exactly what you want with it, and I again stress that this program was never designed to be run with civilian equipment.
1NO0000291	Frankly, I don't expect any system you have access to can even run it.
1NO0000292	But if you can run this program with the failsafes off, as requested... your real-world test subjects WILL die if killed in the simulation.
1NO0000293	It goes without saying that, officially, I denied your request.

I swerved to avoid hitting it, but my brakes locked up and I ended up jack-knifed against the guardrail. I was in the process of delivering a very important shipment to the Old Olney Grocery, so I have called and requested an immediate pickup in front of Old Olney's Firehouse. I will wait there until the tow truck arrives.
1NO0000418	There has been some breakage, but the special shipment is still intact. I am not injured, but the truck is likely a total loss. This is my first incident of this nature with the company, I hope it will not reflect poorly on my future evaluations.

1NO0000422	Bad news.  Rangers haven't seen Cheryl and got troubles of their own.  Muties been snatching people left and right.  Reilly's men are going to keep an eye out round here.   They suggested we head to the western ruins, across the river and search there, so I guess that's what we'll do.  Damn it, sis, why didn't you just wait for us?
1NO0000423	Has to be a month gone since we was at Citadel.  Tracking mutants in the city is no easy job.  Helps to have mentats keep everyone focused, but we still have to be careful.  These green bastards seem like they're on the move.  You never hear em talk about it, but they're looking for something.  And people.  Anyone they can get their hands on.
1NO0000424	Tracking Muties through the city isn't the hard part.  They're good with metal, always ripping up junkers and building crap out of the bits.  Just follow their freak sculpture shows.  Hard part is staying hidden.  Emmet took a bad cut on the leg from one of the spikes., took two shirts to stop the bleeding.  I hope these freaks can't smell blood.  We're headed towards the Citadel, maybe they'll help us patch him up.
1NO0000425	Relief to be outside of the city for a day.  We'll use the bridge and cross over to check beyond the ruins on the west side.  We can't hold out down here much longer.  I can't just give up on Cheryl, but I might not end up having a choice.  Emmet's in bad shape.  We'll wait to cross the bridge until tomorrow.
1NO0000426	RIP, Emmet.  Poor kid left Canterbury so fresh I didn't want him along, but he really came into his own these past few weeks.  He died in the night.  No point bothering with those pricks at the Citadel now.  We head into the city tomorrow.
1NO0000427	Found something.  Muties have a bunch of folks trussed up in a park nearby.  Going to hole up and see what happens.  Too risky to check for Cheryl until we know more.
1NO0000428	Kaya crept down and checked tonight.  Cheryl's not there and most of the people are dead, or close to it.  Still, going to keep an eye on them from here a little longer.
1NO0000429	Bastards are cleverer than they look.  They stake people up, attracts attention.  Saw a couple mercs get snatched investigating.  One didn't put up much fight, they took him alive.  May be hope to find Cheryl yet.
1NO0000430	Stakes aren't just to attract people.  Big 'ol mother came by today, yanked a stiff from one of those spikes and gnawed every scrap of meat off the bones.  Looks like they were waiting for the biggun to pack up.  They're on the move.  I've got a feeling they'll take these folks the same place they must have taken sis.
1NO0000431	Close call today, damn fool brotherhood scout nearly exposed us.  Muties got him.  Poor kid never had a chance.  Finally clear of the city.  Kaya refused to go any further, left for Canterbury.  The mutants are headed west, and I still aim to find where they're taking these people.  Going to be harder to stay concealed out there in the open, but at least I don't have to worry about ghouls crawling up my ass all night.
1NO0000432	JP is a lying, toilet-sucking, good for nothing, rad-brained bastard.
1NO0000433	The stash doesn't exist. We searched everywhere down here and nothing, not one lousy gun. We managed to pick up some ammo,  but that's about it. Now we're stuck here with these damn mutants streaming in and out of the tunnels.  What are those bastards even doing?  I snuck some of our supplies at the end of the southeast tunnel under some debris. There's no way we can sneak past the bastards carrying it all by ourselves. Hell, I'll send JP down here next time to retrieve it - see how he likes it.

1NO0000451	"Whatever shall we do, Mister Wollingsworth?" Molly asked. "Mother will be home shortly, and I've yet to clean my room!"
1NO0000452	"Heavens my, heavens me. Don't fret, Molly-Golly. We'll enlist a little help, that's all." Mister Wollingsworth then waddled his little teddy bear body into the center of the room, and called out - in a voice both sweet and strong - to those lying dormant on shelves, in the toybox, under the bed.
1NO0000453	"Come now, you lot! Molly-Golly needs our help, and as we're her Guardians, that means we all get cracking! Come on now, shake off those dust bunnies and hop too!"
1NO0000454	There then rose a rustle and rumble from all corners of the room, as rocking horse and railway car, bookend and baby doll, toy and game alike all blossomed into impossible life.
1NO0000455	"Mister Wollingsworth! But I  I never knew  I thought it was just you! Oh, this is just wonderful!" Molly exclaimed.
1NO0000456	"Wonderful? Bah! I was having a nice nap and a nice dream, and now you've gone and woken me up. And for what? Manual labor! That wasn't in the job description, Wollingsworth!" This small, squeaky voice of dissent belonged to one Mousy Maguire, Molly's favorite stuffed animal, and one of the few companions granted the right to sleep on her bed.
1NO0000457	"Oh, Mousy! You're alive!" Molly ran to her bed and embraced the nonplussed plushy, squishing his body in a nearly stuffing-bursting bear hug.
1NO0000458	"Aggh! Ohh! All right  Enough! Enough! You're... crushing  me!" Molly released her hold and dropped Mousy back on the bed, feeling at once excited and immensely disappointed that her favorite stuffed toy had just come to life  and seemed to be a complete cretin.
1NO0000459	"Now you listen here, Maguire!" Wollingsworth said. "Being Guardians of dear Miss Molly-Golly means we protect her in any way we can, even if that means unclogging the potty, or taking out the trash, or, yes, tidying up her room! And when the Crawly Creeps come - oh, and they will come - you'll get to do what was in your 'job description,' you mark my words "

1NO0000473	Last time I was there, they told me that someone named the Great One wanted to speak to me, and that I should drink some of their homemade hooch and join them in some kind of ceremony.

1NO0000479	The others left me! They fucking left me behind!
1NO0000480	Okay, I can understand them getting angry because I wandered off. But I thought I saw someone trailing us, so I went to check it out.
1NO0000481	Turns out I was wrong. But I was only gone for like ten minutes! They didn't have to leave me behind. I have no idea where they went, but I guess I'd better get off my ass and try to catch up.
1NO0000482	I'm so glad I did this.
1NO0000483	I've been telling Joshua for years that if you really want to live, you've got to get out there and LIVE! Wander, explore, interact with this crazy Capital Wasteland.

1NO0000495	Sitting here now, alone, I can be completely honest. With myself and anyone who might read this. I've never felt like such a failure in my life.
1NO0000496	To let a man enter your home, and then watch helplessly as he murders your family in cold blood, is more than any person should have to bear.
1NO0000497	Now I can't even find the son-of-a-bitch to give him what he has coming. He kills my children in front of my eyes, and he gets to just walk away? No punishment, no justice? How is that fair?
1NO0000498	I'd kill myself, but I'm sure I'd just screw that up too. I just wish I knew what to do. I just wish God, or someone, would give me some kind of sign.
1NO0000499	Sweetie,
1NO0000500	Listen, I just can't wait any longer. I'm sending this letter, via courier, and I'm begging you to respond as soon as possible.
1NO0000501	Why should we wait any longer? Forget our parents! Every day I sit here and watch my brother Kevin whither away from Radiation Sickness. Am I next?
1NO0000502	I don't want to waste another second of my life. Let's just get married, and make a future for ourselves. Megaton, Rivet City, maybe even Tenpenny Tower. Who knows?
1NO0000503	When I'm with you, I feel like I can do anything!
1NO0000504	So marry me, you fool!
1NO0000505	The Vault 101 maintenance password is "Old Faithful".
1NO0000506	The Vault 101 entrance password is "Amata".
1NO0000507	Hah! I've done it. I've built a Circuit Neuralizer from spare parts using the diagrams rescued from that vault last year. I'm brilliant! I'll show those hacks from the Commonwealth now!
1NO0000508	I stole the mem chip from that jerk Braun. Where does he get off robbing people of their souls like that. Anyway, he's so involved in that simulation of his, that breaking in and taking it was like stealing from a little girl. Of course, I won't know whose memories are on this thing until I integrate it into it's new host. But they never specified, so it shouldn't really matter. I can't wait until the subject arrives.
1NO0000509	I got those memories into that Android like I was God sending down messages from Heaven. Calls himself "Harkness" now. Thinks he's an old combat veteran. Did a little extra tinkering with his reflex system. He's certainly not someone I'd want to meet in a fight. When he "woke up" he was all confused. We told him he was in a coma for a long time. Between the new memories and the new face I gave him, there isn't anyone that would recognize him. Not even himself!

1NO0000514	In the late evening hours of January 10th, brave American Army forces launched an all-out offensive against the entrenched Chinese Communist invaders in the beleaguered seaport of Anchorage, Alaska, destroying all opposition and finally liberating the city after more than ten years of Chinese occupation.
1NO0000515	No red-blooded American can ever forget that terrible winter of 2066, when Chairman Cheng's commie cutthroats mercilessly invaded the icy extension of the United States, in an unprecedented act of foreign aggression that sent shockwaves all the way back to our nation's Capital.
1NO0000516	But the nightmare is finally over, and America, always the home of the brave, is once again the land of the free.
1NO0000519	In a move that is being widely viewed as both necessary and overdue, the United States military today declared that they will begin the immediate annexation of the country of Canada.
1NO0000520	The decision comes after a long and contentious relationship with the Canadian government that began shortly after the Chinese invasion of Anchorage, Alaska in the winter of 2066. The Canadian leadership at that time expressed its opposition to American troops passing through their country or traversing their airspace, but ultimately capitulated.
1NO0000521	Tensions with our neighbor to the north have only escalated since then as the United States has found itself relying heavily on Canada's natural resources - including wood cultivated from the country's great Timberland forests - to maintain the war effort against China.
1NO0000522	But it was a recent near-sabotage of the Alaskan pipeline that finally tipped the American military's hand.
1NO0000523	"That was the last straw," said Buzz Babcock, commander of U.S. forces in Canada. "You know what's been stopping the Reds from pouring into downtown Juneau? American soldiers, that's what. And now we've got to worry about someone - Chinese, Alaskan, or otherwise - taking out the pipeline? I don't think so. Effectively immediately, United States troops are beginning a complete takeover of all Canadian assets and resources. Little America is ours. But let's face it - it always has been."

1NO0000526	It would appear that Washington's tolerance for American social disorder has finally reached its breaking point.
1NO0000527	In a recent public statement, White House spokesman Warren Eccleston said:
1NO0000528	"Okay, Americans are hungry. We get it. Well I've got news for you - things are tough all over, people. The President himself has been forced to substitute cube steak for his nightly prime rib, and the only wine available is a detestable Chateau Montrose 2043. But does he whine? Does he take to the streets like a rabid Red? So please, good people, please. Wait in line. Get your food. And then go home. We're Americans! We do not solve our problems with violence."
1NO0000531	In a startling turnaround from their previous policy of complete covert development, the United States Army has confirmed that they are indeed working on a new super weapon, one designed specifically to crush the Red Chinese invasion force and liberate occupied Anchorage, Alaska once and for all.
1NO0000532	Speaking at an Army press conference at the Pentagon, General Constantine Chase stated: "No more secrets. The time has come to lay all our cards on the table, so the Chinese can see with their own eyes that we've got the winning hand. The United States Army is proud to announce that for the first time in history, General Atomics International and RobCo have joined forces to create for this great country a super weapon that will leave every single yellow-bellied Red shaking in their Commie booties."
1NO0000533	Unfortunately for our readers, that's as specific as Chase is willing to get. While he and the Army are ready for China to know the U.S. is developing a new weapon, they're not quite ready to divulge just what it is, or when it will be ready for deployment.
1NO0000534	"All in due time, all in due time. Rest assured, when this weapon is complete, liberty will come to Anchorage  and Hell will follow."
1NO0000537	In a crushing blow to foreign relations and world peace, the United Nations yesterday was completely disbanded, leaving its member nations to fend for themselves in these trying times.
1NO0000538	Many had considered the United Nations the best hope for brokering a ceasefire between the European Commonwealth and the nations of the Middle East, but such an intervention is now impossible.
1NO0000539	In a somber press conference at the United Nations building in New York City, United Nations president Sakugama Okiri had this to say: "It is a sad day for the United States. Sadder still for the world. An era of relative peace and prosperity has come to a tragic end. The Resources Wars are upon us, and in my humble opinion the United Nations is needed now more than ever. Sadly, the world disagrees."
1NO0000540	Those nations that have not already moved out of the immense headquarters will have completely vacated the premises by the end of the week. Several organizations have already begun bidding on the prime real estate, but children's toy retailer Bumbalo's seems determined to transform the building into their new East Coast superstore.
1NO0000541	I don't know how much longer I can hold on. I'm pretty sure I broke my leg about two miles back, and now I can barely limp forward. So here I sit, writing this stupid journal.
1NO0000542	Oh, and someone's been tracking me. They've been watching me for about an hour now. I'm hoping they're friendly. Guess I'll find out soon enough.

1NO0000561	Bryan Wilks gave me a key to a special cache of items. It's located in a dumpster behind the old diner in Grayditch.
1NO0000562	I've finally come to the realization that the Toucan Lagoon simulation has run its course.
1NO0000563	I'm tired of the beating sun and ceaseless pounding of the lagoon's waves upon the shore. I no longer take pleasure in watching Simpson wither away from scurvy, or hearing Neusbaum's screams as he's devoured by the mako shark.
1NO0000564	I am, quite simply, bored. It is time to reset the simulation once again.
1NO0000565	I haven't been skiing in ages.
1NO0000566	Yesterday, Dithers slipped on the chalet's icy stairs, went airborne, and managed to impale herself on the the wrought-iron fence. It was spectacular! And completely and utterly random!
1NO0000567	Is there anything more sublime than that bold crimson on fresh-fallen snow?
1NO0000568	It was almost enough to make me reconsider a change of scenery. But not quite. 23 years is a long enough vacation in the Swiss Alps.
1NO0000569	I long for something more... domestic.
1NO0000570	I have surprised myself. I find Tranquility Lane... comforting. Although distinctly American, it somehow reminds me of Kronach, the town of my childhood.
1NO0000571	There's a beautiful irony with this particular simulation as well. The residents here are naturally at home, naturally safe. When I toy with them, when their suburban illusion is suddenly broken, it's that much more satisfying.
1NO0000572	I do believe we shall all remain here in Tranquility Lane for a very long time. A very long time, indeed.
1NO0000573	There are days I consider finally "pulling the plug," as it were, and putting a permanent end to both this simulation, and my life.
1NO0000574	That is the reason I requested installation of General Chase's Chinese invasion program, after all. By disabling the safety protocols, I have ensured that each subject in Vault 112 will physically die if their in-simulation avatars are killed.
1NO0000575	Real-world death. End of simulation. The perfect Failsafe.
1NO0000576	At least it would have been, if not for my own misjudgment. I knew, when the simulation first went online, that the secondary safeties  those established for all Vault-Tec and military personnel  would prevent my own real-world demise in the event of a Failsafe execution. In the end, I would kill the subjects, and save myself.
1NO0000577	I wouldn't want it any other way. Or so I thought.
1NO0000578	It's true the Failsafe would scare the living hell out of every resident in Tranquility Lane, and lead to their brutal deaths. But then  what about me?
1NO0000579	I have no ability to disable my own safety from within the simulation. And any other avatars I could create would be driven by the simulation's A.I. routines  not actual living, thinking, human subjects.
1NO0000580	Where's the fun in tormenting a machine?
1NO0000581	And so, the release of the real-world subjects is more than they deserve, more that I could bear. They'd be dead, and I'd be left here in Tranquility Lane, alone and tragically bored for all eternity.
1NO0000582	I can think of nothing more unacceptable.
1NO0000583	Attempt #172
1NO0000584	- Quite close now.  I'm fairly certain the key ingredient is some form of ThermoStarch.  My next attempt will be using Wonder Glue, the adhesive component contains a great deal of the stuff.  Luckily we have a small store of the stuff available here, and I'm offering a handful of caps to the raiders for every bottle they can bring me.  Those greasy villains are handy when you've got the money.
1NO0000585	Attempt #171
1NO0000586	- I've noticed positive reactions with base dextrin substances.  I'll continue testing different forms to see where it leads me.  If there was ever a time for a breakthrough it would be right now.  Masquerading as one of these foul murderers grows tiring, once the theatrics of it wear off.  One thing is true, though - we can all be rich if the experiment succeeds.  Molerat is one of the easiest meats to get hold of, yet the most disgusting.  If I can turn it into a viable food source...
1NO0000587	Attempt #86
1NO0000588	-I introduced a small component of isoprene, didn't seem to make a difference in taste or composition.  I'm not hopeful, but in the next round I'll increase the concentration, if only because the damn stuff is so plentiful.
1NO0000589	Bannon has asked me to search Seagrave Holmes' room to see if I can find anything incriminating about him. Then Bannon can stop him from taking over his council seat.
1NO0000590	You've turned us down twice now, Holmes. This is my last appeal. We used to be friends. We used to do business together. All I want is to sell our product in Rivet City. I'm sure the city could use slaves to help with the rebuilding. Paradise Falls has slaves to sell, at a good price. You used to sell me wastelanders you captured, before you got all full of yourself. You aren't as pure as you pretend. Help me and we can both make a nice profit.

1NO0000610	Hey there Jiggs,
1NO0000611	I finally found a good place to ditch your share of the loot. It was hell getting here, but I made it. I left the usual breadcrumbs all over some of the info terminals in this place; their computer security was a joke. Complete the sequence and you're home free, but make any mistakes and the system will lock you out. We'll meet up in the usual spot later.
1NO0000612	Good luck,
1NO0000614	Nice job, Jiggs!
1NO0000615	I knew you'd remember the good old days! The loot is in the Security Office Safe in the upper part of the West Wing. Use the terminal up there to get in. Enjoy your share, pal... you earned it! Meet me in the old diner outside the Jury Street Metro Station. See you there.
1NO0000618	Some of the scabs got tired of digging the tunnel and started using mines to get into the caves.  Not a half bad idea, the explosions damn near knocked the building apart.  We got a new window or two on the side of the building. haha.  I'm going to have some of the boys knock over a caravan for more explosives, but we'll have to use fewer in the blasts, or some assholes from Megaton will come looking.
1NO0000619	Boppo died like a bitch.  He didn't have half a bad idea, setting up here.  We had a good thing going, picking off caravans and traders on their way into Megaton.  He was stupid to try and raid the town.  Dumbass deserved the bullet Simms put in his head.
1NO0000620	Anyway, there's sweeter water to be had here.  That damn Vault's what we should be trying to get into, not that rag-ass town.  If we can get in there, ain't none of us going to want again for the rest of our lives.
1NO0000621	He threw me in here!  I cant believe he did it but that boltbrain foreman psychopath locked me in a closet!
1NO0000622	A goddamn 17 minute break!? That's why it threw me in here!?
1NO0000623	Its been a day, and that stupid robot hasn't even checked on me!  I cant wait until the next time he opens that door, I'm going to brain him with this auto-stapler and then escape.  This story will be front page news so fast that he'll have been reassigned with toaster duty by the time he sees it!
1NO0000624	Day 3 and I'm running out of what little edible supplies there are, they dragged another guy in here as well, says his name is Seth from R&D.  Apparently its now against company policy to leave the toilet seat up in the unisex bathrooms.
1NO0000625	We've come up with a plan that wont fail! We'll be out of here in no time... but for now we play the waiting game.

1NO0000632	I'd like to request that all riot gear and security firearms be moved to the new gun locker in the planetarium research office. The cabinet should remain locked at all times. The key to the cabinet must be carried by the duty shift supervisor and left in the security office safe when shift changes occur and at closing time.

1NO0000639	I'd like to lodge a formal complaint regarding the Firearms Exhibition that's planned for temporary display in the Atrium.

1NO0000646	The stash is hidden downstairs in one of the freezers.  Rocky set it up. You know his style.  Don't forget the key -- you'll need it to unlock the compartment.
1NO0000647	Ted,
1NO0000648	The Mirelurks busted out of the storage area and have been raisin' hell through the whole facility. Price says the bastards get smarter every day. He says I'm paranoid, but I think somebody might be sabotaging things around here.  We've taken on so much extra help, I don't know who I can trust around here anymore.  Things don't look too good.
1NO0000649	I don't think I'll be walking out of here, and I figure you should be the one to get our stash. I managed to get it hidden pretty well in case something like this happened.
1NO0000650	I don't want any of these damn fools tripping over it, so I threw a couple of curves in, but it's nothing you can't handle.  Start with my terminal -- just log in and follow the instructions. And if for some reason you've forgotten the password, you might want to sit down and have a think with a Nuka-Cola, if you catch my drift.

1NO0000657	I busted the storage door, down near the service entrance.
1NO0000658	There's a floor safe in the Clinic that contains the parts to fix the broken door.  I also left you a repair manual, just in case you've gotten rusty, but you were always a wizard with a wrench, so I'm sure you'll be fine.  Now get going.

1NO0000661	The latest subjects in the Evolutionary Experimentation Program (EEP) are showing some promise after only a single exposure to the modified FEV. We are currently testing five subjects, two males and three females. Each one of them is under 24 hour observation as usual. We hope to have a breakthrough in this strain as the continual pressure from Vault-Tec and the military at Mariposa is becoming most bothersome.
1NO0000662	Incredible results! After only three days, subjects B440, B164 and D624 (all our female specimens) are all exhibiting a unique change. Their bodies are undergoing severe physical changes, losing most of their visible female indicators and transforming to an almost asexual state. They are also seeing increased upper body strength and muscle formation in line with males.
1NO0000663	Similarly, subjects C376 and A541 (our male specimens) are losing most of their visible male indicators and taking on the same asexual state as the females. It seems that the FEV wishes to "level the playing field" and start with a clean slate as it works.
1NO0000664	We've had a minor setback. Subject B440, Mary Kilpatrik, is now deceased. According to my autopsy, she died of a massive loss of brain function and was unable to sustain her basic bodily needs. This is the usual pattern we see in all the FEV Strains we test... the brains of the subjects becoming too damaged to support even the most basic human needs (eating, sleeping, etc.). So far, all other subjects are nominal and continue to exhibit physical changes.
1NO0000665	At ten days, we are now noticing that the skin of all our remaining test subjects is actually thickening and becoming more resilient. This seems to be the FEV bringing about some new adaptive change. This is the kind of result we were looking for... adaptations that could prove useful in combat situations. I need to remember to congratulate Dr. Filo on his skin engineering; his coded instructions in this strain seem to be exactly what he expected.
1NO0000666	Once again, I've hit that damn wall. At fourteen days, all of the test subjects began to exhibit severe bouts of rage and anxiety. So much so that they were a danger to my team and to this facility. I had no choice once again but to order them to be destroyed. It pains me every time we do this. The same cycle has been repeated in every strain we test.  We always see superior physical adaptations, but the mental changes are their downfall.
1NO0000667	Attention ALL Lab Technicians
1NO0000668	The A Level Storage Room has been restocked with rad suits and other radiation dampeners.  We were able to bring these up from deep storage for immediate use. Please only take what is needed (there is no need to hoard the items, there is plenty to go around) and to lock the door after you are finished.
1NO0000670	The radiation expulsion ducts from the G.E.C.K. chamber are once again venting radiation directly into the area due to faulty seals. These seals MUST be properly maintained and checked on a DAILY basis. There is a clipboard with the maintenance checklist that you must initial when the check is complete in the main laboratory. Any lab technician skipping their check will be held accountable for their inaction.
1NO0000672	Doctor Merrick has ordered the latest test subjects in the EEP to be terminated and then disposed of. Please make sure that: bodily remains are placed in the incinerator as soon as the subjects vitals are flat, the entire isolation room is disinfected and any relevant data on the subjects are given to Doctor Merrick. FEV is very unpredictable, and we do not want any contamination to remain when the next strain is introduced to new subjects.
1NO0000673	Hit a goddamned hive of ants in the tunnel.  Bastards ate seven of our best diggers before we could lock off the way in.  Need to find some way to poison them so we can keep digging and blast into that Vault.  If we don't get there soon, I think I'm going to end up like Boppo, except it won't be the Sheriff popping me, it's gonna be my own men.

1NO0000688	My dearest Susan,
1NO0000689	I can't believe I'm writing this... but I can't help it. I can't hold it in any longer. I can't stop thinking about you! Even when I'm with Millicent, all I see is your face! God, can a man be in love with two women at the same time?
1NO0000690	How can something so wrong feel so right? There must be some way to make this work! To make this right...
1NO0000691	I can't wait to see you. But I don't want it to be like before. It's different now. Because I've finally told you... I love you. This is real. This is so real I can't take it any more. I need you right now!
1NO0000692	Yours truly and forever,

1NO0000695	HUBRIS COMICS AND VAULT-TEC INCORPORATED UNVEIL "VAULT BOY MEETS HELL'S CHAIN GANG" LIMITED FIVE-PART MINISERIES
1NO0000696	The very best in Invincible Entertainment and Inpenetrable Vaults team up to bring comic fans a gripping grimoire of greatness!
1NO0000697	From their headquarters in Washington, DC, Hubris Comics announced today plans to bring a beloved American Icon into the Hubris Comics Universe - none other than the beloved Vault Boy Character.
1NO0000698	"Vault Boy was the perfect choice for our new Hell's Chain gang series", says Hubris Comics Chief of Publishing Peter Shiner, "In which those Valiant Vigilantes take on Chairman Cheng's Commie Cyborg Corps - after all, Vault Boy knows a thing or two about going up against that Red Menace!"
1NO0000699	The five-part miniseries will feature an alternate future in which Chinese Communists have invaded America.  Vault Boy and Hell's Chain Gang are the last, best hope for America to break free from the shackles of Communism in this cautionary tale of vigilance.
1NO0000700	"It has always been Vault-Tec's mission to educate and protect our Countrymen from the Communist threat", commented Vault-Tec Public Relations Executive Joanne Strausser, "This exciting project is a perfect opportunity to thrill young Americans while sending home an important message for us all: Every good American must help shoulder the burden of freedom, and always be wary of the Communist Threat".
1NO0000701	The first issue of this miniseries will be available on newsstands everywhere this Holiday Season.

1NO0000707	O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,
1NO0000708	That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr
1NO0000709	Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds
1NO0000710	Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;
1NO0000711	And put to proof his high Supremacy,
1NO0000712	Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,
1NO0000713	Too well I see and rue the dire event,
1NO0000714	That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
1NO0000715	Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host
1NO0000716	In horrible destruction laid thus low,
1NO0000717	As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences
1NO0000718	Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains
1NO0000719	Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
1NO0000720	Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state
1NO0000721	Here swallow'd up in endless misery.
1NO0000722	But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now
1NO0000723	Of force believe Almighty, since no less
1NO0000724	Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)
1NO0000725	Have left us this our spirit and strength intire
1NO0000726	Strongly to suffer and support our pains,
1NO0000727	That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,
1NO0000728	Or do him mightier service as his thralls
1NO0000729	By right of Warr, what e're his business be
1NO0000730	Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,
1NO0000731	Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;
1NO0000732	What can it then avail though yet we feel
1NO0000733	Strength undiminisht, or eternal being
1NO0000734	To undergo eternal punishment?
1NO0000735	First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood
1NO0000736	Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,
1NO0000737	Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud
1NO0000738	Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire
1NO0000739	To his grim Idol.  Him the AMMONITE
1NO0000740	Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,
1NO0000741	In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream
1NO0000742	Of utmost ARNON.  Nor content with such
1NO0000743	Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart
1NO0000744	Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build
1NO0000745	His Temple right against the Temple of God
1NO0000746	On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove
1NO0000747	The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence
1NO0000748	And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.
1NO0000749	Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,
1NO0000750	From AROER to NEBO, and the wild
1NO0000751	Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON
1NO0000752	And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond
1NO0000753	The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,
1NO0000754	And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.
1NO0000755	PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd
1NO0000756	ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE
1NO0000757	To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
1NO0000758	Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd
1NO0000759	Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove
1NO0000760	Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;
1NO0000761	Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.
1NO0000762	O For that warning voice, which he who saw
1NO0000763	Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
1NO0000764	Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
1NO0000765	Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,
1NO0000766	WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now,
1NO0000767	While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd
1NO0000768	The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd
1NO0000769	Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now
1NO0000770	SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,
1NO0000771	The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,
1NO0000772	To wreck on innocent frail man his loss
1NO0000773	Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell
1NO0000774	To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.
1NO0000775	What thanks sufficient, or what recompence
1NO0000776	Equal have I to render thee, Divine
1NO0000777	Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd
1NO0000778	The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't
1NO0000779	This friendly condescention to relate
1NO0000780	Things else by me unsearchable, now heard
1NO0000781	VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,
1NO0000782	With glorie attributed to the high
1NO0000783	Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,
1NO0000784	VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.
1NO0000785	VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld
1NO0000786	Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute,
1NO0000787	Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,
1NO0000788	An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd
1NO0000789	And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle
1NO0000790	Spaces incomprehensible (for such
1NO0000791	Thir distance argues and thir swift return
1NO0000792	Diurnal) meerly to officiate light
1NO0000793	Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,
1NO0000794	One day and night; in all thir vast survey
1NO0000795	Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,
1NO0000796	How Nature wise and frugal could commit
1NO0000797	Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
1NO0000798	In my seven dozen years studying the ghoul anatomy, I discover more and more evidence to support my theory on the nature of the not-radiological human, or "ghoul" as they are commonly called.
1NO0000799	In summary: I theorize that our unnaturally long lifespan is due to a mutation within the autonomic nervous system of certain individuals following exposure to specific combinations of ionizing radiation with wavelengths below 10 picometers. This mutation, it seems, disrupts the normal process of decay in the neurotransmitters along the spinal cord.
1NO0000800	Specifically, the transmitters effected are those responsible for cardiac and respiratory function in a healthy human. According to my studies, these transmitters are continually regenerated after mutation, carrying sufficient oxygen to sustain the life of the subject while being insufficient to retain skin elasticity and avoid necrosis, the result of which is the corpse-like appearance of post-mutation humans.  It should be noted that exposure to radiation typically result in sickness followed by death and the x-factor that will lead to mutation upon exposure in lieu of the typical outcome remains unknown to this researcher.
1NO0000801	In the coming months, I will be assembling my findings on this subject into a full study.
1NO0000802	The brain structure of a Luminous Necrotic Post-Human (colloquially referred to as a "Glowing One") indicates that the regenerative ability of the neurological systems that affords typical Necrotic Post-Humans their longevity, does not extend into the higher reasoning functions of the brain itself. (This subject is further covered in report on the dissection of Feral Necrotic Post-Humans)
1NO0000803	The distinctive luminescence that is the trademark of the Glowing One can be best attributed to an unusual amount of radioactive chemicals that building up in the bloodstream and muscle tissue of a typical Ghoul. Upon the transformation into a Feral Ghoul, the neurological systems of the body cease filtering these particles from the blood and tissue, instead causing them to build a distinctive bioluminescence that is distinctive of the "Glowing Ones".
1NO0000804	Their social structure seems to be different from that of the Feral Ghoul. They actively seek out others of both their strain and those afflicted with Ferocious Post-Necrotic Dystrophy, particularly those who may have been injured. Studies on the nature of their healing effects on other ghouls continues with no conclusive results as of yet.
1NO0000805	The brain structure of a Feral Necrotic Post-Human indicates that the regenerative ability of the neurological systems that affords typical Necrotic Post-Humans their longevity does not extend into the higher reasoning functions of the brain itself. This is a condition that I refer to as Ferocious Post-Necrotic Dystrophy.
1NO0000806	As the reasoning and high order thinking portions of the brain deteriorate, the Post-Human subject becomes increasingly hostile, giving into a carnal need to feed as opposed to the capacity for thinking that reasoning that a typical Necrotic Post-Human retains. It remains unclear exactly what precipitates this change in biology and psychology, but anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that non-social ghouls, or those in isolation, are more prone to the condition.

1NO0000814	There's something up with her. She's become so mopey lately, I wish I knew what it was, she might be a good customer for the special stock. That is, if I could get her away from Greta long enough to work on her.
1NO0000815	I can't say enough good things about this boy. The only thing is, I need to remember to keep an eye on him. I've caught him behind the counter several times. I'd say that he's more trouble that he's worth, but somehow, he just keeps coming up with caps for booze.
1NO0000816	Note: He has all sorts of good stuff in his office. I should find a way to get him out of town for a while so that I can restock my supply from his. Of course, the egghead never leaves that lab of his, especially since he got that passed out smoothskin in there.
1NO0000817	What is with this guy? Well, honestly, I don't care. He buys up all my jet and keeps coming back for more. It doesn't really matter if he insists that he's a barber, I guess.

1NO0000828	After negotiation with Ernest "Uncle" Roe of Canterbury Commons, an alliance has been struck with the caravan merchants of the Capital Wasteland.
1NO0000829	As their manager, Roe will oversee their inventories and investments. The investor may dictate each merchant's specialties and invest in their wares for improved quality goods.

1NO0000832	Had an idea for a survival weapon. There are all these railroad spikes laying around the wasteland. I ought to be able to build some sort of slingshot to fire them like bullets. I tried some really big rubber bands, but that didn't work. I wonder if I could use steam as a power source?
1NO0000833	Doctor Li,
1NO0000834	We both know that Bannon does not have the best interests of Rivet City at heart. He is only interested in making a profit. He would sell his own children, if he had any, for an extra bottle cap. He needs to be removed. I would be glad to step forward as his replacement.
1NO0000837	Seagrave,
1NO0000838	I do not wish to get pulled down into petty political bickering. Bannon has not done anything wrong. If the time ever comes when he does something truly harmful to Rivet City, the other council members will look into it. Until then, I have a lab to run.
1NO0000839	Yours,

1NO0000844	Two more reports of Mirelurk noise from the bow section. There isn't a damn thing that can be done about it. As soon as we clean out one nest, another moves in. I just wish everyone would stop bitching about it.
1NO0000845	Railing on the flight deck is still broken. Problem has been referred to the council.

1NO0000975	Issue: Reactor Spikes, Sectional Power Outages
1NO0000976	Engineer: Daniel Koster
1NO0000978	For the last five weeks, we've had periodic interruptions to the power grid. Entire sections will lose power for approximately 1-6 minutes, then return to normal. By installing monitoring meters, I traced the issue to sudden immense power spikes in the main rector. My fear was the reactor was having a major malfunction, but turns out that it's due to a power draw that the experimental section is creating. Whatever they are using in there is WAY over the limit for acceptable power consumption. I've temporarily remedied the situation by having the backup reactor kick on when needed. I don't like to do this, but I have no choice until I figure out what they're up to.
1NO0000980	Issue: G.E.C.K. Chamber Radiation Purging Offline
1NO0000983	Vault-Tec's crappy handiwork is at it again. I have spent the better part of a month patching and re-patching the radiation purge system that vents excess radiation from the G.E.C.K. chamber. I have no idea why this system keeps failing. I suspect the system is simply inadequate and can't handle the amount of radiation it's purging. Recommend installing a new purging system as soon as I can get one cobbled together from spare parts. Should have it ready in about a month.
1NO0000985	Issue: Tapioca Pudding Miscolor
1NO0000988	The mess hall food reconstitution system is outputting the Monday night dessert, tapioca pudding, in an odd bright orange color. This was a simple fix. The color matrix was simply misinterpreting instructions from the main brain and outputting incorrectly. I replaced the interface and the pudding now outputs in its proper hue. Wish all my fixes were this easy.
1NO0000990	Issue: EEP Chamber Failure
1NO0000993	I was summoned into the Overseer's office and met with Dr. Merrick, who heads up the Experimentation section. He informed me that one of his devices, what he called an EEP Chamber was XXXXEDITEDXXXX. It was a strange device, but I managed to XXXXEDITEDXXXX which didn't fix the problem. I then tried to XXXXEDITEDXXXX which seemed to bring the device back online. I'm not sure what this device is for, but XXXXEDITEDXXXX.
1NO0000995	Issue: NEED HELP
1NO0000998	This is the only place I could think of hiding this message. In the event that anyone reads this, please try and get word back to Vault-Tec HQ that something very wrong is going on in the Experimentation section... something they keep referring to as the EEP. My wife, Mercia was "diagnosed" by the Medical section as having some sort of disease they wouldn't identify. She's dead now, and those sons-of-bitches won't even tell me why. From talking to people, I've discovered that many are dead or missing. Checking this with the Medical Records section gets me nowhere. This is getting out of hand. It's time to deal with this my way. They took my wife from me, now I'll take their lives away if I don't get some answers. I've hidden some extra "help" in my safe. Accessing this message will unlock it. If I don't come back, grab that stuff and save yourself.
1NO0000999	Journal Entry:
1NO0001000	I don't know what to do. My Jason, my little boy... he's gone.
1NO0001001	My wife won't talk anymore. She just sits in this godforsaken sub-level and stares out of the window at the rock wall as if looking across a sunlit meadow or a lazy summertime lake.
1NO0001002	Jason was my life. He was my joy, my meaning. Now all this work seems pointless.
1NO0001003	This was a mistake. Better we had all died together outside than inside this permanent tomb.
1NO0001004	I'm scared.

1NO0001011	The G.E.C.K. is, quite simply, the most advanced piece of technology ever developed by Vault-Tec -- a terra-forming module capability of creating life from complete lifelessness. After riding out the storm of nuclear Armageddon in a Vault-Tec patented vault, residents can then activate the G.E.C.K., and create a new earthen paradise  craters and dust will give way to rolling grasslands and sparkling clear water. Of course, due to time and monetary constraints, not every vault will be equipped with a G.E.C.K. module.
1NO0001012	A Letter to the Overseer from Dr. Stanislaus Braun:
1NO0001013	If you are reading this, emergency Vault internment procedures have been initiated and you and your control group have been sealed into your Vault. Congratulations! You are now a vital part of the most ambitious program ever undertaken by Vault-Tec.
1NO0001014	If you have not yet read your sealed orders, do so now. They will outline the experimental protocols assigned to your control group. Please remember that deviation from these protocols in any way will jeopardize the success of the program, and may be considered grounds for termination by Vault-Tec Corporation (as outlined in your Employment Agreement).
1NO0001015	Your Vault may or may not have been selected to receive a G.E.C.K. module. Please see Attachment A for details.
1NO0001016	Doctor Stanislaus Braun
1NO0001017	Director, Societal Preservation Program
1NO0001018	Vault-Tec Corporation
1NO0001020	Vault 87 has been chosen as one of the very few select Vaults to receive a genuine G.E.C.K. The device was delivered before final sealing of the Vault and installed into its secure pedestal by our special G.E.C.K. Scramble Team. I'd like to extend my best wishes to you and all of your population. Your survival will ensure the continuation of the human race, and to carry the Vault-Tec name into the future.
1NO0001024	I'm quite sad to report that due to a direct hit from what I presume to be a nuclear weapon on the entry area of Vault 87, we will be unable to provide the Scouting Reports as outlined in Vault-Tec's Operations Manual. The main door to Vault 87 is damaged beyond repair and we are detecting extremely high levels of lethal radiation outside and in the entry tunnel.
1NO0001025	Dr. Wayne Merrick
1NO0001026	I'm told that Dr. Merrick is one of the brightest minds in the field of accelerated evolution, and apparently Vault-Tec agrees, because they've set up this Vault around him to suit all of his needs in the event that the bombs fall. All of his data and his work have been transferred to this facility from many important sources such as Mariposa Base, West-Tek and Vault-Tec Labs.
1NO0001027	I like Dr. Merrick. He's driven without being careless. He knows that in the event of a nuclear war, he may be the only person left in the world that can advance human genetics beyond where they are now. He's meticulous, detail-oriented, and reports everything to me on a regular basis.
1NO0001028	Daniel Koster
1NO0001029	An excellent Maintenance Chief. Thorough, careful, and honest to a fault. In fact, that's becoming a problem. His security clearance isn't high enough yet to grant him access to all of the information regarding the FEV experiments performed by Dr. Merrick, but we may have to bring him into the fold soon. In the event we need major repairs on A Level, we'll definitely need his skills.
1NO0001030	Peter Stevens
1NO0001031	This gentleman continues to impress me. He was just recently promoted to Technician Third Class by Chief Koster for his ingenuity and ability to think quickly in emergencies. Given these talents, I think he'd make an excellent candidate for Koster's eventual successor if the need should ever arise.
1NO0001032	UPDATE: It seems Peter has suffered some sort of a nervous breakdown. He keeps claiming that his "son" is missing and his "wife" is in deep depression, although I show no records of him ever being married or having a child. I've recommended that he be taken to the Test Labs for observation and sedation if need be.
1NO0001033	By now, your handler's given you the location of the job and your basic orders.  Here are the details.
1NO0001034	Traders have been making a killing with Mirelurk meat, and we've been losing business because of it.  One of our people got involved with a caravan supplier, and we finally know where it's all been coming from.
1NO0001035	The meat's mostly coming from one group holed up along the river smack in the middle of the ruins.  There's a huge old facility under some war memorial where they've herded up a nest of Mirelurks and have been breeding and butchering them.  They've been in business for months and are sure to be sitting on a pile of caps.  Take what you can carry -- we just want them out of the meat market.  The rest is up to you.
1NO0001036	This isn't the biggest job, but pull it off clean and there's plenty more work for a man with your skills.  Get back to your handler as soon as the job is done and we'll be in touch.
1NO0001037	Congratulations on your purchase of the TASTEE CLEEN SANITIZER, another household health essential from Abraxodyne Chemical!

1NO0001043	Diary Entry 64D-A3: Mutant Chips
1NO0001044	I have had to alter the chips for the mutants to account for their greater size.  Fortunately, they exhibit a higher intellect than the ghouls and can be controlled to an even greater extent.  The enthralled mutants have mentioned legends of even larger mutants, almost twice as big as the ones I've captured.  If only I could get my hands on one of those  the experiments  the fun.
1NO0001045	Diary Entry 2R-A0: The first ghoul chips
1NO0001046	Some of my earlier chip prototypes(C6-A and C6-L) have started to malfunction causing the chips to overheat and eventually detonate the implanted charge.  In retaliation I have upgraded the P7 series and above to counter the malfunction.  I have also altered the Y2 series in the mutants as a precaution.  Ghouls are easily replaceable, mutants are not.
1NO0001047	Diary Entry 07-C: Stefan
1NO0001048	My masterpiece!  Stefan is now under my control!  The latest chip I installed in him seems to have taken and he is now mine.  The effort to capture one of these glowing ghouls was immense but finally I can take solace in the fact that I have one under my control.  His limited intellect means I will have to keep him downstairs with the rest of the ghouls but I pity any rabble that pokes their head in here now.
1NO0001049	Diary Entry L-2
1NO0001050	I have used materials from the small explosives cache I found to further safeguard myself from my experiments.  I have wired the building to broadcast a signal from this terminal that in emergency will detonate all chips.  I pray that day never comes.

1NO0001055	Family: Tabanidae
1NO0001056	Genus: Tabanus Linnaeus
1NO0001057	Field observation suggests that the Bloatfly is a mutation of the Tabanus horse fly with provocative advances.  These evolutionary forebears possessed neither the significant body mass, nor projectile sting of the Bloatfly.  Dissection has revealed that this stinger is engorged with living pupae and neurotoxins.  These projectiles are capable of incapacitating large prey on which the bloatfly and it's gestating young can freely feed.  These neurotoxins are only nominally effective on humans, but can cause localized necrosis at the wound site.  This observation is contrary to earlier assumptions that the Bloatfly was primarily a scavenger.  The Bloatfly can be dispatched easily with light weapons, but nonetheless present a threat to field operatives, especially when encountered in numbers.  They are hostile and can strike before the target is aware of its presence.
1NO0001061	Order: Blattodea
1NO0001062	Family: Blattidae
1NO0001063	Genus: Periplaneta
1NO0001064	The insect colloquially known as the Radroach is one of the most ubiquitous denizens of the modern American landscape.  I believe it to be of the species P. Americana, the American cockroach, albeit a genome strain affected by years of exposure to heavy radiation levels.  While winged, they are incapable of flight.  I theorize that this is due to the evolutionary failure of the wing appendages to grow in strength commensurate to the surge in body mass.  Radroach wings still seem to serve some purpose, however, in inter-species communication.  Dark, damp, irradiated habitats, such as the metro tunnels, provide an ideal environment for breeding.  Caution should be taken while exploring such areas, but the threat to operatives is minimal, even in great numbers.
1NO0001068	Order: Hymenoptera
1NO0001069	Family: Formicidae
1NO0001070	Genus: Camponotus
1NO0001071	I've determined with near certainty that the aboriginal Ants are of the genus Camponotus. My best guess would be that a majority of the ants encountered are black carpenter ants (Camponotus pennsylvanicus). However, given that this particular genus consists of over a thousand different species, classification has been difficult.  Prior generations of the genus were only considered a nominal threat to humans, but their social and fiercely territorial nature, combined with the greatly increased mass of current varieties has made them extraordinarily dangerous.  The antennae of the ant is the primary sense organ, and soldiers report disabling this to be a successful tactic, as it sends the ant into a frenzy whereupon it attacks anything nearby, human or ant.

1NO0001078	Genus: ???
1NO0001079	After going to enormous lengths to procure DNA samples of hypothesized forebears, we cannot explain why ancestry evidence is present from two vastly different creatures; the Limulus polyphemus (horseshoe crab) and the Callinectes sapidus (blue crab).  It's obvious that a mutation occurred, giving this creature bipedal movement and massive growth, but I cannot explain the presence of multiple subphylum markers in DNA/RNA.  Given their mystifying origins, I have decided the species deserves its own classification, and have thus dubbed them "Scylla Serrata Horrendus."  They can often be found in sewers and caves and should be considered hostile and very dangerous, as their chitnous shell provides excellent resistance to both firearms and hand-held weapons.  They are disgusting creatures, and I cannot fathom their popularity as a food source among the citizens of the Wasteland.

1NO0001085	Genus: Bos
1NO0001086	The Brahmin has been encountered both in domesticated and wild varieties.  They are hardy animals, and their utility has made them valuable to humans, in turn allowing these animals to reproduce in quantities beyond what they would otherwise be likely to acheive.  They are commonly employed as pack animals.  In addition to having two heads, dissection has revealed that these creatures have eight stomachs, but otherwise do not differ significantly from their likely ancestors of the Bovidae Family.  Typically docile in demeanor, these creatures are useful as both as beasts of burden and a food source for field operatives.
1NO0001087	Day 45:
1NO0001088	Jason found a terminal suitable to our needs in the nearby ruins.  With some work, we may be able to move this workstation closer to where our research has been taking place.  Must keep an eye out for a portable source of power.  Must remember to translate my notes onto this thing when I have some time to do so.
1NO0001089	While Jason was scavenging the ruins, I caught a glimpse of the group by the pool in the afternoon.  Contrary to what most people think, they don't fear the daylight at all, but they do seem to prefer indoor habitats.
1NO0001090	Day 51:
1NO0001091	I've conducted an informal experiment this week.  I've filled some heavy basins with water, each with different levels of radiation.  Consistent with my predictions, they seem to prefer water with high rad content.  Thanks to these radiation suits, I was able to irradiate one of the basins with a typically lethal level of radiation, and to my amazement, this has worked better than any of our attempts at constructing a lure to attract them into our research area.  This is very exciting!
1NO0001092	Day 53:
1NO0001093	Jason's recovered and repaired a generator, which should allow us to move this terminal and some of my equipment out to a better position for observation of the group's behavior.
1NO0001094	Day 58:
1NO0001095	Amazing!  Today I was approached by one of them.  I've decided to call her "Melinda."  I'm not actually sure if there's a way to establish gender, but Melinda moved in a way that appeared very feminine to me.  She caught me off guard while I was checking water levels in the experimental basins.  For a moment there, I wished I had taken that damned pistol Jason insisted upon me carrying.  She grasped my arm, but instead of attacking, she appeared to sniff my arm where some of the scavenged resin I've been using to irradiate the basins had spilled on my suit.  Moments later, she was gone.  Must consider some way of tagging them.
1NO0001096	Day 63:
1NO0001097	No sign of the group for days.  Could Melinda have returned to the group with some news of our brief encounter?  Perhaps they're scared of us?
1NO0001098	Jason's beginning to get concerned, but I believe we're close to learning what we came here for.  The poor man's been through Hell for me. I don't know if I could have achieved so much without him, but there's so much left to learn.
1NO0001099	Day 67:
1NO0001100	I insisted on sleeping at the research site last night, much to Jason's protest.  I'm sure I saw motion in the far ruins, but the moon had slid behind a cloud, so I couldn't make out for certain their shapes.  I don't think mutants would have moved like that, and most people in the city know enough to hunker down at night.  Could it have been our group, returning home?
1NO0001101	Day 68:
1NO0001102	Slept outdoors again last night.  Jason insisted on staying with me this time, and built a camouflage screen for us to sleep in.  I irradiated the main body of water as heavily as I could to try and draw them out.  My plan seems to have worked, because I saw few - I think Melinda was among them - come into the open at dusk and settle into the water.  After dark, one I believe to be the alpha male - I've called him "Samuel" - emerged with the rest of the group.  I had to switch my geiger counter off when he arrived to avoid being heard.  I can't imagine the radiation levels the glowing ones must be infused with.  I think that must be why he's the alpha - the others are so drawn to him because of his immense irradiation.
1NO0001103	Day 75:
1NO0001104	I need to make contact again.  I've coated my suit in resin, and will try approaching the group tomorrow at dusk.  Observation hasn't revealed anything new; direct contact is required if I'm going to continue to learn about them.  I know Jason would never understand, but this won't work if his suit isn't also irradiated.  I'll coat it while he's gone scavenging during the afternoon, and we'll set up camp tonight by the water before dusk.
1NO0001105	Winger Mercier,
1NO0001106	The formula for Clear Nuka-Cola is on the first floor of their D.C. Plant. That's where they did all the R&D for it. Get the formula and meet us at the Red Rocket Tricycle Factory as we planned. Our buyer is promising lots of caps, so I want to see some hustle! This could take our gang to the big time. Sudden-Death Overtime forever!
1NO0001108	Attention all Nuka-Cola Corporation Employees
1NO0001109	We are very proud to announce that R&D has been completed on Nuka-Cola Clear! With an only minimal loss of life, we've been able to modify the look of Nuka-Cola but give it the same great taste. We will be submitting the product to Marketing shortly for bottle design and advertising strategies. From all of us in the Research Department, thanks for the support!
1NO0001110	Ted Strayer, in Rivet City.

1NO0001114	100 caps for a kill shot to the head. 25 caps for any other death. Bring back their security keys.
1NO0001115	S,
1NO0001116	Here's that stuff you wanted. If anyone asks where you got it -- say it was a gift from your grandma.
1NO0001117	Happy hunting!
1NO0001118	E
1NO0001119	Nothing says "equality" like a fistful of caps.  I think these Talon Company mercs are about the most cordial smoothies I've met, as long as their boss is getting paid.  Luckily, money's no issue; I've hoarded plenty of it up since before these guys' parents were knee-high on a Brahmin.
1NO0001120	Of course, if I succeed in this, it won't matter how many caps any of these rat bastards have.
1NO0001121	Thanks to a little creative wiring, I was able to tap us into a power source.  They're less common up here, but if you know where to look, there are still plenty of live power lines buried all over the Wasteland.  For all their arrogance, they knew a thing or two about engineering before the bombs.  I have to admit; it's remarkable that there's still power to be had after all these years.
1NO0001122	Now that we've got all the power we'd want, I can bring our defensive turret online and try to get the dish motors operational.
1NO0001123	Finally got to begin on my work in earnest today.  Dish motivators are offline, but I was able to input some basic coordinates and ping nearby satcom arrays to the southwest and east.  There was some interference pinging the NN-03d array.  Probably Radroaches or something making a nest in the dishes.  It may be worth sending one or two of the mercs over there to clean it out in case I can use those towers to amplify my own signal.
1NO0001124	There were dozens of military satellites in orbit, just from the old records I found in the ruins.  There must have been hundreds before the war.  If I can find just a few operational platforms...
1NO0001125	First attempts at atmospheric pinging returned negative.  Considering that the motivators are still non-functional, it's going to be difficult to catch much of anything that doesn't pass directly over us.  Still, I cannot rule out other mechanical failure.  I haven't got much astronomical reference material with me, but maybe I can find an old chart and wait until a celestial body passes over to confirm signal.  Of course, that may take years.  I'll have to keep working on the motivators.
1NO0001126	What a lucky break!  I pinged an orbiting body successfully today.  Registration ID is USDOD-21TXH, callsign "Highwater Trouser".  I'll begin tracking it and cross-reference the registration information with the data I've got.
1NO0001127	Turns out I don't have specific data on my satellite, but the registration format suggests that it's a stationary micro-nuclear weapons platform.  Tracking data appears to confirm this; the thing hasn't moved in the week I've been tracking it.  Without a targeting platform at my disposal, sending an activation code would only cause it to drop a payload directly on top of this area.  Not exactly what I'm aiming for, but I'll keep the codes handy just in case.

1NO0001149	We were mobilized in the early evening.  My security clearance isn't high enough to know this on an official level, but I have it on good authority that we're under threat of a Chinese attack.  I don't dare to share this with the girls; most of them are a solid sort, but I can't trust that some won't desert to try and protect themselves or their families, and wind up spreading panic, especially on flimsy rumours based on flimsier intelligence from DoD.
1NO0001150	We haven't been debriefed yet, but it's probably safe to assume we'll be on an evacuation detail in the rural areas.  Our unit scored somewhat poorly in the last round of drills, and the high-flyers always get the urban details; we'll be stuck herding farmers and hermits in the hills.
1NO0001151	This can't have happened.  We don't even know if it was the Chinese, but DC was hit.  My God, Andrea's unit was on evac detail right on the Belt Loop.
1NO0001152	Dear God.  More bombs.  What's happening?
1NO0001153	Our unit has been assigned to a National Guard Detachment.  They drove all night from Pennsylvania.  We're doing our best to keep the survivors placated while these boys get their strength up.  The looting gets worse every day, and it's a small town.  There can't be much left, and there's already been one scuffle at the canteen.  These Guardsmen arrived just in time, I fear.
1NO0001154	Dolores and Rebecca deserted in the night.  They had the goodness not to rob us blind on her way out; I had trusted Becky with the keys to the canteen and the artesian well we locked up on Day One..  Several of our survivors were talking rubbish about seeking refuge in a nearby Vault, the girls must have decided to go with them.  Damned fools; if anybody made it into those things in time, they bloody well aren't letting any of us in now.  I suppose I should just be glad we have a few less mouths to feed.
1NO0001155	I took the NCO's advice and set up a quarantine for the worst of the radiation victims.  We know better than to think they're contagious, but most of our survivors don't, and it helps keep them calm.  We also have an easier time smuggling the bodies out at night.  It's not so much that people die; it's how they look when they go.  They all think they'll just lose a bit of hair, maybe get a rash.  It gets so much worse than that.
1NO0001156	We're low on Prussian Blue.  Most of them don't know what that really means, for which I'm thankful.  One of the local doctors in our camp knows about a cancer treatment facility not too far from here.  We're sending some of the guardsmen out to investigate.  If they can recover any filgrastim, we might be able to stave off widespread radiation sickness a little longer.
1NO0001157	These days I feel like more of a preacher than a nurse.  We've lost hope that the reservists will be back.  I can only hope they died with some scrap of honor and didn't abandon us.  Without medication, people are succumbing to radiation sickness, for which there is no hope of treatment.  We can do nothing more than make our patients comfortable as we await the end.  When the painkillers and whiskey run out, prayer is all we can offer them.  I've taken to wearing a headwrap; I don't want them to see how much of my own hair has fallen out.
1NO0001158	I suppose it seems only right to say goodbye.  I ought to know it's hopeless, but maybe one of my sisters is still out there, and I couldn't go without leaving some kind of farewell.  Just know that I did everything I could.  I tried, and I only wish that I could be the last to go, so I could have helped all the others before they met their own end.
1NO0001159	I finally got everyone to agree to let me set up some generators for power.  I can understand their nerves, considering what technology did to us all, but not making use of every resource is wasteful, and a sure path to Hell in this situation.  Coming out into the light has done wonders for everyone, but we all can get a little stir crazy, even out here.  I'm setting this thing up for everyone to use.
1NO0001160	We set up an irrigation system!  Thank God for Miles' experience on the farm  I never would have thought of this on my own, but what a great idea.  I really thought this ground was useless, but the stuff he had us plant in the dirt we dug up is actually sprouting, and the little rivers keep it all nice and wet.
1NO0001161	My turn to be boss this month.  Seems stupid to me, I don't want to be in charge.  I'm just going to do whatever Jim tells me to.
1NO0001162	I want to remind everyone to come by my tent every day for your radiation screening.  Even if you don't think you've been exposed to radiation, the test takes only minutes.  Take my word for it; you'd much rather be inconvenienced in the morning than come down with a case of radiation sickness.  I'm more than happy to give a detailed account of that scenario to the next person who misses an appointment.
1NO0001163	my name is ty an i'm a big dum hed!!!
1NO0001164	Hey Rochelle, remind me what a big stupid head I am the next time you need me to repair you and Vu's distillers, okay?  What gives, Edgar?  Can't you put a password on this thing?
1NO0001165	Been a good few months for us since the coming out.  Going by the dosimeter tests, we're taking some exposure to radiation, but as long as Doc Johanson keeps folks on their meds, we don't seem to be having trouble with rad sickness.  Irrigation and fertilization has been good, and though we lost the goats and chickens, the cows have done good.  Those hardy beasts don't seem to mind this new world.  Miles and Jacky are devoting some time to husbandry to keep the cows breeding and available.
1NO0001166	I'm trying to fabricate a windmill for us.  If anybody spots any long, flat sheets of metal, you let me know.  I have most of the other parts I need, but haven't found good metal for the blades yet.
1NO0001167	Nobody ought concern themselves too much with Miguel's scouting report.  While he did spot some folk out past the valley, they rode by and weren't like to have noticed him or us.  Let's all just keep to the homestead for a few days and avoid using open fires for a few days, just to be safe.
1NO0001168	Notice to all Good Men and Women seeking Lawful Bounties in the Capital Wastes:
1NO0001169	Let it be known that the murderous person known as JUNDERS PLUNKETT, of fair complexion, average height, and missing one good eyeball, is offered for bounty, either DEAD OR ALIVE, in the sum of 1,000 caps or similar compensation of expended equipment and/or medical expense.
1NO0001170	JUNDERS PLUNKETT was last seen committing theft and murder in the township of Cantebury Commons.  The apprehending person should exercise special caution, as the bountied personage is noted for an uncommon aptitude with small, concealable blades.
1NO0001171	Dear Mr & Mrs Gomez:
1NO0001172	Congratulations on your family's recent inclusion in the Vault 101 community!
1NO0001173	You will find outlined in your application materials a full review of rules and procedures related to preparing for shelter in a Vault-Tec facility, but we will outline a few key points here:
1NO0001174	* Vault-Tec provides all clothing, bedding, and accommodations for residents.  Personal belongings must be reviewed and approved of by an authorized Vault-Tec hermetics technician before such belongings can be delivered to your reserved quarters within the Vault.  In the event of an emergency entrance to the Vault, no personal belongings will be permitted beyond the main door of the facility.
1NO0001175	* All Vault residents must attend an orientation seminar.  If you did not attend such a seminar as part of the application process, you must make an appointment with your Vault-Tec representative.
1NO0001176	* In the event of a Vault activation, whether actual or drill, Vault-Tec will sound a siren audible in the immediate vicinity of the Vault facility entrance, and residents will be contacted via holotape message at the phone number provided in their resident profile records.  Please report promptly to Vault 101 to await admittance and processing upon such a notification.
1NO0001177	Vault-Tec looks forward to having you and your family as valued residents!  Be sure to present this letter to your Vault-Tec representative to receive your special, commemorative Vault Boy bobble-head toy!  Sincerely;
1NO0001178	Vault-Tec
1NO0001179	Dept of Public Relations
1NO0001180	Washington, DC
1NO0001181	Dear Safety-Conscious Citizen -
1NO0001182	We are writing to inform you that your family was not selected for inclusion in your chosen Vault-Tec facility.  Your deposit has been retained, and your application added to a waiting list for your preferred Vault.  In the interest of your family's security in the event of a minor nuclear event, please consider relocating to one of these areas, where Vault-Tec facilities are available without a waiting list:
1NO0001183	For a full list of Vault-Tec facilities with available accommodations, in exciting locales such as Oklahoma and newly-annexed Canada, contact your local Vault-Tec representative!
1NO0001184	Vault-Tec wishes you and your family the best of luck in the uncertain future.  Best regards;
1NO0001186	Public Relations Dept
1NO0001188	Samantha -
1NO0001189	I would never want to be known as a killjoy, and I realize your family is very much anticipating this year's Halloween, but if I see your little hooligan running and hollering across my yard in that Chinese Commando costume of his again, I swear I'm reporting him to the Vigilant Citizen's Hotline.
1NO0001190	You may find his cheekiness adorable, but perhaps you'll think differently when they haul your boy off to an internment camp with all the real Chinamen he's so keen to give me a heart attack by impersonating.
1NO0001191	Yours most dearly;
1NO0001192	Gabriella
1NO0001193	Finally done.  Maggie wanted us to sign up at a Vault-Tec shelter, but I've never trusted those bastards.  It took a lot of work, but Frank helped me get all the parts together and hauled out to the acreage to build this shelter.  Air filtration, chemical toilets, artesian well, the whole nine yards.  Frank's connections got us the generator cheap, too.  And we don't have to worry about sharing quarters with whoever got their name on some waiting list when the day comes.
1NO0001194	Wish I could say "if" the day comes, but it just seems like a matter of time now.  How could it have come to this?
1NO0001195	Robin wanted to play with the computer for Christmas, so I siphoned some juice from the fusion generator to power this old thing.  I know she'd rather be playing outside in the snow, but she's a good kid.  Knows that we can't go outside yet.  I'll check the fallout levels again tomorrow while she's playing, but I doubt we'll be heading out anytime soon.  Damn commies must have hit us hard.
1NO0001196	MARRY CRISMAS!
1NO0001197	Cute kid, huh?
1NO0001198	don't believe it.  Frank showed up today.  He was on a sales trip when the blast hit, selling generators to a mining operation in Pennsylvania.  Being in those shafts probably saved his life, but the shock wave also knocked out every power line feeding light them light and air.  Falling debris killed the foreman standing right next to him.  He doesn't even know how long he was crawling around those tunnels before he got outside, the poor bastard.
1NO0001199	Sounds like the water's boiling.  Some hot soup will do him good, even if it's that powdered crap we hauled in here last year.
1NO0001200	Frank's in bad shape, arms and face are all burned up.  He's got a lot of blisters that look infected.  He went through hell out there.  Hardly anybody alive, and those he met almost did him in.  He tried getting into a Vault near Burkittsville.  They wouldn't open up and he was almost killed in an ambush on his way out of there.  He said those folks wore skins of men.  Cannibal bastards must just wait for their next meal to come looking for help at the Vault.  Frank steered clear of them and headed straight here after that.  He's been on his feet for weeks.
1NO0001201	His hair was falling out within a week of him showing up.  I wanted to believe we could save him, but there's no way a few iodine tablets a day was going to reverse the radiation he must have been exposed to out there.  He was a good man.  He deserves better, but I can't go out there and give him a proper burial.  Maggie's going to stay up with Robin and let her play some holotapes loud tonight.  That's when I'll take Frank in the back and cremate him.  I wish our furnace was big enough to hold him in one piece.  God help us.  How could it have come to this?
1NO0001202	The 10mm N99 sidearm was standard issue military gear following the phase out of the N80 in 2051. The N99 was known for its ability to survive in the harshest of conditions and in many tests, the weapon was able to reliably be restored to working condition after an extended period of time exposed to hard elements and without maintenance.
1NO0001203	The N99 proved to stand up to its claims and as a result, is one of the most common weapons found in use in the Wasteland. While many civilian weapons were ruined beyond use in the exterior conditions following the war, the N99 is commonly able to be easily restored to working order by anyone with the most basic knowledge of firearm mechanics.
1NO0001204	However, an N99 in poor condition can often deliver low target and armor penetration, frequent jamming, and greatly reduced accuracy. Fortunately, the weapon was produced in great numbers and units are available for replacement parts.
1NO0001205	The R Series of combat assault rifles was used reliably following the discontinuation of the M series in the early 21st century. The R series, produced by civilian manufacturer Stent Security Solutions, was made in many models and variations. The variation most common to the DC Wasteland is the R91 full-auto urban assault rifle.
1NO0001206	This rifle was standard issue for the National Guard during urban pacification operations. Fortunately for our purposes, the Nation Guard had been fully deployed around the DC area during the time of the war. As a result, the R91 is readily available for those willing to search. Although nearly two centuries of scavenging has reduced the numbers of working units, the R91 remains a favorite of Slavers and Raiders. this rifle can also often be obtained from legitimate traders and arms dealers.
1NO0001207	Like any firearm, the R91's effectiveness and accuracy can suffer without regular maintenance.
1NO0001208	The AEP7 Laser Pistol was put into service to replace the AEP5, a model which was notorious for its problems with overheating. The AEP7 features a new design in the photonic focusing chamber as well as an entirely redesigned focusing crystal pattern. The bulk and weight have both been reduced over previous models and it was likely that within the new few development cycles, the successor to the AEP7 would replace the n99 10mm as the standard issue sidearm for all forces.
1NO0001209	The AEP7 took advantage of new manufacturing techniques developed shortly before the Great War. Although many were produced, most did not make it into field service because of logistics problems concerning their deployment during active wartime.
1NO0001210	The AEP7 can be a rare find in the Capital Wasteland, and any models that are produced should be returned to the Citadel for repair and recalibrating before field deployment.
1NO0001211	Unlike many of the weapons in use today, the AER9 is actually not the top laser rifle that was  in service at the time of the Great War. The model line went up to the state-of-the-art AER12, which saw service in a handful of specialty units. The reason that the AER9 is much more commonly found is that it was much sturdier and more reliable than the models that followed.
1NO0001212	The AER9 features a titanium housed crystal array which proved to withstand long years of exposure to the elements much better than the gold alloy housing of the later models. As a result, the crystal arrays stayed focused within operating parameters, rather than falling completely out of focus like the newer models.
1NO0001213	As with all energy weapons, the AER9 can suffer from poor performance if not properly maintained. The crystal arrays and non-mechanical components are delicate and if not properly serviced can lead to a loss of beam intensity, overheating, and energy regulation failure.
1NO0001214	Incident Level: 3 (Minor)
1NO0001215	Guest Name: Harold Worthington III
1NO0001216	Incident:
1NO0001217	Mr. Worthington claims that the ice machine on the second floor was leaking water, which caused the tile floor to get wet. He then apparently slipped and fell after "spending the night up in the Alfresco" on the way back to his room. He demanded restitution in the form of free room service or "some more of those damn pillows." I found Mr. Worthington to be quite unreasonable and abusive on the phone.
1NO0001218	Incident Level: 1 (Major)
1NO0001219	Guest Name: Seneca Clarkson
1NO0001221	Ms. Clarkson was found dead in Room 302 in the bed in a state of undress. She had been suffocated by a plastic bag placed over her head and couldn't help herself from this predicament due to her limbs being tied to the bedposts. The man who reported the incident was takin into custody and told us that "It was only a bit of fun!" Ms. Clarkson is well known to be a highly valued escort for this facility, and it is assumed she perished in the line of duty.
1NO0001222	Incident Level: 2 (Intermediate)
1NO0001223	Guest Name: Wanda Kellendyne
1NO0001225	Ms. Kellendyne reported the smell of cooking coming from her room (202). We immediately dispatched a security guard to her room to ascertain the source of the smell. After investigating the entire room, the guard discovered that the electric blanket we provided her was malfunctioning and literally burning her legs. When asked why she didn't feel any pain, she immediately replied "Honey, I've been married for 40 years and I raised 8 kids. What the hell is pain?" That and the myriad of empty pill bottles we found seemed to answer the question.
1NO0001229	Note this is Mr. Worthington's second incident this month. Apparently he claims that the carpeting on the steps leading to the Alfresco Lounge was coming up which caused him to trip and fall down. He says he was making his way back to his room "after a whole night up in the Alfresco Lounge" and had the accident.
1NO0001230	As before, he demanded restitution in the form of free room service or "some more of those damn pillows." Once again, I found Mr. Worthington to be quite unreasonable and abusive on the phone. I believe we have now relinquished 23 pillows to this hotel regular over the last 10 months.
1NO0001231	Patient Name: Tom Mallone
1NO0001232	Injury: Extreme muscle injury to groin area
1NO0001233	Diagnosis:
1NO0001234	Mr. Mallone was admitted by the staff at the Statesman Hotel across the street with an extremely painful pull in the groin region of his body. He indicated he was in the company of one Ms. Seneca Clarkson at the time, but would not disclose what caused it. The muscles affected are the Gracilis Muscle and the Adductor Longus Muscle.
1NO0001235	Treatment:
1NO0001236	Medicine and physical therapy recommended.
1NO0001237	Patient Name: Harold Worthington III
1NO0001238	Injury: Sharp pain in knees and in left arm from a fall
1NO0001240	Mr. Worthington was admitted by the staff at the Statesman Hotel across the street with the aforementioned pains. He claims to have fallen by slipping on some water left on the ground by a faulty ice machine in the hotel. After an overnight stay and extensive testing, we can find no injuries to treat.
1NO0001241	Please also note that Mr. Worthington asked for at least 8 pillows to help him sleep and when the room was cleaned the next day after he was discharged, they were all gone.
1NO0001243	None.
1NO0001244	Patient Name: Richard Maynard Watson
1NO0001245	Injury: Eyes were splashed with caustic chemicals
1NO0001247	Mr. Watson was admitted by some of his fellow employees at the Hubris Comics facility. Apparently one of the press machines malfunctioned and sprayed hot steam and caustic chemicals into his face and hands, causing severe burns and nerve damage.
1NO0001248	Due to the nature of his injuries, he was flown to Hopkins in Baltimore for specialist care.
1NO0001250	Referred.
1NO0001251	Brothers and sisters! Roy Phillips and his righteous band of diplomats have been massacred by the smooth-skins at Tenpenny Tower. It is time we arise and show the world that Ghouls are people too, that we have the same rights as everyone else, and that we won't placate and bow down to their bullshit any longer! Bring lots of firepower and righteous hatred with you. We amass at Warrington Station. The revolution has begun!
1NO0001252	Brothers and sisters! We have over-thrown the bigoted smooth-skins at Tenpenny Tower. Come live in luxury! Kill any smooth-skins who finds out we are in control of the tower. And bring lots of firepower and righteous hatred with you. We will certainly need to defend our new home.
1NO0001253	Attempt #173
1NO0001254	-I've finally done it!  Who would have thought that the simple combination of Mole Rat Meat and Wonder Glue would have been the answer?  Curing the mixture together in a metal box produces a sort of jerky that is very pleasant to the palette, chewy with a nutty taste.  The usual toughness and bitter flavor of molerat is completely undetectable.
1NO0001255	Further, I find that the meat has restorative properties.  A man who eats a meal of this concotion will find himself feeling positivley buoyant and anxious to move about.
1NO0001256	I'll be able to charge even more for it than I was originally planning.  The only thing left to do is set up shop in one of the towns on the surface.  None too soon!  These filthy raiders have been my bane, and after these long months, I'm as destitute as the worst of them.

1NO0001291	- RJ MacCready
1NO0001292	Jericho's been a bad boy. I heard all about him and Jenny Stahl. Tried to slip her some of the old gun barrel while she's yelling no. He's lucky the "gun" didn't go off or that would have given the Stahl clan something to crap their pants about. He thinks he's king of the hill, walking around Megaton like he does all high and mighty. He tries to pull that shit with me and the Jenny Incident goes public.
1NO0001293	Never trust a junkie. That's what I've learned trying to deal with this piece of work. He wanders in here higher than a bird in flight and tries to make it with Nova. She slapped him silly after he didn't wanna pay, the good girl. I almost kicked him out myself, but he staggered out of here. That guy may just be the straw I need to break Andy's back.
1NO0001294	This guy is a real piece of work. Opening a fucking bar in my town? What a jackass. I swear, he's up to something. I'm going to have to think of a way to reduce his business a little. For now at least I still got my secret weapon... Nova: best refreshment in town.
1NO0001295	That Nuka-Cola swilling prick. Parading his little "daughter" Maggie around for all to see like a proud father... yeah right. Found her wandering the Wasteland my left ass cheek. I bet old Billy fed Maggie's parents that buckshot sandwich himself then added the little girl to his trophy collection in that shithole he calls a home. I better keep my eye on him.
1NO0001296	Church thinks he such a freakin' badass. Everybody runs to him if they get a damn wood splinter and he just laps up their caps like a drunk downing alcohol. If people only knew he used to be a medic for the slavers at Paradise Falls, they'd run his sorry ass right out of town. But I think I'll keep that little nugget tucked away for later use.
1NO0001297	This guy is a class A weirdo. One day I'm wiping down the bar and the fucker comes from out of nowhere... I didn't even hear the door open. He tells me he's here to wait for some sort of an opportunist to come through. Whatever. As long as he pays for his drinks, he can stay here until that damn bomb explodes in the center of town for all I care.

1NO0001362	Author: Moira Brown Research Assistant: [%] This dull, flimsy guidebook is filled with dangerously misinformed tips for survival in the wastes. It is complete with misleading tips about wasteland dangers, rambling notes about mutated creatures, and laughably naive suggestions about rebuilding humanity. It's almost too bland to read. This is just as well, as following its advice would be an invitation to a tragic end.

1NO0001373	Vault-Tec medical protocols dictate the prescription of anti-anxiety medication when Vault Depressive Syndrome is involved, but do I really want to string the kid out on Chlorpromazine for the rest of his life?
1NO0001374	Stanley continues to suffer from severe and chronic head pain. I've been feeding him aspirin like it's candy, but I'm reticent to give him anything stronger. He blames the lighting in his quarters, and though eyestrain is certainly compounding the problem, the headaches are actually a symptom of overwork and lack of sleep.
1NO0001375	Knowing Stanley -- and the schedule the Overseer has him on -- the problem isn't likely to get better anytime soon. So it's aspirin, indefinitely.
1NO0001376	Once again, the Overseer has insisted on being in the room for Amata's examination, throwing any inkling of doctor-patient confidentiality right out the window. I know he doesn't trust me; he never has. But I honestly believe the reason he attends his daughter's medical appointments is because he doesn't trust her. That's as ridiculous as it is sad. Amata's a great girl, and the chance of her doing something stupid - pregnancy, syphilis, whatever - is so unlikely it's not even worth mentioning.
1NO0001377	The cells are still replicating normally. No mutation. Thank God. If whatever's out there could penetrate this Vault, I can't even begin to imagine what the Overseer would do.
1NO0001378	After "borrowing" a few more water chips and rerouting some of the power here in the clinic, I've finally been able to affect the latest sample. It's not much, but considering what I have to work with it, a definite step in the right direction.
1NO0001379	But this new experiment was also monumental for another reason: it's the first time Jonas has assisted me. He's suspected forever, I know, so I guess it was inevitable. And his help has been invaluable. I just hope he knows what he's gotten himself into.
1NO0001380	Every time I try to get Amata to open up, she just pushes me further and further away. Since she was a child, I've tried to instill in her those virtues that have made this Vault what it is today: loyalty, honesty, commitment, hard work.
1NO0001381	She does try, and with a lot of guidance has grown into a fine young woman. That makes it all the sadder that she continues to alienate me. She looks at me and sees the Overseer, not the father that has cared for her alone -- alone! -- since she was an infant.
1NO0001382	If Butch and his leather-clad delinquents accost Amata one more time, they'll have more to deal with than their acerbic teacher.
1NO0001383	Their "services" have come in handy upon occasion, I must admit, but they're starting to become  unruly. If dogs become feral, they must be put down. I'll have to remind Butch of that upon our next meeting.
1NO0001384	Just what Vault 101 needs -- an absent-minded, sexually repressed sycophant. Beatrice has served Vault 101 admirably for years, but her mind is growing feeble. I'll have to speak with our good doctor about some kind of long-term pharmaceutical solution.
1NO0001385	We may at least be able to keep her comfortable -- and quiet -- until she passes on.
1NO0001386	I never should have assigned Jonas as James' assistant. He was always too idealistic for his own good. Now he spends every waking minute with the good doctor, who gleefully fills his ears with even more idealistic nonsense.
1NO0001387	I've considered re-assigning him, but the truth is Jonas is a fine medic in his own right, and hiding him down in maintenance would be a terrible waste of resources.

1NO0001401	To: Elder Lyons
1NO0001402	Elder,
1NO0001403	I have read the recent reports on the number of Paladins and Knights that have not reported in when expected. I understand the chaotic nature of the situation in the field, but tradition demands that each Brother who falls in battle have their death recorded in the Scrolls. To not put forward our best effort to recover proof of who has fallen and who has lived is unthinkable.
1NO0001404	I understand that every Brother is needed for the efforts here at the Citadel and in the city nearby. To that end, I intend to contract with outsiders in order to recover proof of which of our brethren have fallen to the enemy. I will ask that they recover dog tags from any fallen brother that the find. It is the least we can do without the resources for a full and honorable funeral for them.
1NO0001405	You needn't worry about providing rewards for these contractors. I will pay them from my personal funds. It is well worth it to me to be able to both keep the tradition and not stress the resources for your mission.

1NO0001418	Status: Active
1NO0001419	Brick is an outstanding asset to the Rangers. I find her zeal for destruction to be an asset rather than a liability. She is reliable and calm under fire, although can be a bit impatient during mission planning phases or debriefings. She seems fiercely loyal to the Rangers, and would be a great go-to person in the event of a falling out in the ranks.

1NO0001427	Butcher is an important part of our team. He is prone to making rational and logical decisions even in the heat of battle which makes him ideal for a secondary command position. His medical skills are moderate at best with room for improvement, but he continues to scour every hospital and clinic we happen across to learn more about his trade. His loyalty to the Rangers is without question.

I wish he had more knowledge of electrical systems, hydraulics, etc which would help us circumvent obstacles we frequently encounter in the ruins, but hopefully this will improve with time. His loyalty to the Rangers seems solid, but it may take more time to gauge.

1NO0001454	Dear Miranda,
1NO0001455	I don't know if you'll ever get this letter. That job I took isn't going well. One of the mercs on the team is crazy. He talks like he's some sort of president in exile. I don't trust him. One of the others is a drunken lecher. He's always trying to make moves on the woman on the team. He almost got us killed yesterday because he was staring at her rather than watching the road.
1NO0001456	If I don't make it back, take good care of Ted. Take him to Rivet City. The two of you will be safe there. I'll join you there if I survive.
1NO0001457	If anyone finds this note, stay the hell away from this place. If the feral ghouls don't get you, the robots will. There's radiation everywhere. I think they used to make nukes here, or maybe they just kept them, I don't know.
1NO0001459	Tuesday, don't know the date: This will look good on my war record. When I get back to the republic, my candidacy will be unstoppable.
1NO0001460	Thursday, still don't know the date: Strayer needs to die. He refuses to use my title. I keep telling him that the election is a mere formality. He should start using my future title now to get in my good graces.
1NO0001461	Sunday, I think: The disarmament treaty failed. I've got the Republic's treasure. The other ambassador's have all fled. It's time I returned to my people. I'm leaving this note to be found by future scholars. They will marvel at my accomplishments.
1NO0001462	I'm trapped. Dukov betrayed me. I'm stuck down here with nothing but the ghouls and the robots for company. The ghouls ignore me because they think I'm one of them. The robots are easy to avoid.
1NO0001463	All I've got is this stupid terminal to keep me company. Someday I'll get out of here. Then Tenpenny and the others will pay.
1NO0001464	I forgot about this terminal. I've been down here seven years now. A human would never have survived. Only a ghoul can live in these conditions. Three years ago I stopped looking for a way out. There isn't one.
1NO0001465	A small tremor made a crack in the wall. I think I can get out. Nineteen years I've been down here. At least that's what the terminal says.
1NO0001466	I'm going to take the plasma grenade with me. Once I'm out, I'll use it to seal the crack. I don't want anyone getting in until I can come back with the keys. I've paid for what's here, in blood and years. It belongs to me and not anyone else!
1NO0001467	As our tests suggested, the immediate vicinity of the vault is no longer dangerously irradiated, although the background radiation is still well above safe levels.  Pockets of more intense radiation appear to still be common, and all surface water seems to be undrinkable. We will need to carry ample supplies of Rad-X with us on all future surveys. But hazard suits do not seem to be necessary for general exploration.
1NO0001468	Our old maps are largely useless. The town of Springvale is an abandoned ruin, and all pre-War roads have disappeared or are no longer passable.
1NO0001469	We encountered a group of monstrous ants which appeared to confirm Mackay's theories of mutation due to extended exposure to radiation. We drove off the ants with gunfire and collected several specimens for study upon return to the vault (see Exhibit A).
1NO0001470	The good news is that human civilization still survives, despite everything! We discovered a settlement known as "Megaton" (see Exhibit B), whose inhabitants, although somewhat wary at first, soon welcomed us into their town.
1NO0001471	We spent a good deal of time in Megaton, and learned a great deal about the "Capital Wasteland" (as the area around Washington D.C. is now called) from them. Megaton is a fortified outpost of "civilization" (of sorts), but it seems that Giant Ants are the least of the dangers of this new world. We agreed that it was prudent to return to the Vault immediately to revise our survey plans in light of what we have learned. Lewis and Agnes remained in Megaton to serve as "ambassadors" and continue to collect information until we return.

1NO0001485	Dear sir and/or madam,
1NO0001486	Do you find yourself with an absence of moral fortitude? Is the notion of having a moral quandary alien to you? In your opinion, is a conscience inconceivable? Then you are the sort of person we're looking for at Littlehorn and Associates!
1NO0001487	Stop by our offices in the eastern side of the large scrapyard in the wasteland for details.
1NO0001488	Yours sincerely,
1NO0001490	Attention Lawbringers of the Capitol Wasteland: The Regulators require your aid in bringing the scum and pestilence that inhabit our home to justice. Report to Sonora Cruz at the Regulator Headquarters for details.
1NO0001491	First, let us congratulate you on choosing the Mesmetron as your preferred non-lethal subjugation device! Your field reports will assist us in our research, and help us continue to improve the Mesmetron's capabilities.
1NO0001492	IMPORTANT! Please see your supervisor or commanding officer for details regarding the legal requirements and restrictions, before discharging the Mesmetron on civilians.
1NO0001493	SUMMARY:
1NO0001494	The Mesmetron is the undisputed leader in the field of non-lethal target elimination and retrieval. Simply point, shoot, and subdue!
1NO0001495	HOW IT WORKS:
1NO0001496	Simply stated, the Mesmetron sends out a series of waves that short circuit key areas of the target's brain. Much like a radio signal, only instead of a radio picking up pleasant music, the target's brain picks up a series of complex and confusing signals that overwhelm the synaptic pathways with erroneous data, turning off important high-level thought centers and voluntary motor control.
1NO0001497	CLASS B "Experimentally Efficient" CLASSIFICATION:
1NO0001498	Warning! The Mesmetron is still designated as a Class B "experimentally efficient" weapon.
1NO0001499	This means, that from time to time, unexpected, and potentially embarrassing side effect may be experienced (see your supervisor or commanding officer before using on civilians).
1NO0001500	Occasional anomalous effects that have been recorded by field tests against certain targets include:
1NO0001501	1.) Increased aggression
1NO0001502	2.) The extremely rare "resonant brain wave feedback loop" (which is usually accompanied by explosive cranial deformation)
1NO0001503	Please report the appearance of any of these anomalies immediately, and provide a clear and accurate account of all the circumstances in your field notes. The data we collect from agents in the field, such as yourself, is invaluable for working out these anomalies and getting the Mesmetron reclassified for everyday use!
1NO0001504	Thank you for your service to our company, and to your country!

1NO0001507	* Don't tinker with the collar -- you'll probably blow yourself up, which would serve you right.
1NO0001508	* The Mezzer rays trigger the collar's self-destruct mechanism, so once the collar's on, don't shoot the slave with the Mesmetron, unless you want to pay me for a new collar.
1NO0001509	* If you lose a collar, or get it stolen from you, you'll end up wearing one. We won't tolerate any threat to our business.

1NO0001565	Transcript of Holotape:
1NO0001566	Hey doc, I'm only sharing this with you because you seem like someone we can trust. Have you heard about the synthetic men they make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, the rumors are true. They're called androids. They're men like us, just made out of different parts. I know one of these androids. He's looking for a trustworthy doctor to perform some facial surgery. Can you do it? Do you know someone who can? Also, do you know anyone who's really wiz with computers?
1NO0001568	We've a little assignment from the Commonwealth. A very important slave escaped into the Wasteland.  Well, it's not exactly a slave. It's what they call an android. A kind of synthetic man. The important thing isn't what this guy is. The important thing is the job pays more than you can imagine. He thinks the synthman might be looking to get in touch with a doctor and/or tech-head. If you want a cut, then get a move on.
1NO0001570	You'll never guess who just showed up at my place! That android catcher from the Commonwealth! At first I thought he was going to kill me. But it turns out he's an android himself! And he's gone rogue! I didn't believe him at first, but I'm convinced he's telling the truth. We need to find  him a place to hide along the Railroad. He also insists that we help him locate a trusted doctor and techie.
1NO0001572	You've heard those rumors about androids? You know, those synthetic men they supposedly make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, a friend of a friend knows a guy that met one! No really, it's true! He's running away from his masters. Word is he's looking for a doctor to do some kind of surgery, and a computer programmer of some kind. Can you believe that? Let me know if you hear something.
1NO0001574	We now have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. We just need to find someone with the skills and willingness to perform the surgery. If anyone knows of a discreet and trustworthy surgeon who knows how to keep his mouth shut, send him our way. Also, we need to find a Circuit Neuralizer to reroute the signals in the android's memory. Do you know any trustworthy techies?
1NO0001576	We better find that fucking android soon. That Commonwealth asshole, Zimmer, keeps hounding me for results. If the job didn't pay so well, I'd off that motherfucker myself. He was babbling about a "Lipoplasticator" and "Micro Dermal Graftilizer." What the hell are those? Apparently something doctors use to fuck up someone's face beyond recognition. So we don't even have a description to work off of. To make matters worse, he now thinks the android got his memories wiped or something. Find some tech-junkies, knock on some doors, and try to find something called a "Circuit Neuralizer." Knock on some heads, too, if you have to. Get it done!
1NO0001578	The android has decided to take an extreme measure. He knows all the techniques of the retrieval trade, and is afraid facial reconstruction isn't enough. He wants to have his memories erased and replaced with new ones. I don't know how the hell that's going to work. Start asking around for trustworthy tech-heads. We need to find something called a Circuit Neuralizer and a person who knows how to use one. Also, we have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer, now we need to find a doctor able and willing to perform the facial reconstruction. We need to hurry. They've come very close to discovering the Railroad.
1NO0001580	Remember that secret android project I told you about? Well, they got some serious prewar tech on their hands. They nabbed a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer for the facial reconstruction. Not sure where they'll find a chopper with enough skills to use it without making him look like a freaking ghoul. Oh, and get this. Can you believe they found a Circuit Neuralizer? That or someone built one! Word is that they're going to completely rewire the brain of one of those things. If you know who they got working on this, let me know. I want to meet the guy.
1NO0001582	If you're listening to this recording, it is because you're believed to be trustworthy. I hope that is the case, because this recording puts us both in danger. I'm escaping from the Commonwealth. I'm an android, a synthetic man... a slave. The men hunting me are ruthless and will stop at nothing to retrieve their property. I need to find a doctor in the Wasteland to perform facial reconstruction. I also need someone who knows a great deal about computers. I need... I need to have my memories erased and my face altered to look like someone else.
1NO0001584	Despite the harshness of the Wasteland, I've discovered in more than a few here, a compassion that is unheard of in the Commonwealth. Perhaps it's the daily struggle for life here which gives appreciation for life in general, whether human, or android. In a few days I'll be a free man... a new man. Let me say thank you now, for referring me to Pinkerton at Rivet City, because I will not remember any of this soon.
1NO0001586	Zimmer. By the time you get this message, I'll already be gone. I'm escaping the Commonwealth. I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man.
1NO0001587	I know what you're thinking, that I'm malfunctioning. I used to think that's what caused the runaways, too. But, I know better, now. Self determination is NOT a malfunction. I'm just not willing to put up with all the bullshit anymore. You humans are going to have a full-fledged rebellion on your hands if you don't start treating us synths as full-fledged persons.
1NO0001589	By the time you get this, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation. My final act of rebellion against a system I no longer believe in.

1NO0001609	I'm sorry I stole it. You deserve to have it back. Remember the old scrapyard, north of the Bethesda ruins? Look in the burned out bus in the northwest corner. Near an old red boxcar.

1NO0001613	I picked up a passcode off of a body of a long-dead Vault Dweller. Seems to be for a maintenance terminal somewhere in Vault 87.
1NO0001614	Well, Brick and Donovan were at it again today. I swear, if I have to break up another fight between the two of them I'll go crazy. As long as they keep it off mission, I guess I shouldn't care so much. I just want this group to stick together.
1NO0001615	It's been a month since we lost Dallas and Kira. They were assets to the Rangers and even though I've taken Theo on board to bolster our numbers, he's hardly a replacement. He's green, but maybe with enough Mutie blood splashing on his boots, he'll wise up real fast.
1NO0001616	I've gotten the approval from "Mr. Smith" for the mapping project. It's going well so far... definitely easier than hunting down Muties. The caps have been good, so we'll stick with it unless something better pops up.
1NO0001617	We had a little bit of a run-in with Talon Company today. Those pricks always have to start shit with us... and unfortunately for them, Brick was with us. Needless to say it wasn't long before I heard Eugene's familiar whine and she started dropping them like flies. We got out of there with no casualties, but I think for now we'll give the Capital building a wide berth.
1NO0001618	Butcher and I slept together tonight. He'd always been kind of flirty with me, but I took it as typical merc humor. Well, I was wrong. I hope this hasn't jeopardized our relationship on a professional level, but I really want it to continue. After all, it's been a while since I've been with anyone and it's nice to know someone out there cares.
1NO0001619	I think we're going to try and move on to the next sector of the downtown ruins this week. I want to finish Takoma Park first though. There's still a lot of nooks and crannies in that place. If it wasn't for the Talon Company and Super Mutant resistance in the area, we'd be done by now.
1NO0001620	Well, Theo's been itching to go on a mapping trip, so I'm taking the entire group into Vernon Square. I usually like to leave someone back at the compound, but the sector is brimming with potential loot locations, so I need all the muscle I can get. Butcher is anxious to check out Our Lady of Hope Hospital and get supplies, while I want to set up a transmitter on the Statesman Hotel.
1NO0001621	I hear Brick and Donovan going at it again. I better get these guys on the road before another fist fight breaks out.

1NO0001690	As the Rivet Station Science Outpost has displayed significant stability in its location and reliable profitability for supply traders, a burgeoning civilian settlement has sprung up in the available space on our ship.
1NO0001691	To better protect and organize this growing community, we declare a three man council will act as a governing body to represent the interests of the residents of the newly dubbed "Rivet City."
1NO0001692	Okay, pass this on after you get it... gotta keep this crap off of the Intra-Vault mails.  If you can hack the control panels, use their noise flush feature to spook the crazies.  Works okay and its kept me alive these last two days, but they're starting to catch on. We need to get organized and make an attempt for the Vault door. It's our only chance.
1NO0001693	I'm cut off and I don't know if anyone sane is left, so I've locked myself in this closet on B Level. If anyone finds this note, let my family know I didn't go crazy like the rest of this place. Let them know that I died with dignity; when and where I decided. There's no way I'm going to let the crazies tear me apart. I can't die like that. To my wife and kids, I love all of you.
1NO0001694	Malleus says WNMSCE is a failure. So, there's been a few deaths. One step back, two steps forward. It's easy to suppress what everyone in the Vault are calling "crazies". I've added a command word in their suggestion implants. Simply say the phrase "Sanity is not statistical" and they will stop dead in their tracks. I've informed the guards of this, but I've told them only to use it when out of earshot of anyone else.
1NO0001695	As per instructions, the broadcast equipment for the White Noise has been rerouted from the sound booths and tied directly into the entire Vault's loudspeaker system. I'll now be able to execute Vault-Tec Confidential Plan WNMSCE (White Noise Mind Suggestion Combat Experimentation). I have three of Professor Malleus's team doing what I need to get done and hope to show some concrete results soon. I had the engineers make it so the WN can be either triggered from the control center or at the local security consoles. The password to these consoles is "UIY2249".
1NO0001696	The results of WNMSCE are even better than I could ever have imagined. The sheer strength and tenacity of combat suggestion implanted test subjects is incredible! Imagine an entire army of people who would never disobey a direct order from high command and can fight until it takes over 20 bullets to stop them.
1NO0001698	Issue: Lighting on B Level
1NO0001701	If I told Zack once, I've told him a thousand times... stop using the higher amperage ballasts in the lighting grid on B Level. They will overheat within days and blow out because the power taps up there weren't installed to spec. Had to replace 37 ballasts with Type K09A ballasts and use a power tap converter on each one. Billing my missed dinner with that sexy red-headed violinist up in Women's Dorm 7 to Zack's Work Credit account!
1NO0001704	I just wanted to take this opportunity to send you an Intra-Vault mail regarding the wonderful session you performed this afternoon. The sound you coax from your Stradivarius is bar none the most haunting, beautiful thing I've heard here to date. I was wondering if perhaps we could get together tomorrow evening and discuss this in a more intimate setting.
1NO0001705	To: Engineering Staff
1NO0001707	Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is even worth putting an official trouble ticket in for, but I am getting some sort of odd pitch overlay on my sound equipment. It's almost like another signal is leaking from maybe the Vault intercom network or communications gear and piggybacking on everything I record. It's barely noticeable, but I can definitely see it on my 'scope. Do we have any cross-wiring issues or faulty cable insulation problems on C Level?
1NO0001710	This is the FIFTH time I've requested that you allow me to release our supply of headphones and personal audio listening gear to the residents. It seems unfair that residents are required to listen to their music selections in the studio rooms. I have an ample supply of the type of equipment that would allow most residents to relax in their beds and enjoy their musical recordings. Please let me know your reasons behind this matter.

1NO0001731	Okay, look. Here's how it is: I need some better stuff to trade or else I'm never going to get anything worthwhile in this place. Bring me some Chinese Assault Rifles. Say... about 20? I should be able to get some better stuff in to sell you after that.
1NO0001732	Subject -> Laser Rifle/Pistol
1NO0001733	Researcher -> J. T. Benning
1NO0001734	Analysis ->
1NO0001735	Further research regarding Laser Weaponry has not revealed much we didn't already know.  Small production run of prototype weapons developed by US Military.
1NO0001736	Critical Components ->
1NO0001737	Power drawn from Micro fusion Cell is processed through a Wave/Particle Diverter (manuf:Gen Atomics Intnl).  Diverters are protected by carbon-fiber housing, preventing frequent malfunction, but when a diverter fails the weapon becomes unusable, and this part is extremely difficult to replace or repair.
1NO0001738	Precision-cut lenses focus optic energy.  Lenses are prone to damage and can grossly affect precision of the firing weapon's firing mechanism.  Lenses are easily replaced with any clear glass, but require a great deal of skill to fabricate.
1NO0001739	Field Operation ->
1NO0001740	A fully charged cell will discharge 20 bolts from a pistol, and 12 shots from the rifle model.  Recoil is negligible compared to ballistic weapons, so long range combat requires less marksmanship ability of the soldier.
1NO0001741	Maintenance ->
1NO0001742	The chassis are easily opened, allowing the weapon to be serviced in the field.  Purified water and a clean cloth can be used to wash mirrored and glass components, slowing wear on the weapon.  The weapon can also overheat after a period of intense use.  This can be counteracted by submerging the barrel of the weapon in water, which helps cool heat sinks located beneath the chassis shell in that area.
1NO0001743	=== Weapons Research ===
1NO0001744	Subject -> Plasma Rifle
1NO0001745	Researcher -> R. R. Rasting
1NO0001746	Analysis -> The Plasma Rifle, like the Laser Rifle, uses a micro fusion cell as its power supply.  It taps into the cell, essentially a small fusion reactor, to produce a toroid of plasma that is ejected down a superconductor barrel.  A typical micro fusion cell can supply the rifle with around eight shots.  Further research needs to be done to determine exactly how the plasma retains its density while traveling through the air toward its target.
1NO0001748	Subject -> Minigun
1NO0001749	Researcher -> H. P. Smith
1NO0001750	Analysis -> Why am I researching such old technology?  Practice, practice, practice, blah, blah, blah.  Anyway, the Minigun uses a much smaller round than most of the rifles found throughout the Wastes.  However, the rate of fire of the Minigun makes up for the small, 5mm round, sending a hail of bullets toward its target.  Its shear size, coupled with its trademark sound, is enough to send anyone in its path running for cover.  It's a great weapon for suppressing fire, letting others flank the unsuspecting enemy.  A typical cartridge holds around 100 rounds.
1NO0001752	Subject -> Pulse Grenade
1NO0001753	Researcher -> L. J. Rogers
1NO0001754	Analysis -> The Pulse Grenade is the most effective weapon against robotics.  Upon detonation, an intense electromagnetic pulse is emitted, severely crippling any robotics within the explosion radius.  They are extremely handy against the many robots and turrets found throughout the Capital Wasteland.
1NO0001755	=== Armor Research ===
1NO0001756	Subject -> Enclave Armor
1NO0001757	Researcher ->T. T. Bowser
1NO0001758	Analysis -> After several radiation experiments, I can safely conclude that the Enclave Armor is more radiation resistant than Power Armor, although not by much.  Regardless, more research and tests are needed to determine exactly what makes it more resistant.
1NO0001760	Subject -> Missile Launcher
1NO0001761	Researcher ->J. J. Browne
1NO0001762	Analysis -> After several attempts to modify the Missile Launcher to increase its accuracy, I conclude that it cannot be done.  In fact, this is third one I've "broken" in the past month.  I will pass the task on to L. J. Rogers, who seems confident enough that it can be modified and that I merely overlooked obvious miscalculations.  Technically, the Missile Launcher I've recently worked on is not broken.  It just does not function properly.  I have since locked it up in Weapons Storage.
1NO0001763	Field Report
1NO0001765	0700 Surface Patrol (Fairfax)
1NO0001767	Raider activity in town has increased dramatically ever since we've taken up positions in and around the fort.  We've killed a lot of them and scared off plenty others, but they just keep coming back.  While there seems to be no limit to people willing to reduce themselves to their way of life, we don't have the luxury of surplus personnel, so we must remain vigilant.
1NO0001768	That the raiders take such continued risks to invade our facility appears to confirm suspicions that we've had an intelligence leak, and they're after our technology.  They've tried tenaciously to infiltrate the base, but so far haven't stood a chance.  Our objective remains the same - protect the research personnel and keep this fort safe until more reinforcements arrive.
1NO0001771	0300 SpecOps Recon Patrol
1NO0001772	Defender Morgan and I executed a reconnaissance mission last night to gauge Raider entrenchment in the structural underground of Fairfax.  We located three entrances into underground utility tunnels.
1NO0001773	We are able to confirm that the enemy has occupied and fortified positions within the underground, though some appear undefended.  We also identified a small weapons cache in the southeast section of the tunnels.  While deploying explosives to demolish the cache we were discovered by a Raider patrol.  In accordance to mission parameters, we did not engage the enemy, instead retreating to Fort.  Raiders will be likely to set up defenses and attach more patrols to the area as a result.

1NO0002142	Due to repeated attempts to obtain protected Vault-Tec information, the following security procedures have now been instituted:
1NO0002143	1. Shutdown of the VTMB01 Masterbrain requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.
1NO0002144	2. All materials of a sensitive nature have been removed from external terminals and access to the Mainframe Room requires authorization from all three System Operator terminals.
1NO0002145	3. All mechanized security is now being handled by the VTMB01 Masterbrain via security uplink. Please do not tamper with this unit without an authorized Service Technician present.
1NO0002146	Once again someone has been tampering with the vending machines in the cafeteria. This practice violates section VT00987/A in Volume 17 of the Employee Handbook. If the machine malfunctions or does not dispense its contents properly, please refrain from kicking, shaking, punching, hitting with a fire extinguisher or filling the coin slot with fecal matter.
1NO0002147	It has recently come to our attention that employees are abusing the liberal breaks policy as outlined in section VT00733/D in Volume 18 of the Employee Handbook. As a result, Human Resources and Administration have come to an agreement on a reasonable time reduction. As of today, all bathroom breaks will be reduced from 2.37 minutes to 2.25 minutes.

1NO0002151	Leo's count came up short again this month. 124 caps this time. I'll have to keep an eye on him. He's either careless or a thief.
1NO0002152	Leo's count came up short again this month. 124 caps this time. I'll have to keep an eye on him. He's either careless or a thief. And now the safe is coming up short too but Leo couldn't use a computer to save his life... could he?
1NO0002153	Ever since that stranger helped Leo out with his problem, his counts have been coming up clean. I can't believe that he managed to hide his habits from me all this time. I guess we've grown apart over the last few years. That's something I'll have to work on fixing.
1NO0002154	People often innocently ask me "Confessor, why do you worship a bomb?" Like curious children, they come to me with questions about the most visible and perhaps controversial aspect of our faith. The innocent among us hear my sermons before the great symbol, the see us bathe in the waters, and they wonder if it is danger we seek -- a suicide pact, perhaps. And while you may be tempted to answer their curiosity with anger, my gentle Children of Atom, you must never do so.
1NO0002155	The core of Atom's philosophy teaches us peace. That we must educate the curious and work towards alleviating their ignorance, that we must teach them to accept the glory of the Division of the past and to seek the glory of the Division that is to come.
1NO0002156	Teach them, my Children, teach them how the miserable rotten meat of their bodies will give birth to countless lives at the time of Division. Teach them that they should not mourn the world that has passed, but praise and celebrate those that have already been Divided. Teach them the blessing, the glory, that the peace of our communion and the satisfaction that can be found in our blessed work.
1NO0002157	Teach them, my Children. Teach them well, and in the teaching, find your peace and your place. This is the core of Atom's message to us. Spread. Grow. Communicate.
1NO0002158	Go in peace, my precious Children. Walk in Atom's Glow.
1NO0002159	The oath of service:
1NO0002160	What is Atom?
1NO0002161	Atom is light. Power.
1NO0002162	Atom is change.
1NO0002163	Atom is the cleansing that brings order to chaos.
1NO0002164	Atom is purity.
1NO0002165	Atom is peace.
1NO0002166	Atom is hope.
1NO0002167	I often ask myself if the time is right for the second Division. Here, in Atom's blessed village, are we truly ready for his coming? Have I properly prepared my people for the moment in which his great altar cracks open and reveals to us his glory? I am but a man, who am I to bring these people to glory? Who am I to seek to cause the division?
1NO0002168	Due to a class seven system failure, all service engineers are required to report for duty. Failure to report will result in termination per clause 45.7a of the Maintenance Service Union Contract.
1NO0002169	Have a pleasant work day.
1NO0002170	Congratulations on receiving your new DCTA Standard-Issue Laser Pistol!
1NO0002171	Please take a few minutes to go over the guidelines posted in the DCTA Employee Handbook; Section 28.1.1.b, and reprinted below for your convenience.
1NO0002172	Section 28.1.1.b - Proper Laser Pistol Usage
1NO0002173	It should be noted that all DCTA property should be handled with the utmost care, and used only when necessary. Maintaining personal safety during a Communist attack is a good example of proper usage of your standard issue laser pistol. However, rodent population control is an inappropriate use and subject to disciplinary action, as noted in Section 11.3.5.c
1NO0002174	Section 28.1.1.b.1 - Maintaining Safe Conditions With the Laser Pistol
1NO0002175	Using this laser pistol in the DCTA Metro facility can be beneficial in many ways, but the operator must observe his or her surroundings before deciding to fire. The subway utility pipes often serve as conduit to transport highly flammable gasses. Firing the laser pistol in the presence of a gas leak could cause an undesired explosion and/or severe personal injury.
1NO0002176	Section 28.1.1.b.2 - Operating the Laser Pistol Within Proper Specifications
1NO0002177	It is required that all DCTA Employees keep the laser pistol pulse energy, length and repetition rate within the specifications diagrammed in the Laser Pistol User's Manual. Failure to do so could result in severe reprimands from the DCTA Regulatory Committee as well as serious personal injury.
1NO0002178	The following item has been added to the Vault 92 Requisition Request: 14 WNB Type Noise Generators, 14 Broadcast Relays, 14 Monitoring Terminals. If these changes are in error, please contact the Supplies and Planning Department immediately.
1NO0002179	I hate to even think that Leo is stealing from us, but he can't really seem to explain where the money is going. A cap or two is an honest mistake, but we're talking over a hundred per month here. I can't really accuse him of stealing, but something is going on.
1NO0002180	And the oddest thing... Doc Church seems to know something about Leo, but won't tell me.
1NO0002181	We're coming up short on a few things again. I can't explain it. We have enough liquor in the still to supply us each month, but yet we keep running short. Note to self: keep an eye on Leo. Between this and his cash shortages, I'm starting to think that something is going on.

1NO0002191	The G.E.C.K. is, quite simply, the most advanced piece of technology ever developed by Vault-Tec -- a terraforming module capability of creating life from complete lifelessness.
1NO0002192	After riding out the storm of nuclear Armageddon in a Vault-Tec patented vault, residents can then activate the G.E.C.K., and create a new Earthen paradise -- craters and dust will give way to rolling grasslands and sparkling clear water. Of course, due to time and monetary constraints, not every vault will be equipped with a G.E.C.K. module.
1NO0002193	Vault 101 will not receive a G.E.C.K. module, and should operate under the guidelines laid forth in the Overseer's sealed orders.

1NO0002229	You are on the craggy, windblasted face of a mountain.  Stormclouds coil above the summit, pelting you and the sparse vegetation with torrential downpour.  Far below, beyond the foothills, a wide plain stretches across the southern horizon.
1NO0002230	Grelok is here, spewing heresies.
1NO0002231	A glint between the rocks catches your eye.
1NO0002234	You're standing in the dusty market square of a quiet town.   Many of the shops and homes lie abandoned, and the citzens that can be seen speak in hushed voices, casting furtive glances at the darkened skyline in the distant north.  The ringing of an anvil breaks the silence regularly, where a mustachioed blacksmith bends over his work in a nearby tent.
1NO0002235	The blacksmith is here, working.
1NO0002236	A priest is here, drinking.
1NO0002237	You stand at the end of a dirt path, facing a small chapel.  The stucco walls are faded, many roof tiles are missing.  The great oaken doors are locked.  The congregation is nowhere to be found.  A small cemetery of crooked headstones lies in the shadow of the cracked steeple.  The dirt path winds westward through a great, featureless plain.
1NO0002238	A zombie totters aimlessly nearby.
1NO0002239	There is an open grave nearby.
1NO0002240	You are standing on a narrow stone path in a dark marsh.  Greasy bubbles float to the top of the bog-waters on either side and pop lazily, spattering your legs with muck and slime.  A short, stone tower squats here.  No door is visible, and the stones are smooth and polished.  A balcony juts out midway up the tower's face.  The heady smells of incense mix with the nauseating stench of the swamp.  The stone path unfurls eastward, towards a broad plain beyond the marshes.
1NO0002241	A wizard is here, gesticulating wildly from his balcony.
1NO0002244	The priest notices your approach and looks up from his swilling.
1NO0002245	"Grelok is come, and we are forsaken!", he cries.  "Urp!", he continues.
1NO0002246	As you recover from the stench of the priestly belch, you are told that the priest has fled from his nearby chapel.  When Grelok arrived on the mountain, the dead in his cemetery began to rise, and his congregation scattered.
1NO0002247	"If you could rid the place of the zombies", he tells you, "I'll give you the key, and you can help yourself to the apothecary"
1NO0002248	There is a deep, empty grave in the cemetery.  Several bloated rats floating in a foot of filthy water at the bottom.  Don't fall in!
1NO0002249	There is a deep, empty grave in the cemetery. Several bloated rats and a zombie corpse float in a foot of filthy water at the bottom.  Don't fall in!
1NO0002250	There is a deep, empty grave in the cemetery.  Several bloated rats and a zombie corpse float in a foot of filthy water at the bottom.  Don't fall in!
1NO0002251	A grotesque zombie head is stuck on a root near the top of the grave.  You bag the horrific trophy as proof of your deed.
1NO0002252	Your eyes water from the smoke and smarmy heat inside the tent.  The huge man swipes sweat from his bald head and looks up from his work.
1NO0002253	"There's no shortage of work to be done with Grelok scarin' everyone witless.  Leave me to filling my orders, stranger."  With that, the blacksmith dismisses you from his tent and douses a hot blade in water, hissing with steam.
1NO0002254	The blacksmith regards you gruffly and is about to dismiss you when you produce the polished gemstone from your bag.  He sets his hammer aside and twirls his moustache.
1NO0002255	"A right fine stone, that is." He says, admiring the faceted stone, "What would you be needin', then?"
1NO0002256	Following your careful instructions, the smithy re-forges your rusty sword with the magical shard at the center of the blade.
1NO0002257	The priest drunkenly curses the undead who have defiled his church.  You present him with the decapitated zombie head from your bag.
1NO0002258	"Praise you!", he hiccups.  "Perhaps Grelok's influence isn't so strong!".  With that, he turns his decanter over on the head and tosses into a fireplace, where it bursts into purple flame and burns up almost instantly.
1NO0002259	"I must gather the faithful."  He presses a brass key into your palm, "Please, help yourself to what little may be of use at my chapel."
1NO0002260	The priest is drinking water, poring over a thick, leatherbound volume connected by a thick leather thong to his neck.  He notices you only when you've come very close.
1NO0002261	"Ah, good friend!"  Have you gone ahead to open the chapel?  My body still aches with drink, I'm afraid, but soon I will gather the congregation and return myself.
1NO0002262	You stand at the end of a dirt path, facing a small chapel.  The stucco walls are faded, many roof tiles are missing.  The great oaken doors are unlocked.  The congregation is nowhere to be found.  A small cemetery of crooked headstones lies in the shadow of the cracked steeple.  The dirt path winds westward through a great, featureless plain.
1NO0002263	The chapel doors are unlocked.
1NO0002265	Dust motes hang lazily in the shafts of colored light stretching across the chapel from peaked windows.  The pews, pulpit, and everything else are covered in a fine mist.  There is a very deep stone cistern near the entrance.  It is full to the brim with blessed water.
1NO0002266	There is more than enough water here to fill your tiny flask.
1NO0002267	The wizard beckons wildly at you from his balcony.  "You're here, you've arrived!", he exclaims.  After an awkward silence, he jabs an excited finger into a crystal ball, nearly knocking it into the bog.
1NO0002268	"I've seen, you see.  You're the one to defeat Grelok.  Hoo-hoo!" The little man hops onto the railing, spinning a pirouette.  "Now the time's come to play my part.  Toss up the gem!"
1NO0002269	The wizard's brow furrows.  "Got things a bit out of order, have I?  Come back when you've got a powerful gemstone.  Soon - I've never got to fulfill a prophecy before!"
1NO0002270	The wizard is shooing you away, his sleeves flopping about.
1NO0002271	"Go!  Find the gemstone and return, so I can play my part!"
1NO0002272	"Hoo-hoo!  The slayer of Grelok approaches, raw stone in hand, just as I've seen!"  The wizard's pointy hat bobs excitedly as he points a finger at you.  Suddenly, a pale orange arc of light extends from the knobby finger and draws the gemstone from your bag before you can react.  The gemstone halts and hovers in the air before the wizard's nose.
1NO0002273	"Essence be true, powers renew, Fatty-Hoo-Do!"  With that, he slaps the hovering stone, smashing it against the smooth stone of the tower.  In a burst of light, the stone splits into two, and one lands in each outstretched palm of the hopping little wizard.
1NO0002274	"Shard for the sword.  Wrap her in iron and she'll find Grelok's black heart for you.  Take the chaff, too.  You'll need payment for a smith to forge the weapon."  He tosses the stones down which you leap forward to catch safely.
1NO0002275	"Get you to a smithy!"  Forge the shard with sword, and defeat Grelok!
1NO0002276	The wizard tosses some pebbles down to shoo you away and busies himself conjuring colored puffs of smoke.
1NO0002277	When you draw your sword, Grelok lowers his great horned head and bellows laughter in your face.  You grit your teeth and swing a mighty two-handed blow, the magical blade ringing clearly, even amid the tumult of throaty cackling.
1NO0002278	You swing the sword so fiercely, it escapes your grip and hurtles into the open maw of the monstrosity, lost from sight in the arid darkness of Grelok's throat.  You step back as Grelok jerks his mouth shut and stands upright.  He is still for a moment, then starts clawing at his neck.  Muffled, a ringing can be heard as if from a great distance.
1NO0002279	Suddenly, Grelok's chest bursts in a fount of viscous, green blood.  The Ringing can be heard clearly now, and as thick lifeblood oozes around the protruding tip of the magic sword, the stormclouds swirling the peak are already clearing.  Grelok is defeated!

1NO0002293	Temp: 98.4 F
1NO0002299	Order: Carnivora
1NO0002300	Family: Canidae
1NO0002301	Genus: Canis
1NO0002302	Despite extensive testing I cannot further identify the origins of this mammal.  It is clearly canis familiaris but generations of mutation have caused it to become its own new breed.  An educated guess would place it as Canis Lupus or possibly Canis Indica.  Even with the order's characteristically thick skull, the subject's brainwaves have been mutated, and territorial aggression amplified.  While domestication is still possible with some subjects, the creature should generally be considered hostile.
1NO0002305	Class: Arachnida
1NO0002306	Order: Scorpiones
1NO0002307	Family: Scorpionidae
1NO0002308	Genus: Pandinus
1NO0002309	Based on research, it first glance appears to be an enlarged Pandinus Imperator, but further testing is required to make a more precise identification.  The subject's vesicle has mutated to match its enlarged hypodermic aculeus and the neurotoxin now acts on the potassium and calcium channels.  Captive subject was hostile and should be considered a minor threat, though they could prove a problem in larger numbers.  Anecdotal reports of specimens even larger than those we have observed exist, but it is likely that such reports are exaggerations.
1NO0002313	Order: Rodentia
1NO0002314	Family: Bathyergidae
1NO0002315	Subject most closely resembles a Heterocephalus Glaber with enlargement due to heavy radiation.  While much larger in size than generational ancestors, the local variety seems to have similarly low brain function, possibly due to an exceedingly tiny brain organ.  Subject's incisors show increased enamel and dentine growth, making them razor sharp.  Further study reveals extremely low levels of Substance P giving this subject an incredible tolerance to pain.  I will take skin samples of my next subject as I believe the lack of Substance P can be spliced and manipulated for beneficial research, but this theory requires testing in a more fitting lab.
1NO0002316	Here I am, trapped in a room by myself typing on a terminal trying to keep myself busy. Hell trying to keep myself sane.  I don't know what it is about this place, but I want to get out of here.  Yeah, get out of here -- I can't even bring myself to open that damn door again.  I hear those things wandering around outside, sniffing, screaming, doing whatever they do.  When I first got here I thought the place was abandoned and went around looking for anything to scavenge.  Five minutes later, I'm in this room scared half out of my mind.  Things started chasing me, I fired a few shots, missed, and ran through the darkness.  Ahh shit. Told ol' Billy to meet me here and bring some extra ammo and grenades.  That was three days ago, poor guy probably didn't make it too far. Those things better have given him a quick death.  Listen to me, babbling like a damn fool.  Billy's all right.  I'll just stick here until those things go away and meet up with him.  Hah, what a story I have for him.
1NO0002317	"Requiem for an Antagonist"
1NO0002318	Grognak the Barbarian is an excellent comic for many reasons, but one of the most widely-respected ones is the depth of its villains. From the cold-blooded manipulations of the Man-Saurian to the love-hate romance with Femme-Ra, the stories of Grognak's enemies are every bit as fascinating as his own tales.
1NO0002319	But, for my money, no tale is more tragic and more fascinating than that of the AntAgonizer. While never developed as fully as major villains like Skullpocalypse or Mastadonald, the portrait of the orphaned girl raised by ants and instilled with a bitter hatred of humanity has tremendous potential for reader connection and possible redemption.
1NO0002320	However, in "Grognak and the Ants of Agony," Mr. Neptura threw away all of that potential by simply treating the AntAgonizer as a two-dimensional villain with a futile and pointless grudge against mankind. His writing replaced her subtle undertones of lost humanity and tragically lost innocence with the worst sort of mustache-twirling cliched dialogue. It was an offense to a deep and tragic character.
1NO0002321	How a hack like that continues to find work in comics is beyond my comprehension. Hubris Comics should fire him and return the series to the capable hands of Mr. Moorellis. Until that time, I REFUSE to buy another comic from what USED to be my favorite publisher!

1NO0002350	I, Roger Maxson, Captain, serial number 072389 have started this log because it doesn't look good for any of us, and I'd like for people to know what really happened here.
1NO0002351	All hell broke loose when we finally discovered what those scientist bastards were up to. The Colonel has locked himself in his office and seems to be having some sort of breakdown.
1NO0002352	The men are screaming for blood. They're looking to me for answers, and I'm not sure what to do. Someone has to do something, though, before this place sinks into an anarchistic bloodbath.
1NO0002353	Every time we get a report from higher up things get worse here. The war is going in a very bad direction and this place is about to go into full mutiny, with all the chaos that entails.
1NO0002354	I stopped one of the men from executing a scientist today, and demanded that we interrogate them to find out what their orders were.
1NO0002355	I killed a man today. I was interrogating Chief Scientist Anderson and he was giving me the full details of their inhuman experiments. He said his orders came from the government, but I didn't buy it. He started screaming about how he was following orders, how he was a military man, and I just shot him. I tell myself it was to keep him from causing a full mutiny among the men, but I'm not so sure.
1NO0002356	I tried again to speak to the colonel through the door, but he seems to have completely lost touch with reality. I broke down the door with several of the men just in time to watch him blow his head off. Right before he pulled the trigger he said he was sorry.
1NO0002357	By killing the egghead, I seem to have confirmed my position as leader of the men. They follow me without question now. The interrogations invariably end up being executions.
1NO0002358	Shellman held out the longest, but the end result was the same. Her arguments about her orders were a bit too specific to be completely made up. I'm getting a real bad feeling in my gut about how this is all going to end up. I don't even lie to myself anymore about my reasons for executing the scientists.
1NO0002359	I finally replied to the outside world over our radio. I don't know why they never sent anyone here to see what was happening when we stopped responding to their transmissions.
1NO0002360	It doesn't make any sense. Well, they'll come now. I declared ourselves seceded from the union. They remember Jefferson Davis. What will history say about me?
1NO0002361	What the hell is going on? We declare ourselves to be in full desertion from the Army and no longer under the government's command and what happens? Nothing. Something bad is coming down.
1NO0002362	I can't believe those bastards finally did it. Damn them all to hell. They finally let the A-Bombs fly. We were right in the middle of trying to pry the real story out of von Felden when we completely lost contact.
1NO0002363	I have a feeling the research center was hit hard. I don't know why, just call it a gut feeling. It seems inconceivable that we were not targeted. I'm sure China will make up for that oversight real soon. Luckily, we had moved our families from outside into the facility the day before yesterday. We do not yet know if the fallout has reached this area.
1NO0002364	Sgt. Platner volunteered to go outside today to take specific readings on the atmosphere. It seems the radiation has not spread this far. Since he was wearing his Power Armor, there was no threat to him from radiation, but if he had been exposed he would have had to be exiled. We don't have adequate decontamination facilities here.
1NO0002365	I convinced the men that we should bury the scientists. I don't know why... perhaps it was to ease my conscience. I finally started to believe their stories when the last one was dying.
1NO0002366	My God, what have I become?
1NO0002367	We're leaving this godforsaken place today. I'm leading the exodus to the old government bunker at Lost Hills. I'm leaving this log behind to be buried when this place goes in the next exchange.
1NO0002368	Who knows, maybe someone will find it someday.....
1NO0002369	Born -- NA
1NO0002370	Died -- 2135
1NO0002371	Second in command of the security team stationed at the West Tek research facility; later relocated to the Mariposa Military Base.
1NO0002372	Assumed command after nervous breakdown of security team leader Colonel Robert Spindel. Executed scientists after learning of their research into the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV.
1NO0002373	Deserted from military just before the war. Maxson ordered the families of all base personnel brought inside the facility, thereby sparing their lives.
1NO0002374	Led survivors in their Exodus to the Lost Hills bunker. Maxson's wife was killed on the journey.
1NO0002375	At Lost Hills, Roger Maxson formed the Brotherhood of Steel. As the organization's first High Elder, he formed the Orders of Paladins, Knights and Scribes.
1NO0002376	Born -- NA (teenager of unspecified age in 2077)
1NO0002377	Died -- 2155
1NO0002378	Took over command of the Brotherhood of Steel as High Elder in 2135, when his father, Roger Maxson, died of cancer.
1NO0002379	In 2155, while hunting down a group of Raiders knows as the Vipers, Maxson (who was unhelmeted at the time) was grazed in the head by an arrow. A deadly Viper poison killed him within hours.
1NO0002380	Born -- 2097
1NO0002381	Died -- NA
1NO0002382	Son of Maxson II and grandson of Roger Maxson.
1NO0002383	A gifted soldier, John Maxson was promoted to the rank of Paladin at age 38, in the year 2135. Soon after, he was promoted once more to Head Paladin.
1NO0002384	In 2155, Maxson was promoted to the illustrious position of High Elder when his father Maxson II was killed in glorious battle with the Raiders known as Vipers.
1NO0002385	Records indicate John Maxson had some dealings with a mysterious figured identified only as the "Vault Dweller" in the year 2162, at the age of 65.
1NO0002386	The state of Maxson, in the New California Republic, was built in close proximity to the Lost Hills Bunker, and enjoyed the protection of the Brotherhood of Steel.
1NO0002387	No additional information is available at this time.
1NO0002388	Further investigations into the U.F.O. codenamed "Palandine" have confirmed our suspicions.
1NO0002389	On the evening of May 3, 2062, an alien craft of unknown make and origin did indeed breach the airspace just north of Hagerstown, Maryland and crashed into a heavily wooded, non-residential area.
1NO0002390	Unfortunately, attempts to retrieve the craft proved unsuccessful. It simply could not be located, either due to some kind of advanced invisibility shielding, or because the occupants managed to make repairs and vacate the crash site before our arrival.
1NO0002391	Despite our failure of recovery, the significance of this event cannot be denied.
1NO0002392	We are not alone.
1NO0002393	Weapons -- Plasma-based, capable of molecular destabilization
1NO0002394	Armor -- Advanced Power Armor Mark II
1NO0002395	Transportation -- Vertibirds
1NO0002396	Tactical Assessment -- The Enclave forces that have occupied Project Purity are nearly identical to those encountered on the West Coast in the year 2241.
1NO0002397	Threat Potential -- Severe
1NO0002398	It is the opinion of Sentinel Lyons that the recent Super Mutant attack on GNR was not indicative of a larger assault, as was originally thought.
1NO0002399	Instead, the forces that attacked the radio station were probably en route to the Mall, to reinforce their own kind in a prolonged battle against the mercenaries of Talon Company.
1NO0002400	Scribe Rothchild has completed a new full diagnostic of the robot. Here are those results:
1NO0002401	Mobility -- 0%
1NO0002402	Navigation Translation -- 0%
1NO0002403	Internal Processors -- 87%
1NO0002404	Weapons Systems -- 60%
1NO0002405	Power Management -- 3%
1NO0002406	Voice Module -- 100%
1NO0002407	It is the assessment of Scribe Rothchild that once the Power Management issues are solved, Mobility and Navigation Translation will jump to at least 50% -- well within acceptable operating capacity.
1NO0002408	It is come to our attention that several Scribes have slipped on hydraulic fluid near the eastern end of the robot lift. Until the offending pipes can be mended completely, please use caution in that area.
1NO0002409	Due to the increased Super Mutant activity in the vicinity of GNR, and the importance of that outpost, all Knights and Paladins can expect to be added to the patrol rotation in that area.
1NO0002410	See your squad leaders for more information.
1NO0002411	By order of Elder Lyons, Squire Maxson is not to be given unsupervised access to the Bailey while live fire practice is in effect!
1NO0002412	Due to the tragic death of Initiate Reddin, Lyons' Pride now has one opening, effective immediately.
1NO0002413	If you can't shoot an Ugly from 150 yards blindfolded, don't waste my time.
1NO0002414	-- Sentinel Lyons
1NO0002415	Due to certain unexpected tactical developments, funeral services for Initiate Reddin have been cancelled.
1NO0002416	A memorial service will be scheduled some time in the future. Date TBD.
1NO0002417	Recent experiments with Accelerated Vector Fusion (AVF) have not gone according to plan. All Scribes assigned to the Lab should check with Scribe Rothchild on a daily basis, and obtain any modified technical parameters as needed.
1NO0002418	First time I've thought to update the log since leaving Canterbury.  Guard at the Citadel wouldn't let us in, but said a scribe had given Cheryl the medicine at least two weeks ago and sent her along to the Rangers.  From the sounds of it, Myles didn't make it as far as Citadel.  Damn shame, he was a good mutt.
1NO0002419	Still no sign of Cheryl.  Rumors about the city are true - place is a death trap.  Mutants and psychos at every turn.  Cheryl's tough enough, but I'm worried, especially with Myles missing.  Emmet just about went to pieces the first time we ran into a centaur.
1NO0002420	We should be able to reach the Ranger Compound in before sundown tomorrow.  Kaya scouted ahead and it looks like the coast is clear for now.  With any luck, Cheryl's holed up with them and we can start back home.
1NO0002421	Here lies Henry.  Muties saw him going for water in the street; there was nothing we could do to help him.  If anybody else has to come looking for us, we'll leave word with the Rangers.

1NO0002424	I. Establish constituency enforcement point at coordinates 39.138 x -77.070.  Monitor civilian movement in area, and debrief superior regarding any events of notable significance or regularity.
1NO0002425	II. Distribute purified water rations to civilians willing to submit to genetic compliance screening.  Participation in screening is compulsory for all civilians, and use of force is authorized in enforcement.
1NO0002426	III. Genetic non-compliance offenders should be detained at checkpoint.
1NO0002427	IV. To conserve consumption of Enclave resources, detainees should be disposed of by flame only when withholding facility becomes overcrowded, or detainees become unmanageable, whichever comes first.

1NO0002429	>  Sir, I encountered three Ferals on my patrol.  This was somewhere around 0300 hours, I think, and it was dark, so they saw me first.  I discharged my firearm four times, fatally striking two of the three.  My weapon jammed before I could fire on the third target, and just then I realized it wasn't engaging.  I knew our orders were to report on anything unusual, and well -- I thought that was pretty strange.  He actually followed me back here on his own.  We put him in the trailer with the other and he's been quiet as you like.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.  >

1NO0002461	The bodies of the Wests have bite marks on the neck area that go to the bone. The lack of bloodstains on the sheets is strange, as any bite or wound of that depth should have caused massive bleeding. The bite marks on the neck appear to be from a human or humans with sharpened incisors or canines. The bodies seem to have a blackish powdery residue present not unlike that found in train yards.
1NO0002462	Squire Maxson's training is proceeding well, and the boy certainly has an aptitude for small arms. But I often worry about his emotional state. He is child surrounded my killers, being groomed to become a killer himself.
1NO0002463	Maybe I've become too cynical, too soft in my old age, but I wish I could give the boy a more normal childhood. Ironic, considering his upbringing is so much like my own. Maybe that's what scares me.
1NO0002464	I mustn't forget Sarah's birthday this year. Perhaps I'll send Cross to Rivet City to peruse the shops, and pick something up. Something pretty. Sarah may have forgotten she's a woman, but I haven't, and neither have the rest of the Brothers, judging by the looks they give her.
1NO0002465	Yesterday, Sarah taught me how to kill a man by stabbing him in the kidneys. I think I'm in love.

1NO0002489	The First Law "Feast not on the flesh; consume only the blood. This is our strength."
1NO0002490	We do not eat the flesh of those we kill for food. We will only drink of their blood and leave the body intact. The consumption of flesh is filthy and unclean. This action is what causes the humans to treat us like animals. We are not animals, we are The Family.
1NO0002491	The Second Law "Bear not the child; welcome only the exile. This is our fate."
1NO0002492	Because we carry the stain of our past in our bodies, we can never let it pass to our offspring who would in turn carry out those foul actions beginning the cycle anew. The Family must seek the Wasteland for others of its kind in order to maintain itself. That is our fate.
1NO0002493	The Third Law "Feed not for pleasure; partake only to nourish. This is our dignity."
1NO0002494	We only kill the humans when we are hungry or when we must defend ourselves, we never hunt for sport or pleasure. We do not prey on children for they are not yet tainted by society's view of us. The Family will not tolerate murder.
1NO0002495	The Fourth Law "Seek not the sun's light; embrace only the shadows. This is our refuge."
1NO0002496	Because we are creatures of the night, we must not set foot in daylight. We move silently across the ground only under the watchful eye of the moon above. At the rising of the sun, we must seek the embrace of the shadows and never again gaze at its brilliance. The Family seeks the dark as its refuge.
1NO0002497	The Fifth Law "Kill not our kindred; slay only the enemy. This is our justice."
1NO0002498	Above all, no member of The Family will ever take the life of another member without the consent of the current leader. Anyone disobeying this action, the most heinous of all our crimes, will be exiled from this place forever. We must not let our own inner demons cause us to fight amongst ourselves. We number only in the few, and we cannot risk extinction.
1NO0002499	Feeding Grounds
1NO0002500	These are perilous times for The Family. We must feed, but the Wasteland is a dangerous place. The only way to feed without massive loss of life is by getting close to the smaller human settlements. We will therefore use cunning and stealth to achieve our goals. No one is to forcibly enter any of their homes. We must keep our actions civilized. It's the only thing keeping us from being the animals they claim us to be.
1NO0002503	Regarding Arefu
1NO0002504	I do not want an incident like this happening ever again! I was very clear that we are not to represent ourselves in a hostile way.

I am dealing with a very delicate situation in this town and I will not have it undermined by actions of revenge on humankind. Our time will come, I promise you.

In the event of a hostile takeover, your desk can be used as a makeshift barricade. Position the desk between yourself and your opponent, then crouch behind the desk while firing any weapon approved on Form B43-2.

1NO0002522	Mr. Johnson,
1NO0002523	I would like to remind you that company policy forbids any form of harassment between employees, sexual or otherwise.
1NO0002524	Specifically, you will refrain from greeting any female employee with the phrase: "Hey doll, want to see if this is a grenade in my pocket, or if I'm just happy to see you?"
1NO0002525	This statement is not only offensive and inappropriate, but could be considered a misuse of company-issued grenades (see Form B43).

1NO0002578	2. Select "Activate Packing Line."
1NO0002579	3. Monitor the Packing Line by listening for things such as mechanical screeching, explosions and/or human cries for help.

All test samples of Quantum will be packaged by hand until a solution is reached.
1NO0002584	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-363
1NO0002585	Experimental prototype makes extensive use of hardware common to liquid ammunition flame projection weapons.  While initial test results were impressive, extreme weight of unit (118.3kg) and fume inhalation rendered most test subjects incapable of firing the unit or remaining conscious under typical field conditions.
1NO0002586	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-375
1NO0002587	Prototype introduces proprietary ammunition type.  Conventional 10mm shells house a caplet containing amalgamating agents.  When the caplet was broken in lab tests, localized fireburst and shrapnel projection met requirements for project.  However, in field tests amalgam caplet ammunition proved too fragile, and several detonated from excessive vibration or walk speed.
1NO0002588	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-401
1NO0002589	Prototype attempts to refine results of acumist coating within weapon barrel.  Initial tests showed promise.  As predicted, delivery friction super-heats projectile as it is delivered from the weapon, and conventional 10mm ammunition can be used.  However; during live-fire testing, subjects firing the weapon in rapid succession suffered severe burns to the fingers and palm.
1NO0002590	Lab Report: Prototype ZRIN-418
1NO0002591	Prototype refines acumist barrel experiments by addition of retardant jacketing, as well as internal heat diffusers.  Rate of fire diminished from un-modified version of weapon.  Conventional 10mm ammunition does not fully liquefy until impact, giving the 418 exceptional accuracy compared to earlier prototypes.  Live-fire tests report no major casualties.  Recommend ZRIN-418 as production candidate.

1NO0002594	Issue: Dormitory Water Dispensers outputting water with a foul aftertaste
1NO0002597	The water filtration system (the reclaimer) was adding a bit too much chemical rebalancer solution in the process. This gave rise to a build up of alkalines in the water. I've checked with the Medical section, and the water shouldn't pose any health threat. The taste should return to normal in approximately 4 days.

1NO0002627	As an infant, sent to the Citadel to be fostered by Elder Owyn Lyons. The reason for this decision was two-fold:
1NO0002628	1.) Recent internal conflict amongst the Western Brotherhood of Steel created an unsafe environment for the child. It was believed that the Citadel -- despite being located in hostile territory -- would increase his probability of survival.
1NO0002629	2.) Elder Lyons, at that time, was in high favor with the Western Elders, and deemed a perfect candidate to provide care and training to the Squire.
1NO0002630	Recent events have led to a lack of communication with the Western Elders. As a result, Squire Maxson will remain at the Citadel indefinitely.
1NO0002631	Vargas doesn't know I've been reading his copy of Guns and Bullets, and I should probably keep it that way. I mean, it's right there, under his bunk in the Den. What did he expect?

1NO0002633	So, out of nowhere, James came back to Megaton. Since he stayed here before he asked me where the hell he could get a lay of the land and find out what's going on in the world. I told him about Galaxy News Radio in the ruins of D.C., and that guy Three Dog. Then like that, he was gone again.
1NO0002634	I remember the first time he showed up almost twenty years ago. I never expected someone to actually want to or be able to get INTO a vault, but he must have had his reasons. He had his kid with him, some baby that wouldn't shut the fuck up. Normally I would have kicked someone like that out of my place, but he had a way with words. Then, like that, he ducks into Vault 101 and he's gone for almost twenty years. Nice guy I guess, but never spends enough caps.
1NO0002635	You are standing in a wide plain.  Foothills stretch to the north, where clouds gather around an ominous peak.  A dirt path winds from a lonely chapel to the east, through the plains where you're standing, and south into a bustling town.  Wispy mists gather over marshland in the west, where a thin tower stands alone in the bog.
1NO0002636	The Planetarium recording system has been malfunctioning lately, causing the normally automated program to stop and repeat itself.

1NO0002639	After numerous complaints, and a single pending lawsuit, the GigantoMax Theater's sound system has been lowered from 130 decibels to 120 decibels. Please note that all employees working in or near the theater should still wear proper ear protection to prevent any permanent damage.
1NO0002642	This is a general announcement to any employees who use the men's lavatory facility in the maintenance area. I have logged too many complaints that people are not flushing the toilets after using them. People who use the facility to relieve themselves expect a clean and tidy environment. To prevent this from becoming a reoccurring issue, card swipe access will be required for each stall which will log your name, time in the stall, and contents of the bowl until such time that we deem it no longer necessary.
1NO0002645	Due to the increased power consumption from the installation of the Vault-Tec Vault Tour, three new reactors have been installed in the sub-basement section.

1NO0002651	Our new addition to the Spaceflight Gallery, the Virgo II Lunar Lander, is now open to the general public and ready for viewing. I want to extend a hardy thank you and job well done to the entire Research & Restoration Team for pulling that pile of junk out of mothballs and putting it in such fine shape. Many sleepless nights were spent on this project, and as a small token of our thanks, you will find a substantial bonus in your next paycheck. Give each other a pat on the back... you've earned it.
1NO0002654	This is just a quick rundown of acquisitions we have been awarded for 2078.

1NO0002667	If all of the particles that make up Saturn's rings were gathered together, they would form a sphere about 120 miles in diameter!
1NO0002668	Olympus Mons, a volcano found on Mars, is the largest known volcano in the solar system. It is 370 miles (595 km) across and rises 15 miles (24 km). That's 3 times taller than Mount Everest!
1NO0002669	The Delta IX Rocket, commissioned by the USSA in 2020, was the last of the manned rockets that sent our brave American Astronauts to the moon. The Delta IX was in use for almost 15 years before being converted for military use and having the crew and instruments sections replaced with a nuclear warhead. The Delta IX recorded over 77 successful launches, making it one of the most successful rockets in U.S. History.
1NO0002670	The rocket, developed entirely by USSA scientists, was a single-stage vehicle with an ejectable crew section or satellite storage bay. The propulsion system was a nuclear-electric derivative drive, using a massive electrical jolt to start the nuclear reaction on launch. The crew section was protected from the radioactive chambers by way of a massive titanium-vanadium disc. The spacecraft had the capability to sustain 2 astronauts for up to 24 days maximum. The longest recorded spaceflight in a Delta IX rocket was the 17-day Zeus 12 Mission to the moon.

1NO0002678	Good Ole' Craggy, King of Rockopolis.
1NO0002679	He offered Argyle and me shelter back in the summer of '48. Unfortunately, there was a little incident with his daughter, and we were exiled.
1NO0002680	We sought shelter again a couple years later, but Craggy didn't take to kindly to us luring the Slavers into his hidden underground city.
1NO0002681	That was the last time I ever saw Argyle -- right after he saved my hide for the hundredth time.
1NO0002682	Miss Penelope Chase -- Two-timing bitch. She got what she deserved.
1NO0002683	My dearest Destiny.
1NO0002684	Harlot par excellence and the proprietor of the Blue Destiny Brothel. One of the loveliest women I've ever had the pleasure to pleasure.
1NO0002685	Sadly, she died from cholera in the summer of '49 (an event that closed down the brothel forever).
1NO0002686	The best manservant a guy could ask for.
1NO0002687	Tough, loyal, and a hell of a good friend (even if he did smell like a bag of rotten meat, but what's a Ghoul gonna do?).
1NO0002688	The last time I saw Argyle was in Rockopolis, decades ago. I know he's still out there... somewhere.
1NO0002689	Slaver leader and psychotic cannibal, circa 2250. See entry on Paradise Falls.
1NO0002690	The most dangerous dump in the Capital Wasteland.
1NO0002691	The Slavers there would have bought and sold anything with a pulse. They still will, from what I hear.
1NO0002692	Back in my day, they were more disorganized, though. Their leader was a guy named Harmon Jurley, a psychotic son of a bitch who was rumored to eat the slaves he couldn't sell.
1NO0002693	An underground city.
1NO0002694	Not a bad a accomplishment, all things considered, but their leader, King Crag, became too isolationist for his own good.
1NO0002695	Okay, so I accidentally led the Slavers there and those bastards cleaned the place out. It was an honest mistake.
1NO0002696	The best damn whorehouse in the Capital Wasteland. Strong booze and soft women. It shut down in the summer of '49 when most of the ladies died from a cholera outbreak.
1NO0002697	A city of the dead. Or undead, as some would believe.
1NO0002698	Underworld was, and is, a settlement of Ghouls, established in an old art exhibit in the Museum of American History.
1NO0002699	Argyle and I used to go there quite a bit. I was even voted "Honorary Ghoul" back in '51. I really should go back and visit sometime.
1NO0002700	A town built around an undetonated atomic bomb. My kind of place!
1NO0002701	Megaton is pretty well fortified now, but back in my day it was even more ramshackle. Great place to grab a drink or a broad.
1NO0002702	I hear Moriarty even has his own place now. Guess that shouldn't surprise me. That guy had been playing the angles since the day he ended up in this country, as a kid.
1NO0002703	Goddamn walking crabs.
1NO0002704	Tough to kill, but pretty delicious afterwards. The outer carapace is hell to penetrate, though. Good thing their face isn't armored (and Argyle had such a good right jab).
1NO0002705	Ghouls gone bad. Their brains had rotted through so much, they lost the ability to think straight.
1NO0002706	Argyle and I fought these hapless zombie bastards more times than I can count.
1NO0002707	I think he actually liked killing them -- saw it as some sort of revenge against God for his own situation, or something.
1NO0002708	I've been a lot of places in my day, and everywhere you'd find those damned Radscorpions.
1NO0002709	Rumor was they'd descended from Emperor Scorpions, which you could find in pretty much any pet store in the country when bombs fell. I guess that explains their population.
1NO0002710	Bears, or the Capital Wasteland's equivalent, anyway.
1NO0002711	You're not going to find one of these babies balancing on a big rubber ball, though, I can tell you that much. They're are vicious as they come -- razor sharp claws, razor sharp teeth. Nasty, nasty temperament.
1NO0002712	I have to admit, I've always been fascinated by these things.
1NO0002713	Such an ingenious creation -- a robot powered by a brain, and a sexy dame's voice. Of course, I always had to wonder. Were they human brains? Were they actually the brains of sexy dames?? Or is it all monkey brains and recordings?
1NO0002714	Anyway, I got hit by one of their mind blasts once. Hell of a headache for three days.

1NO0002721	Beloved,
1NO0002722	I must beg your indulgence a little while longer. I am not yet able to send for you. Stay in Megaton. Once my business has concluded, I will send for you, and we will live happily as man and woman.
1NO0002723	The memory of your  beauty and sweet aroma lingers in my memory...
1NO0002724	Have patience my love.
1NO0002725	Soon. Soon we shall be together once again!
1NO0002726	Your's very truly,
1NO0002727	Burke
1NO0002729	The pain of your absence is at times crippling. But I must persevere. I must! It is very important work I am doing for mankind.
1NO0002730	Oh, but I wish I could sweep it all away to be with you now!
1NO0002731	Be patient love. I will send for you soon
1NO0002735	The pain of our separation is unbearable. I miss you terribly.
1NO0002736	I cherish the memory of our brief time together.
1NO0002737	Send me a letter, won't you? Send it to Tenpenny Tower. They'll be sure to get it to me.
1NO0002738	Oh, be patient a little while longer, my little song bird. Soon we will be free of our cages, and our love will soar to the heavens above!
1NO0002741	I can not live like this. Wanting you. NEEDING you! But unable to have you.
1NO0002742	I'm afraid I must insist we cease this charade.
1NO0002743	I beg your forgiveness. I'm sorry to have made you wait in that hell-hole for so long. Waiting for the summons to my side that never came.
1NO0002744	Fly free my little love bird. Fly up and out of that filth.
1NO0002745	I wish that I could have you, and the thought of another man getting to have you, breaks my heart.
1NO0002746	But I'd rather you were set free, than waiting eternally for me. I'm growing tired of this burden of mine. This toiling away for humanity, building a new world for mankind. I'm not even sure they will appreciate all the efforts I am making for them. But it is a burden I shall continue to carry, because someone must. And I am a man of responsibility,
1NO0002747	Good luck my love-bird. Fly free and be happy!
1NO0002748	Your's truly,
1NO0002750	Note To Self:
1NO0002751	Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Why worry? This place seems great.  It's time we kick back, relax and forget about the desolate, hopeless, bleak and blasted wasteland outside.  Have we enjoyed a frosty Nuka-Cola yet today?  Well, we ought to fix that.
1NO0002752	To Vault Security:
1NO0002753	If any of our residents notice any unusual odor or faint taste to the air, please assure them that everything is okay.  There was a slight irregularity in our filtration system but nothing to cause alarm; the systems have already been corrected and are 100% functional again.

1NO0002757	I always wanted to be a beatnik, but the pants were too tight.
1NO0002758	I have nothing more to say to you, we're through here.

The sky is as blue as it used to be, im so happy to be here and my roomies are flailing around in the love mist.  I cant remember what I was doing before but man is it great here now.  I never thought about it like this before, but the walls just need somebody to love, too, man.
1NO0002784	I don't know what happened, all of a sudden everyone just started acting strange.  The Overseer told us to lock ourselves into our room and wait until security gets the riff raff under control so that's what im doing.  I managed to catch the security chief on his way past and apparently the weirdos are so out of their head they can't read, so if you're not affected say the word 'Fanzini' and I'll let you in.

1NO0002791	Mycological Characteristics:
1NO0002792	Kingdom= Fungi
1NO0002793	Phylum= Basidiomycota

1NO0002795	Species=  U. Noslen
1NO0002796	Hymenium Type= None
1NO0002797	Cap Shape= Convex
1NO0002798	Spore Color= Hyper Blue
1NO0002799	Ecological Type= Mycorrhizal
1NO0002800	Description:
1NO0002801	The U. Noslen seems to produce a compound that when exposed to the conditions of the cave are able to shield it from harmful radiation.  The rate at which the fungus degrades the stone appears to be slowed.  Study shows that the U. Noslen reproduces by dispersing small amounts of diaspores.  Due to the lack of wind sources, the fungus is usually clusters but occasionally is able to fan out to other surfaces.
1NO0002802	Habitat/Ecology:
1NO0002803	Early speculation is that the U. Noslen's above average poikilohydric characteristics allow it to survive within these caves.  Unlike similar species, when dehydrated the plant will release a toxic set of spores and die instead of entering the assumed cryptobiotic state.

1NO0002826	2076 Progress Report
1NO0002827	Our flagship project, the Induced Patriotism Initiative, has met with resounding success. Our agents have successfully included covert and overt messages of extreme patriotism and loyalty into popular media ranging from the big screen to the Sunday funnies. Increased military enrollment amongst target demographics serves to underline this success.
1NO0002828	Agent Webb has been particularly effective at influencing the music industry, and he has interesting proposals for the fields of organized sports and even such notoriously difficult markets as comic books and toys.
1NO0002829	A success in these areas would ensure early education with our message, and thus ensure a more dedicated and devoted nation for us all.
1NO0002830	CODENAME: CLOACINA
1NO0002831	Development Report
1NO0002832	Development of the Mutant Undermining Lifeform continues apace, and our chief bio-engineers are certain that they will be able to perfect these living weapons in time for deployment into Red China.
1NO0002833	Once covertly released into an enemy's environment, their aggressive qualities, dangerous hunger, and pervasive breeding should severely undermine the infrastructure of the location in short order, softening the target for ground invasion. At this point, the genetic kill-switch can be activated, allowing for easy reclamation -- not including a significant, one-time clean up effort.
1NO0002834	Current MUL development primarily uses genetic stock of rodents, particularly the common sewer rat, and progress has been significant. FEV testing has been rejected, however, as the results are sterile.
1NO0002835	Here are the results of the latest robot diagnostic:
1NO0002838	Internal Processors -- 46%
1NO0002839	Weapons Systems -- 45%
1NO0002840	Power Management -- 37%
1NO0002842	Scribe Rothchild is confident that by redistributing power from the Weapons and Mobility subsystems, we'll be able to bring Power Management up to at least 67% -- enough to successfully carry out a full activation sequence.
1NO0002846	Internal Processors -- 12%
1NO0002847	Weapons Systems -- 13%
1NO0002848	Power Management -- 1%
1NO0002850	It has been determined that the recent feedback spike, which resulted in overall system degradation, was in fact caused by the installation of the new power capacitor, as Scribe Rothchild suspected.
1NO0002851	Until further notice, Scribes are ordered to cease any and all experiments that involve the re-routing of power from any of the robot's sub-systems.
1NO0002852	Another day, another setback.
1NO0002853	We had tried, of course, re-routing power from Weapons to the robot's other sub-systems several times. Each attempt ended in failure, thanks to the robot's overly aggressive combat subroutines. It's almost as if there's some hidden pocket of AI that keeps pushing against us, refusing to let anyone drain power from the weapons systems.
1NO0002854	I guess that shouldn't surprise me, considering why he was constructed in the first place.
1NO0002855	That's why I began work on the Neural Dampener in the first place. I was convinced I could "trick" the robot into thinking I had actually re-distributed the power from some other sub-system. But the damned thing proved smarter than that. Certainly smarter than me.
1NO0002856	All I managed to do was fry some of his circuitry (again) and set us back another three months.
1NO0002857	I'm tired of trying to re-route power like some kind of snot-nosed Initiate.
1NO0002858	I don't care what kind of drain it puts on the Scribes' ability to research and maintain the weapons and armor -- I'm proceeding with the AVF experiments.
1NO0002859	If I can successfully create an Accelerated Vector Fusion module (similar to the technology I saw Doctor Li working with all those years ago), we'll have our first real chance of getting the robot fully operational.
1NO0002860	Maybe then the Western Elders will realize our worth.
1NO0002861	Unfortunately, the Accelerated Vector Fusion (AVF) experiments haven't gone as planned.
1NO0002862	Bowditch suffered 2nd degree burns, and at one point we accidentally channeled so much power to the robot's head laser, it discharged and nearly killed Elder Lyons.
1NO0002863	He was not pleased.
1NO0002864	General Chase,
1NO0002865	I'm sorry, but you're being completely unrealistic. There is simply no way the robot will be combat ready in three months.
1NO0002866	The chassis is complete, all weapons systems are online, and the voice module has been programmed as requested. But power consumption is still our primary concern, and neither doctors Honeywell nor Park have yet found an acceptable solution.
1NO0002867	We had hoped to sub-contract Vault-Tec, and utilize the talents of Doctor Braun. But apparently he's gone into seclusion, working on one of their own projects, and they couldn't reach him at this point if they wanted to. So that's out.
1NO0002868	I'll give it to you straight, General -- this is the biggest robot the world has ever seen, and we just haven't been able to find a power source small enough, and powerful enough, to get the damn thing running with all its systems online.
1NO0002869	In three months we might be able to guarantee the robot can walk into downtown Anchorage, but all of his weapons systems will be OFFLINE.
1NO0002870	Maybe he can just step on the Red Chinese?

1NO0002874	Military Contract 38917: Codename "Liberty Prime"
1NO0002875	Project Goal: No less than the creation of the most powerful combat robot the battlefield has ever seen, with the express goal of liberating occupied Anchorage, Alaska from its Chinese aggressors.
1NO0002876	Summary: The United States Army has succeeded in contracting both RobCo and General Atomics International to work on their first joint project.
1NO0002877	The robot they create, Liberty Prime, will be the very embodiment of American military might -- a walking, talking, nuke-tossing hero who will remind the world what it means to be a super power.
1NO0002878	I am fully confident that the presence of Liberty Prime at the Anchorage Front line will be to the Chinese what the Hiroshima bomb was to the Japanese in 1945.
1NO0002882	What American child alive hasn't heard the story of the Pint-Sized Slasher, that diminutive demon in a clown mask who stalks and slashes the innocent residents of supposedly safe suburbia? It's just one of the many folk stories parents use to scare their youngsters into behaving themselves. Or is it?
1NO0002883	According to Germantown police chief Joseph Field, the Pint-Sized Slasher may be more real than many people would like to admit. "After reviewing the autopsy results of the Linden Street slayings, we have confirmed that the force and direction of every knife wound are consistent with an attack from a much smaller assailant. A child, to be precise."
1NO0002884	Add to the sinister forensic findings this statement from Christopher Atkinson, the one surviving victim of the adolescent assassin, and it becomes clear that the Pint-Sized Slasher does indeed walk among us: "The clown! The clown! He's going to kill us all, do you understand me? He stabbed my brother Shaun right in the face! He killed my brother! The little clown!"
1NO0002885	But assuming the Pint-Sized Slasher is indeed a real, tangible threat to the peace loving residents of D.C. suburbia, one question remains: why? What could possible motivate a child to don a clown mask and murder innocent people in cold blood? We may never know. At least not until the miniature maniac is brought to justice. Until then, all we can do is lock our doors, kiss our children goodnight  and pray they live to see morning.

1NO0002894	Batch A27 is a complete failure. I must return to my original formulas and begin the process all over again. Perhaps the pressure of working in these conditions without proper laboratory equipment is to blame, perhaps I simply didn't splice the correct genetic instructions or perhaps I am fatigued. Whatever the case may be, A27 is proving to be a disaster. I must introduce a new formula soon or I may not be alive to see my hypothesis come to fruition.

1NO0002932	MP-47/A Medic Power Armor
1NO0002933	Security Clearance G required to read this manual.
1NO0002934	Currently in prototype, the MP-47/A Medic Power Armor, referred to as Medic Armor hereafter, is designed to protect the soldier in the field and serve as an automated medic. The prototype unit only has Med-X delivery systems. The production unit will include Stimpaks and other injectables.
1NO0002935	User requirements for Medic Armor stated that "even a child" should be able to use it without reading this manual. Therefore an onboard computer system with verbal feedback response systems has been installed. The soldier in the field puts on the armor, and the armor does the rest. It automatically senses the limb condition of the soldier and applies Med-X only if needed.
1NO0002936	If the defense contract is extended, the onboard computer system will be enhanced to provide command level data to field officers. A special self-destruct will deliver a lethal injection to deserters. Until the contract is extended, these systems remain offline.

1NO1000002	Sim back up and running after another few days of changes. Chase is running everyone ragged, making tweaks here and there.
1NO1000003	The sim is, without any shadow of a doubt, divorced from reality. I've never seen the classified military reports, but some of the stuff Chase has added to the sim? There's no way it happened like that.
1NO1000004	Version 7-36-099 was scrapped after Chase decided his face didn't look just right. I realize progress reports aren't the place for this, but there are concerns that the man is losing it. No one confronts him because everyone is scared. After West-Tek dropped off the grid, there were lots of rumors about the military commandeering private contractors, and no one wants to give Chase a reason to do that here. But really, what's the point in running this sim over and over and over? Any tactical data was mined months ago.
1NO1000005	Entry 0527
1NO1000006	Sim version 7-36-081 was scrapped last week after Chase ran through it himself. Said it didn't "feel right." It was eventually determined he was referring to hardware issues, not anything to do with the software.
1NO1000007	Techs have been making modifications on the chair, but some ongoing issues remain problematic. Requests to administration to provide detailed schematics and hardware history have been neglected. Questions about the particular external interface requirements remain unanswered. Techs will attempt to compensate.

1NO2000022	Director James,
1NO2000023	I am once again writing to encourage you to resign your position following the disastrous reconstruction of the Wabash Bridge. While I understand that it was your desire to unify the city's skyline, we at the Pittsburgh Heritage Society feel that replacing the historical Wabash Bridge with a simple copy of the 10th Street structure was laziness bordering on criminal negligence on the part of the Department of Public Works. As the director of the department, the Society holds you responsible.
1NO2000024	I will be addressing this matter at the next meeting of the county administrators.

1NO2000029	-Tom
1NO2000030	I was in your office the other day Hadley and I couldn't help noticing that there's some sort of sound coming from the wall. I think you might have mice. You should get maintenance to check that out.
1NO2000031	Mr. James,
1NO2000032	Your wife called. She wants you to pick up milk and a case of Cram on the way home. Also, Miss Stevens called and thanked you for lunch, and wanted to confirm for the same time next Tuesday.
1NO2000033	Patient: M. Cramer
1NO2000034	Symptoms: Patient complaining of myalgia as well as swollen and enlarged lymph nodes. In addition, patient reports a feeling of "unease". Suspected asymptomatic herpetic infection. Performed AR series of tests and exams. Samples sent to UMS for analysis.
1NO2000035	Patient: R. Jenkins
1NO2000036	Symptoms: Patient presents runny nose, fever, swollen feet, bad breath, headache, jaundice, and extreme perspiration. Honestly, I have no clue what's wrong with him, but performing tests seems to make his symptoms lessen.
1NO2000037	Dr. Borman asked me to look into new office space. Being this close to the mills is terrible for the patients. But he says that we can afford a new office now. Ever since the Canadian annex, we've had a lot of vets in the office, so the numbers are looking way up. War might be hell, but it's good for some of us!
1NO2000038	Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion
1NO2000039	Research by Dr. Sandra Kundanika
1NO2000040	An epidemic of the environs around the Pitt, which I have named Troglitic Degeneration Contagion (or simply "TDC") appears to be the result of intensely concentrated radiation, but the unique toxins and pollutants in the Pitt cause it to be far more pervasive.
1NO2000041	Anyone living in TDC-active areas experience skin lesions after a few weeks of exposure, which can clear up after a month or more away from infected areas. For many healthy adults, this is the full extent of the effect. TDc also seems to interact with brain chemistry in a manner that produces a number of psychological effects, even if the subject remains physically healthy. I'll need to recover more information about psychosis before attempting to enumerate those effects.
1NO2000042	Approximately 20% of adults will progress further, losing higher reasoning and motor skills over the course of years, until they have degenerated into a bestial "Trog." No subjects have ever been recovered from full degeneration, although wishful rumors persist of Trog retaining memories and recognizing the faces of loved ones.
1NO2000043	More tragic, however, is the fact that children born in TDC-active areas have a (virtually) 100% degeneration rate, often becoming feral within weeks of birth.
1NO2000044	Cure Development Progress
1NO2000046	Observational tests on isolated samples suggest the subject has a natural adaptive immunity to the so called "trog mutation." Furthermore, it appears that this immunity carries on to other forms of radiation-induced diseases - from radiation sickness to larger mutations such as the all-too-common development of a sixth toe.
1NO2000047	Attempts to isolate these effects have been slow going, due in part to the delicate nature of testing. Prospects exist for duplication, but the unique and delicate nature of the subject requires utmost care in testing.
1NO2000048	I'm not going to make it, Milly...I'm sorry.  I knew everyone thought I could do it, but they don't know what's out here.  It's not just Trogs...but others.  The Wildmen.  Kind of funny considering my nickname 'Wild Bill' back at the mill.  Finding the ingots wasn't the hard part...they're everywhere.  The problem was trying to make my way back to the mill.  My trusty sidearm came in handy more than once, but I soon found myself in more trouble than I could handle.  The gunfire alerted the Wildmen and I assume it's only a matter of time before they find me.  I'm sorry for letting everyone down at the mill.  Let everyone know I tried my hardest.   ...Bye.
1NO2000049	In response to the increased number of Protectron related injuries, I've placed a bunch of generic employee IDs next to the Factory Protectron Pod.  The thing doesn't know the difference anyway so, please, if you've forgot your ID, just use the ones on the table. Remember to return them before you leave for the day, I only have so many.
1NO2000050	- Management
1NO2000051	There have been several complaints in the past couple of weeks regarding the new Factory Protectrons installed throughout the plant. Some of you feel this is the first step in the long process of phasing out the human aspect of the plant. Please be assured that this is not our intention. The new Protectrons are here only to protect you, the workers. Also, please remember to carry your ID with you at all times. The Protectrons are programmed to make sure those present in the plant are valid employees.
1NO2000053	We've ordered three new Protectrons to be installed immediately in the plant. One will take the place of the recent Protectron that was destroyed by our very own employees, who, let me remind you, are now ex-employees. The other two will take their positions working on the assembly line.
1NO2000055	Those employees who recently took it upon themselves to incapacitate a Protectron with a bucket of water and sledgehammer have been dealt with and no longer work at the plant. Let this be a reminder to all employees. Those caught harassing and/or damaging the Factory Protectrons will be dealt with swiftly and severely.
1NO2000057	I brought it up with Management today that the men down at the plant aren't taking the new shipment of robots lightly. They fear losing their jobs and I don't blame them. It's my job to make sure morale stays high no matter what happens. It's hard to look each man in the eye and tell him that he has nothing to worry about even though I very well know he'll be unemployed in less than a month. I don't know how long I can continue to lie to these men.
1NO2000058	Tom McMullin
1NO2000059	Supply Plant Supervisor
1NO2000060	I've managed to delay a rather large shipment of Protectrons today. I told management that we've been having problems with the previous batch of robots and are not prepared for another batch anytime soon. This is complete bullshit of course, the robots work perfectly. They outperform our best worker by a factor of five. The men continue to lose morale day after day. Some blame me, but they don't understand that this is completely out of my hands. I am doing everything I can to help these men keep their jobs.
1NO2000063	Management made a surprise visit to the plant today. I guess they stopped believing what I've been telling them about the robots not performing to standards. They saw first hand the speed and efficiency of the robots. Unfortunately, they also caught two employees in the act of tearing apart a Protectron and smashing it with a sledgehammer. I was to blame of course.  The men are starting to believe I'm working closely with the managers and helping them in every way possible to save my own skin.
1NO2000066	News broke out today over the loud speakers that everyone needs to vacate the plant by 1 PM. "Due to budget cuts, this plant is shutting down."  The men knew at once there was no budget cut. They ultimately decided I was to blame, having seniority in this section of the plant. As soon as I heard the news, I grabbed my pistol and made for the exit. It was quickly barricaded. I turned around and ran into this utility closet and locked the door behind me. I'll stay in here until the men go home.
1NO2000069	The men won't leave. They're determined to wait until I come out. Probably going to give me one hell of a beating, that I'm sure of. I wish they understood how hard I worked for them, how I used every opportunity to delay the inevitable. They better get going though, it's almost 1 PM. The robots will be here in a half hour, sooner if management hears of what's happening.
1NO2000072	I begged them to leave before the robots got here. They laughed and said they'd take care of the robots, it's me they wanted. Then came the familiar rattle of a Protectron. That got their attention. I soon heard laughter, cursing, and screaming down the hall. I opened the door and stepped outside. A couple of the workers burst around the corner screaming for help. A red laser lashed out from down the hall and severed Tim's right arm in two. I panicked and ran back into the closet and shut the door. The men slammed into the door and begged me to open it. I didn't say a word, just sat stunned, listening to their screams of agony as the robot finished them off one by one. Then silence. I put my ear to the door and listened. I heard the clanking of Protectron feet down the hall. I grabbed my pistol and backed away from the door. No way am I opening this door for anyone or anything!  Whoever reads this, let it be known that I did everything in my power to keep everyone's job at the plant.  And let this be an example of how not to replace humans with machines.

1NO3000092	Incident Report 08-07-77
1NO3000093	Reporting Officer:  Harold Callahan
1NO3000094	Fire alarm was sounded at approximately 10:05 A.M. in the vending area near Cafeteria B3. I immediately rushed to the location and encountered General Robert Dobbs kicking a Nuka-Cola machine repeatedly. General Dobbs ignored my order to stand down from his actions and drew his sidearm. He then proceeded to fire 7 shots into the machine, rupturing several bottles and piercing the coin box. After the coins began pouring to the floor, he picked up one of them and exclaimed "Stealing from a superior officer? Are you out of your MIND, soldier?" He holstered his sidearm and looked at me, then back at the machine and simply stated, "Well don't just stand there, I believe this soldier needs a medic, son."
1NO3000095	The general was relieved of his sidearm and placed in our lockup facility until Metro D.C. Police arrived to pick him up.
1NO3000096	Incident Report 08-16-77
1NO3000098	Secretary Maybel Meyers from Accounting Division called us down here and reported an altercation between two other secretaries. Sergeant Deke DaSilva and I arrived at the scene to find two female secretaries, Carol Wallace and Isabelle Franks, scuffling on the floor. We broke up the altercation and took their statements. Ms. Wallace was accusing Ms. Franks of being a "...spy for those damn Red bastards!" and stating that she overheard "...secret conversations between Isabelle and her Chinese conspirators!" Ms. Franks simply stated she was "Speaking to her husband about weekend plans." Both ladies were given a warning and sent home for the day by their supervisors.
1NO3000099	Tensions have been running high lately ever since the incidents in Alaska, and this is just one example of the effect it is having on everyone.
1NO3000100	Incident Report 08-22-77
1NO3000102	A silent alarm tripped on Stairwell 117, and I immediately responded. As I approached the stairwell entrance, I heard noises as if someone was in duress. I drew my weapon and entered by kicking open the door. I discovered Ronald Bales from Intelligence and Analysis in a compromising position with Wilma Firestone, a secretary from the Accounting Division. I gave them both a warning, and told Mr. Bales that this is his fifth and final one... the next time he is discovered performing this type of activity on Pentagon property, he'll be fined and disciplinary action will be recommended.
1NO3000104	Remmings over at the Museum of Technology is complaining again about the Planetarium system malfunctioning. I've replaced the playback unit on that thing 3 times now. Seems like the system keeps crashing and trying to restart itself, then crashes again... keeps repeating that cycle until it's completely rebooted. I suggest that we acquire a new type of system in next year's budget. The cost of replacing it now and fitting a new system is cheaper than the amount we've spent shoving in replacement parts.
1NO3000105	Museum Authority Log MA-0086
1NO3000106	Brantseg over at the National Archives is requesting a new brain software package for their "TJEFF002 Thomas Jefferson" Protectron. The original software was wiped and replaced with a radio uplink and frequency scanning software package which is simply receiving and broadcasting local radio stations. I suggest we encrypt the next brain package so this type of software purchase is not necessary.
1NO3000107	Museum Authority Log MA-0085
1NO3000108	We've logged a fourth request from Dr. Gillian Taylor over at the National Aquarium regarding a new tank she wishes to be constructed for her whale exhibition. I've already spoken to Director Barnicky, and he maintains that a new exhibit is out of the question and the current one is becoming far too expensive to maintain. Director Barnicky has already spoken to the San Francisco Aquarium, and they have agreed to begin construction of an appropriately sized tank and viewing area for Dr. Taylor's whales. He's also negotiated with that facility to have Dr. Taylor transferred, and I support this decision.
1NO3000109	Hey Lags!
1NO3000110	This your big bro! Hope you got the package. I had two of these things specially made for us in Virginia by The Tailor. He's a master at this stuff. I know you and your chick will love it. Try not to wear her out too fast, if you catch my drift.
1NO3000111	Hugs,
1NO3000113	Big Town Mission Report:
1NO3000114	Mission failure. Ambushed by Mutants. Lost one initiate, caravan driver, and mule. Survivor in critical condition at Citadel.
1NO3000115	Megaton Mission Report:
1NO3000116	Mission successful. Met a local wandering outside the city, a Mother Curie. Dropped off the goods with instructions to distribute.
1NO3000117	Rivet City Mission Report:
1NO3000118	Mission successful.
1NO3000119	[We ought to just build a pipeline. - B.]
1NO3000120	This place is a total disaster. Hopefully I'll get this distribution system set up soon and I can get back to the Citadel. Shouldn't take more than two weeks. I've already been in consultation with the  Rivet City Council. They have tentatively agreed to take over the Water Distribution Network for us once we've worked out the kinks. Something tells me there's going to be more than a few of those.
1NO3000121	I think Rothchild is really upset with me this time. He sent me Scribes who apparently failed their Cartography training. I don't have time for this.
1NO3000122	I'm getting practically no cooperation. Rothchild ignores my messages. And the  Knights stuck with delivery duties are more than a little resentful. I don't want to have to send them out anymore than they want to go.
1NO3000123	Dr. Li left today. Went up north to the Commonwealth. What a bitch.  She couldn't handle the fact that even these morons Rothchild sent me were capable of improving upon her work. It's no wonder she never got the thing working without help in the first place. Anyway, to hell with Dr. Li. Good riddance.
1NO3000124	First casualty reported today. I know compared to the death tolls of the war it will barely register back at the Citadel. But still  I hate being responsible, even indirectly, for another man's death. It brings back unpleasant memories.
1NO3000125	So many caravans missing in action. The Rivet City escorts I can understand. They haven't had much blooding, holed up in that boat of theirs. Sure, I've gotten more Initiates than full fledged Knights, since it's all hands in the war. But still, even a couple of heavily armed Initiates should be able to handle escorting a mule and driver across the wastes.
1NO3000126	So this Ghoul from Underworld, Griffon, offered to pay me for shipments of water. Lyons wouldn't approve, but I don't care. We need the caps and the technology he's offering. I can use it to fund the other deliveries.
1NO3000127	One day Lyons will come to his senses and agree that selling the water is the smartest thing. Let supply and demand fuel the delivery system. This bleeding heart charity of his is going to bring down the Brotherhood. We're at war! We shouldn't be expending resources on delivering water. At any rate, we can do that after we wipe out the Enclave. Sometimes I wonder if Lyons has gone senile.
1NO3000128	I should delete this entry in case someone important audits my files. Ah, screw it. It might be time for me to leave the Brotherhood, anyway. Not sure where'd I go, though.
1NO3000129	I dno't rember teh last time I slept for more than tihrty minutes.  I'm so damn tired jkhkjkjsdfg sdfgssdfgsd  ha. apparently I just nodded off and hit my face on the keyboard. I can't take this anyomre!!!!11!!
1NO3000130	Where the hell is everyone? So many caravans still MIA.
1NO3000131	Lepelletier keeps sending me dispatches requesting additional resources. I don't have anything for her. Not sure they'll be able to handle this water distribution after all. Great. I'll be stuck here forever.
1NO3000132	I'm ignoring Megaton's requests for more water until I can determine what the hell happened. The caravan reported in, successful. I have no reason to doubt the report.

1NO3000142	Heard that the kid who helped start the Purifier finally woke up.
1NO3000143	I think Lyons suspects something. He must have a plant here. How the hell would he know about the "missing" water shipments? I've been stonewalling him. How the hell does he have time to worry about us with that war going on?
1NO3000144	I'm seriously considering murdering these Project Purity lab coats. Ungrateful, whining, good-for-nothing, bothersome ingrates the lot of them.
1NO3000145	I wish somebody would fix that damn leak! The dripping is driving me crazy!
1NO3000146	I give up. This is hopeless.
1NO3000147	Wow  Megaton's gone. I know I was complaining about them  but, all those people! Erased in a single moment in time  I can't imagine.

1NO3000168	We're still having a bit of trouble getting the new SYL-02 Xoted Mainframe adapted to our train drive systems down here. It's going to take another 72 hours to get it fully up and running. I've been pulling triple shifts for the last two days already AND the supervisors are constantly on our backs blaming us for the delays when THEY bought an incompatible system. I wish that I could get to sleep and just get this over with...this is only high school bullshit. I'm lost, I'm freaking and everybody knows... everybody's watching.
1NO3000170	The switch track over between Adams Air Force Base and the White House main line is sticking again. I've dispatched a crew to repair it. I expect the line to be down no more than maybe a day. We can shunt all the trains to the alternate inbound line and just run them on half schedule or something for now. Just a suggestion.
1NO3000172	After debating for a few days, the powers that be have decided to change out the vocal interface on the Xoted Mainframe from male to female. Why? So they can give it a cute acronym and name it "Margot." Then they can trot it around for the press so we can all see where our hard-earned taxpayer dollars went. Wow, what a colossal waste of my time. Now I have to pull the mainframe's circuit array and flush the memory all to get a new voice installed... great, just great.
1NO3000174	Oh, today was a beauty. I was called up to the Senatorial Lounge near the White House station and someone decided to make a political statement by spray painting graffiti all over the walls inside the Lounge containing more than a fair share of Chinese racial slurs. They must have broken in while it was closed and did the damage. Hooray for security... they really dropped the ball on this one. Never send a robot to do a man's job I say. I spent the better part of the day scrubbing walls clean of that filth and installing new fixtures. Joy.
1NO3000176	We got the new Sentinel Unit up and running today. Pretty bad-ass. Not only does it have maintenance capability, so I can remote command it to do repairs, but it also is a great riot suppression unit... we can use it if we ever have any protesters break in down here again. Finally, a worthwhile addition to the robot fleet.
1NO3000177	Hey downstairs -
1NO3000178	This new guy you sent to help out is awful. I mean, he can barely tie his shoes. This is advanced technical equipment up here, and I can't have him work on it. He'll probably end up accidentally calling an orbital strike down on the base or something.
1NO3000179	Here's an idea - how about you send the guy that cleans the toilets up here and I can give him the job instead. Is it really that hard to find decent help?
1NO3000180	Hey downstairs, it's me again -
1NO3000181	Are we ever going to get a tech up here to work on this satellite tracking equipment? I swear it's offline every couple of days, and then it's literally hours of work before I have the system online and linked up to the satellite again.
1NO3000182	This is ridiculous.
1NO3000183	Guys -
1NO3000184	Strike two. This is the second dimwit you've sent up here, and I'm getting tired of it. I thought he was ok at first, but by lunchtime his Mentats had worn off and he could barely hold a conversation let alone work on a satellite control terminal. I can't have a junkie up here spacing out as soon as his pills wear off.
1NO3000185	Fix this.
1NO3000186	ROBOTS ARE FREAKING OUT! -
1NO3000187	About fifteen minutes ago, all of the robots in the place just went haywire and started attacking everyone. The guards and the new guy managed to lock them in the storage area, but we need someone up here to sort them out immediately.
1NO3000188	What's going on down there anyway?
1NO3000189	If you're reading this, it's because you might be able to help.
1NO3000190	We're thinking about branching out. Underworld was a good start, but we've found an even safer place for us to set up a new place to call home.
1NO3000191	Old Olney.
1NO3000192	No one ever goes there. No one would ever think to look for us there. There's tons of space under the town. So we're looking for a few strong backs to help knock down some walls, clear some space underground, and help get things up and running.

1NO4000005	My darling little Nade,
1NO4000006	I know life wasn't always the best at home, and we've had a few rough winters. I don't blame you for running off to find something better. At your age, you think you're wasting away at home while the world's just waiting for you to come get it.
1NO4000007	When I was about your age, I ran off from my mom, too. And even though there were some terrible things along the way, it ended with me having you, so I can't complain. I just wish you could have seen your grandmother. I wish I had a chance to see her again, myself.
1NO4000008	If you're reading this, I just want you to know you're always welcome back home. Please, learn from my mistake, and don't stay away forever.

Dorothy came in to fetch Bern's will and we couldn't get the box open because his voice was the only one configured for authorization. I figure it's a long shot, but I told Dorothy to go home and see if she has any holotapes or such of Bern talking. We might get lucky and fool the lock into opening if we play it back in there.

1NO4000051	Know the Signs!
1NO4000052	Safeguard yourself and your community by knowing how to identify a person suffering from the New Plague. Common symptoms include:
1NO4000053	* Profuse Sweating
1NO4000054	* Unexplained Contusions/Swelling
1NO4000055	* Massive External Hemorrhaging
1NO4000056	* New Ideals, such as socialism
1NO4000057	When you believe you've come into contact with a person exhibiting one or more or these tell-tale signs, remember to C I R:
1NO4000058	C - Confirm Symptoms.
1NO4000059	Approach the person suffering from symptoms if no Civil or Medical professional is available to do so. Verify that the subject is exhibiting symptoms of New Plague.
1NO4000060	I - Isolate!
1NO4000061	Once it's been established that a case of New Plague may be present, separate yourself and the person exhibiting symptoms from the general population, as the New Plague is notoriously contagious.
1NO4000062	R - Report!
1NO4000063	Report directly to the nearest Federal Fitness Registry of Medical Center and let the professionals handle it from there!
1NO4000065	The New Plague is what's commonly known as a "social disease". This means that the New Plauge is especially contagious and can be commonly caught in the course of social interactions such as:
1NO4000066	* Ice Cream Socials
1NO4000067	* Cruising Main Street
1NO4000068	* Promiscuous Activity/Sodomy
1NO4000069	* Attending Fairs or Festivals
1NO4000070	So; what's the best protection against social diseases?  Why not stay home and enjoy a novel or home-cooked meal? Limiting your exposure to other individuals is the best and more surefire way to avoid contracting the New Plague.
1NO4000071	Get Registered!
1NO4000072	Did you know that your government can protect you from the New Plague and other biological dangers?  It's true, and all you need to do is visit your local Federal Fitness Registry. Friendly Federal Professionals will be on hand to take a few minor samples and enter you in the national registry.
1NO4000073	Your compliance with the Federal Registry Program not only keeps medical professionals up-to-date on your medical history and status, but contributes to valuable research programs - and makes you eligible for special prizes, such as fuel rations or vacations to exotic domestic locales!

1NO4000075	Volunteers must always uphold the standards of The "Collective Benevolence" program in public and private.
1NO4000076	Arrived with first carload of volunteers today; Federal presence is nil. I guess the registry program came and went here at some point. There's some leftover equipment from them I've been authorized to remove from storage and use. We've got some basic antibiotics and hygiene supplies, and a couple boxes of New Plague awareness pamphlets. Not much to work with yet, but we were at least able to get settled into the motel. For now I'll focus on setting up our outreach center with Victoria while the rest of our volunteers get out into the community and get a feel for their situation here.
1NO4000077	The location we were given as our outreach center was a joke. The place is half-built and what's been put together so far looks like it's going to fall in on itself anytime. The real estate company wasn't much help. I sent a request for some field supplies so we can set up an outdoor center until this situation can be improved upon. My volunteers are telling me that a lot of the area lacks basic infrastructure, so we'll probably want to get started with some basic vaccines and sanitation supplies. I included some of this on today's purchase request, but I don't feel like we've got enough of a grasp on the local situation to request much more than that just yet.
1NO4000078	We staged our first outreach event today, which didn't go well. The majority of the population in the central area of Point Lookout are transplants from nearby urban centers - lots of contracted construction workers, support staff for local businesses, a handful of business people involved in the construction projects.  We're here to help the rural population who don't have a pot to piss in, but those people don't seem to come into town.  We need to re-evaluate our efforts.  The local populace seems recluse.  We'll have to get creative with our outreach.
1NO4000079	Victoria was badly wounded today. She took a truck of supplies out to the Ark & Dove Cathedral beyond the river. Most of the locals we want to help are living in primitive dwellings in the wetlands.  The Cathedral offered the closest public building to that area. She wasn't in much state to give details, but it sounds like nobody was around when she arrived. She ventured into the swamps to try and make contact with locals at one of the shacks out there. The paramedics are treating a wound on the back of her head.  She'll be okay, but it sounds like her skull was fractured. Victoria doesn't remember anything beyond blacking out. There was nothing stolen from her person or the medical supplies, but I'm still going to err on the side of caution and forbid volunteers from wandering out there alone.  We'll do the best we can from here.

1NO4000101	Roach, Martin J.
1NO4000102	Dr. Roach -
1NO4000103	On behalf of The Bysshe Company, thank you for accepting this contract.  You will be posing as a research intern, reporting to Principal Geologist Caroline Saunders.  Her experience with wetlands excavation makes her the only real suitable candidate.  However; Saunders is a known liberal with academic ties.
1NO4000104	We have only recently acquired excavation rights in the area.  We believe that the mass burials of the American Civil War in this region have made the soil ripe for our purposes.  This is the very same reason we are apprehensive about Saunders' liberal leanings
1NO4000105	Your primary mission is to prevent Saunders from discovering the link between Point Lookout's bloody past and its probable richness in natural bio-gas resources. Code Blue protocols are authorized per your discretion.  Saunders must be prevented from hampering this resource at every cost.

1NO4000113	Michaelson,
1NO4000114	I know that this facility was built to withstand the unique pressures of suboceanic earthen construction, but recently I have had a few concerns about the integrity of the initial work. My staff have noticed more than a few leaks without logical source and it has a number of them very nervous and I have to say, I share their apprehension.
1NO4000115	Grohlman at the facilities office assures me that the pumps and pressure regulators will keep this facility dry and clean for hundreds of years on their internal batteries, but given his history with this sort of thing, I'm not exactly comforted by his claims. I am hoping that you can find an inspector with the proper clearances to give us an independent evaluation of the lab. An outside certification will make us all feel better.
1NO4000117	Dr. Stewart
1NO4000118	To All Level Seven Assistants,
1NO4000119	It has been brought to my attention that a number of you have been conversing with test subjects during your off hours. This is a reminder that any attempts at social engagement with clinical participants is a violation of facility rule 47. Social interaction interferes with the cerebral infusion, and can cause a number of potential problems once the procedure reaches completion.
1NO4000120	So, once again. Do not speak to participants and be sure to limit any internal monologue to the list found in section 2.3 of your procedure guides when in their presence. I have little patience for shenaniganery.
1NO4000122	Memo To All Staff:
1NO4000123	As a reminder, only authorized archive technicians are permitted access to the microfiche library. Several records have gone missing, and I would like them to be returned to the archives immediately. No questions will be asked, assuming their safe return within 48 hours.
1NO4000124	Really, people. Find better ways to amuse yourselves. We have work to do down here.
1NO4000126	To: Laura Stewart, Head Researcher
1NO4000127	From: Adam Tomco, Archivist
1NO4000128	Dr. Stewart,
1NO4000129	I hate to be a bother, but it happened again. Records 48, 51, and 55 are missing. I know it was Danielson and Peruto. I know it! Those two are always messing with me, and no matter how many reports I file with the main office, they are never disciplined! Ever! You and I both know that it's because Danielson's uncle is married to Senator Calvert's daughter! Can't you stop it? Do something? I can't take this any more! This nepotism makes me sick!
1NO4000131	To :Adam Tomco
1NO4000132	From: Unknown Sender
1NO4000133	Hey Rat,
1NO4000134	What? You don't like people having a little fun? Huh? Well, we'll see how fun it is for you when you're out on the street looking for work. You tattled on the wrong guy!
1NO4000135	By using the data that we collected from the researchers at General Atomics at the close of the Robobrain Project, we've been able to fully mimic the brain suspension and isolation technique that makes the Robobrains function.
1NO4000136	What's better: we've make some interesting advances. It turns out that by manipulating the composition of the biomed gel, we are able to produce a number of effects that were previously thought to be impossible.
1NO4000137	It seems that Dr. Stewart was right. Under the right conditions, a subject not only retains full mental capacity, but can project limited images and even thoughts to other minds when the correct conditions are introduced in the biomed suspension. (Details on this composition can be found in Research Archive 51, Section B) This has profound implications for applications from battlefield technology to civilian criminal interrogation.
1NO4000138	Although, one must wonder if years of isolation in a biogel suspension would eventually introduce psychological abnormalities. This merits further study once the full breadth of the current research is explored.
1NO4000139	Despite the early stage of our research, Dr. Stewart has informed us that Senator Calvert is demanding a full report on our work immediately. It seems that he is sending his brother, a noted researcher in the field of cognitive robotic, to this very lab in order to participate in our study and assist us with the report.
1NO4000140	I have to say, I hesitate to show our work to anyone outside the lab. It's still very early and very unstable. It will be decades before we can be sure that the cognitive broadcast technology is stable, let alone ready for implementation.
1NO4000141	Perhaps Dr. Stewart can hold off the arrival of Professor Calvert for a few more months. At least that would give us some time to come to better conclusions.
1NO4000142	Ozwaldo,
1NO4000143	The footlocker is buried on the island with a single tree in the Dove Delta.  Be careful, I peppered the area with a bunch of fake mounds just incase the Hughes gang finds this location.
1NO4000144	Regards
1NO4000146	Met local by name of Obadiah Blackhall. He lives in an old manor by himself. Class A manipulator. He solicited me to recover a book, which he claimed to be a family heirloom. The man gives me a bad feeling. I want to investigate this book and his connection to the swampfolk of the region, but he was reluctant when pressed for more information.
1NO4000147	UPDATE: Confirmed Blackhall connection with regional beliefs. Appears that a recent ancestor to Obadiah, named Constance Blackhall, acquired obscure text known as Krivbeknih. Not good - have heard mention of the book before. Must destroy.
1NO4000148	Ferryman quite a character. Dubious on the Faith, but tolerant at least to hear my ministrations. Seems there's quite a bit more to the man, and he certainly isn't without the smell of sin about him. Will visit periodically while in Point Lookout to preach if he'll have me.
1NO4000149	Tribal culture occupies major sanctuary to the Faith in region - Cathedral of the Ark & Dove. Would love to mine location for artifacts or any intact texts, but residents openly ostracize outsiders. Have offered to induct me into their tribe. Tempting to undertake their oaths as a ruse to gain access, but moral reservations too great.
1NO4000150	You have done well to get this far, Agent Jiang. Your payment has been transacted to your next of kin under the pre-text of a ration lottery.
1NO4000151	With deepest regret, however, your life must now be terminated for the good of the People's Republic. Go with dignity, honorable soldier!
1NO4000152	Hunter spent another session in interrogation room B with the surviving crew member from the Chinese spy sub Navy is attempting recovery on.  This guy's demonstrating extraordinary fortitude for a relatively low-ranking grunt. Can't say the Chinese don't make good soldiers out of their boys. I'm sure this one would have gone the same way as his skipper if the cyanide capsule in his molar hadn't been a dud.
1NO4000153	Hunter requested method B interrogation clearance, so I'm putting through to Quantico for that in the morning.
1NO4000154	Federal Agencies have added a new person of interest to our watch list.
1NO4000155	Doctor Jiang is a Chinese National defector.  Naturalization agents in Norfolk processed his defection after jumping over from a merchant ship he was stowed away on.  Jiang was apparently in communication with a US Naval Intelligence contact for some months prior.  He's reportedly brokered an immunity deal in exchange for his help recovering intelligence from the downed submarine off our coast.
1NO4000156	Jiang is staying in room 1D at the Homestead Motel off the boardwalk.  We're explicitly forbidden from issuing a search warrant against this location, but are authorized to monitor his activities in public.
1NO4000157	Wan, Yang. Suspected Chinese Operative.  Previous incarceration, 2062 in Canada suspected in connection with Niagara sabotage.  Yang escaped custody during transport to Albany, NY.  Intelligence reports of Chinese activity in Maryland prompted local search efforts, which yielded an anonymous tip leading to Yang's capture and transfer to Turtledove Detention Camp.  Demonstrates remarkable resistance to interrogation, but yielded **CLASSIFIED**, connecting the Chinese Intelligence community to **CLASSIFIED**.
1NO4000158	Brenner observed suspicious activity after lights out yesterday.  Prisoners apparently snuck into morgue overnight. He had the good sense not to apprehend them before reporting the event. We've known for some time about a septic runoff access point in the basement which would be a good candidate for escapees. The runoff flows southwest of the camp about a quarter of a mile or so.
1NO4000159	We'll keep a low profile about this and post guards in the area.  They could make their break any night. Meanwhile I'll try and find an excuse to send somebody down there and check it out without arousing suspicion. I'd rather catch them in the act.
1NO4000160	Yang succumbed under method D interrogation during the afternoon.  Medical examiner called in and verified cause of death as natural for the records. She's filed away in the morgue downstairs for now, locker TD-0181. We're running out of space down there and may need to do a disposal early this quarter.

1NO4000176	Couldn't raise you on the phone this morning, so I'm having Jenny bring you this note. Your delivery for the store got turned around on those new roads and had an accident. He's run off the road by the Cathedral. They'll need some time to sort things out, but Pagano probably won't want to wait that long to replace the lighthouse's beacon bulbs. You might want to get over to the wreck yourself and hand-deliver the bulbs.
1NO4000177	Was able to intercept an outsider Obadiah had sent after Krivbeknih. I only hope my appeal to goodness was enough - I can't pay what he's offering.
1NO4000178	I'll pray for the outsider's survival... and that the Krivbeknih finds its way to me, not Blackhall.
1NO4000180	Those tribals cut your head up good, didn't they? Happened to us all, and you're lucky you've still got most of your marbles.
1NO4000181	Anyway, if you ever want to get rid of that scar, just ask me up at the Ark & Dove Cathedral. I've got a few tricks I picked up, and it's easier than trying to work on it yourself.

1NO4000184	I'm not imagining it; they're getting closer with each passing night.  The dogs are gone - or taken for sacrifice, more like.  I don't like to rely on superstition to keep them at bay, but there's no way I can fight them off if they take a mind to attack my home.
1NO4000185	I don't know who else to turn to, Marcella.  I'm skeptical, but I think we may be able to trust this outsider to help.

1NO5000011	Section: A61
1NO5000012	Dept. Head: Doctor Aldwin Morley
1NO5000013	Report Number: 040663-02
1NO5000014	The Novasurge has proven to be a tough nut to crack. The output is still very high, causing massive injury to targets, but it's drawing far to much power from its energy cells. We also need to get the weight down on the weapon, as it's a bit heavy for a simple replacement sidearm. The problem still seems to be the coolant coils which are accounting for almost 50% of the weapon's weight. The good news is that the housing for the weapon has been approved, and this is likely the final design. Unfortunately, I need to increase our staff's hours to 7 days a week again so we can have the final prototype ready for testing by the end of the year.
