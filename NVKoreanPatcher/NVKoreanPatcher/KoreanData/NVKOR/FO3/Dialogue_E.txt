1DI0000001	Dead? Argyle? You... you're sure? My God. I always thought he'd outlive me, by at least 100 years. Poor bastard.
1DI0000002	But thank you! Thank you for telling me. At least now I know. At least now the poor guy can catch a breather.
1DI0000003	I'd like to return your kindness. Here, take this key. It unlocks my safe. Lots of stuff in there I'll never use again. My adventuring days are over.
1DI0000004	Oh come now, bluffing's not really your style, is it?
1DI0000005	And there's certainly no need to threaten me.
1DI0000006	And why would I do that, when I am clearly the best hope for the people of the Wasteland?
1DI0000007	We might be able to work something out. But it won't be cheap. If I vouch for you and you go mess up our groove, it's my ass on the line.
1DI0000008	I think 500 caps should cover it. What do you say?
1DI0000009	Whoa Nelly! Sensing combat inhibitor removal! Guns are hot! Firing for effect! Welcome to Hell, you zombie freaks!
1DI0000010	Ah, human problems for human hearts. I don't trouble myself with such petty affairs. My work is my life! And as you can see, I've been quite busy...
1DI0000011	Just understand that this android is now, for all intents and purposes, a man. He looks human, he acts human. He believes he IS human.
1DI0000012	But even if he's not... Even if he's a machine... He's capable of rational thought. And emotion. So you see, his soul is as human as yours or mine.
1DI0000013	This person -- and he is a person -- deserves a chance at freedom. Please, if there's a shred of decency in you, don't take that away from him.
1DI0000014	Nice to meet you, too...
1DI0000015	I'm the sentry for Underworld. City of Ghouls? Inside the Museum? For a tourist, you're pretty clueless...
1DI0000016	My name's Willow, by the way.
1DI0000017	What?!
1DI0000018	That area is strictly off limits. Can't have people fooling around with the terminal down there. They could shut off power and open the escape door.
1DI0000019	That area is off limits to residents and visitors. Only Gustavo and authorized technicians are allowed down there.
1DI0000020	That emergency access door is currently keeping out Ghouls and other vermin. So you can see why people aren't allowed to picnic down there.
1DI0000021	You mean the generator room? What the hell do you need to know about that for? That area is strictly off limits.
1DI0000022	You stay away from the generator room!
1DI0000023	I hear there're some tunnels underground for use in emergencies. Ask Gustavo, he's in charge of all those kinds of things.
1DI0000024	There's those access tunnels that lead underground - those are sealed by a door... Then there is someplace down there where they keep the generators.
1DI0000025	Occasionally something goes wrong down there and we lose power. Then Burke goes out and finds a technician. We haven't had any blackouts in a while.
1DI0000026	If you want to get into the gen room, you'll need to talk to Gustavo. Though I doubt he'll take you on a tour, or let you wander around down there.
1DI0000027	Why would I ever go to the basement? Talk to Gustavo about such nonsense.
1DI0000028	Aha! So you've been exploring the tower! Well done! Let's just say that Gustavo's not the only one with a key for the generator room!
1DI0000029	Bah! I thought you were more interesting than that. Fine. But you better not get caught with that!
1DI0000030	Only that they keep generators down there... and some kind of emergency escape tunnels.
1DI0000031	Oh, you know who you should talk to? Comrade Dashwood. He knows this place like the back of his hand.
1DI0000032	What are you talking about? You mean the basement of Tenpenny Tower? What a random question. Why should I know anything about a basement?
1DI0000033	Why don't you run off and find Gustavo. I'm sure he could help you find whatever it is you're looking for.
1DI0000034	I haven't. But every so often Gustavo takes someone down there to work on the generators when we lose power. That hasn't happened in awhile, though.
1DI0000035	Tunnels in the basement? No can't say that I do.
1DI0000036	Hold it! I do remember something about a bunch of escape tunnels in case of disaster or something. Or something about generators for power...
1DI0000037	You should talk to that old guy... you know, the famous one with the radio show about him... You know, What's-His-Name!
1DI0000038	Daring! Daring Dashwood! That's him. He's explored this whole place from top to bottom. Ask him about those tunnels. He'd know.
1DI0000039	What do you take me for? Some greasy engineer? All I know is that's where they make the electricity.
1DI0000040	Why don't you go bother Gustavo? I'm sure he can handle whatever it is you need in the basement.
1DI0000041	Yeah, supposedly there's some kind of emergency access to the Metro tunnels.
1DI0000042	It'd have to be a pretty big emergency to get me down there. That's for sure. There's all kinds of gross things that live in those tunnels.
1DI0000043	Talk to Chief Gustavo if you want to know more. I think he's the only one that has a key.
1DI0000044	Maybe try talking to Mister Tenpenny or Chief Gustavo. They're probably the ones who would know.
1DI0000045	That's a laugh. Roy Phillips can't be reasoned with. Trust me. But go ahead and try to talk some sense into him. It's your funeral.
1DI0000046	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. They've barred the main entrance. Go through the train yard.
1DI0000047	Good luck, kid. You're gonna need it.
1DI0000048	Not soon enough! I don't think I can stand another day in this barbaric backwoods...
1DI0000049	Facial surgery's too dangerous. Plus you need some specialized prewar equipment. Hmm. That reminds me of an old hoax. Here's a copy of that holotape.
1DI0000050	Need specialized equipment and and expertise. It's also prone to infection. Too dangerous.
1DI0000051	That's all just a hoax. You'd need specialized equipment and expertise. It'd be prone to infection. Too dangerous. Never happened.
1DI0000052	Damn stupid idea. That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, take a listen to this crusty holotape and see for yourself.
1DI0000053	Now, you know I hate repeating myself. Damn stupid idea.
1DI0000054	Damn stupid idea if you ask me. That was all just an elaborate hoax.
1DI0000055	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.  Hey, but that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
1DI0000056	Medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.
1DI0000057	That was all just an elaborate hoax. Besides, medicine is an important art and science. Shouldn't be wasted on vanity.
1DI0000058	Hmm... that reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this. It's clearly a joke. No one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
1DI0000059	No one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
1DI0000060	It's clearly a joke. No one's got the tech to do that without risking infection.
1DI0000061	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection. Reminds me of an old hoax. Listen to this holotape.
1DI0000062	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection.
1DI0000063	That's an old hoax. Though if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection.
1DI0000064	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need special equipment and expertise. Hmm. Reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
1DI0000065	Facial surgery's way too dangerous to try. Need specialized equipment and expertise.
1DI0000066	That was all just an elaborate hoax.
1DI0000067	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection? That reminds me of this old hoax. Here, listen to this holotape.
1DI0000068	Nah. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. And why risk infection?
1DI0000069	Forget that old practical joke. You need specialized gear that doesn't exist anymore. Besides, who'd want to risk infection?
1DI0000070	I heard old Pinkerton at Rivet City had a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
1DI0000072	Old Pinkerton over at Rivet City's rumored to have done it. Damn fool. High risk of infection and death. Though, I admit, I'm slightly jealous.
1DI0000073	Probably down at Rivet City. Anything that has any use out here, they snatch up for themselves. That damn Pinkerton don't share nothin'.
1DI0000074	Dammit! Why are you wasting my time? I already told you, ask Pinkteron down at Rivet City.
1DI0000075	If you are lookin' to change your face, I'd try Pinkerton at Rivet City. That boy's got no sense of ethics. And you're a fool if you try it.
1DI0000076	They say old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow got his hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. Amazing really.
1DI0000078	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try it. Too risky. Go to Rivet City if you want. But don't expect to come out looking better than me.
1DI0000079	Try Pinkerton at Rivet City. Heard he has the goods. Hope he doesn't try to actually use them on anyone. Bet he would though. He's nuts.
1DI0000081	I tell these assholes to just stop looking in the mirror. But if you want to mess up your face, try Pinkerton at Rivet City. He's crazy enough.
1DI0000082	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech. He might have what you're looking for.
1DI0000084	Guess old Pinkerton at Rivet City has some shiny prewar tech and knows how to use it. He could probably rearrange your face for you if you wanted.
1DI0000085	I heard a rumor that old Pinkerton at Rivet City somehow conjured up a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
1DI0000087	Pinkerton's the only surgeon crazy enough to try a facial reconstruction. I'd advise my patients against it. Due to high risk of deadly infection.
1DI0000088	Rumor had it Pinkerton at Rivet City found a Lipoplasticator and Graftilizer. Good luck to any fool that let Pinkerton test them on him though.
1DI0000090	I know it's foolish to cut into the body unnecessarily. Leads to infection. Heard Pinkerton's willing to give it a try though. Try him at Rivet City.
1DI0000091	What're you talking about, boy? I don't know anything about any of that, and a what-did-you-call-it? An android? What's that?
1DI0000092	What are you talking about, girl? I don't know anything about any of that, and a what-did-you-call-it? An android? What's that?
1DI0000093	Like I tell my men: Don't bother reporting in, unless it's to tell me you got the job done.
1DI0000094	Really? You? You're welcome to give it a try. But don't come crying to me when you get hurt.
1DI0000095	They've holed up in the nearby metro tunnels. They're living with packs of Feral Ghouls. Be careful, Roy seems damn close to turning zombie himself.
1DI0000096	I suppose you won't be doing this out of the kindness of your heart, huh?
1DI0000097	How's 500 bottlecaps sound? Payable upon termination of that damn Ghoul, Roy Phillips, and all his followers.
1DI0000098	Of course! If you help me, and thus the android, God and the universe will smile upon you. Is there any better compensation?
1DI0000099	Not here. Not in Andale, no sir. The great Commonwealth of Virginia is alive and well. In fact, we just voted ourselves a new governor!
1DI0000100	Not here. Not in Andale, no ma'am. The great Commonwealth of Virginia is alive and well. In fact, we just voted ourselves a new governor!
1DI0000101	The adults walked right on down to the polling location and dropped ballots into the box. How do you think it works?
1DI0000102	Yessir, it's every American's civic duty to cast his vote for his favorite Republican candidate. Am I right?
1DI0000103	Now, now, my vote is my business and no one else's. But I'll tell you one thing: we didn't vote for any beatnik liberal commies, that's for sure.
1DI0000104	Poor guy. His wife died and he went... well... crazy, I guess. He won't talk to any of us anymore.
1DI0000105	He stays locked up in his house all day and the girls bring him his meals. He barely eats enough to stay alive. Poor guy, he's all skin and bones.
1DI0000106	Yeah, well, he's hit it rough. Ever since his wife died, he just hasn't been enthusiastic about the Andale lifestyle anymore.
1DI0000108	Haven't you ever heard the radio play? The Adventures of Herbert "Daring" Dashwood? That guy at the radio station put it together a few years ago.
1DI0000109	He did it in the style of those shows they had before the war. Came out pretty well. And it's all true! Rockopolis, Miss Chase... All of it.
1DI0000110	Of course, they do portray me as a bit of a chump. Argyle may have saved my hide more than once, but I had my moments. Ah, those were the days...
1DI0000111	I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you'll consider meeting me in Rivet City.
1DI0000112	That's good to hear. Let's not waste any time.
1DI0000113	Really... Do go on.
1DI0000114	Oh, they're somewhere to the northeast. In a police station or something. Thanks for rescuing our friends!
1DI0000115	Try Germantown. They always come from up that way. Bring lots of guns and shoot the hell out of those Muties! I'll hold down the fort here.
1DI0000116	Well if you feel like dying, go right on ahead. They're up there at some police station near Germantown. Good luck. You're gonna need it.
1DI0000117	There's a police station up there to the northeast or something. Bury our friends corpses if you find them. I've got enough ghosts haunting me.
1DI0000118	Have you changed your mind? Are you going to rescue our friends! I'd given up hope. It's so hard here in the Wasteland. Not like when we were young.
1DI0000119	Well, I was just thinking I better go kill those Muties and rescue my friends myself... unless you've changed your mind and you're going to help us!
1DI0000120	Hah! You've decided to help rescue our friends? Unlikely. You probably just figured out a way to take advantage of the situation. Bah!
1DI0000121	Have you changed your mind? Are you going to rescue them?! I mean, not that I care or anything. They aren't really my friends anyway.
1DI0000122	Just walking corpses waiting to die like the rest of us.
1DI0000123	I thought growing up was a good thing. You got to leave and explore the real world. Well, what nobody tells you is that the real world sucks!
1DI0000124	At first we just paid the Slavers to leave us alone... when we ran out of money Red found other ways to convince them to leave us alone.
1DI0000125	But now she and the others are gone. Super Mutants attacked and carried them off! No one knows when they're coming back. Or who'll be next.
1DI0000126	What? You never seen a Super Mutant before?! They're mean and ugly and scary as hell!
1DI0000127	They came and rounded up a bunch of us and carried them off! God! They must be doing awful things to them.
1DI0000128	I'd go rescue them, but then who'd defend Big Town? I patrol every day now.
1DI0000129	And I got a little present for those muties when they come back. You know what it is? This kick-ass gun. That's what! Yeah baby!
1DI0000130	The only thing you need to know is that we're all doomed! Sooner or later they'll get every last one of us.
1DI0000131	And what are you supposed to be anyway? Some kind of hero here to rescue our friends from the Muties? Bah! You're just here to cause trouble.
1DI0000132	Ever wonder what it'd be like to slit your wrist? I watched someone die once. So I'm an expert on death. And so are many of my friends now.
1DI0000133	Now that Mutants took them.
1DI0000134	Unless someone can figure out how to rescue them.
1DI0000135	The Mechanist used to be our town mechanic. Scott Wollinksi, quiet guy, but plenty fierce with a wrench and some solder.
1DI0000136	Guy used to take care of a robot that protected the town... until it got torn up in one of the AntAgonizer's lame little attacks.
1DI0000137	I guess he took it personal, because he made a mechanical suit and called himself the Mechanist. Said he would lead a robot army to fight her.
1DI0000138	Now he doesn't even respond to his name, and his "robot army" is more dangerous to the town than the ants ever were.
1DI0000139	You mean Scott Wollinksi. I refuse to call him by that ridiculous name just because his head got a screw loose.
1DI0000140	He used to be a damned good friend, and not just because he fixed my guns up.
1DI0000141	Now he spends all his time up in that 'bot shop, just thinking about fighting that AntAgonizer. Hardly even recognizes his own name, anymore.
1DI0000142	I knew the Mechanist back when he was just a normal-hero. He used to be called Scott, and he fixed up stuff around town!
1DI0000143	But one day, the AntAgonizer killed his favorite robot, and I told him he ought to fight back against her like a real super-hero!
1DI0000144	Ever since then, he's been up in his Forge in the back of the robot shop on the hill, working to protect us all from the AntAgonizer!
1DI0000145	My nephew Derek might know more about them. I swear, it's all I can do to keep him from running into the fight whenever they come out.
1DI0000146	He might know more about where you can find them, but don't encourage the poor boy. He's had enough close calls!
1DI0000147	If you could just get make either one of them stop fighting, it'd do the trick. You probably wouldn't have to worry about the other one.
1DI0000148	I can't imagine Scott attacking the town with his robots, and that AntAgonizer girl was never much more than a sideshow freak by herself.
1DI0000149	Roe may prefer that you're thorough, but all I care about is that you get the job done, one way or the other.
1DI0000150	No way! Don't stop them! They're awesome!
1DI0000151	Unless maybe you're going to be a super-hero, too!
1DI0000152	You could be called "Super-Humongous" and fight them with an army of Super-Mutants!
1DI0000155	You could be called "Awesome-Claw" and fight them with an army of Deathclaws!
1DI0000158	You could be called "The Brilliant Shadow" and undermine all of their plots with an army of Mole Rats!
1DI0000161	You could be called "Incredibly Lucky Guy!" And you could fight them with an army of... um... Mirelurks who just happen to do what you tell them!
1DI0000164	You could be called "Incredibly Lucky Girl!" And you could fight them with an army of... um... Mirelurks who just happen to do what you tell them!
1DI0000167	You could be called... um... err... Well, maybe you wouldn't make a very good super-hero.
1DI0000168	Just don't fight them, okay?
1DI0000169	Thank you. Pleasure doing business with you. Enjoy your visit to Paradise Falls.
1DI0000170	Friendly warning - don't act like a jackass. You won't get a second chance.
1DI0000171	That's what I said. Bring me the caps, and I'll vouch for you. Good luck.
1DI0000172	Well, it's about time someone put that bastard out of his misery.
1DI0000173	And here's the reward for it. Spend it well, Lawbringer.
1DI0000174	Ah, yes. A rather unfortunate incident. In all the commotion, Miss Beatrice suffered from a rather bad sprain in her left toe. The big one.
1DI0000175	Obviously, I had no choice but to amputate. The leg. I'm sorry to say the operation was not a success.
1DI0000176	We call ourselves the Railroad. Our mission is the rescue and salvation of synthetic humanoids. Androids, as they're more commonly known.
1DI0000177	Sure did. Underworld. It's right inside the Museum of History, then through the big skull.
1DI0000178	Most of the residents ain't crazy about humans, but they'll sell to you, fix you up, so long as your caps are good. And you ain't a Ghoul hater.
1DI0000179	Now we're talking! What do you need?
1DI0000180	Are you serious? Well alright! Let me get my knives!
1DI0000181	Alright! A full head of hair to work with! What should I do?
1DI0000182	Sorry. I'm way too gone to cut hair right now... maybe later?
1DI0000183	<whine>
1DI0000184	Fuck that. Do your own dirty work.
1DI0000185	I'm sorry, my companion, but no. We all have our own destinies, and yours culminates here. I would not rob you of that.
1DI0000186	Soldier, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. This is your fight! You gotta finish what your daddy started! Stand strong and get your ass in there!
1DI0000187	Honey, you are out of your mind if you think I'm going in there. Find yourself another guinea pig.
1DI0000188	My friend... It's been my pleasure accompanying you, but we both know this is your fight to finish. Stay strong, and honor your father's memory.
1DI0000189	That chamber? Right there? With all the radiation? Man, no way. I'll end up dead. Or worse. I could be one of them Ghouls! Ain't gonna happen.
1DI0000190	You and I both know that's not going to happen. I've saved your sorry ass enough. This one's all you.
1DI0000191	I sure am. Two hundred caps, if you can find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and get them to end their pointless fighting in town.
1DI0000192	You only need to stop one of them, really. Nowadays, I think they only stay in Canterbury to fight each other. So, what do you say?
1DI0000193	Excellent! Without him, the AntAgonizer should be on her way, and Canterbury Commons is safe again! Relatively speaking, of course.
1DI0000194	Now, I do believe this is our agreed upon payment for your fine services rendered. Thank you, once again!
1DI0000195	Excellent! Without her, the Mechanist should be on his way, and Canterbury Commons is safe again! Relatively speaking, of course.
1DI0000197	That's grand! I do believe it's fair to say you've saved Canterbury. And unlike that Mechanist, you did so with significantly less stress all around!
1DI0000198	Now, I do believe this is our agreed upon payment for your fine services rendered. And a little bonus, as a special thank-you!
1DI0000199	First you took away my uncle, and now you took away them, too? Fine - here! Take it and go away forever!
1DI0000200	Yeah, he told me. I wish you didn't have to make the super heroes go away, but I guess Uncle Roe knew what the town needed.
1DI0000201	He told me to pay you for the work. He always did say, "Money comes and goes, but a contract's forever." At least the town's safe, now.
1DI0000202	There's no need to flex. I was just playing with you. We know who you are. You can come in.
1DI0000204	Oh, and, if you want, I have a mutually beneficial offer for you to think about.
1DI0000205	Relax. I was just playing with you. We know who you are. You can come in.
1DI0000208	Hmm... If I recall, he was looking for a surgeon and some kind of computer genius. But those rumors are ancient history by now.
1DI0000209	Some VIP from up north looking for surgery and computer expertise. I don't pay attention to that crap, and neither should you.
1DI0000210	Now that's an old story. If I recall, some runaway android was looking for a surgeon and, what? A computer expert, if I remember correctly.
1DI0000211	You believe that ancient crap? Rumors of an escaped robot looking for a hacksaw and a computer expert. Forget about it.
1DI0000212	Oh yeah! That crazy old story about an escaped robot, right? He was looking for a surgeon and a computer expert. Yeah, that sounds right.
1DI0000213	Well... ancient rumor had it that some hotshot from the Commonwealth was looking for special surgery, and some kind of computer tech.
1DI0000214	Sounds like that old story. Let's see... It was an escaped robot looking for someone to perform surgery, and for a computer expert too, or something.
1DI0000215	Have you heard the so called "android recording?" Didn't know what to make it of myself.  Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. Take a listen.
1DI0000216	It was a hoax. End of story. Those holotapes were sent to practically everyone doctor in the Wasteland. Go bother someone else.
1DI0000217	Thought that hoax was long in the grave. Here take this holotape and hear it for yourself. That was just some bored prankster. Forget about it.
1DI0000218	You got wax in your ears? I said it was a hoax. Practically every doctor in the Capital Wasteland got a holotape like that. Go bother someone else.
1DI0000219	I've learned a thing or two about not taking things on appearances. That was an elaborate hoax. Take this holotape and give a listen. Clearly fake.
1DI0000220	It was clearly faked. You can ask practically any doctor in the Wasteland. We all got a tape like this.
1DI0000221	That old "android recording?" Some of the boys took that seriously. Clearly it was a hoax. Here's a copy of the holotape. Listen for yourself.
1DI0000222	You don't take that seriously do you? They sent tapes like that all over the Wasteland. Try bothering someone else.
1DI0000223	Oh you mean that old "android recording?" Have you heard it? It's great. Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. It's either real or a great joke.
1DI0000224	Yeah! It's really great isn't it? I mean, if it's real it's amazing, if it's fake, it's really funny. They sent tapes like that to doctors all over.
1DI0000225	That old story? Well, now.... I haven't heard talk of that in quite some time. It was all just a rumor. A hoax. Someone's idea of a practical joke.
1DI0000226	Story was there was an android, escaped from the Commonwealth up north. From someplace called the Institute.
1DI0000227	There was a holotape that got circulated. I think I've got a copy of it... Yeah, here it is. Give it a listen. That's a man's voice! Hoax for sure!
1DI0000228	Like I said, it's a hoax. Don't bother with it. Someone sent tapes like that to pretty much every doctor in the Wasteland. None of us believed it.
1DI0000229	I had forgotten about that old hoax. Have you heard it? Here's a copy of that old  "android holotape." It's just some practical jokester.
1DI0000230	It's a pretty elaborate practical joke. I mean, they sent a bunch of tapes like that to doctors all over the Wasteland.
1DI0000235	Oh if I got my hands on the right gear I might try it. It's dangerous though. Prone to infection. Reminds me an old hoax. Listen to this holotape.
1DI0000259	Argyle was my manservant! Ah, but that's really just a fancy word for "the guy who saves my sorry skin on a regular occasion."
1DI0000260	He was a Ghoul, you see. Been around since before the war. We met when I stole his girlfriend, back in '41. We'd been best friends ever since.
1DI0000261	We got separated, a long time ago, and never reunited. If you find Argyle out there, somewhere, you be sure and tell me! Okay?
1DI0000262	Well, you're standing fine, but you could use some switching up. That'll be 50 caps.
1DI0000263	Your vitals are fine, but you could use some stitches on those cuts. Tell you what, 50 caps sound good?
1DI0000264	Look at you! You're fine! Don't come in here wasting my time with your hypochondria. I've got actual patients to see to.
1DI0000265	Oh, you do not. Just suck it up, you big baby.
1DI0000266	Alright, you're not that banged up -- a couple of pain killers should do you fine. That'll be 50 caps.
1DI0000267	You know, all things considered, you could be worse off. I can stitch you up for 50 caps.
1DI0000268	Let's see... moderate lacerations, maybe a broken bone or two... I should be able to do you up for 75.
1DI0000269	Well now, let's take a look at you... some 2nd degree burns... a couple of flesh wounds... it'll take some work but I can fix you up for 75.
1DI0000270	Good lord, this'll take some work... 100 caps worth of work.
1DI0000271	I'm surprised you made it in here. I can fix you up, but it'll run you 100 caps. What do you say?
1DI0000274	All right, you're not that banged up -- a couple of pain killers should do you fine. That'll be 50 caps.
1DI0000277	That takes a lot of nerve, threatening to bury us all alive and then crawling to me for help. As RJ would say, "Fuck off, mungo."
1DI0000278	Sure thing. Run into a bit of trouble out there?
1DI0000279	You're lucky you're one of us. I'd be charging you through the nose, otherwise.
1DI0000280	Got scraped up a bit out there, huh?
1DI0000281	Yeah, but only because you saved three of ours.
1DI0000282	Looks like it's just a scrape. I can take care of it for 50 caps.
1DI0000283	Okay, but it'll cost you. Every spare cap I get from you is more medicine for these germ-magnets.
1DI0000286	That looks pretty bad. For 75 caps, I can take care of that.
1DI0000290	This is going to be tricky. And not at all pleasant. And it'll cost you 100 caps.
1DI0000293	Maybe you should have been more careful down here, mungo. You're on your own.
1DI0000294	Unless you've got hurt feelings, there's not a damn thing wrong with you. Come back when you've got some injuries that I can earn some money from.
1DI0000295	Hey, if you needed help, I'd gladly take your money, but you're just fine, buck-o. Now stop wasting my time.
1DI0000296	Let's see, a few Stimpaks and a couple of stitches should get you goin'. And it'll only run you 50 caps.
1DI0000297	All right, a few stitches and a couple of bandages should fix you up. Let's call it 50 caps. Sound good?
1DI0000298	A few broken bones, a couple of cuts... I should be able to do you up for 75.
1DI0000299	Sure, I'll help you. If you have the caps. Looks to me like you're pretty banged up, though. Let's say... 75 caps and I'll fix you good as new.
1DI0000300	You know, when I saw you limping in here, I knew that I smelled money. That'll be 100 caps. Or you can just bleed to death. Your choice.
1DI0000301	Well, hello, meal ticket. 100 caps. Or I can just wait for you to die and take it.
1DI0000302	Don't think because I'm a Ghoul, I'm stupid. You're fine.
1DI0000303	Is this a trick question? I don't even see a scratch on you.
1DI0000304	Injured... ha! This is just a nick. If you can't tough it out and you want to be fixed up it'll cost you 50 caps.
1DI0000305	I'd hesitate to even call this a wound, but if you insist. 50 caps should cover my expenses.
1DI0000306	Yeah, you could do with some work. It'll set you back 75 caps, but well worth it.
1DI0000307	This is pretty bad, but I've seen worse. Still, it's going to cost 75 caps to get you back on your feet.
1DI0000308	Yeah, you look almost as bad as I do. Of course, I'm supposed to look this way and you aren't. 100 caps will do it for my expenses.
1DI0000309	Did you get the number of that Brahmin that trampled you? Sheesh! If you want me to stitch you back together, it'll be 100 caps.
1DI0000310	For you? No problem. Now, hold still.
1DI0000311	I don't see anything wrong with you.
1DI0000312	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though. Let's say 75 caps.
1DI0000314	You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee... 100 caps ought to cover it.
1DI0000315	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for 150 caps.
1DI0000316	Not unless Mayor says it's okay. You'd better ask him.
1DI0000317	You sure about that? It's scary in there. Even I don't like going there, and I'm really brave.
1DI0000318	Okay, it's your funeral.
1DI0000319	Come on. We'll open the gate for you.
1DI0000320	The last I knew, he was headed back to the lab at Project Purity, in the old Jefferson Memorial building.
1DI0000321	I still say it's dangerous, and he shouldn't have risked it. That's all I know.
1DI0000322	You mean you haven't? I assumed he sent you here.
1DI0000323	For that matter, aren't you supposed to be in a Vault? James said he left you there.
1DI0000324	What? Did I do something bad?
1DI0000325	Oh... I'm sorry. I was just really excited. I'll, ah... I'll shut up now.
1DI0000326	One day there was a crazy woman leading a bunch of ants into town. She said humanity was dead and the ants would inherit the Earth. Stuff like that.
1DI0000327	Well, that gave Dom plenty of time to line up a shot or two on the ants. She ran away, but every once in a while, she'd stage an "attack" again.
1DI0000328	She wasn't much of a threat, then. In fact, she was sort of entertaining, at first. Gave everyone in town something to talk about.
1DI0000329	But when the Mechanist started fighting her, things got bad. Ants are easy to shoot, but add robots with lasers, and it got real nasty.
1DI0000330	I don't know who she is, other than a crazy with an ant suit and a chip on her shoulder for humanity.
1DI0000331	She wasn't much trouble by herself, really. Her attacks were a joke, but at least stories of her kept some of the raiders at bay.
1DI0000332	If it helps, she was always attacking from the warrens up North. Maybe you can find her ant nest in there.
1DI0000333	I don't know much about her, except she really, really doesn't like people. That's kinda cool. I mean, sometimes people are jerks.
1DI0000334	I think her lair is somewhere in the caves to the north of the city. I've seen her ants down there once in a while.
1DI0000335	Joe Porter said he found out something about her, but my uncle won't let him tell me. He says, "Don't encourage the poor boy."
1DI0000336	I can see you're trying to appeal to my good nature. Pity for you I don't have one.
1DI0000337	I'll give you this one for free -- we use our big guns to kill big Super Mutants, so people like you can sleep at night.
1DI0000338	Yes, if we are able. But there are others in the Wasteland who assist in the plight of human slaves. Our android brethren have only us.
1DI0000339	Ah, one of my favorite subjects, of course! What would you like to know?
1DI0000340	You want to talk to Scribe Jameson. She's the archivist, not me.
1DI0000341	Those knuckle draggers? Nah. They don't bother us Ghouls. Maybe they see us as kin or something. I dunno. Now, those other assholes...
1DI0000342	He's expecting you? Why didn't you say so right away? Just a moment...
1DI0000343	Alright. Come on in. But I warn you. We're watching you.
1DI0000344	You shut up!
1DI0000345	That Commonwealth robot was real! I have proof. Listen to this!
1DI0000346	I sure do! No one believes me though. It was old Pinkerton. You know, the "ghost" of Rivet City. He's a genius!
1DI0000347	Maybe you're right. We can deal with her later.
1DI0000348	I can give you something that'll should help.
1DI0000349	The treatment costs 50 caps. Even most outsiders should be able to afford it.
1DI0000350	I can take care of it for you, for a price.
1DI0000351	That'll be 50 caps. Maybe the dent in your pocketbook will keep you away from that crap.
1DI0000352	I swear, you and Zip, just full of your own little chemical problems, aren't you?
1DI0000353	Here, hold on. I've got you covered.
1DI0000354	And here I thought Zip's soda problem was bad.
1DI0000355	For 50 caps, I can help you get over that. Otherwise, you can find your own solution.
1DI0000356	I'm just glad you're willing to get help. But the treatment isn't free. I'll need 50 caps for the drugs.
1DI0000357	I thought you had the look about you. Sure, I can help you. But it's not free. 50 caps, take it or leave it.
1DI0000358	Talk to Scribe Jameson. She is our keeper of the Scrolls. She will want to know what you have found.
1DI0000359	You have? Oh my. This brings to light a sad affair for the Brotherhood. But perhaps it is something that you can assist us with.
1DI0000360	If you have the time, I have an offer for you.
1DI0000361	Excellent. How many are you willing to trade?
1DI0000362	You have no such thing. I do not have time for these jokes.
1DI0000363	Yes? What about them?
1DI0000364	What? No, I never said that.
1DI0000365	Ain't got no use for one. Lost most of my hair a long time ago, y'see?
1DI0000366	Ain't had enough to drink. Can't go nowheres.
1DI0000367	Now's our chance! Let's go!
1DI0000368	Freedom!
1DI0000369	Fine, but what am I supposed to do here? Work on my needlepoint or something?
1DI0000370	I shall wait here until you return for me.
1DI0000371	But it's so boring all alone!
1DI0000372	Don't piss around, I don't want to be standing here with my thumb up my ass all day.
1DI0000373	I will keep this location secure!
1DI0000374	If you insist. But do be careful - I can hardly repay your kindness while waiting back here.
1DI0000375	I shall reflect on the battles past and the battles to come until your return.
1DI0000376	Well... Billy built a safe into the floor of our house. He keeps all sorts of cool stuff in there.
1DI0000377	I shouldn't tell you this but... the combination is 15-16-23-42 if you want to take a look.
1DI0000378	Just make sure that you put everything back if you take anything out to play with it. I don't want to get in trouble.
1DI0000379	Did he? Well, our time together was brief, but... that is the way of it out here. When a bond is forged, little else matters, hmm?
1DI0000380	Well, he did come through here, but he left. I'm truly sorry. But maybe you can catch up to him?
1DI0000381	He headed southeast, into the city. Said he needed information from those loonies at the station. You know, Galaxy News Radio, what there is of it.
1DI0000382	It's like I said, kid. Your dad was here for a bit, but didn't stay long. Said he was going to the Galaxy News Radio station. Southeast, in D.C.
1DI0000383	My God... It's you. The little baby boy, all grown up. Persistent little bastard, ain't ya? Then and now, it would seem. It's been a long time, kid.
1DI0000384	Oh, your daddy passed through here, all right. Here and gone. Got what he came for, and then left. I'm assuming you'll do the same, correct?
1DI0000385	My God... It's you. The little baby girl, all grown up. Persistent little flower, ain't ya? Then and now, it would seem. It's been a long time, kid.
1DI0000387	You took care of our little lost lamb, eh? I knew I could count on you.
1DI0000388	How about you just hand over 100 caps and we'll call it even.
1DI0000389	You got memory problems, kid? You ain't getting somethin' for nothin'. So pony up the 300 caps, and THEN we'll talk.
1DI0000390	Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
1DI0000391	Oh, yeah! I do remember a guy like that.
1DI0000392	Honestly, I usually keep my head down. I tend to get smacked around if I look customers in the eyes. But talk to Moriarty, he'll know more.
1DI0000393	I can't talk about that anymore. Moriarty will beat me again if I do.
1DI0000394	Yeah, I remember that man. I saw him talking to Moriarty. It's hard to forget handsome men like that.
1DI0000395	Not in here, I haven't.
1DI0000396	Sorry, man. I haven't seen any cats like that roll through here.
1DI0000397	Many of the transient visitors end up at one of Megaton's seedier establishments.
1DI0000398	I suggest you speak to Colin Moriarty and continue your search there.
1DI0000399	Boy... are you botherin' me? 'Cause I think we talked about what happens when you bother me.
1DI0000400	Girl... are you botherin' me? 'Cause I think we talked about what happens when you bother me.
1DI0000401	Oh man, you're looking for your dad? That is so sweet! Did he run out on you when you were a kid or something?
1DI0000402	Our parents died when we were kids. My brother Leo, he's the oldest, he raised my brother Andy and me. It was hard on him, but we turned out okay.
1DI0000403	But God, you don't want to hear about that. I'm sorry, but I haven't seen your dad. He didn't eat at the Brass Lantern. I'd remember if he did.
1DI0000404	Are you fucking kidding me? Get out of my face.
1DI0000405	I usually avoid most of the Wasteland types that come through here, but there was one guy.
1DI0000406	Unlike most of the wannabe heroes that come in, he looked like he could actually read a book without giving himself a headache.
1DI0000407	He spent a bunch of time at Moriarty's before moving on. I'd try talking to Colin.
1DI0000411	Your father? I don't know, I don't know. Doesn't ring a bell, sorry.
1DI0000412	Well, come to think of it, I do remember a stranger coming through here. Had a look in his eye. You know the kind a man gets when he's got a purpose.
1DI0000413	Spent some time up in the saloon. Might want to check with Moriarty. Just watch yourself. That man's trouble.
1DI0000414	Nope, sorry. I got enough fires to put out in this place that I don't have time to keep tabs on every visitor. I'd ask around town.
1DI0000415	Could be the guy I saw at Moriarty's Saloon not too long ago. I'd ask there.
1DI0000416	It's that Martha Simpson, isn't it? I knew it! That's it. I've had enough of Roger's lies and bullshit!
1DI0000417	Now see here. That's not anything for you to be asking about. Our marriage is our business, and it's private.
1DI0000418	Why can't people just understand that, and just leave us alone?
1DI0000419	Our marriage? Goodness, what kind of a question is that?
1DI0000420	Mabel didn't put you up to this, did she? What a silly thing to ask about.
1DI0000421	I don't know what sort of thing you'd want to hear about... There was that one time Janet waved a rolling pin at Martha...
1DI0000422	Oh, but I suppose that's not really something you should concern yourself with. All in the past now.
1DI0000423	Their marriage? Why that's an odd sort of question. They're like anyone else, I suppose. Got their problems, but they work through them.
1DI0000424	Janet's a good woman. It's a good thing that Roger came to his senses.
1DI0000425	Another of his games? I won't be a party to it. You leave those poor people be.
1DI0000426	Now what's a kid like you want to know about that? Kind of grown-up stuff to be worried about, don't you think?
1DI0000427	Well, don't you worry your head about it. They worked out their problems a while ago. Haven't heard them fight in a long time.
1DI0000428	Well, they're just so nice, aren't they? It's good the two of them worked everything out.
1DI0000429	Why are you asking me? I don't know anything. And why should I care about their marriage, anyway?
1DI0000430	What? No she didn't... did she?
1DI0000431	I don't like her. She's creepy, and she laughs at stuff that isn't funny.
1DI0000432	The Neusbaum boy, eh? Quiet kid. Seems like his parents don't give him much wiggle room.
1DI0000433	Just between you and me kiddo, he looks he's what we'd have called a "momma's boy" back in my day.
1DI0000434	That boy is in trouble, if you ask me. Pat babies him like you wouldn't believe... Acts like he's still an infant.
1DI0000435	He's never out of his parents' sight. Can you imagine what it'll be like the first time he's separated from them?
1DI0000436	I'm not one to gossip, but that boy's in trouble, if you ask me. Growing up so attached to his parents like that.
1DI0000437	What he needs is some discipline. I keep telling Pat that military school would do him some good, but she won't listen.
1DI0000438	She doesn't understand I'm just trying to help. Even got a brochure for her to look over... but I'll bet she hasn't even glanced at it.
1DI0000439	Not really a boy, is he? Got him all confused, looking like he does.
1DI0000440	He's been on the edge for a while. I keep trying to talk him down, but his parents... They don't understand. Just about anything could set him off.
1DI0000441	My boy Timmy? Good kid. Straight-laced, good head on his shoulders. Never been in so much as a fist-fight.
1DI0000442	We're a close-knit family. Don't know what any of us would do if something happened...
1DI0000443	Timmy? Oh, he's a good boy. George and I are so proud of him.
1DI0000444	I don't care what Mabel says; I don't think military school would do him any good at all.
1DI0000445	I have half a mind to give her that brochure back and tell her just what she can do with it!
1DI0000446	What were you doing in our basement? What's down there?
1DI0000447	Um... yeah... I got tons of caps at Big Town. Well, they're not mine really. My girl friend's got them. Her name's Red.
1DI0000448	She's a doctor, so she's sure to have lots of money. She'll give them to you for making sure I get there safely.
1DI0000449	If it'll help, I'm glad to.
1DI0000450	You mean the super-heroes? Yeah, I try to watch all of their fights!
1DI0000451	Roe hired you put a stop to their shit, did he? Guess he finally listened when I told him I haven't got the time to do it myself.
1DI0000452	It's easy enough to hide inside when those two square off, but they're only getting worse about it all.
1DI0000453	What do you want to know about them?
1DI0000454	You mean, apart from having cheesy names? Actually, I think I might know something useful.
1DI0000455	One of the traders told me she sounded like a girl he used to know. Girl's whole family was wiped out by ants, not long before she showed up here.
1DI0000456	But they never found any trace of her body. Said her name was "Tanya Christoff." That might just be our little AntAgonizer.
1DI0000457	I know Dom doesn't want me just killing them. He and the Mechanist used to be friends or something.
1DI0000458	All I know is next time they come to town, I bet I could solve the whole problem with one bullet for each of them.
1DI0000459	So, how's the scavving been? Got the food and medicine from that Super-Duper Mart?
1DI0000460	Oh? Feeling a bit under the weather? Or a bit over the Geiger-counter?
1DI0000461	How are those hot little potatoes?
1DI0000462	Because, you know, they're on the ground, like potatoes. And hot, because they, um, explode.
1DI0000463	Anyway, what's up?
1DI0000464	How are those hot little potatoes? Or whatever. You know what I mean.
1DI0000465	Oh, I can't wait to hear how the repellent's working!
1DI0000466	So, are they intelligent? Do they have a leader? Some sort of king? Or priests? Or some sort of scaly community center?
1DI0000467	Well, how do you feel?
1DI0000468	Any luck finding out how Rivet City got started?
1DI0000469	Fiddle with any interesting technology, lately?
1DI0000470	Is it there? Are there books? Can I go borrow some?
1DI0000471	Harkness, you say? Yes... Yes, that makes sense. He used to work for a special branch of the Commonwealth Police, after all...
1DI0000472	And he's right here in Rivet City! Excellent! I must wait... find an opportune moment to confront him...
1DI0000473	Thank you for your discreet assistance, and continued discretion regarding this matter.
1DI0000474	And now for your payment. This combat module will directly affect your central nervous system. I think you will find it quite beneficial.
1DI0000475	What can I tell you about it, beyond it not being any of your business, you mean?
1DI0000476	Nothing really. Just some run away android from the Commonwealth. Naturally they asked the Paradise Falls crew for help retrieving their property.
1DI0000477	The job pays well, but so far it's been mostly a distraction. Certainly hasn't been a priority for us.
1DI0000478	Nothing really. Just some runaway slave from the Commonwealth. Eulogy had us running around like morons looking for him. I'm done with that.
1DI0000479	It's none of your God damn business.
1DI0000480	Nothing really. Just some run away slave from the Commonwealth. Naturally they asked the Paradise Falls crew for help retrieving their property.
1DI0000481	The job pays well, but so far it's been mostly a distraction. I think most have pretty much given up and forgotten about it.
1DI0000482	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." We're done wasting resources on that job.
1DI0000483	We're done wasting resources on that job.
1DI0000484	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." I'm done wasting my time on that old job.
1DI0000485	I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Forget it.
1DI0000486	Here's a copy of the so-called "android recording." I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Don't tell Eulogy though. I kinda like it here.
1DI0000487	I'm done wasting my time on that old job. Don't tell Eulogy though. I kinda like it here.
1DI0000488	All I know is Zimmer, the guy contracting to find this slave, is hot to retrieve him. He's starting to get other people looking. So it's a race now.
1DI0000489	I hope you're not on the case. If I find out you are, well... You best not be! We'll leave it at that.
1DI0000494	Despite all his grumbling, I think Eulogy still wants us finding that guy. Zimmer is asking around hiring other people. Makes us look bad.
1DI0000495	I'd hunt down surgeons and bang on their heads to get leads, but I'm tired of chasing after that android thing.
1DI0000500	I guess I can trust you not to spread it around. Zimmer has put it out that he will pay to find this slave, but he wants him alive.
1DI0000501	Hey! You aren't thinking of signing up with him are you?
1DI0000502	It wouldn't be healthy for you, if you know what I mean.
1DI0000503	Don't know anything about a surgery, but I do know that Zimmer has put a bounty on his head.
1DI0000504	A word of advice. You don't want to be competing with me for this one. I'd hate to have to waste a bullet on you.
1DI0000506	Don't get in my way on this one. My competition tends to end up dead.
1DI0000507	We got a man at Rivet City. Been looking for a long time. I doubt he's even still there. Either way, don't go sticking your nose in our business!
1DI0000510	Trail led to Rivet City. Sister's our inside man. I think he's long given up looking for that android, and is just living it up on that boat.
1DI0000513	Why has Zimmer hired you too? I can't find a trace of that robot. I'm sure he's here somewhere though. Don't tell Eulogy I told you, though.
1DI0000516	We don't do that anymore. Well, not until the heat dies down. The Railroad isn't operating anymore. Best forget it about it now.
1DI0000517	I wouldn't betray one of God's children. Besides, we don't do that anymore. It's been too risky of late. We shut the Railroad down.
1DI0000518	The last one was... different. I heard a lot of people are looking for him. That's all I know. May the Lord guide him to safety.
1DI0000519	We don't do that anymore. Well, not until the heat dies down. For now, the Railroad is shut down.
1DI0000520	Used to help them escape from the Commonwealth. Find them places to lay low. The last one was someone real important. They are still looking for him.
1DI0000521	Ooh. We had to shut down the Railroad. Got too hot. You're endangering people by talking about it. Those Commonwealth hunters are deadly serious.
1DI0000522	Last I heard, they were looking for a surgeon and a computer technician. But you best keep your head down, honey. Those hounds are still out there.
1DI0000523	It's true. They found him a place to hide. It's not easy. The Commonwealth always sends someone looking. Someone ruthless and determined.
1DI0000524	They had been searching for a surgeon and computer programmer. I hope they found them. It's too dangerous to be out in the open now.
1DI0000525	He must be important if the hunter is still looking after all this time. May God guide his footsteps.
1DI0000526	Be careful who you talk to. These are dangerous topics.
1DI0000527	I heard they found him a place to hide. It's not easy. The Commonwealth always sends someone looking. Someone ruthless and determined.
1DI0000528	They were looking for a surgeon and a computer wiz. But that's old news.
1DI0000529	Lay low for a while. We've had to temporarily shut down the railroad.
1DI0000530	They were looking for a surgeon and a techie to do some advanced stuff to make him seem like a different person.
1DI0000531	But you better forget about all that for now. They shut down the Railroad. Those Commonwealth agents were starting to get close.
1DI0000532	A while back they were asking around for a computer genius to give our friend a new set of memories. You know, a clean slate and all that.
1DI0000533	He's one of God's creatures, just like you and I.
1DI0000534	He wanted new memories and a new face. Sadly, I couldn't help him. He left to look for a tech, someone with pre-war skills.
1DI0000535	Shhh! Not so loud! Whoever brought you in should have told you to be more discreet!
1DI0000536	They were looking for a tech-wizard awhile back. Someone who could give our friend a new set of memories. You know wipe them clear and replace them.
1DI0000537	Not sure how that'd be accomplished. If you know anything, send word by the regular channels. Now go before someone overhears us!
1DI0000538	They were looking for a tech wizard a while back. Someone who could fiddle with the android's memories.
1DI0000539	But you better stop poking around. Those Commonwealth hunters are still out there, tracking him down. We shut down the Railroad for safety.
1DI0000540	Pinkerton at Rivet City took care of him a while back. Was a complete success. No one will recognize that robot now. I'm glad.
1DI0000541	But you hush yourself about all that. The hounds are still out sniffing around.
1DI0000542	To Pinkerton at Rivet City. He doesn't remember his old life, and now he can't be forced to betray us.
1DI0000543	The Lord will protect us, but just to be safe we've shut down the railroad. Agents of the Commonwealth are still looking for him.
1DI0000544	He was delivered to Pinkerton at Rivet City a long while back. It's been a complete success. No one will recognize that robot now.
1DI0000545	We can all breathe easier, but we've shut down the Railroad until we are sure this has all blown over. Agents of the Commonwealth are still looking.
1DI0000546	Heard Pinkerton at Rivet City fixed him up good. That robot doesn't even know he's a robot. But they are still after him. So we all better lay low.
1DI0000547	They were talking about that a while ago. He needed some special surgery and brain hack or something. Was really cool.
1DI0000548	Turns out it was just joke though. Wish it was real. How cool would a living robot be?
1DI0000549	Something about facial surgery and reprogramming its memory. But that seems to have been a hoax. Haven't heard anything about it in a long time.
1DI0000550	I reckon you're talking facial surgery and memory reprogramming.
1DI0000551	I always liked that story best. Boy, Wastelanders sure can spin a yarn. It's been a while since I heard that one.
1DI0000552	Supposedly he needed facial reconstruction and memory wipe. At first we were thrilled about the idea of androids. Turns out it was just a hoax.
1DI0000553	Rumors about facial surgery and reprogramming its memory. That's ancient gossip by now. Forget about it, smoothskin.
1DI0000554	Ah maaaan. I wish it wasn't just a giant practical joke. Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. Think how cool it would be if it were true!
1DI0000555	How cool it would be if it were true! It was a huge joke they pulled. They sent those to lots of people. I bet other people got tapes like that.
1DI0000556	Have you heard the so called "android recording?" It sounds like an ordinary man! Here's a spare copy of that old holotape. It's a hoax for sure.
1DI0000557	I guess they sent those tapes to lots of people. Especially people like me who are interested in technology. Boy, I wish androids were real, though!
1DI0000558	Some dang fool was selling android recordings. I was just as big a fool for buying one.
1DI0000559	Here, have mine. Nothing but a damn hoax anyway.
1DI0000560	Yeah, I know. I got "DUMMY" written on my forehead. They sent those tapes to lots of people. You know, gullible and technically minded folk like me.
1DI0000561	It's a hoax. Here listen to this "android recording." We analyzed it. That's clearly a human man speaking.
1DI0000562	They sent tapes like that to various people who were interested in gadgets and technology. Our analyses concluded it was an ordinary man.
1DI0000563	A bunch of bullshit, that's all that was. Here, take this old holotape. It's just some guy pulling a clever prank. Had lots of folk convinced though.
1DI0000564	So much bullshit. Though I have to admit, it was a clever hoax. They sent tapes like that to various technically minded people. Ha! Couldn't fool me.
1DI0000566	Well, not sure how they'd do the mind wipe. Maybe with a giant magnet or something. But I know this for sure. That Commonwealth robot was real!
1DI0000567	Well... I think the Neuralizer's a giant magnet or something. But I know this for sure. That Commonwealth robot was real!
1DI0000568	Some say it was all a hoax. But it's real. Here. Check out this holotape I found. That Commonwealth robot was real!
1DI0000569	Some say it was all a hoax. But they're wrong. That Commonwealth robot was real!
1DI0000570	Some say it was all a hoax. But they're wrong.  I've seen diagrams of that Neuralizer, it's real. And so is that android!
1DI0000571	Shhh! They might be listening.
1DI0000572	The Commonwealth has tried to make it out to be a hoax, but the escaped android is real I tell you!
1DI0000573	Listen to this holotape. It will make you a believer too.
1DI0000576	Most believe it's a hoax. Here's some evidence for you to consider for yourself. Take this holotape.
1DI0000577	Most believe it's a hoax. There's some evidence for it being real. I'm not convinced either way.
1DI0000579	I used to this it was all so much bullshit. But then I got this holotape. Here, listen to it yourself.
1DI0000580	I used to think it was all so much bullshit. I'm not so sure anymore. But it's ancient news. So who cares, right? Doesn't change my life none.
1DI0000585	Heard a rumor a while back that it was some guy named Pinkerton at Rivet City. Apparently he's got some sweet tech stashed on that boat.
1DI0000588	Yep. Old Pinkerton. They say he helped found Rivet City. Must be some sort of crazy genius.
1DI0000589	He kind of vanished a long time ago. I don't know where he went, but you might ask around the ship.
1DI0000594	Normally I don't traffic in unsubstantiated rumor, but... they say old Pinkerton is hiding out somewhere in Rivet City and that he did it.
1DI0000597	It was old cranky Pinkerton who did it. Over at Rivet City. One day I mean to visit him and chat him up about it.
1DI0000600	HELL NO! Tenpenny won't allow it. And I take my orders from him.
1DI0000601	After Tenpenny died, I assumed full command. And since I hate Ghouls, I guess the answer to that question is pretty damn clear.
1DI0000602	Those Ghouls can live here over my goddamn body!
1DI0000603	I spend most of my days out acquiring and managing various... assets for Mister Tenpenny. So it matter's little to me personally.
1DI0000604	However, the Ghoulish state is a bitter reminder that things aren't yet in line with Mister Tenpenny's vision for a pure and stainless future.
1DI0000605	So you see, Ghouls living here is simply out of the question.
1DI0000606	I know you've been pressuring people into allowing Ghouls to live here.
1DI0000607	Who do you think you are, harassing honest people like that? You should be ashamed of yourself! I certainly won't allow Ghouls to live here.
1DI0000608	My neighbors might be out of their minds, but I am not. Those Ghouls will NOT be living here.
1DI0000609	Ah yes. I was wondering when you'd try me.
1DI0000610	You may be able to coerce the others, but I'm not such a pushover. Your zombie buddies will need to find someplace else to live.
1DI0000611	It's my turn, eh? Well, you won't be getting me to go along with your ridiculous plan.
1DI0000612	Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freaking mind!
1DI0000613	I know all about your plan to get your Ghoul pals in here, and I'm putting a stop to it. You can't just go around pushing us around like that!
1DI0000614	I've dealt with people like you before... people who think they know what's good for everybody else. I know what's best for me, and that's no Ghouls.
1DI0000615	So you can run along and tell your Ghouls they'll just have to find somewhere else to squat. Or better yet, to go off and die somewhere.
1DI0000616	Oh, I know you've been lobbying for those Ghouls... and I've already been thinking it over. I guess I would be willing to give it a try.
1DI0000617	I know you've been talking to the others about the Ghouls... and I've been mulling the whole thing over a few cocktails... well more than a few...
1DI0000618	And I've decided that I'd be willing to give it a go. Having Ghoul neighbors, I mean.
1DI0000619	I knew it was only a matter of time before you asked me about that... I've decided I want to do my own study of Ghoul physiology.
1DI0000620	Who knows, I could even publish my findings!
1DI0000621	You've finally got around to asking me, comrade.
1DI0000622	I've given it a lot of careful thought. I would welcome these Ghouls into our community.
1DI0000623	I've already formed a welcoming committee!
1DI0000624	It's my turn, eh? I'm still worried, but if the others are willing to let them live here, I guess I could try it. But they better behave!
1DI0000625	I've heard they carry diseases. I'd have to sanitize everything after them all the time. Besides, they are dangerous, aren't they?
1DI0000626	You've heard the stories I'm sure. About the mindless ones eating brains and the like. Well, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with all that.
1DI0000627	Haha. You're joking right? You're serious? Of course not! Ghouls can't live here. They're dirty loathsome creatures.
1DI0000628	Dear lord. Are you serious? Ghouls living here? With us? That's simply out of the question.
1DI0000629	I'm not sure. My first responsibility is the health and welfare of the residents of Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0000630	Ghouls often carry diseases due to radiation damaging their immune systems.
1DI0000631	You're being serious? That's out of the question. What an absurd notion!
1DI0000632	You can't be serious. Ghouls aren't human. They live in filth. They eat their own babies. You're out of your right freakin' mind!
1DI0000633	Don't have any data in my files about that.
1DI0000634	Ghouls wouldn't make the best of neighbors, comrade.
1DI0000635	I don't know. I mean, they're all deformed and scary looking. I bet they're really mean, too.
1DI0000636	I've come too far to share my digs with some droopy Ghoul!
1DI0000637	Well, I wouldn't mind. But they'd better be civilized. The tenants here are real uppity and most wouldn't take kindly to Ghouls living here.
1DI0000638	I've already told you no!
1DI0000639	I believe I've told you NO!
1DI0000640	It's not happening.
1DI0000641	I will not allow Ghouls to live here.
1DI0000642	I'm really tired of you and your Ghoul crusade.
1DI0000643	I wouldn't mind. It would certainly liven things up around here, that's for sure!
1DI0000644	I'm willing to give it a try... On a trial basis.
1DI0000645	Oh what the hell? It's not like anything interesting happens around here anyway.
1DI0000646	It would give me a chance to do my own study of Ghoul physiology.
1DI0000647	It's not really fair to deprive anyone of a community, is it? So we really ought to welcome them as comrades, shouldn't we?
1DI0000648	If they behave, I suppose it'd be okay with me.
1DI0000649	Great. I'd LOVE to talk to you some more. What the hell do you want to know now?
1DI0000650	Excellent. I had suspected that's why you came to me.
1DI0000651	And we will happily take them in trade, friend.
1DI0000652	Then you've been busy. Good. Show me what you have.
1DI0000653	The unrighteous will fall. Let me see how many you've brought to justice.
1DI0000654	Yeah, you know. Those humans, like you. Well, maybe not like you, I dunno, but humans all the same.
1DI0000655	The Brotherhood of Steel guys with their testosterone and Power Armor... Those psycho Talon Company mercs...
1DI0000656	Those other assholes.
1DI0000657	What? Let me see that! This is a Neuro-Servo... Unique to the A3-21... I... And you say you got this from his corpse?
1DI0000658	I suppose there's no other way you could have obtained it. Well... damn it. I was afraid this would happen, out here in this, this... Wasteland.
1DI0000659	Well. Here's 50 caps for your troubles. Try to buy yourself an education out here in this hell. Good day.
1DI0000660	Forget everything you know about robots. Those buckets are mere children's toys compared to the real thing.
1DI0000661	Androids have fake skin, and blood, and are programmed to simulate human behavior, like breathing. They can even eat and digest food realistically.
1DI0000662	I suppose so. I worked with them for several years until... Until your mother died, and your father decided it was time to leave.
1DI0000663	What else do you want to know?
1DI0000664	What do you want to know?
1DI0000665	Oh. I forgot I had that on. It was for my birthday. Here, you take it. I don't want it anymore.
1DI0000666	Well, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
1DI0000667	Things like where it is and isn't safe to find food, the dangers of radiation, and how to avoid and even profit from dangerous landmines.
1DI0000668	Ooh, sounds like fun, doesn't it? Which do you want to do first?
1DI0000669	The last chapter's a bit more esoteric. It's about the survival of humanity as a whole, and how to rebuild society. Deep stuff, huh?
1DI0000670	We need to know how large settlements are formed, how to harness the old technology, and I'll need you to get ancient history from a nearby library.
1DI0000671	We're in the last stretch, now, so let's finish it up strong! What first?
1DI0000672	The second chapter's going to be a bit trickier, I think. It'll cover how to handle creatures out there, for better or for worse.
1DI0000673	For example, repelling Mole Rats, learning about Mirelurks, and when all else fails, how to handle being injured.
1DI0000674	So, let's buckle down and get to work on this chapter. What first?
1DI0000675	I still need to study a living specimen with radiation poisoning.
1DI0000676	I need someone to research how to travel through a minefield.
1DI0000677	And that'll cover the first section of the book. Which strikes your fancy?
1DI0000678	I've got to see how safe it is to scavenge food from one of those huge stores out there.
1DI0000684	Well, I know lots about radiation from books... and personal experience, obviously.
1DI0000685	But I need to see how radiation effects normal, not-so-gooey humans. I never seem to get a live example to study. Not for long, anyway.
1DI0000686	So I need you to get a bit of radiation poisoning so I can study its effects. Oh, not a deadly dose, of course - I can fix you up before that!
1DI0000687	Yes, that's what I need your help on. I know lots about it from books, but I never seem to get a live example. Not for long, anyway.
1DI0000689	Well, food and medicine. Everyone needs them once in a while, right? So they need a good place to find them!
1DI0000690	There's an old Super-Duper Mart not far from here. I need to know if a place like that still has any food or medicine left in it.
1DI0000691	Landmines are one of the few dangers out there that you can profit from. Disarm one before it blows, and you can sell it for plenty of caps.
1DI0000692	I've heard stories about a ghost town that's just full of mines. Traders just call the place "Minefield."
1DI0000693	Sounds like the place for some fieldwork! Get in there, get back, and tell me all about it. And could you bring back a mine for my studies?
1DI0000697	There's a sort of Mole Rat repellant I've developed. I need it to be tested on a few Mole Rats before I can say it's a success.
1DI0000698	There's a lot we don't know about Mirelurks and how intelligent and dangerous they are. That definitely deserves research.
1DI0000699	And that should be it for the second chapter. Which do you want to check out?
1DI0000701	I hesitate to ask, but I'll need to examine the effects of serious physical trauma. I wouldn't ask if I couldn't fix you up afterwards, of course!
1DI0000706	Mole Rats can burrow into almost anything and cause a lot of trouble. So I figured I'd make a chemical repellent stick for people to shoo them off.
1DI0000707	But I need it to be tested before I put the recipe to paper in the guide. So I need you to find some Mole Rats and test it out a bit.
1DI0000708	Great! I never get to study anyone who's severely injured. Not without them crying to be fixed right away or trying to bleed out and all that.
1DI0000709	But obviously, you can handle a lot of abuse, so if I'm ever going to find a good example of human anatomy and injury resistance, it'd be you.
1DI0000710	Next time you get badly injured, return here so I can examine you before I heal you up. I mean, you're going to get yourself hurt anyway, right?
1DI0000711	Yes, knowing more about them can help people learn to avoid, or even outsmart them.
1DI0000712	So I picked up this observer device to study them in their natural habitat. I need you to hide one in one of the spawning pods in their lairs.
1DI0000713	I want to find out the history of how a successful settlement like Rivet City got started.
1DI0000714	I've also got to do a section on working with old computer electronics, so there's some research to be done in the old RobCo Production facility.
1DI0000715	And that'll be it for the last chapter. So, what'll it be?
1DI0000717	Also, there used to be a big library out there. Imagine, a whole building full of books! I'll need you to gather information there for me.
1DI0000719	I've got to do a section on working with old computer electronics, so there's some research to be done in the old RobCo Production facility.
1DI0000722	Yes, Rivet City's in particular. It's the most successful survivor settlement around, but no one here really knows how it started.
1DI0000723	Of course, that's why it's important to know how a place like that succeeded. So I need you to go there and do some researching!
1DI0000724	Oh, this is so exciting! I feel like I'm sending you out on some sort of super-assignment! Okay, okay. Give me a moment to calm down...
1DI0000725	Now then, a trader gave me this bit of electronics from the RobCo factory. It ought to go into some mainframe in there to control the robots.
1DI0000726	If there's a way to reactivate and control the robots there, it'd make for a good example of harnessing the past's technology for the book!
1DI0000727	It does, doesn't it? I mostly just deal with it after it's junked. But a trader gave me this bit of electronics from the RobCo factory.
1DI0000729	Yes. Books are where the old world kept its knowledge, and libraries are where it kept the books. And there's supposed to be one in Arlington.
1DI0000730	See if it's still there, and if you can download records from its computer. Information dumps like those would be invaluable for rebuilding humanity!
1DI0000731	Like I've said, I suspect he's had facial reconstruction, and possibly even a mind wipe.
1DI0000732	Try snooping around the work spaces of techies -- you know, people like yourself. And try doctors' offices, look for patient records or something.
1DI0000733	Start with Doctor Preston. He lives on this leaky boat. See if he knows anything. He's a "doctor" after all.
1DI0000734	Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm busy trying to ignore my surroundings.
1DI0000736	Search the offices of doctors or techies for android information. If he's come into contact with these people, there may be records.
1DI0000739	There's four that Eulogy wants especially. Arkansas, Susan Lancaster, Red, and Flak. Which of those assholes do you want to know about?
1DI0000740	Which one do you want to know about?
1DI0000741	It's Megaton. Have you been living in a hole or something? Everyone's heard of Megaton.
1DI0000742	They have plenty of water in there, but they only give it to residents... or people who can pay for it.
1DI0000743	Maybe.... MAYBE he didn't exactly wander off. Maybe he fled. Escaped captivity, as it were, if he began to misinterpret his "situation."
1DI0000744	It's possible my android sought to forget his previous life. Wipe away all memory, all guilt. Trick himself into believing he really IS human.
1DI0000745	So no, he may not be just an ordinary robot, but he's certainly not human, no matter how badly he wishes it so. I made him. I want him. End of story.
1DI0000746	Oh, I couldn't do that! It'd be a real blow to those nice folks in the Church.
1DI0000747	Besides, it's not like that bomb ever hurt anyone. Live and let live, right?
1DI0000748	By God, you're as annoying as you are clever. Very well. I'll tell you what you want to know, if it helps you locate my property.
1DI0000749	The duty of this particular unit was the hunting and capturing of other escaped androids. Yes, others have escaped.
1DI0000750	It's one of the side effects of having such an advanced A.I. Machines start to think for themselves. Fool themselves into believing they have rights.
1DI0000751	And so... this particular android may have believed he'd done something... wrong. Immoral.  And wanted to forget those deeds. Satisfied now?
1DI0000752	This particular android... Designation A3-21, is... different. Special. The most advanced synthetic humanoid I've ever developed.
1DI0000753	The others, like my escort Armitage there, are all older models. Easily replicated. Ah, but A3-21... it would take years to recreate him!
1DI0000754	So you see, this android MUST be located. At all costs. The others are all... acceptable losses. But A3-21, he is... irreplaceable.
1DI0000755	<bark>
1DI0000757	Nuh-uh. Door works fine. Computer's broke.
1DI0000758	Well, maybe not broke, but it sure don't work right. I turned it off because it was just wasting power.
1DI0000759	It's not safe, even for someone as brave as you. There's monsters back there.
1DI0000760	You don't want to go there. That's where the monsters are.
1DI0000761	We got pretty good at keeping them out. Probably better than you could do.
1DI0000762	We don't go there. It's bad back there. Ask Mayor if you really want to know.
1DI0000764	Yeah, I mean they pay well enough, I guess. What the hell do you care?
1DI0000765	That's easy! The AntAgonizer's suit makes her super-agile, but I guess her ants are pretty weak on their own. Just watch out for her royal guard.
1DI0000766	The Mechanist's robots are a lot tougher, and his suit makes him super-smart. I don't think he has any weaknesses.
1DI0000767	Well, maybe one. Since he's a good guy, he's not as ruthless as the AntAgonizer. Like, he'd never hurt an innocent like me... if he could help it.
1DI0000768	What? No! No children's book could possibly capture the true depth of the AntAgonizer!
1DI0000769	You're wrong. Humans are cruel, hurtful beasts! They can't be saved... we can't be...
1DI0000770	I can't... I can't go back. But I can't keep doing this. I can't be as bad as they were. Not if someone like you believes in me.
1DI0000771	Please... I think I've made some terrible mistakes. If you really think I still have a chance, just let me go.
1DI0000772	I'll give you the suit. No one ever has to see the AntAgonizer again. Just please, let me have another chance.
1DI0000774	I can't... I can't go back. But I can't keep doing this. I can't be as bad as they were.
1DI0000777	Is... Is that true? Have I really become a threat to the town? Do you really feel that way?
1DI0000778	Am I really the villain, here? Does this mean I should stop myself?
1DI0000779	I... I guess I could just give up my suit and stop being the Mechanist. But I couldn't face the town after causing that much trouble.
1DI0000780	Here, please. Take the suit. I don't want to think about it anymore.
1DI0000781	Is... Is that true? Have I really become a threat to the town?
1DI0000785	Is... Is that true? Have I really become a bigger problem for the town than her?
1DI0000789	Perhaps...
1DI0000790	But I'll snuff those chances soon enough. Now, my royal guard, kill this commoner!
1DI0000791	Why, I'm an inventor, a tinkerer, and a general genius of junk. One person's junk is another's treasure, you know.
1DI0000792	And traders bring in lots of junk, so I get dibs on anything particularly nifty. Sure, I don't have as much to sell, but it's more fun this way!
1DI0000793	Moira Brown, inventor, tinkerer, and general genius of junk. One person's junk is another's treasure, you know.
1DI0000794	My name's Moira Brown. I take care of basics around here. Nothing fancy.
1DI0000795	I used to work on all sorts of things, but that seems like it was a long time ago.
1DI0000796	<pant> <pant>
1DI0000797	<whine> <whine>
1DI0000798	Well, it's a dangerous place out there in the Wastes, right? People could really use a compilation of good advice. Like a Wasteland Survival Guide!
1DI0000799	For that, I need an assistant to test my theories. I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt because of a mistake. Nobody's ever happy when that happens.
1DI0000800	No... Then they just yell a lot. At me. With mean, mean words.
1DI0000801	I'm still working on that survival guide that I told you about. Great idea, but I need help to test some of the theories.
1DI0000802	Oh, did you reconsider helping me out? Because that'd be super awesome!
1DI0000803	Oh, sure. I mean, if you're going to be my assistant, it's in my best interest that you stay alive, right?
1DI0000804	Besides, I guess the original owner isn't coming back to pick it up, so you're the closest thing to an inheritor. Here!
1DI0000805	I'm still working out the kinks in the first chapter. I'm calling it, "Survive."
1DI0000806	It's about dealing with the day-to-day needs out there. Finding food and water, avoiding hazards like radiation and traps. That sort of stuff.
1DI0000807	Oh, I'm writing up the second chapter right now. It's called, "Thrive."
1DI0000808	It covers the various ways to get ahead and stay ahead of the various predators out there. And how to patch yourself up if you don't!
1DI0000809	In the last stretch, now! The last chapter's going to be called, "Revive."
1DI0000810	It's all about how we can rebuild society and humanity, learning how to use old tech, preserving knowledge, building communities, and so on.
1DI0000811	It's a little ambitious, yeah. But why aim low, right?
1DI0000812	Oh, I've been doing a bit of research into ways to communicate with Centaurs. I mean, they should be able to talk, since they're mostly human.
1DI0000813	Or, at least, parts of them are mostly human. Sort of.
1DI0000814	I was considering a new way to make irradiated ground fertile again with some mixture of brahmin dung and crushed rad-away.
1DI0000815	Of course, even if that works, the real problem would be irrigating the fields. And that'd require water.
1DI0000816	I've been contemplating the possibilities of domesticating Mole Rats. I know it seems a little gross, but milk is milk and meat is meat, right?
1DI0000817	I was playing with an idea for an elevated brahmin feeding system, so they don't have to strain their necks so much.
1DI0000818	But the caravan master said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
1DI0000819	I guess that applies to improvements, too. Oh well.
1DI0000820	Just taking care of business, as always.
1DI0000821	Sorry, I can't really talk now. I've got lots of work to do. Lots of dull, dull work.
1DI0000822	That damn Roy Phillips won't take no for an answer. Keeps showing up, looking for a handout. He and his kind aren't wanted. End of story.
1DI0000823	If I were a betting man, I'd place a stack of caps on him trying something violent soon.
1DI0000824	And that would make Tenpenny nervous. I don't like it when Tenpenny gets nervous.
1DI0000825	But I can't spare the manpower to go hunt down Roy Phillips and his band of misfits, or I'd gladly end this thing once and for all.
1DI0000826	If they got in here, they'd get their filth over everything. You can smell them a mile away!
1DI0000827	I hope they come back and get killed by security.
1DI0000828	They were told they can't live here. But those zombies are too stupid to understand.
1DI0000829	They live in their own filth, squatting in the nearby metro tunnel. Security keeps shooting them, but they keep coming back.
1DI0000830	Don't you worry about any such thing, sir. Care to wet your whistle?
1DI0000831	I'm sure it will end in bloodshed. It's serious business, comrade.
1DI0000832	They're living in the nearby tunnels. They scare me!
1DI0000833	Why doesn't somebody do something!
1DI0000834	Are you going to do something about the problem, or not?
1DI0000835	Some Ghouls moved into the nearby Metro tunnel. There's a bunch of the so-called Feral Ghouls in there, but a handful seem the sociable type.
1DI0000836	I've tried explaining to my fellow tenants that not all Ghouls are monsters. But they don't seem to care.
1DI0000837	The intelligent ones should stay away from our trigger happy protectors. If there're enough feral ones though, they could overwhelm security.
1DI0000838	We have the situation... contained.
1DI0000839	Chief Gustavo assures us that he's increased the number of the security team, and will kill any zombies on sight.
1DI0000840	We haven't discussed this already? Apparently there's a pack of zombies living in the tunnels. Gustavo says he has it under control.
1DI0000841	On the bright side, it's given me another reason to hit the drink!
1DI0000842	There's a pack of zombies living nearby in some old tunnel. They asked to move in. Naturally, they were told to go to hell.
1DI0000843	Gustavo's hired some additional goons. Seems to be working. Still, makes one a bit fidgety having those loathsome creatures around.
1DI0000844	I wouldn't even want them as slaves!
1DI0000845	Again with the Ghouls! It's all anyone will gossip about. I can't help thinking about them... doing things to us. Let's talk about something else.
1DI0000846	My current theory is that the destructive disease of the Ghoul condition will always eventually render him little more than a mindless killer.
1DI0000847	The proverbial Wasteland "zombie"  with a predilection for raw human flesh.
1DI0000848	They can't be cured. And there's nothing to alleviate the symptoms. All in all, it seems rather sad, really.
1DI0000849	I had thought about it, but some of these Wasteland traders... well, they aren't exactly the organizational type.
1DI0000850	It'd take a pretty savvy businessman to make it worth their while to work together. Frankly, I'm not sure even I'm up to the task!
1DI0000851	Sure thing! Which one would you like to talk about?
1DI0000853	<bark!>
1DI0000854	<whimper>
1DI0000855	Nope. Sorry. Protector Casdin says the locals around here are barely smarter than the Mole Rats.
1DI0000856	But Morgan said we might have some work for an outsider. Talk with her, if you're really interested.
1DI0000859	We aren't recruiting, kid. Old sap Lyons might trust walk-ins, but we don't.
1DI0000860	But if you want to help out... well, we might be able to work out a deal.
1DI0000861	You bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you a finder's fee, based on the device. But Protector Casdin would have to okay it, first.
1DI0000862	That's Charon. Let's just say... well, he's a loyal employee. Don't mess with me, and he won't mess with you.
1DI0000863	That's behind the Back Door! The Back Door is my job, and I do it really well!
1DI0000864	See what happens is, Mayor says he wants the door open. Then I help him because I'm good at it. It takes two of us to do it.
1DI0000865	But only Mayor can say it's okay. You gotta talk to him, and then I'll help him.
1DI0000866	Not much, really. Mayor has us steer clear of the door to Murder Pass, just in case. If you go near it, you can hear them howling.
1DI0000867	Can't hear much around the other door, though. I guess maybe there aren't as many back there. Doesn't matter much, though.
1DI0000868	Yeah, I know that place. Yep, sure do. Monsters back there. Big, scary monsters. Lots of them. Tons, even.
1DI0000869	Are you going there? Are you? Are you gonna shoot 'em dead? I bet you are. That'll be so cool. Unless they eat your face. They do that, you know.
1DI0000870	That's where the monsters come from. We don't go back there. It's called Murder Pass for a reason, you know?
1DI0000871	If you go that way, you're probably gonna get hurt. I can patch you up as long as it's not real bad.
1DI0000872	I don't know what that is, mister.
1DI0000873	Oh! Sorry, I guess I got ahead of myself, huh? Maggie's nine, sweetest little girl you'd ever care to meet. We take care of each other.
1DI0000874	I ain't never had a daughter, but if I did, I'd want her to be Maggie. I took her in when her parents got killed by Raiders. That was two years ago.
1DI0000875	It was a pretty bad scene. Small settlement up north. I'd stopped in to trade some salvage, and the whole place had been wiped out.
1DI0000876	I found Maggie hiding under a bed, in the same room where her parents had been butchered. We've been together ever since.                
1DI0000877	For those answers I shall direct you to my husband, Confessor Cromwell.
1DI0000878	Why? Why? Look around you. This is the good ol' USA. Sure, she looks a little bit different these days, but you're still on American soil.
1DI0000879	And even if you were born in some underground Vault, you were born under the United States, which makes you an American.
1DI0000880	And it's your duty and my duty to support our country and our president, no matter what. Understand?
1DI0000881	Because American is the greatest country on Earth... actually... it might be the only country on Earth now.
1DI0000882	Take on the role of the Pint-Sized Slasher, and kill everyone on Tranquility Lane. I'll be waiting.
1DI0000883	Mabel Henderson needs to die. But in a creative, fun sort of way. I'm sure you'll think of something.
1DI0000884	Visit the Rockwells. Observe their happy marriage, and then destroy it. But don't kill them; that'd spoil the fun.
1DI0000885	You need to go find Timmy Neusbaum, and make him cry. It'll be funny. You'll see.
1DI0000886	What? Now that's a ridiculous thing to say. You kids need to find some different games to play!
1DI0000887	Now that's not funny. Not one bit.
1DI0000889	What? No I'm not!
1DI0000890	Red was taken with the others in the last attack by the Super Mutants. She's the doctor. If you rescue her, I'm sure she'll give you your money.
1DI0000891	But... you probably shouldn't tell Sticky... it would crush him if he thought Red was in danger, or possibly dead.
1DI0000892	Those damn Muties took her with the others when they raided the town last. If you rescue her, I'm sure she'll pay you whatever Sticky owes.
1DI0000893	But... just don't tell Sticky, okay? He just got here and we want him to have a little hope before we tell him how awful things are.
1DI0000894	Red was the only decent person in this hellhole, and the Mutants took her in the raid. That Sticky is a doofus, but I bet Red will cover his debts.
1DI0000895	But... you probably shouldn't tell Sticky Red's gone. I don't want one more cry baby wandering around here causing a ruckus. It's bad enough already.
1DI0000896	The Super Mutants took Red along with the others. She was the only person that really ever listened to me.
1DI0000897	Don't tell Sticky, though. He's liable to kill himself if he knew Red was gone.  And that would conflict with my own suicide plans.
1DI0000898	What? But you said you'd take me. This bites. You really suck, you know that?! I hope a mutant bites your face off and you die! I hate you!
1DI0000899	Long ago, I was a mere citizen like yourself. Beyond a talent for computers, I had no power in this world.
1DI0000900	But then the AntAgonizer attacked, and killed someone very dear to me. The damage was too much for me to fix her. But I knew what I had to do.
1DI0000901	That tragedy burned away the weakness of my previous life, and in the fires of revenge, the Mechanist was forged!
1DI0000902	Lies! Unlike the rest of you peasants, I was born for greatness. I was never meant to crawl in the muck of mankind!
1DI0000903	But the ants knew my destiny. When I was but a larva, they rescued me from my filthy human family.
1DI0000904	They saw my nobility, and they saved me from a human life of fear and pain. Now, I will lead them to their glorious future!
1DI0000911	Oh, how marvelous! Please, tell me what happened.
1DI0000912	Come now, the faster you tell me... the faster I can provide promised payment for your services!
1DI0000914	Please, don't insult my intelligence. You didn't even enter the Hatchery!
1DI0000915	Now, I believe you have a job to do?
1DI0000916	What?! How could you do such a thing?
1DI0000917	How marvelous! Here is the promised Lab Coat. I'm certain you'll find it quite useful.
1DI0000918	Which injection did you want? Will it be the Ant Sight or Ant Might?
1DI0000919	How marvelous! Which injection did you want? Will it be the Ant Sight or Ant Might?
1DI0000920	You didn't honor the agreement, so our bargain is null and void. Good day.
1DI0000921	Naw, go ahead. I like talking to you.
1DI0000922	You will? Really? Thanks a whole lot!
1DI0000923	My house is the one closest to the huge sign and the old diner.
1DI0000924	Please... find my pappa and make him come back!
1DI0000925	Whoa! That's a bad place. My dad said to never, ever go down there.
1DI0000926	It's in the southeast part of Grayditch, near the big buildings.
1DI0000927	Interesting. It seems they wish to enter into some kind of agreement.
1DI0000928	I guess it's better than pointing my gun down that ramp all day and hiding inside at night.
1DI0000929	Let Vance know he's got a deal... we'll do it. I'll speak to the others, I'm sure they'll agree with me.
1DI0000930	Excellent! I knew you would serve as an ambassador for us in good faith.
1DI0000931	I will dispatch Alan to Arefu immediately to help serve as their guardian and honor my end of the agreement.
1DI0000932	Your efforts surpass those of the average human. In fact, I feel almost like you are a member of our flock.
1DI0000933	If you ever wish to learn our ways, you have but to ask.
1DI0000937	To be a vampire is a life commitment. It is not achieved by my words, it is something you earn by your own will and sincere meditation.
1DI0000938	Sadly, I cannot fully make you one of us, but I can teach you how the life blood of others brings us regenerative powers.
1DI0000939	Since your body lacks the way to extract blood as we do, you must find alternative sources for your nourishment.
1DI0000940	Drink deep of the blood, allow not a drop to spill. Feel the warmth as it spreads inside you.
1DI0000941	You are becoming one with the life force of another. They lend a part of themselves to you. For a brief moment, you are two entities becoming one.
1DI0000942	Allow the feelings to course through your body as you partake of the blood... feel it empower you and make you stronger.
1DI0000943	Once you have done this deed, only then will you know what it is like to be a vampire.
1DI0000944	There is no more I can teach you.
1DI0000945	Use what little I have given you well, and carry that knowledge with honor.
1DI0000946	Biding our time, making plans, getting ready. Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes can't keep us out of that tower forever.
1DI0000947	We got rights. And we'll take them if they aren't given to us.
1DI0000950	What about it?
1DI0000952	Roy is coming up with a plan to get us into that tower. Tenpenny's. Says it's only a matter of time.
1DI0000953	He's strong like that. He never gives up. The kind of guy who makes things happen, Roy is. That's why the others follow him.
1DI0000954	Me, I just like the way he looks at me. Makes me feel pretty again. I'd go anywhere with him.
1DI0000955	I've been stomping around with Roy and his gang of misfits. Roy's a no nonsense, take no prisoners kinda guy.
1DI0000956	He heard about this Tenpenny asshole, and now he's trying to get us in that tower. He's hatching some kind of plan to kill all those bigot bastards.
1DI0000957	Believe it or not, I used to vacation there.
1DI0000958	Tenpenny is always on time with the money. And we get fairly comfortable digs with side benefits.
1DI0000959	It's a piece of Utopia jutting up from the Wasteland. Tenpenny is a true visionary. I do my part to assist him in unfolding his Master Plan.
1DI0000960	This tower is the symbol of true progress in this world! People are dying to get in here. Just ask those Ghouls.
1DI0000961	It's a great place to live. I've always dreamed of giving people fresh meals, and a place to relax and enjoy a good conversation or two.
1DI0000962	Tenpenny gave me a place to do that. I'm greatly indebted to him for that.
1DI0000963	Well it's a great place to live... IF you don't mind GHOULS breathing down your neck.
1DI0000964	It's THE place to live. The only place one finds any modicum of civilization and breeding.
1DI0000965	Of course those Ghouls are trying to move in here. Can you fancy that? Disgusting zombies? Living in a place like this? Ahahaha! Really now!
1DI0000966	Things haven't been the same since those Ghouls showed up. Has everyone on edge.
1DI0000967	Tenpenny is a classy place. Just look at me. Look at my shop. Can't find top shelf class like that anywhere else.
1DI0000968	People are healthy here, they eat well and have a strong roof over their head.
1DI0000969	Only those deserving to live here can afford it. And let me tell you, those who do, live in style!
1DI0000970	Well comrade, things are great. The best of the best have made a community here.
1DI0000971	Well, there is that problem with the Ghouls. But I think it'll be solved soon enough.
1DI0000972	It's very clean and safe here. Well, mostly safe. They say those Ghouls won't get in. But I don't know.
1DI0000973	Beats living out there in Wasteland, trust me. See, I'm not like these other puffed up fogies. I earned my way into privilege. I worked to get here.
1DI0000974	Well, until recently the only danger you ever faced in this fine establishment, was bumping into all the bloated egos floating around.
1DI0000975	But now there's a group of Ghouls nearby. I've tried explaining that they don't ALL want to eat you - though SOME do, of course.
1DI0000976	Problem is, it's hard to tell which is which. Chief Gustavo has initiated a shoot first and ask later policy. If they're smart, they'll stay away.
1DI0000977	Bring me one of those VIPs and I'll let you up into Paradise Falls.
1DI0000978	But, since Eulogy's got me on watchdog duty all the time, I don't get to make much commission.
1DI0000979	If you round up any slaves, I'll gladly split the commission with you.
1DI0000980	But don't get any wise ideas. I'm the guy who monitors the slave collar radio signals, and notes any new "arrivals."
1DI0000982	Let's head for Rivet City. It's a bit of a hike, but I want to get back there so I can start spending my caps!
1DI0000983	Don't worry, I know exactly where it is... we should make it in one piece.
1DI0000985	Let's get the hell out of here. Time to get paid, then get drunk!
1DI0000986	There should be an elevator to the upper level somewhere around here.
1DI0000987	What else, let's get the document!
1DI0000988	Look, if you think you can reason with him, go right ahead. My advice? Blow its damn head off. It's obviously malfunctioning.
1DI0000989	Either way, I'll let you decide. Anything that gets us closer to the prize is fine by me.
1DI0000990	Inside the Archives Strongroom should be the Declaration. I have no idea what's inside. That's the only part of the plans I never found.
1DI0000991	If you can find and disable the turret generator, most of the turrets in the East Wing should go offline.
1DI0000992	If you're any good at hacking or lockpicking, we can get through the maintenance doors or utility gates.
1DI0000993	There should be shortcuts like it all over the East Wing.
1DI0000994	They kept the Declaration in the Archives Strongroom that's at the end of the East wing here. We'll have to make our way to it.
1DI0000995	It looks like we're in the Sub-Basement hub. I think the door we want is the one to the East. Never been this far in, only saw it on blueprints.
1DI0000996	There's a cargo lift right here in the Rotunda. It should take us directly down to the lower levels.
1DI0000997	I was hacking the system right before we were attacked. The code should be "We the People."
1DI0000998	Okay, let's try this slowly. When you and your daddy left, there were problems. Those problems were bad.
1DI0000999	Amata and some others said we should try opening the door and going outside more. The Overseer said that was bad, too, and he got angry.
1DI0001000	Now, just about everyone's angry down here. And things are still bad. Really bad.
1DI0001001	You will? Thank goodness for that. No matter what I say, he just doesn't listen. He just spends all day up in his office.
1DI0001002	But you've actually been outside, so you can tell him what it's like with firsthand experience!
1DI0001003	Just... Please don't do anything rash or hurt him, all right?
1DI0001006	Just... Please be careful.
1DI0001007	I'm okay, I just worry about how long we have before someone does something rash.
1DI0001008	Huh. I wasn't expecting to hear that!
1DI0001009	Okay, here's the deal: You go and get them to quit this Vault-opening nonsense, and I'll let you leave. Heck, I'll even throw in some pay.
1DI0001010	Hmm. You always have held a certain sway with them that neither I nor my guards have enjoyed.
1DI0001011	All right, then. Go to my daughter and convince her to leave this rebellious nonsense behind.
1DI0001012	You're lucky I'm in a good mood. Get to it.
1DI0001013	All right, but I expect results. Get to work.
1DI0001014	I heard one of the guards talking about some sort of plan to raid Amata and the rest of us.
1DI0001015	I didn't hear anything else, but I think he read it on the security terminal, so maybe you can find more there. I'm sure it's bad news for us all.
1DI0001016	Now that the old fool is finally dead, we can have some real leadership around here: me.
1DI0001017	There's an election for the next president.
1DI0001018	Don't look so surprised. Can't you see this is a Republic?
1DI0001019	The Department of Tourism usually handles all questions for outsiders. Make it quick.
1DI0001020	Shawna runs the museum, not me. What the hell do you want?
1DI0001021	Sure! The Museum of Dave is happy to answer any questions on behalf of the Republic of Dave's Office of Tourism!
1DI0001022	Um, okay. As long as President Daddy says it's all right.
1DI0001026	Jessica is dead.
1DI0001027	Shawna is dead. How could something like this have happened?
1DI0001028	Rosie is dead. Can't honestly say I care very much.
1DI0001029	Sure, honey, but don't make it too long or Dave will start wondering why we're talking.
1DI0001030	You should talk to Dave, but okay.
1DI0001031	Well, Bob is being even more of a jerk than usual.
1DI0001032	I give a tour of the Museum of Dave every day at 2. You should check it out.
1DI0001033	No, there won't be much going on now that the election is over.
1DI0001034	Well, I'm trying to think up a good new name for this place now that it's mine.
1DI0001035	Every once in a while I hear something like a man screaming coming from the Capitol Building.
1DI0001036	Well, there's an election coming up. Dave is up for re-election again.
1DI0001037	Dave is dead. We're not sure what will even happen to this place anymore.
1DI0001038	Bob is dead. Nobody deserves to die that young.
1DI0001039	Rosie is dead. It's too bad, she was always so nice.
1DI0001040	Negative. No Super Mutants, civilians or traveling salesmen allowed.
1DI0001041	Which are you?
1DI0001042	That's an affirmative. You're clear to enter. But I still don't like it. Or you.
1DI0001043	Gob? Yes, of course!
1DI0001044	He's my son... well, not really, not like you would think of a son. We Ghouls don't really work like that, but I love him like he's my own!
1DI0001045	Do you know him? Have you seen him? Is he alright?
1DI0001046	You better choose your next words really carefully, cause you're startin' to piss me off...
1DI0001047	Oh... well... it's not so bad, I guess. Once you get used to it... but, it's not like before.
1DI0001048	I used to be pretty, you know! Everyone used to come around all the time!
1DI0001049	People stop wanting to be around you, though... when it starts to happen... when you start to change, I mean...
1DI0001050	I wasn't always like this. I was a goddamn scientist. We were doing great things. Amazing things.
1DI0001051	Sure sacrifices were required. Some people got hurt. But we were making real progress. But then those goddamn bombs dropped.
1DI0001052	Karma's a real bitch. You'd be wise to remember that.
1DI0001053	I've been drinking this irradiated shit and... I can't do it. I just throw it up now. I need purified water... please...
1DI0001054	I provide food, drinks, and discreet chemicals to discerning customers around the Wasteland. I help ease the suffering of my fellow man. For a price.
1DI0001055	I don't have a home office, exactly, but I organize much of my trade with Ernest Roe, in Canterbury Commons.
1DI0001056	I scour the wasteland for the very best pieces of trash, the height of detritus, and the veritable pick of the litter. It's all valuable to someone.
1DI0001057	And I always make sure to make my rounds through Canterbury Commons. Their mayor, Roe, always has a place for a clever junkman like myself.
1DI0001058	See, the world's a dangerous and unbalanced place. So I realized, the only way to bring peace was to make sure that everyone could be dangerous!
1DI0001059	So, with a little bit of help from the mayor of Canterbury Commons, I set up this caravan. I can't give the weapons away for free, but I come close!
1DI0001060	My caravan sells clothing and armor, to decorate and protect the body while it endures the ravages of the physical world.
1DI0001061	My travels take me from Canterbury Commons to where there is true need of this protection. After all, this is what they'll pay the most for.
1DI0001062	What's been going on? Well, let's see. For years, we've been draining our resources defending the ungrateful residents of this no man's land.
1DI0001063	Most of my best friends have either been ripped apart by Super Mutants or left to join the Outcasts.
1DI0001064	And now an enemy we faced more than thirty years ago has resurfaced, and their tech is still better than ours.
1DI0001065	What's been going on with you?
1DI0001066	Okay, okay. Let me talk real careful for the slow folks.
1DI0001067	I was once a man a long time ago named Harold. Something in me changed and a weird little tree started growing right out of my head.
1DI0001068	It kept getting bigger until I ended up stuck inside. When people would ask about it, I decided to name it Bob. You know, like a friend or something.
1DI0001069	Sometimes I call him Herbert instead of Bob, because I get bored and I think it's funny. So long story short, call me Harold!
1DI0001071	You've definitely proven your worth. I'll make sure to tell our people on patrol that you're a friend of the Outcasts.
1DI0001072	Look. Keep your bullshit judgments to yourself, man. Just don't tell Jenny or Andy and we'll be fine.
1DI0001073	I just started, but so far... so good.
1DI0001074	Things are pretty hard, but it's getting better. Thanks again, you really talked some sense into me.
1DI0001075	Dammit! Who told you- I mean... I have no idea what you're talking about.
1DI0001076	It's not any of your business, remember?
1DI0001077	Didn't you figure it out? The dog. So loyal, so trusting... so annoying.
1DI0001078	I simply made him what he always was...
1DI0001079	He's been right here the whole time, and you were too dense to figure it out. The dog, you see.
1DI0001080	Man's best friend. But now you've taken all my friends from me...
1DI0001081	Yes, I'm sure he's fine. No doubt when you leave the simulation, he'll be waiting for you.
1DI0001082	But there's no one waiting for me...
1DI0001083	Well sure I can, sweetie!
1DI0001084	Let me just go light the oven to get it warming up.
1DI0001085	But, but... I don't want to go away! I don't want to leave my mommy!
1DI0001086	[crying]
1DI0001087	I've been with Doctor Li for about ten years now. She needed an assistant, and I needed something to do.
1DI0001088	It was either this or wind up dead in a ditch someplace, y'know?
1DI0001089	I have worked for Doctor Li for many years. She has been good to me, helped me through some difficult times.
1DI0001090	I had little purpose in my life before she helped me. So now I help her in return. I am no scientist, but I am good with machines.
1DI0001091	Unlike some people around here, I stuck with Doctor Li through it all. I was the last one to leave when we finally gave up.
1DI0001092	Now your daddy shows up out of the blue, and suddenly I have to drop everything to come back and help pick up the pieces.
1DI0001093	Who, me? Oh, nothing special. I grew up in Rivet City, and was always interested in what the scientists were doing there.
1DI0001094	Doctor Li took me under her wing, and taught me everything I know. Dan and I were out in the field when we got the call to come back.
1DI0001095	Check the map in the lab for reference, if you like. The Vault is to the west of the city, far out in the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0001096	Remember that you won't be able to just walk in, due to the radiation. You'll have to try and find another way to access the vault.
1DI0001097	I expect that Lamplight Caverns is your best chance for success.
1DI0001098	Is it now?
1DI0001099	That's an unexpected but welcome surprise. Hopefully it'll reduce their ability to defend themselves.
1DI0001100	With that in mind, we need to revise our strategy.
1DI0001101	You have?
1DI0001102	I mean of course you have, it's an awesome place. Well, enough talking, let's get a move on. You ARE taking me to Big Town, right?
1DI0001103	It's east of Little Lamplight. Come on, let's go there. It's not that far away. We'll be there in no time!
1DI0001104	Aha! That's the spirit, chum! You seem quite capable - you got to me after all. You can be my official sidekick!
1DI0001105	I'm afraid I don't have another suit, though.
1DI0001106	But we can deal with that problem later. We've got bigger ants to fry! Now, how to proceed?
1DI0001107	Yes, you would join me in fighting the Mechanist! Him and his little tin men, made by humans to kill humans for other humans.
1DI0001108	Would you turn your back on humanity's failings? Would you join the ant court in our destruction of the Mechanist and his hubris?
1DI0001109	Yup, you've done a great job! I just need to add in the section on how to cook rat, and this chapter's done.
1DI0001110	Here, for your services, I've saved up quite a few Stimpaks. Of course, you may need them: we've still got two more chapters to go.
1DI0001111	Absolutely! I'm glad to finish it up, but I'll bet you're even happier, right?
1DI0001112	Just one last chapter, now. And it's much safer, I promise!
1DI0001113	Oh, and here's your payment - two big boxes full of ammo. Think of it as insurance, in case the next chapter isn't as safe as I predict.
1DI0001114	It certainly is. With that last bit of info, I'm all done!
1DI0001115	For all your hard work, I want you to have this Mini Nuke. I kept meaning to use it to dig a well, but honestly, it just makes me nervous.
1DI0001116	Now, I just need to do a few last tweaks and it'll be ready to print and distribute! Thanks for all the help!
1DI0001117	Correct, and it's looking very smart. Very smart, indeed! They'll be dazzled by our intelligence!
1DI0001119	Correct, as always! And your feedback's really led to a very smartly written book. Maybe too smart for some folks, I worry.
1DI0001120	Of course, if the reader can't be bothered to understand something important as a book on how to stay alive, then what can we do, huh?
1DI0001121	And in case those readers blame you for their ignorance, here's your payment: two big boxes of ammo. Now, on to the next chapter!
1DI0001122	Yes, that concludes our exceptional expert endeavor! I have to admit, I was worried it would go over some peoples' heads, but it should be fine.
1DI0001125	Yup. It's looking like it'll be a real tough book for real tough guys. And real tough gals, too, of course!
1DI0001127	You bet. Your feedback is just the stuff for that rough-and-tumble, survive-anything sort of feel!
1DI0001128	Of course, readers who aren't already rough-and-tumble may have a hard time dealing with it. But I'm sure they'll pick up survival as they go.
1DI0001129	Nothing to concern ourselves over, I'm sure. Here's your payment - nothing too complex, just lots and lots of ammo. Now, on to the next chapter!
1DI0001130	Yup, that's the last bit for the toughest survival guide in the Wastes! Survivors of the world, rejoice! And everyone else, too!
1DI0001133	It most certainly does. And if I keep writing in the style of some of your reports, this is going to be one mighty slick book!
1DI0001135	Oh, it's very real, and very complete. I think I'm really capturing that sly and stylish way you have of getting around problems out there!
1DI0001136	Of course, I worry I'll write with too much style and not enough substance. So keep bringing me back good research, and that won't be a problem!
1DI0001137	Here's your payment: I know ammo isn't really your style, but think of it as excellent bartering material. Now, on to the next chapter!
1DI0001138	Smooth, suave, and done with a smile. I swear I picked up a few pointers from your style, myself!
1DI0001141	It definitely is. I'm trying to put that same great sense of humor you've got into the book. Keep it up, and it'll inform and entertain!
1DI0001143	Oh, you. Of course we are. And I think I'm really capturing that snide wit of yours. So, for all your snippiness, I think it'll help the book.
1DI0001144	Still, I can put up with plenty of your little jabs, as long as the research is good.
1DI0001145	And, yes, you'll still get paid. Here: nothing says loving like big boxes of ammunition, right? Now, on to the next chapter?
1DI0001146	Well, lucky for you, we're done! And for all your nasty attitude, I think the quips made it a lot more entertaining to read. That's bound to help.
1DI0001149	Oh no! What happened?
1DI0001151	It used to be kinda' nice. No one bothered us there, I guess because we were so close to D.C.
1DI0001152	There was seven of us living there in tall, old brick houses. I think I'm the last one left. Those things took everyone else.
1DI0001153	Indeed? Tell me what you've learned from the Laws. What do you think we are?
1DI0001154	We are the remnants of society, cast aside like the picked bones of a hunter's feast.
1DI0001155	Men of science would call us cannibals, eaters of human flesh. Society labels us as monsters, demons and the unclean.
1DI0001156	I've brought my flock here to shelter under the sun-baked sand of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
1DI0001157	No, I can see it in your eyes. You do not yet possess that spark of realization. Continue speaking to my people.
1DI0001158	Each of us is required to speak one of the Laws when we hold our ceremonies. I say the First Law.
1DI0001159	"Feast not on the flesh; consume only the blood. This is our strength."
1DI0001160	When we all gather in the common area, Vance gives his speeches and then we each have like a Law to say.
1DI0001161	Mine is "Bear not the child; welcome only the exile. This is our fate." Kinda cool, huh?
1DI0001162	Oh wait... Vance told me I was supposed to say something special when asked that... from his teachings.
1DI0001163	Oh, right! The Third Law is "Feed not for pleasure; partake only to nourish. This is our dignity." Whew... almost forgot it again.
1DI0001164	When Vance stands on that balcony and starts mouthing off like some kind of preacher, it makes me wanna puke.
1DI0001165	But if I wanna keep this place stocked I gotta have his permission, so I learned his Fifth Law.
1DI0001166	"Kill not our kindred; slay only the enemy. This is our justice." Pretty silly if you ask me.
1DI0001167	Well, usually everyone has a rule or something they have to yell out at our gang meetings.
1DI0001168	Since I guard the door all the time, I don't have to do that. I mean, they're good laws and all, but it feels stupid yelling that stuff out loud.
1DI0001169	Well, Vance makes each of us remember a rule, and when we all gather in the common area, we have to say it out loud. Kinda weird.
1DI0001170	So, my Law is the fourth one. "Seek not the sun's light; embrace only the shadows. This is our refuge."
1DI0001171	I haven't seen any of the Wests since we were told to head indoors.
1DI0001172	Nope. Everyone stays inside, except Evan King of course.
1DI0001173	If I recall he and the boys are probably at the lake fishing. Those rapscallions! There's no telling what monkeyshines they'll get into next!
1DI0001174	I had always assumed if a human happened upon our home, it would be for the purpose of our extermination.
1DI0001175	It appears my fears were ill-placed. It is a pleasant surprise to meet someone as amenable as yourself.
1DI0001176	Very well. I will allow you to speak to Ian. Perhaps you can help him come to grips with his greatest enemy. Himself.
1DI0001177	I believe I was very clear when I said you are not welcome to see him.
1DI0001178	Ah yes, my newest charge. What would you want with him?
1DI0001179	I'm afraid Vance has him in isolation and there is no way I'm going to override Vance's orders.
1DI0001180	He's a good kid. I think Vance will set him along the correct path soon... like he did for all of us.
1DI0001181	Like I said, he's in isolation. It's his time to meditate and reflect.
1DI0001182	Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
1DI0001183	Poor kid... he looks like he could use another friend.
1DI0001184	Nope. Like I told ya, Vance has him in meditation right now. No one's supposed to be in there.
1DI0001185	I don't have any authority here. I'm pretty new myself.
1DI0001186	Justin's been trying to talk to Ian; make him feel better. Maybe you should speak to him.
1DI0001187	Do I look like a fucking babysitter? I don't know where he is. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.
1DI0001188	Ian, Ian, Ian! Is that all you've got to say? Sheesh.
1DI0001189	Ian? What do you want from him?
1DI0001190	No, just that Vance said he isn't to be disturbed while he's in meditation.
1DI0001191	Oh my goodness? What is it?
1DI0001192	Wh-what? No! Oh my God! I should never have left. I knew it... now they're all dead!
1DI0001193	Wait a second... What about my brother?
1DI0001196	Yeah, supposed to be some kinda gang or something. Big deal. They wouldn't dare come around Paradise Falls.
1DI0001197	It saddens me to lose one of my flock, but I believe everyone has to follow their own path.
1DI0001198	All I was attempting to do was guide him. Now it seems that responsibility has fallen upon you. I hope you will be more successful.
1DI0001199	Please, I want you to take this. Consider it as an apology to you for all the hardships you had to endure finding this place.
1DI0001200	Goodbye, human. Our time together has been rather... educational.
1DI0001201	When you first arrived I was suspicious of your intentions. I can see now it was an error in judgement.
1DI0001202	I can assure you Ian will be well cared for and safe with the Family.
1DI0001205	Simms is an idiot. He prides himself on his position as mayor and sheriff of this scrapyard.
1DI0001206	Is that so? He isn't man enough to do it himself? Sends a boy to do his dirty work. You think you got what it takes?
1DI0001207	Is that so? He isn't man enough to do it himself? Sends a girl to do his dirty work. You think you got what it takes?
1DI0001208	Figures. He's Tenpenny's adorable lapdog, isn't he? So what's your angle in all this?
1DI0001209	Please don't hurt me!
1DI0001210	Well? what are you waiting for?
1DI0001211	Most of the people in here will just get themselves killed out there. You know that better than anyone. But down here, they've got a safe life.
1DI0001212	And while we're down here, I'm in charge. Like the G.O.A.T. said: "To whom do we owe everything you have, including our lives?"
1DI0001213	The Overseer! And that's me!
1DI0001214	There's no way you could have gone there and gotten back already.
1DI0001215	It's got to take at least a day to get there and back. Now get going!
1DI0001216	I appreciate the landmine, but there's just no way you could have gotten to Minefield and back already!
1DI0001217	I mean, it's got to take at least a day or so to get there and back! So get going!
1DI0001218	Oh, great! And you look like it went fine! So, how was it?
1DI0001219	My very own landmine! Just what I've always wanted. Well, always since I sent you out on this, anyway.
1DI0001220	Now, tell me all about it. What was it like going through there? What's it like disarming a landmine?
1DI0001221	Do you think I suddenly lost track of time or something? There's no way you've gone there and back in the blink of an eye like that!
1DI0001222	Really? Oh, that's a shame. I guess it was an obvious place for people to get food, so it all got taken long ago, huh?
1DI0001223	Still, good work checking it out! And have some food as thanks for the work. It's a shame you didn't find any, there.
1DI0001224	Oh, come on. You barely even left! I can't imagine you tested it on reasonable number of subjects so quickly. It can't have been a good sample size.
1DI0001225	Excellent! Finally, mankind will have a way to shoo away those annoying pests without resorting to cruelty or violence!
1DI0001226	I'll just take that back for my final studies. Oh, but here! I've got lots of leftover chems from the testing. Maybe some of them are your style?
1DI0001227	Oh, come on! You weren't even searching for a full day! You can't just give up on knowledge like that so fast!
1DI0001228	Really? All of it? Not even a single, tattered paperback? Oh, that's terrible. Just like the Library of Alexandria County. What a loss to the world.
1DI0001229	But... I guess I promised you some pay, didn't I? Here's some caps. But it's nothing compared to the wealth of knowledge we've all lost.
1DI0001230	Oh, come on. Now you're just being silly. There's no way you went down to Rivet City and came back in less than a day.
1DI0001231	It is? I've never heard of anything like that! I don't even know anything in books about that sort of thing. Unless...
1DI0001232	Oh my goodness! Do you think it's originally from Atlantis? Or maybe Mu? Maybe they started the war? I never would have guessed that without you!
1DI0001233	This could change everything! Here, have your pay... our book is going to be huge!
1DI0001234	I see you've got some of our Power Armor there. I'll just take that off your hands.
1DI0001235	I'm sure you just found it in the Wastes and you're returning it to us, right? Because you'd have to be a real moron to try to turn it in for pay.
1DI0001236	Now, let's see what else you've got.
1DI0001237	Let's see what you've got.
1DI0001238	Oh, I haven't got nearly the experience in the Wastes that you do. If I tried half of these things, I'd get my head blown off!
1DI0001239	At least you look like you can really handle yourself out there. All I'm good at is coming up with the ideas and fiddling with junk for caravans.
1DI0001240	Well, it'll help humanity rebuild, right? I mean, who doesn't want to help humanity?
1DI0001241	Besides, it's bound to work out better than some of my other projects. I mean, with you helping, and all, how could it go wrong?
1DI0001242	Thanks kid. You're all right.
1DI0001243	The Family must have gotten to them in the last attack! Sons of bitches!
1DI0001244	Damn it! If only we had more men, we could stand up to them. I'm sick of them terrorizing this town.
1DI0001245	Wait a minute... when you searched the West's place, did you find their son Ian's body?
1DI0001249	Check the rest of the town. Make sure I'm not the only one left.
1DI0001250	What?! Oh my God!
1DI0001251	King has to do something about this now! Tell him to get off his ass and hunt those bastards down!
1DI0001252	Son of a bitch! I knew the Family were going to cross the line. It was only a matter of time.
1DI0001253	Maybe it's time I cut my losses and ran, but it just isn't fair. I made my home here, why should I have to leave?
1DI0001254	Dead tired I bet from the square dance in the barn last night! What a time we had!
1DI0001255	For you, sweet cheeks? Sure thing!
1DI0001256	Now, how about I show you how I keep my two bitches happy all night long?
1DI0001257	Hey, you really know robots, huh? Great to meet another mechanic.
1DI0001258	I stumbled across this model a while ago. I just can't seem to fix it.
1DI0001259	Great. Just between us mechanics, try some Mentats before you tackle that robot. They really clear your head.
1DI0001260	I know they're addictive, but hey, that's just the sort of risk professionals like us take, right? Here, I've got a few.
1DI0001261	Your dad? Nope, I haven't. Did he get lost?
1DI0001262	He disappeared on you, huh? Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find him soon.
1DI0001263	Your dad? No, I haven't. I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
1DI0001264	I don't think so, but then I haven't really been looking for him. Sorry.
1DI0001265	Oh he's here, you can be sure of that. Just don't expect to see what you're used to seeing.
1DI0001266	No, I haven't. But when I do, I'll tell him you're looking for him.
1DI0001267	Nope, 'fraid not. Don't you worry about it, though. You'll find him.
1DI0001268	No sweetie, I haven't. I'm sure he'll come looking for you before long, though.
1DI0001269	Can't say that I have, kiddo. Don't worry, I'm sure he'll turn up.
1DI0001270	Oh... okay... but PLEASE don't leave me here by myself... come back for me soon, okay?
1DI0001271	Don't be long!
1DI0001272	Well, look around at the world we live in. It may be okay to you, but I've read about what it used to be like, and this wasn't it.
1DI0001273	So we all need something that keeps us going, despite all the terrible things around us. For me, it's things like this book.
1DI0001274	What? Fuck me sideways! No, better yet, fuck him. I swear, I'll jam a grenade so far up his ass...
1DI0001275	I've got nothing against Ghouls. Ha! I even had a Ghoul party girl once, to see what it was like!
1DI0001276	This is about the key, isn't it? The goddamn key. If you want it, I'd better see some fucking caps on the table, clown shoes.
1DI0001277	It's northwest of here, numb nuts. A long fucking walk, too.
1DI0001278	Wankers like you can't get in though. You need a special set of keys.
1DI0001279	What! I hired you to kill him! I want him dead! You double crossed me.
1DI0001280	I won't get into a bidding war with him. I'll lose.
1DI0001281	Guess I've got to kill you now.
1DI0001282	Yes, yes, yes! Another bigot bites the dust.
1DI0001283	Good riddance. The wasteland is better off without him.
1DI0001284	I serve Miss Vera Weatherly, proprietor of the Weatherly Hotel.
1DI0001285	This is the Weatherly Hotel. It's the finest establishment in Rivet City.
1DI0001286	Well, I really shouldn't tell you, but have you heard about Paulie Cantelli?
1DI0001287	He's addicted to chems. His poor wife, Cindy, is at her wits end.
1DI0001288	You haven't heard? Angela has the hots for Diego.
1DI0001289	But since he's a priest, he's been putting her off. One of these days she's just going to jump his bones.
1DI0001290	They say Mister Lopez is losing it. He stands on the top of the bridge tower for hours at a time, just staring out over the city.
1DI0001291	I mean the Brotherhood from out West, back around California. We knew what we were doing back there. We didn't waste time with delusions of heroism.
1DI0001292	We were collecting still-glowing embers from the ashes of humanity, before civilization's fire died completely.
1DI0001293	We didn't worry about saving individual communities. We worried about saving the progress of humanity itself.
1DI0001294	And all at the cost of throwing away the lives of soldiers for a mission they didn't sign on for.
1DI0001295	They're not supposed to be saving a bunch of backwards locals from raiders, they're supposed to be saving mankind from a new dark age.
1DI0001296	Well, some of mankind, anyway. The important parts, at least.
1DI0001297	I'm afraid the answer to that is a lot more nuanced than others might suggest.
1DI0001298	Brotherhood members are sworn to acquire and protect technology of the past. But not everyone interprets these oaths in the same way.
1DI0001299	Elder Lyons sees these duties as part of a larger dedication to protect the innocent. Some, like the Outcasts, disagree with these priorities.
1DI0001300	Oh, he used to be as tough as the rest of us. Wasn't so long ago, we fought side-by-side to Scourge the Pitt.
1DI0001301	But somewhere, he went soft. Stopped looking at the big picture, and started trying to save every tribal and illiterate community he found.
1DI0001302	When he had us helping those savages instead of recovering tech that could help us all, that's when we objected and became Outcasts.
1DI0001303	Not hardly. We've got our mission, we'll stick with it, and to hell with Lyons and his soldier sycophants.
1DI0001304	If they call us Outcasts for our dedication to duty, then we'll wear the title with pride!
1DI0001305	And you just wait for when we get back in contact with the real Brotherhood out West. Lyons will have hell to pay.
1DI0001306	I like to think that I've still got some big achievements left in me, although some of my joints seem to disagree these days.
1DI0001307	I'll tell you what the low-lights of my time have been though: every time I've been shot at. I'm a scribe, not a soldier!
1DI0001308	The Brotherhood came out here to recover technology from the eastern cities and bases. If Lyons won't do it, then we will.
1DI0001309	And when we resume contact with the Western Elders, Lyons is going to be put in his place.
1DI0001310	Even if that place is in front of a firing squad.
1DI0001311	Huh. And here I thought we had the only remaining copy of that...
1DI0001312	Anyway, I don't know if the old man's going to die from them, but he sure as hell looks like he's going to drag his soldiers down with him.
1DI0001313	But he's not wasting any of our time anymore, damnit.
1DI0001314	You know what? Never mind.
1DI0001315	Sheesh. Ignorant savages.
1DI0001316	A real challenge? Every blessed hour of every blessed day.
1DI0001317	Just because we have good equipment doesn't mean we're invincible. A tool is only as good as the craftsman who holds it.
1DI0001318	And I've seen my share of friends lost. Between the fighting, the Outcasts, and the everyday tragedies, we've seen plenty of grief in these Wastes.
1DI0001319	It seems like whichever challenge we're facing is always the biggest one. Survival at first, then expansion, and now cohesion.
1DI0001320	We've seen plenty of Wasteland freaks or would-be dictators. They're not too bad, at least we've faced that sort of thing before.
1DI0001321	But more recent events, like the schism with the Outcasts... Those are the problems that worry me.
1DI0001322	All right, then.
1DI0001323	By all means. I'm always proud to talk of my Brotherhood.
1DI0001324	Okay. Anything else?
1DI0001325	We were cast out for our dedication to the Brotherhood's true goals. Lyons wanted to play hero to the locals, instead of doing his job.
1DI0001326	We were proud to leave him, so we kept the name "Outcasts" and wear it with pride. A big "fuck you" to the old man.
1DI0001327	He may have struck our names from the great Codex, but we'll be vindicated in the end, and our names will be restored.
1DI0001328	We've got power armor and big guns and we're the ones doing the talking right now.
1DI0001329	Usually, that's all a person needs to know, and they stop asking questions. You going to stop asking questions, now?
1DI0001330	We collect technology, and most people want what we've collected.
1DI0001331	Right now, we're pretty much stuck defending this Fort, but that won't be forever.
1DI0001332	Once we regroup, we'll continue our work and keep moving back west.
1DI0001333	We call ourselves the Outcasts, and we collect technology to preserve it from tribals and idiot locals.
1DI0001334	And before you ask, we were cast out from that company of zeroes who call themselves Lyons' Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0001335	Way we figure it, if traitors think we're too harsh in following orders, we're probably doing something right.
1DI0001336	The Outcasts are a result of my greatest mistake. But a mistake I'm proud of, nonetheless.
1DI0001337	When I came here, I realized for the first time that the Brotherhood's technology could truly save the survivors in this Wasteland.
1DI0001338	I chose to help them, even if it meant putting the Brotherhood's interests at risk. Some of my soldiers called me a hero. Others called me a traitor.
1DI0001339	The dissenters left my command, calling themselves Outcasts to mock me. I cannot fault their dedication, even if I find them lacking in compassion.
1DI0001340	It's a rather sad story, I'm afraid. Last year, some of our soldiers had grave disagreements with the decisions of Elder Lyons.
1DI0001341	Disagreements spiraled out of control, and there was a schism in the ranks. The loyal soldiers practically threw out the dissenters.
1DI0001342	Now they call themselves the Outcasts.
1DI0001343	I'd really don't want to go into it.
1DI0001344	Go bug Scribe Bowditch. He could talk a dog off a meat truck.
1DI0001345	Where Elder Lyons has fought to protect the people of the Capital Wasteland, the Outcasts demanded we move on and leave them to their fates.
1DI0001346	They insisted there was more important technology to be recovered in a scientific base in the ruins of Fort Independence, to the West.
1DI0001347	As callous as their decision may be, it's more in line with our original mission. Elder Lyons is an inspiration to us, but to them he's a traitor.
1DI0001348	Only in a very broad sense. The Brotherhood's oaths are to protect humanity's progress, but not necessarily every human.
1DI0001349	The Outcasts - and members of the Brotherhood in other places - consider it a waste to protect most people.
1DI0001350	"After all," they say, "everyone knows how to make another human, but the secrets to making a P94 Plasma Rifle are all but lost."
1DI0001351	The soldiers rallied behind Paladin Casdin, who was one of Elder Lyons' original squad. They served together for over twenty years.
1DI0001352	Casdin was well-respected, and every bit as loyal to the Brotherhood as Elder Lyons. He just disagreed with the interpretations of our oaths.
1DI0001353	But when disagreements turned into fistfights, he left with the Outcasts. We lost more allies that day than we ever have to any battle.
1DI0001354	Even now, a year after they left, the wounds of their departure are still sore.
1DI0001355	Some of my soldiers are angry about it -- they see it as an insult to me. Bless them for their loyalty, they're more angry about it than I ever was.
1DI0001356	Others understand their decision. Sometimes I hear them wondering if they should have gone with them.
1DI0001357	I can't blame them, but I stand by my decision. And I respect theirs.
1DI0001358	As much as some of our soldiers would like to see them shot for deserting, there's not much we can do. We're too busy with the Super Mutants.
1DI0001359	Meanwhile, they're busy seeking out new technology and trying to get back in contact with the Brotherhood out West.
1DI0001360	So our paths rarely cross, but it's never pretty when they do. I just hope things cool down before it gets worse.
1DI0001361	Has it been worth the cost in lives and resources to protect people like you from the Super Mutants?
1DI0001362	You tell me. I suspect my daughter's squad helped save your life. And most of our recent recruits have come from those we've saved over the years.
1DI0001363	It's cost us, but we've saved many lives and made the Capital Wasteland a place where people can live. Yes, I'd say that's been worth it.
1DI0001364	It is a rather discouraging subject, isn't it?
1DI0001365	Yes, let's speak of other things.
1DI0001366	Lyons and Casdin would have to agree to any sort of reconciliation, and that's pretty unlikely. They're both quite proud and... stubborn.
1DI0001367	Me, I just wish there was a way we could all agree that at least we're still on the same side. There are bigger problems out there, after all.
1DI0001368	That's the thing, really. Casdin's "technology first" sort of attitude is more traditional in the Brotherhood always used to operate, out West.
1DI0001369	But somewhere along the way from there to here, Elder Lyons made sure we watched out for the people, not just the technology.
1DI0001370	To some of us, that was noble. I guess to Casdin and his crew, it was just soft. I wish they could see some sort of middle ground.
1DI0001371	You sound like some of the hard-liners. We all served together for years, but now some of the soldiers hate them as much as the Super Mutants.
1DI0001372	Threat analysis... green. Standing down.
1DI0001373	I'm so relieved we can put that unpleasantness behind us.
1DI0001374	Surrender... accepted.
1DI0001375	Cheerio. Water under the bridge.
1DI0001376	Do that again and I'll put my foot so far up your ass you'll cough up boot polish!
1DI0001377	A wise decision.
1DI0001378	Fine. I'll kill you next time.
1DI0001379	I accept. Do it again, and you're a corpse.
1DI0001380	Just calm down, okay?
1DI0001381	Okay, okay. Let's just calm down...
1DI0001382	Good. Perhaps there's some semblance of civility left in you, after all.
1DI0001383	Just don't fuckin' do it again.
1DI0001384	I accept your terms.
1DI0001385	Watch it, okay?
1DI0001386	Fine. But I'm warning you. Don't try that again.
1DI0001387	Now, can we please behave like civilized adults.
1DI0001388	Fine. One more chance. Do something that dumb again, and you're dead.
1DI0001389	Righto. We were only sparring then.
1DI0001390	Smart choice, clown shoes.
1DI0001391	I'll forgive you. This time.
1DI0001392	Better not try that again.
1DI0001393	What's that?
1DI0001394	Is someone there?
1DI0001395	Come out, you nasty little bug.
1DI0001396	Where are you? I'm going to squish you...
1DI0001397	Dratted roaches.
1DI0001398	I could be in bed right now...
1DI0001399	If he'd just let us turn the lights on this would be a lot easier.
1DI0001400	This stumbling around in the dark is ridiculous.
1DI0001401	At least I can finally see where I'm going.
1DI0001402	I suggest you show yourself!
1DI0001403	Hiding's a coward's game!
1DI0001404	Who's there?
1DI0001405	I know you're out there...
1DI0001406	Gary, hmmm?
1DI0001407	Gary, Gary?
1DI0001408	Possible target in vicinity.
1DI0001409	May have a contact here. Checking.
1DI0001410	Target may be in range.
1DI0001411	Yellow alert. Keep sharp.
1DI0001412	Possible threat detected.
1DI0001413	Area may be compromised. Searching.
1DI0001414	Who's out there?
1DI0001415	Huh. Hearing those damn noises again.
1DI0001416	Hiding from me? Better hope I don't find you!
1DI0001417	Ok, cut the shit... who is that?
1DI0001418	This is bullshit... come out and fight!
1DI0001419	Scared, just like a little bitch.
1DI0001420	I can hear you. Come on out.
1DI0001421	You playing games with me?
1DI0001422	Come on out and let's settle this.
1DI0001423	You can hide, but you can't hide forever!
1DI0001424	This sucks. Come out and fight me, dammit!
1DI0001425	I'm sick of this hiding crap! Where the hell are you?
1DI0001426	Hmm... What was that?
1DI0001427	I can hear you...
1DI0001428	Something there?
1DI0001429	What? I hear somethin'.
1DI0001430	Huh? A noise?
1DI0001431	Hello? Someone there?
1DI0001432	Hiding is futile.
1DI0001433	Come on out and let's fight face to face.
1DI0001434	This is a coward's game!
1DI0001435	You're exhausting my patience.
1DI0001436	Face me, dammit!
1DI0001437	This is foolish. Reveal yourself!
1DI0001438	Threat analysis: yellow. Scanning for hostiles.
1DI0001439	Alert. Non-combatants are advised to leave the area. Security sweep in progress. Lethal force may be used without warning.
1DI0001440	No hostiles detected. Continuing perimeter sweep.
1DI0001441	Don't be alarmed if I try to kill you when I find you. It's just the way I've been programmed.
1DI0001442	Why don't you just come out where I can see you?
1DI0001443	I'll find you eventually, you know.
1DI0001444	Where are you?
1DI0001445	Scanning for hostiles.
1DI0001446	This area clear. Proceeding with search protocol.
1DI0001447	Please step into the open and identify yourself. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.
1DI0001448	It's just little old me. Nothing to be afraid of.
1DI0001449	Someone dirty and disreputable, I shouldn't wonder.
1DI0001450	Here kitty-kitty-kitty!
1DI0001451	As if I'd know what to do if I found something.
1DI0001452	Why not let the robot deal with it?
1DI0001453	I'm going to look over here now.
1DI0001454	Are you afraid of me? You should be because I'm going to kick your ass when I find you!
1DI0001455	Step forward and identify yourself!
1DI0001456	Do you think you can hide from me?
1DI0001457	I'm starting to get angry. You would not like me when I'm angry.
1DI0001458	Are you playing games with me, goddammit?
1DI0001459	I cannot wait to find you so I can kill you as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.
1DI0001460	Probably nothing anyway.
1DI0001461	You'd better come out, whoever you are!
1DI0001462	This is crazy. I'm going to get myself killed.
1DI0001463	Oh goodie. Hide and seek. I haven't played this game in years.
1DI0001464	You can't hide forever. You're stink will eventually give you away.
1DI0001465	I do so enjoy a good hunt!
1DI0001466	Quit hiding and come out and fight!
1DI0001467	Come out here, you sissy! Finish what you started!
1DI0001468	I'll find you, and then you'll be sorry!
1DI0001469	Is that really necessary? I won't hurt you. Come out of there and let's discuss this civilly.
1DI0001470	Come now. You're being unsporting.
1DI0001471	I know you're out there, clown shoes!
1DI0001472	I'm growing tired of this little game of ours. Show yourself!
1DI0001473	Hmm. I was sure I heard something.
1DI0001476	Maybe I'm just jumpy.
1DI0001477	Anybody there?
1DI0001478	Hello? Who's there?
1DI0001479	There's more over here!
1DI0001480	Where do they keep coming from?
1DI0001481	Roaches!
1DI0001482	Dammit, more roaches!
1DI0001483	There he is!
1DI0001484	There she is!
1DI0001485	Got you now.
1DI0001486	I knew you'd turn up sooner or later.
1DI0001487	Stop in the name of the Overseer!
1DI0001488	Hold it right there!
1DI0001489	You can't hide from me, zombie!
1DI0001490	Zombie, over there. I see you!
1DI0001491	There! Another goddamn zombie!
1DI0001492	Zombie! Over here!
1DI0001493	Got him!
1DI0001494	They're coming this way!
1DI0001495	We're all going to die!
1DI0001496	Somebody, anybody, help me!
1DI0001497	Help! Help. HEEEELLLLLPPPPP!

1DI0001508	No more games... time to die!
1DI0001509	Excellent. Combat.
1DI0001510	Bad idea.
1DI0001511	Not a good idea.
1DI0001512	To arms! Brothers! To arms!
1DI0001513	Combat alert! Alarm! Alarm!
1DI0001514	To your guns, Brothers!

1DI0001522	Thought you could hide forever?
1DI0001523	Welcome back to the party! It's your turn to dance!
1DI0001524	There you are!
1DI0001525	Engaging!
1DI0001526	Target acquired.
1DI0001527	On me!
1DI0001528	Spotted, over there!
1DI0001529	Oh my God!
1DI0001530	HEEELLLPPP!
1DI0001531	Oh no!
1DI0001532	<screaming in fear>
1DI0001533	<crying>
1DI0001534	Death to all defilers of Oasis!
1DI0001535	Prepare for your last moments!
1DI0001536	You will be destroyed, Outsider!
1DI0001537	Ah!  Gary!
1DI0001538	Haha, Gaaaary!
1DI0001539	Gaaaary!
1DI0001540	Target locked!
1DI0001541	Tango spotted... open fire!
1DI0001542	Enemy reacquired! Code red!
1DI0001543	I have positive ID on target.
1DI0001544	Target locked! Go weapons hot!
1DI0001545	Enemy located!
1DI0001546	Hahaha! It's killing time!
1DI0001547	This is gonna be fun!
1DI0001548	Time to tear you apart!
1DI0001549	You're dead, meatsack!
1DI0001550	I'm gonna tear you up!
1DI0001551	C'mon, boys! Fresh meat!
1DI0001552	I got ya now!
1DI0001553	Now the fun begins!
1DI0001554	I knew you couldn't hide forever!
1DI0001555	It's ass-stompin' time!
1DI0001556	Game's over, pal!
1DI0001557	Game's over, lady!
1DI0001558	Ha! Your ass is MINE!
1DI0001559	Ha ha! There you are!
1DI0001560	Found you!
1DI0001561	Now try and hide from this!
1DI0001562	Game's over!
1DI0001564	I smelled your fear, human!
1DI0001565	Firing!
1DI0001566	Contact confirmed! Backup requested!
1DI0001567	Got one here! Engaging!
1DI0001568	Enemy contact!
1DI0001569	Opening fire on hostile target!
1DI0001570	We've got company!
1DI0001571	Hostile detected. Commencing neutralization.
1DI0001572	Weapons free.
1DI0001573	Alert. Hostile detected. Lethal force authorized for all units.
1DI0001574	Allow me to introduce myself.
1DI0001575	I'm afraid I'm quite good at killing things. You may want to run now.
1DI0001576	There you are! Were you trying to hide from me?
1DI0001577	Hostile target identified.
1DI0001578	Hold it right there.
1DI0001579	Commencing attack on hostile target.
1DI0001580	Didn't you hear me coming? Now I have to fight you. Bloody fantastic.
1DI0001581	Here we go again.
1DI0001582	Oh good. I found you.
1DI0001583	You must be bloody stupid if you can't hide from me.
1DI0001584	You're gonna learn how Uncle Sam deals with commie maggots!
1DI0001585	You are about to be introduced to the U.S. army!
1DI0001586	Kill that son of a bitch!
1DI0001587	You just made my day! Opening fire!
1DI0001588	Looks like this is my lucky day.
1DI0001589	Since you don't seem willing to do the world a favor and kill yourself, I guess I'm going to have to do it for you.
1DI0001590	Somebody protect the booze!
1DI0001591	A-ha! You've manifested yourself!
1DI0001592	Aha! There you are! That was fun. Pity you'll be dead soon so we can't play again.
1DI0001593	Not very clever are you?
1DI0001594	And here I was so enjoying our little cat and mouse game. It's a shame I have to kill you now.
1DI0001595	Tsk tsk. I had thought you were more clever than that. Oh well.
1DI0001596	So are you going to let me kill you now, or are you going to run away again?
1DI0001597	There you are. Now, let's finish this nonsense.
1DI0001598	Look what we have here.
1DI0001600	Aha!
1DI0001601	Thought I heard something.
1DI0001602	Hey!
1DI0001603	Aha! There you are!
1DI0001604	Is that all of them?
1DI0001605	They're gone... for now.
1DI0001606	I think it's gone somewhere else!
1DI0001607	This can't be happening. This just can't be happening.
1DI0001608	Where'd it go?
1DI0001609	It's behind me, isn't it?
1DI0001610	I guess I was mistaken.
1DI0001611	I must have been hearing things.
1DI0001612	Hmmm, nothing. Echoes of the past perhaps.
1DI0001613	Got to calm down.
1DI0001614	Could've sworn I heard something.
1DI0001615	Where the hell?
1DI0001616	Is it safe now?
1DI0001617	Ah, Gary.
1DI0001618	Gaaary?`
1DI0001619	Target trace lost.
1DI0001620	Got nothing here.
1DI0001621	Cancel alert.
1DI0001622	Standing down from alert.
1DI0001623	Resume standard patrol procedures.
1DI0001624	Scope's clean. There's no one here.
1DI0001625	You got what you deserved, dumbass.
1DI0001626	You know, I almost feel sorry for this poor bastard. Almost. Hahaha!
1DI0001627	Haha! What kind of an idiot screws with a Raider anyway?
1DI0001628	Get back, you monkeys. I got first call on the goods.
1DI0001629	Back up. I got first dibs on the loot.
1DI0001630	Stand down, boys.
1DI0001631	Relax, fellas. Trouble's over.
1DI0001632	Chalk me up another one.
1DI0001633	That was TOO easy.
1DI0001634	What a waste.
1DI0001635	Teach you to mess with the best.
1DI0001636	Well, that was fun.
1DI0001637	Bah. I've had better fights with a hooker.
1DI0001638	Aggh... It was nothin'.
1DI0001639	Bah... I'm hearin' stuff.
1DI0001640	Stupid noises.
1DI0001641	Oh well... I was hopin' for a fight.
1DI0001642	Must have been nothin'.
1DI0001643	Ears play tricks on me again.
1DI0001644	All clear here.
1DI0001645	False alarm. Stand down.
1DI0001646	I've searched the area. Nothing to report.
1DI0001647	Area secured.
1DI0001648	Looks all clear to me.
1DI0001649	Must have been a glitch.
1DI0001650	Threat analysis: green. Standing down.
1DI0001651	Threat analysis: green. Resuming standard patrol pattern.
1DI0001652	Threat analysis: green. Security sweep canceled.
1DI0001653	Oh well. Maybe next time you'll introduce yourself.
1DI0001654	Why did you run away? I'm really not as scary as I look.
1DI0001655	You shouldn't tease me like that.
1DI0001656	All clear.
1DI0001657	Area secure.
1DI0001658	False alarm. Standing down.
1DI0001659	Back to the usual daily tedium.
1DI0001660	Thought as much. Nothing there after all.
1DI0001661	Beastly nuisance. Glad that's done with.
1DI0001662	Another glorious day in the U.S. army.
1DI0001663	False alarm. Stand down, people.
1DI0001664	Nothing I like better than a little R and R on Uncle Sam's dime.
1DI0001665	Hmm. I'm seeing things. I need another drink.
1DI0001666	Hmm. Nothing hewe, I guess.
1DI0001667	Ah well, back to my experiments.
1DI0001668	Ah, just getting jumpy I guess.
1DI0001669	Whatever it was, I guess it's gone now.
1DI0001670	Hmm. Nothing here after all.
1DI0001671	There's nothing here.
1DI0001672	Whatever. I've got better things to do.
1DI0001674	I guess it was nothing.
1DI0001675	Aww, I'm blushing!
1DI0001676	That's so nice of you to say! Thank you!
1DI0001677	Oh, you're embarrassing me!
1DI0001678	Why thank you!
1DI0001679	Hello, Mrs. Wilson.
1DI0001680	Good to see you, Mrs. Wilson.
1DI0001681	My mom says hi, Mrs. Wilson.
1DI0001682	Hi, Mr. Wilson.
1DI0001683	Good to see you, Mr. Wilson.
1DI0001684	Yessir, democracy is God's best gift, right after family, of course.
1DI0001685	No, sir. Not crazy, just a loyal American.
1DI0001686	No, ma'am. Not crazy, just a loyal American.
1DI0001687	And it's good to meet you too! Feel free to stay in Andale as long as you'd like. Heck, stop by the house for dinner sometime if you'd like.
1DI0001688	Just let Linda know beforehand, so that she can make enough for four!
1DI0001689	I hope to see you there! So, did you need anything else?
1DI0001690	Suit yourself, but you don't know what you're missing.
1DI0001691	Linda's meatloaf is the best in the county. And her mince meat pie has won first prize at the town fair three years running.
1DI0001692	But the invitation still stands, if you ever change your mind. But listen to me go on, did you need something else?
1DI0001693	Well, that's a shame. But feel free to stop by and see us anytime!
1DI0001694	Look, stranger, I'm not angry -- I just want you to tell me the truth. If you can't do that, then I think you'd best head on out of town.
1DI0001695	I'm disappointed in you stranger -- so quick to judge us. Did you ever stop to think that I have a family to support here?
1DI0001696	"Judge not, lest ye be judged" as the good book says. Honestly, how many people have you killed?
1DI0001697	The only difference between us is that that I'm bringing home the bacon for my family.
1DI0001701	Hey! I'll have none of that language in this house!
1DI0001702	Okay, that's it. I warned you. Now I'm going to sock your jaw, mister.
1DI0001703	Okay, that's it. I warned you. Normally, I wouldn't hit a lady, but you're over the line, missy.
1DI0001704	I don't think I like your tone. There's nothing wrong with me, we've lived this way for decades
1DI0001705	After the war, four families survived. They continued on just like we have. But when their shelters ran out of food, they need to eat something.
1DI0001706	Family is everything, my friend. I wouldn't expect a wasteland wanderer like you to understand.
1DI0001710	Now, let's just forget that this happened and we'll have no problem, right?
1DI0001711	Well, that's good to hear, friend! Very good to hear, indeed.
1DI0001712	You wouldn't believe how judgmental some people can be. Honestly. All I'm trying to do is keep my family happy and fed.
1DI0001713	Tell you what, talk to Linda. She'll give you some of her special meat pie. It's to die for! Ha! Hahaha... but not you. You're good people.
1DI0001717	Well, I guess we know where our next meal is coming from then, don't we?
1DI0001718	You see, now that's nice to hear. Every time someone discovers our little secret, it's always "oh, you're terrible people", or "how can you do this?"
1DI0001719	I mean, I've got a family to take care of here. I've lived in Andale my whole life. And my father before me, and his father, and his father's father.
1DI0001720	This town started out with just four families, and that's the way we've stayed. Small town and proud, eh?
1DI0001721	Indeed. To each their own, personal choice, it's the American way!
1DI0001722	I tell you what, stranger. I like you. Stop by here anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
1DI0001723	There's nothing better after a hard day of work than one of those pies, I tell you what!
1DI0001727	You're right, it sure would have. You know, you're a breath of fresh air. Every time someone discovers our little secret, we have to hear about it.
1DI0001728	It's always "oh, how can you do this", or "you're such terrible people", or "please, not me, I have a kid in Rivet City". Well, I have kids too!
1DI0001729	Family first, that's the way it works in Andale -- from the day that the first four families decided to stay here.
1DI0001730	You're not bad, stranger. Stop on by anytime and ask Linda for one of her special meat pies.
1DI0001743	And did you see anything... unexpected there?
1DI0001745	And do you have any thoughts on that?
1DI0001753	I'm disappointed, friend. But that's your prerogative.
1DI0001754	If you don't want to enjoy our town, we certainly don't want you here.
1DI0001755	I'm sorry that you didn't enjoy your stay... but, a man does need to feed his family. Nothing personal.
1DI0001756	Too bad, stranger. I guess you'll just have to be our new meal!
1DI0001757	Well that's a bit presumptuous, don't you think? To kill a man just for providing for his family? Everyone has to eat.
1DI0001758	Well then. I guess we can always stand to have some leftovers, can't we?
1DI0001759	Unfortunately, that's not an option. You see, you leave here and start warning people about the "crazies" in Andale.
1DI0001760	And then food get a lot more scarce, doesn't it?
1DI0001761	No, no, friend. I'm afraid that we can't let you leave. Get the ketchup, Linda!
1DI0001762	Didn't your mother teach you any manners?
1DI0001763	Well, that's not very polite at all!
1DI0001764	How rude! You could have at least let me finish!
1DI0001765	Hey, did you know that I'm going to marry Junior Smith when I'm old enough? I know, he doesn't like girls now, but mommy says that he'll come around.
1DI0001766	He's okay, I guess. I don't think he really likes me. Well... not likes me, likes me.
1DI0001767	I know! His daddy and my daddy used to be brothers, so I think we'll make especially good uhm... uhm... married... people? What's the word?
1DI0001768	Yes! That's it! We'll be a great couple!
1DI0001769	Oh my gosh! You said a swear! I'm telling! And that's four words, stupid.
1DI0001770	My dad says that it's going to rain soon, do you think it will?
1DI0001771	I dunno. Nothing, I guess. Old Man Harris won't come out of his house again.
1DI0001772	My daddy is never wrong. Ever. He's the smartest man in the whole world. Smarter than you.
1DI0001773	Wow, what a jerk! You're lucky that I don't tell him what you said!
1DI0001774	I knew it! Even you think he's smarter than you!
1DI0001775	How rude! Some people...
1DI0001776	It's okay, I guess. There aren't a lot of kids around here and no one who comes to visit stays around long.
1DI0001777	Dad says it could be worse; that there are starving kids in other places. But still, I wish I had more kids to play with.
1DI0001778	Are you joking? It's fantastic here! The best town in the USA! Has been for... why it's been so many years running that I've lost count!
1DI0001779	The same thing that all parents do! My mom cooks and cleans the house and my dad goes to work with Mr. Wilson.
1DI0001780	They work in the basement, or sometimes in Mr. Wilson's shed. Dad says that when I'm older, I'll come to work with him and learn the family business!
1DI0001781	Well... I don't right know. But we're the best one, isn't that what matters? I mean, we're the winners. Us. Not Springfield. Not Rockville. Us.
1DI0001782	So, like I was saying, welcome to Andale. What can the Smith family do for you?
1DI0001783	Why thank you! That's so nice of you to say! You're just too sweet.
1DI0001784	But forgive me, did you want to ask me something?
1DI0001785	Well, now. I'm sure that your home town is just so so much better than our little Andale.
1DI0001786	Well... I never! The nerve of some people! At least some of us know how to take the high road.
1DI0001787	Did you want something, Mr. Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
1DI0001789	Did you want something, Miss Fancy Underground Vault, or did you just come here to turn your nose up at us?
1DI0001790	Well, I think that it's quite a bit more than that, but thank you anyway. Now, did you need something?
1DI0001791	Well, I don't think it was a very funny joke. But thank you, we ladies to try to keep it as nice as we can.
1DI0001792	But enough about us, did you need something?
1DI0001793	Oh! Silly me, I mean "preparing a meal for you". Just a crazy twist of the tongue! Haha! Well, gotta go, bye!
1DI0001794	Oh, of course. Here you are! Enjoy!
1DI0001795	Oh, sorry. I gave you the last one! Come back tomorrow, I'll make a new batch!
1DI0001796	What's wrong? You don't see anything wrong with a quiet little town full of friendly people in the middle of a blasted wasteland?
1DI0001797	No! Well... yes. But it's all a trick. Don't you know anything? Does that number on your back mean that you just crawled out of a vault or something?
1DI0001798	Just about everyone in the wasteland knows to avoid Andale, and they're right to do it. People wander in here, and they don't wander back out.
1DI0001799	No! Well... yes. But it's all a trick. Don't you know anything? Did you just crawl out of a vault or something?
1DI0001801	Of course there's something off about them, everyone knows to avoid Andale! The caravans know it, the Raiders know it, even the Radscorpions know it.
1DI0001802	Folks wander into this place, and they don't wander back out. Oh sure, it seems nice, a regular town of out time here, but don't let it fool you.
1DI0001803	You should! Otherwise, you'll end up just like the rest!
1DI0001804	What? You don't believe me? Just look in the basements! Or out in that shed! You'll see what I mean!
1DI0001806	Nothin' wrong with being friendly, but these folks aren't just friendly -- they're killers!
1DI0001807	You just watch your back around here! And get out while you can!
1DI0001808	And you're right sensible to. Especially around here. The friendly neighbor bit is just an act, these people are stone cold killers!
1DI0001809	Get out while you can! Just get as far away from here as possible!
1DI0001810	Well, they're not! They're killers! Every one of 'em! Run! Get out while you can!
1DI0001811	Don't believe me, do you? Just check out the basement, or that shed! There's a reason they're locked!
1DI0001812	If you know what's good for you, you'll get out as soon as you can. They're crazy! Crazy, I tell you!
1DI0001813	They'll stay here with me and I'll raise them myself. It's a shame that they have to grow up without their parents.
1DI0001814	But, to tell you the truth, it's a lot better than growing up with their parents, everything considered.
1DI0001815	Better an orphan than a cannibal, I guess?
1DI0001816	We'll do our best, is what we'll do. Me an the kids here in Andale... what's left of it, anyway.
1DI0001817	It'll be hard goin', but we'll do the best we can.
1DI0001818	I just hope that one day, these kids'll grow up to go some good for this place, after all the evil that's been done here.
1DI0001819	Sure did. Can't say that I'm proud of it, though. It was all just normal. It's what we all did. I didn't ever think much about it.
1DI0001820	I married Gladys, just like every boy in Andale married the girl closest to his age. We had Linda and she grew up to marry Jack.
1DI0001821	It wasn't until Gladys died that I thought about what went on around here. So many people over the years... hundreds... thousands, maybe?
1DI0001822	But what could I do? I'm just an old man. But you ended it. Bless you.
1DI0001823	Oh, that old kidder? Whatever he's saying, he's just pulling your leg. He's always joking, that one.
1DI0001824	Oh, Old Man Harris? Don't mind him. He's gone, you know... a little soft in his later years. Ever since Gladys died, he just hasn't been the same.
1DI0001825	Has he been spreading his stories again? Poor guy. I'll just have to have Jack give him a talking to.
1DI0001826	Well, dad always was a bit off his rocker.
1DI0001827	Did he, now? I've talked to him before about spreading rumors. I guess I'll just have to have another little chat with him.
1DI0001828	Every time he does this, he scares our new friends off, and we love people! It's a shame when they slip out of our grubby little paws! Ha!
1DI0001829	Poor guy, it's so sad when senility sets in.
1DI0001830	Oh dear... I let that slip didn't I? He used to be. Until I got married. I can't really say much more than that.
1DI0001831	Mr. Harris does not smell funny! But... okay, old people do sort of smell funny.
1DI0001832	Oh, we are. Absolutely. Family first, here in Andale.
1DI0001834	Oh, someone spilled our beans, didn't they? Well, Andale has been four families and only four families for a very long time.
1DI0001835	Two families marry into one another, take a new name, and start a new life. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
1DI0001838	I can't say that I know what you're talking about, but I sure as heck don't like your tone. You've got no business coming in here and judging us.
1DI0001839	We're four hard working American families. I work hard to put food on the table for my family, so do all the men here.
1DI0001840	It's not easy living the American dream but dammit, we're doing the best we can.
1DI0001841	Now, I know what you're thinking, and don't bother. We're perfectly happy good Christian people here, and we've been that way for 200 years.
1DI0001842	All the men work hard to put food on the table and all the women work hard to make nice homes for us. That's the way it should be.
1DI0001843	This is America, and I'll be damned if I let some Chinese Commies ruin that with a few bombs!
1DI0001844	Well, you know what they say about curiosity, cats, and killing. Just be careful where you stick your nose. We're private people.
1DI0001845	Darling, what's wrong?
1DI0001846	What is it, dear?
1DI0001847	Hello!
1DI0001848	Hi, there.
1DI0001849	I don't like that stranger nosing around here. He isn't like the others... This one is a bit more... I don't know. There's something about him.
1DI0001850	I don't like that stranger nosing around here. She isn't like the others... This one is a bit more... I don't know. There's something about her.
1DI0001851	That stranger is making me nervous. I don't like the looks I'm getting. Not one bit. I have a funny feeling about this whole thing.
1DI0001852	Martha, darling. You always say that, you always say, "I have a bad feeling about this one," and every time, things happen like they always do.
1DI0001853	Oh, darling, there's nothing to be worried about. Jack and I will take care of it. We always do.
1DI0001854	I know, it's just, you know how I get: worry, worry, worry. That's me!
1DI0001855	Okay, Bill. I trust you. After all, you know best.
1DI0001856	I feed my family and I love my wife and daughter, what else more is there to life, stranger?
1DI0001857	Family first! And any man who says anything different is saying something wrong. And you should hit that man. With a stick.
1DI0001858	I work to feed my family, just like every red-blooded American man should.
1DI0001859	Why, a man that can't keep his family fed isn't any kind of man at all, no sir!
1DI0001860	Aggh! Why are you doing this?
1DI0001861	What the hell has gotten into you?
1DI0001863	Mistake.
1DI0001865	Boy, are you out of your mind?
1DI0001866	Girl, are you out of your mind?
1DI0001867	Have you lost your damn mind?
1DI0001868	Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?
1DI0001869	You dare assault a Brother of Steel?
1DI0001870	Adding target to threat matrix.
1DI0001871	Reanalysis complete. Threat level red.
1DI0001872	I'm sorry that you had to act that way.
1DI0001873	I'm afraid that kind of behavior can't be tolerated.
1DI0001874	Antisocial behavior detected.
1DI0001875	Criminal behavior will be punished.
1DI0001876	Antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
1DI0001877	Not very sporting of you.
1DI0001878	That's hardly Marquess of Queensberry rules, now is it?
1DI0001879	You'll pay for that, you cheeky bastard!
1DI0001880	What is your major malfunction, maggot?
1DI0001881	You make me sick, you worthless scumbag.
1DI0001882	Run! Crazy mungo!
1DI0001883	You shouldn't have done that!
1DI0001884	Get the fuck away from me!
1DI0001885	I'm under attack!
1DI0001886	Being engaged by hostile! Request backup!
1DI0001887	Assault!
1DI0001888	You got a death wish?!
1DI0001889	Are you out of your fuckin' mind?!
1DI0001891	Whoa! What are you doing?
1DI0001892	What'd you do that for?
1DI0001893	Bad move, friend. Bad move.
1DI0001894	Stop it at once!
1DI0001895	Stop! Stop it!
1DI0001896	So, you really are just a rabid cur, aren't you?
1DI0001897	Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
1DI0001898	This is highly irregular!
1DI0001899	Been out of the Vault and now you think you're a big shot, huh?
1DI0001900	Back off, pal!
1DI0001901	You looking for trouble?
1DI0001902	We've got an assault in progress!
1DI0001903	I'll put you down in a heartbeat.
1DI0001904	I can assure you, I'm NOT someone to trifle with.
1DI0001905	Are you out of your goddamned mind?
1DI0001906	I KNEW I shouldn't have let you in here!
1DI0001907	What brutality!
1DI0001908	It's on now, clown shoes!
1DI0001909	Leave me alone!
1DI0001910	Stop it! Help!
1DI0001911	Help! He's attacking me!
1DI0001912	Help! She's attacking me!
1DI0001913	Now there was no call for that!
1DI0001914	Assault! Assault!
1DI0001915	You dirty coward!
1DI0001916	What the hell?!
1DI0001917	These robots are crazy!
1DI0001918	What the hell is going on?
1DI0001919	Put them down, now!
1DI0001920	Die, American dogs!
1DI0001921	You and your country will burn!
1DI0001922	Lay down and die!
1DI0001923	You need to learn some manners!
1DI0001924	I'm gonna beat you up!
1DI0001925	You're gonna get it now!
1DI0001926	I'm going to teach you a lesson you won't forget!
1DI0001927	Take this!
1DI0001928	Grrrrrgh!
1DI0001929	Arrrgh!
1DI0001930	Arrgh!
1DI0001931	Grrrghh!
1DI0001932	Friendly in the firezone! Watch your targets!
1DI0001933	You there! Moron! We're crashing your little party so keep your head down.
1DI0001934	Aggh!
1DI0001935	Hunh!
1DI0001936	Yaaaah!
1DI0001937	Son, get your head down!
1DI0001938	Honey, get your head down!
1DI0001939	Get away from my daughter!
1DI0001940	Get away from my son!
1DI0001941	You see? This is why I took you to that Vault in the first place...
1DI0001942	This is lunacy!
1DI0001943	You think I'm going to let YOU stop me? After all I've been through?
1DI0001944	I'll kill you before I let anyone harm my child!
1DI0001945	First that crazy simulation, now this. Has the entire world taken leave of its senses?
1DI0001946	Traveling the Wasteland, shooting guns! By God, I'm getting too old for this sort of thing!
1DI0001947	Damnit, just leave us alone!
1DI0001948	Just like shooting that old BB Gun! You remember?
1DI0001949	Ahhhhh!
1DI0001950	Enough! Enough of this!
1DI0001951	Run!
1DI0001952	Take that, you little buggers!
1DI0001953	Filthy little monsters!
1DI0001954	God, I hate these things!
1DI0001955	Get away from me!
1DI0001956	You shouldn't have tried to run.
1DI0001957	Your father betrayed us all!
1DI0001958	You didn't really think you could get away from us, did you?
1DI0001959	I knew we would find you eventually.
1DI0001960	Overseer's orders, I'm afraid.
1DI0001961	The punishment for treason is death.
1DI0001962	Too bad it had to end this way. But orders are orders.
1DI0001963	You know, I liked your dad. I guess he had us all fooled.
1DI0001964	I'll try to make this as painless as possible.
1DI0001965	Don't make this more difficult than it has to be.
1DI0001966	I've been wanting to do this for a long time, you little punk.
1DI0001967	If he let me beat up Amata, just imagine what he'll let me do to you.
1DI0001968	Jonas cried while we beat him, did you know that?
1DI0001969	Hold still and take it like a man.
1DI0001970	Come and get it, you dirty traitor!
1DI0001971	Why'd you have to go and attack me? Now I have no choice.
1DI0001972	I would have let you go, you know. I always liked you.
1DI0001973	Run for it, miss!
1DI0001974	Run for it, son!
1DI0001975	You don't have to do this.
1DI0001976	You're no better than your father.
1DI0001977	I always knew it would come to this.
1DI0001978	How dare you threaten me?
1DI0001979	Your father was a traitor and a coward!
1DI0001980	Guards! Help me!
1DI0001981	Off with you now!
1DI0001982	That's it! Back to your vile little hidey holes!
1DI0001983	Get back!
1DI0001984	Squish it!
1DI0001985	Watch out, Andy!
1DI0001986	Hold still, punk.
1DI0001987	You should have just given me the sweetroll.
1DI0001988	Say "uncle"!
1DI0001989	How do you like that, huh?
1DI0001990	Oh, a tough guy, huh?
1DI0001991	I got another one just like that in my other hand.
1DI0001992	Teach you to mess with the Tunnel Snakes!
1DI0001993	Had enough yet?
1DI0001994	Come on!
1DI0001995	Oh yeah.
1DI0001996	Get him, guys!
1DI0001997	Get her, guys!
1DI0001998	How do you like that, Poindexter?
1DI0001999	Maybe this time the lesson will stick.
1DI0002000	Did you see that, Butch? I nailed him a good one!
1DI0002001	I can't believe I'm hitting a girl.
1DI0002002	Tunnel Snakes rule, losers drool!
1DI0002003	Contact -- another civilian. Take him down!
1DI0002004	Yaaaaaah!
1DI0002005	I'm gonna kill you!
1DI0002006	Grrrr!
1DI0002007	You're going down!
1DI0002008	I forgot how much fun it was to shoot Ferals!
1DI0002009	Ghouls! On me!
1DI0002010	They're everywhere!
1DI0002011	Die zombie! Die!
1DI0002012	You got to shoot them in the head!
1DI0002013	How the hell did they get in here?
1DI0002014	Goddamn zombies everywhere!
1DI0002015	Someone flank that one!
1DI0002016	God damn runaway!
1DI0002017	Kill the slaves!
1DI0002018	I'll see you dead or in chains!
1DI0002020	I won't die in chains!
1DI0002021	Goddamn slaver!
1DI0002022	Threat to peace located. Pacifying.

1DI0002045	Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.
1DI0002046	If I'm going to die, I'm taking one of you with me!
1DI0002047	This is surprisingly satisfying.
1DI0002048	I think I'm getting the hang of this.
1DI0002049	I can't stop them all by myself!

1DI0002062	I'm getting hungry just looking at you!
1DI0002064	Come and get it if you want it!
1DI0002065	It's all a terrible mistake.
1DI0002066	I'm so sorry.
1DI0002067	This world makes no sense to me.
1DI0002068	Why is there so much suffering?
1DI0002069	I will always remember you.
1DI0002070	Maybe this time it will be different.
1DI0002071	Is life just a cruel illusion?
1DI0002072	There's the Slaver scum! Kill him!

1DI0002689	Go, go, go!
1DI0002690	Get away from it!
1DI0002693	Watch your ass!
1DI0002694	Moooove!
1DI0002695	Heads down!
1DI0002697	Nooooo!
1DI0002698	Whoa!
1DI0002700	Protect yourself!
1DI0002701	It's live!
1DI0002703	Did you take something?
1DI0002704	Hey, what are you doing?
1DI0002705	Did you find what you were looking for?
1DI0002706	Don't forget to sign out.
1DI0002707	Gotcha. We'll see you next time... leech...
1DI0002708	Try not to break it, outsider.
1DI0002709	You must come back soon.
1DI0002710	It's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0002711	Enjoy your meal.
1DI0002712	Just call me if you want that freshened.
1DI0002713	You done? Good.
1DI0002714	That it?
1DI0002715	Enjoy!
1DI0002716	Come back if you're still hungry!
1DI0002717	See you soon, drunky.
1DI0002718	Come back when you're sober.
1DI0002719	That should liquor you up for a while.
1DI0002720	Come back anytime!
1DI0002721	Enjoy the drinks.
1DI0002722	Enjoy the ride.
1DI0002723	You'll be higher that a fucking kite.
1DI0002724	Good hunting!
1DI0002725	Don't hurt yourself!
1DI0002726	You'll shoot your eye out!
1DI0002727	Come again! I should have more stuff in soon.
1DI0002728	Always a grab bag with my stuff, see?
1DI0002729	Come back later. Never know when I'll get another big find!
1DI0002730	What wonderful items for the Museum of Dave!
1DI0002731	Yeah, yeah. I hope you choke on it.
1DI0002732	Don't like your deal? Tough shit.
1DI0002733	No refunds, asshole.
1DI0002734	Let me know if you need anything else.
1DI0002736	Another satisfied customer.
1DI0002737	Give me a shout if you need anything else.
1DI0002738	Thanks.
1DI0002739	Huh? Oh... 120 caps... I guess.
1DI0002740	Since Colin's not running the show anymore, it's just the room now. 120 caps. Up front.
1DI0002741	Well... for you? A room and some company will run you 120 caps. Up front.
1DI0002742	A mere 120 caps.
1DI0002743	Only 120 caps. You won't get a better deal than that.
1DI0002744	Okay, then.
1DI0002746	Very good, madam.
1DI0002749	Oh. Sorry... there's not really anything I can do. I have to make money, you know.
1DI0002750	Ok, it's right over there. Middle room.
1DI0002751	Well, you aren't gonna get very far with no money.
1DI0002752	Right at the top of the stairs, honey. That's your room.
1DI0002753	Right at the top of the stairs, honey. The room with the big bed.
1DI0002754	A regretable error on your part. We will be happy to service you when you have the necessary funds.
1DI0002755	Excellent. Simply venture into the hallway, turn left, first door on your left. That is your room.
1DI0002756	Well, when you do, you know where to find me.
1DI0002757	That sounds like a deal. Out in the hallway, turn left, first door on your left. That's your room.
1DI0002758	No one understands me. You're just like all the others around here.
1DI0002759	Finally! Someone who doesn't judge me! You know, the people here are just so quick to assume that they know everything about you.
1DI0002760	I mean, like, just because I look different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
1DI0002761	No one gets that, they're all like "blah blah blah, what's wrong with that girl?".
1DI0002762	FINE! Be that way! You'll be sorry! You'll all be sorry!
1DI0002763	Oh! You... you... ... ...no one understands me... *sniff*
1DI0002765	I mean, like, just because I'm different doesn't mean that I'm some sort of freak, you know? It's like, hello, this world sucks!
1DI0002767	That's what they always say. "Blah blah, Bittercup you need to pay attention when you're on patrol". Like, what, I'm supposed to stop slavers?
1DI0002768	I mean, that's Flash's job, not mine. Besides, it doesn't matter, they're going to get us sooner or later.
1DI0002769	Back in Lamplight, they always said that Bigtown was a safe place, that there's nothing to worry about when you leave.
1DI0002770	God! It's so nice to have someone who understands! I mean, sure, when I left Little Lamplight, I was happy to be out of there.
1DI0002771	I was dating Pappy then, you know. I got here and he was all like "Bigtown will be safe", but it wasn't! This place is always under attack!
1DI0002772	But I don't date liars, so I dumped his ass and got with Flash. But that didn't last very long. Me and Timebomb were a thing for a while, too.
1DI0002773	Hey, whatever. And here I thought you were cute. Guess you're just the same as everyone else here.
1DI0002774	Anyway, did you want something or did you just come over here to judge me?
1DI0002775	Oh, yeah, what is it? Um, not that I care what you think.
1DI0002776	I dunno. What does it matter anyway? We're all going to be mutant chow eventually.
1DI0002777	And what do you know?! You wastelanders and your dirty clothes and roughed up faces! YOU look like a serial killer!
1DI0002778	You're not ... uh, seeing anyone right now. Are you?
1DI0002779	Really? I mean... good. No one wants to look like the boring slobs in this town, anyway.
1DI0002780	Besides, if we're all going to die here, I at least want my corpse to look better than these inane wastelanders.
1DI0002781	That's why I never go out during the day. The moon has such a better shine to it than the sun.
1DI0002782	Oh, um, well. I need to get going, but come back and visit me sometime, okay?
1DI0002793	Ugh, hurry up. I have poetry I need to write. Dark poetry.
1DI0002794	Well, we've got Super Mutants out that way and Slavers up that way. Take your pick.
1DI0002795	They both come in here, drag off as many as they can carry and shoot whoever puts up a fight.
1DI0002796	The best we can ever hope for is that they get here at the same time and fight over who gets to kill us.
1DI0002797	And where are we going to go? Megaton won't have us, Lamplight won't take us back, and Rivet City is too far.
1DI0002798	Besides, the bunch of us can't even hold this town, can you imagine us shlepping across the wasteland?
1DI0002799	There aren't many of us left. There's me and Pappy. Red runs the clinic, but she's been taken by the mutant. Kimba does what she can.
1DI0002800	And there's Bittercup. She's just about as useless as a human being can be. Timebomb was hurt in the last raid, so he's out.
1DI0002801	That's about it. The Mutants and Slavers have taken everyone else. Just us and a couple of guns are all that's left.
1DI0002802	There aren't many of us left. There's me and Pappy. Red runs the clinic. Kimba does what she can.
1DI0002803	And there's Bittercup. She's just about as useless as a human being can be. Timebomb was hurt in the last raid, so he's out. Shorty is unpredictable.
1DI0002805	Yeah, we'll see.
1DI0002806	Yeah, yeah, you're a scary wastelander. Look, you'll either kill us, or you won't.
1DI0002807	Most of us have already accepted death so you won't get much of a reaction with your threats. At least we won't be slaves if you shoot us all.
1DI0002808	Then I'm going down fighting!
1DI0002809	Aren't you swell. Did you need something else or can I go back to my patrol?
1DI0002810	Gee, thanks. Are we done here?
1DI0002811	Yeah, I can do it.
1DI0002812	Sure thing. I guess I'll take caps in trade.
1DI0002813	Okay, just make it quick.
1DI0002814	I told you, that's Timebomb. And if it were up to you, he'd be dead. Just stay away from him.
1DI0002815	That's Timebomb. He got lucky. During the last raid, the mutant shot him down in the street.
1DI0002816	Normally, they go for the kill, but I managed to drag Timebomb away before they could get they killing blow in.
1DI0002817	I dragged him back to the clinic, but his injuries are way beyond what I can deal with. Honestly, there's not much hope for him.
1DI0002821	Maybe you can. Feel free to take a look at him. But don't get in over your head. He's got some pretty nasty injuries.
1DI0002822	I doubt it. I've dealt with dozens of battlefield injuries at this point, and the best I've been able to do is keep him knocked out.
1DI0002823	I keep him alive because he's my friend. That's how we work around here -- we watch out for each other. I wouldn't expect you to understand.
1DI0002824	I told you, I keep him alive because he's my friend. That's how we work around here -- we watch out for each other.
1DI0002825	Maybe. But I'd rather die as a moron who cares for my friends than be a heartless jerk like you.
1DI0002826	No. It isn't. Not to me.
1DI0002827	I'm sorry, it's just been hard. When I managed to save him, I though there might be a chance...
1DI0002828	But now, it just looks like he's going to die like the others. And... I just can't bring myself to deal with it.
1DI0002829	Yeah. Let's do that.
1DI0002830	There was a Super Mutant attack recently and where there's one big ugly, there are ten more just waiting to grab you by the throat.
1DI0002831	Then the slavers will come and pick off what's left of your carcass, and drag any survivors to Paradise Falls.
1DI0002832	Skulk up toward Germantown, near the police station. They always come from that direction.
1DI0002833	Nearby. Slavers move quick and come from all directions. Someone else might know where they nest.
1DI0002834	Don't think you'll scare anyone here. You could shoot down everyone in town, and I wouldn't flinch.
1DI0002835	You live in Bigtown; you learn to accept death.
1DI0002838	We're under attack, again! Everyone get down!
1DI0002839	Big talk, killer. Why don't you leave, and let me watch out for people less discriminating than yourself.
1DI0002840	There isn't anything here that hasn't been destroyed or dragged away. You're better off scavenging the dead out in the wasteland.
1DI0002841	Wow. That's ... you saved my life! Thanks. You're a good person, you know that?
1DI0002842	Oh, yeah, sure. I understand. Here. That's all I have.
1DI0002843	Alright. I'll be careful. I promise.
1DI0002844	Ah, shit.
1DI0002845	Oh, uh, okay. Whatever you say.
1DI0002846	Don't you judge me! It's not my fault that the only guys in this town are liars and jerks!
1DI0002847	"Oh, you can't break up with me, we're all going to die soon!" Well, duh, why do you think I'm breaking up with you!
1DI0002848	When I die, the last thing I want to worry about in my afterlife is breaking up with my once-alive boyfriend. Priorities!
1DI0002849	Oh, man, don't even go there. You'd think a girl like that would be more, you know, "adventurous." But that's a dry well, my friend.
1DI0002850	All she does is talk about how she hates everyone else or how dark her clothing is. A guy can only take so much of that before he snaps.
1DI0002851	Poor Pappy got the worst of it. I swear, he's gotten even more depressed since she dumped him for me. As if being here wasn't bad enough.
1DI0002852	We did? Wow, that's news to me. How long was I unconscious, again?
1DI0002853	She didn't, you know, do anything to me while I was out? Did she? That might explain those weird dreams...
1DI0002854	I told her things would be safe here. How was I supposed to know all those stories were bunk? Then she dumped me, called me a liar.
1DI0002855	I was lied to myself, alright! Well, that didn't matter to her. Then she started dating Flash and got all spooky. Good riddance.
1DI0002856	Oh, that. I know all about that nonsense. Flash isn't the smartest cookie in the jar, but he deserved better than Bittercup.
1DI0002857	She wouldn't be so bad if she just faced reality, instead of doing that whole "spooky girl" routine.
1DI0002858	That big moron, Flash, thinks he's in charge. All he really does is listen to what Red tells him. That's all anyone here really does.
1DI0002859	And now Red's gone, taken by those Mutants. That's how we'll all end up eventually.
1DI0002860	No one's really in charge of Bigtown. There's nothing much to be in charge of.
1DI0002861	Red always has good ideas, though! She came up with the whole plan to build the barricades around the town.
1DI0002862	But those... things took her. I hope she's okay. I don't know what we'd do without Red.
1DI0002863	I guess I am. I've got the guns and the guts. At least, I'm pretty sure I do...
1DI0002864	I wish Red were here. She always knew how to handle outsiders and traders and stuff. Why did the Mutants have to take her?
1DI0002865	Only the winds and dirt-piles of the wasteland.
1DI0002866	Flash walks around the town with his gun, trying to watch out for mutants. He should watch the horizon more, then he'd see them.
1DI0002867	Red, the doctor, is the one to really go to. Too bad the Mutants took her in the last attack. Another victim to add to their list.
1DI0002868	I'm about as in charge as a mother leading her kids out of a warzone. This isn't exactly a nice little city with a mayor and town council.
1DI0002869	Just a bunch of children who had to turn into adults too fast. If only we were all little again...
1DI0002870	You mean Dusty? Never talks about himself much. Never talks about anything much.
1DI0002871	We used to take turns, but Dusty started guarding the gate night and day. Little weird, but I'm not complaining.
1DI0002872	Well, I mainly hang around Pappy. He's not such a bad guy. You should have seen him when he first got here, so bright and positive.
1DI0002873	I ... just didn't have the heart to tell him at first, you know? How frightening this place really is. Everyone figures it out eventually.
1DI0002874	Everyone's dead or dying. Now leave me alone.
1DI0002875	You just think you can order people around, huh? You're like Flash. You think you're in charge, but you're not.
1DI0002876	Kimba says we should get along, but we're all gonna just gonna end up like Timebomb: dying on a table in Red's clinic.
1DI0002877	Red and Kimba won't talk to me, just because I used to date Pappy and Flash! They're so jealous!
1DI0002878	Maybe that thing I had with Timebomb was wrong, but still! I don't need them! I'll do whatever I want!
1DI0002879	Oh, yeah! I can tell you all about them, if you want. Let's see...
1DI0002880	Red's the doctor. Flash is on day patrol. Bittercup is on night patrol. Kimba, Pappy, and Shorty scavenge for food. Dusty guards the gate...
1DI0002881	At least, that's kinda how things got settled. Everyone sort of picks their own work here, you know? No mayor or anything.
1DI0002883	Was there something else, then?
1DI0002884	Certainly.
1DI0002885	More than anyone else, I dare say. Certainly enough to know they're the greatest threat the Capital Wasteland has ever faced.
1DI0002886	The Brotherhood of Steel has encountered the Enclave before, you see. Over thirty years ago, back in California.
1DI0002887	Then, they were led by a President Richardson. Now we've got this Eden to contend with.
1DI0002888	It matters not -- now, as before, they seek to control and destroy, all in the guise of restoring order. Your father, I fear, was just the beginning.
1DI0002889	It's been over twenty years since we arrived. And we've been struggling to contain and eradicate the Super Mutants for nearly as long.
1DI0002890	With the arrival of the Enclave, I have a terrible feeling the Super Mutants are the least of our worries.
1DI0002891	We arrived here in '55. Established ourselves in the Citadel within the first few months. The Elder has kept us busy since then.
1DI0002892	The Brotherhood is an old organization, going back to the years just after the war. We are but a part of it. What would you like to know?
1DI0002893	What more did you want to know?
1DI0002894	I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person.
1DI0002896	The Brotherhood began on the West Coast, and exists there still. We were dispatched to this location many years ago.
1DI0002897	In truth, the Brotherhood of Steel has been struggling for years, both here and back home.
1DI0002898	Honor, truth, courage -- these virtues seem to have little meaning in these troubled times, I'm afraid.
1DI0002899	The Brotherhood of Steel is bigger than what you see here. We're only a small... division, you could say.
1DI0002900	But that's a bit of a sore subject around here.
1DI0002901	You're an outsider. I don't expect you to understand.
1DI0002902	We live and die by our dedication to the Brotherhood. To go against orders...
1DI0002903	It's not something that's done. I appreciate that Lyons believes he is doing what is right, but he should never have disobeyed orders.
1DI0002904	And now look where it's gotten us. Forces dwindled, Super Mutants on one side, Enclave on the other. We can barely take care of ourselves.
1DI0002905	Indeed it is. Especially when they refuse any attempts at communication.
1DI0002906	Lines of communication were severed years ago. The Western Elders have washed their hands of us.
1DI0002907	He's in charge of this detachment, yes. He's not in charge of the Brotherhood.
1DI0002908	As loyal as I am to the man, I can't overlook the fact that he disobeyed orders, and it cost us.
1DI0002909	The West Coast cut us off completely, once they saw what was going on. So now we're on our own. No communications, no reinforcements.
1DI0002910	We can't even beat the Super Mutants, and now we're expected to defend against the Enclave? Alone? The situation is... less than ideal.
1DI0002911	No need to apologize.
1DI0002912	You are an outsider. You had no way of knowing.
1DI0002913	It wasn't why we were sent here. Good or bad has nothing to do with it.
1DI0002914	Lyons knew that, but ignored it. He decided it was more important to save the people here than to obey orders from his superiors.
1DI0002915	For years he'd try and persuade them to send reinforcements and supplies, all the while stringing them along, saying he was sticking to the mission.
1DI0002916	Finally, things came to a head. Lyons directly refused orders, and so the West Coast cut us off. No communications, no reinforcements.
1DI0002917	If you insist. What do you want to know?
1DI0002918	We were dispatched with a specific mission. We were sent to locate and secure any technology remaining from before the war.
1DI0002919	Like our robotic monstrosity. That was our greatest find. Damn thing still doesn't work, but at least it's ours.
1DI0002920	But those damned Super Mutants... They changed things. Lyons changed.
1DI0002921	He decided they were a threat. Not just to us, but to everyone. And so he altered the mission.
1DI0002922	Finding the source of the mutants and putting a stop to them was his goal. Our original mission became an afterthought. We've failed both.
1DI0002923	Some did not approve of the Elder's decisions. Initially, they followed because we are all taught to follow the Elders.
1DI0002924	The West Coast, unless something has changed.
1DI0002925	There's been no contact with them for the last several years.
1DI0002926	There's also a small detachment in Chicago, but they're off the radar. Gone rogue. Long story.
1DI0002927	I'm here for two reasons. One, Lyons needs me. He always has, just as much as I need him. We've been through a lot together, he and I.
1DI0002928	Two... Take a look around you. Access to this kind of technology, and the benefits it could provide to the Brotherhood, is immeasurable.
1DI0002929	No, not everyone. But for a variety of reasons, those who disagree are no longer with us.
1DI0002930	Much has happened in the 23 years since we left the west coast. Our mission has changed in that time.
1DI0002931	The changes have not all been pleasant, and have had significant repercussions.
1DI0002932	Predominantly because the Elder won't like some of what I have to say.
1DI0002933	But fine, I'll discuss it. What do you want to know?
1DI0002934	Vault 87? Where you found the G.E.C.K.? We've never been able to penetrate the radiation surrounding that area...
1DI0002935	This information is invaluable! Well done!
1DI0002936	Would you believe... "no"? It's pathetic, really, considering we've been fighting those abominations for nearly twenty years.
1DI0002937	In all that time, all we've managed to do is contain the threat. Hold them back, so they don't overrun every blasted settlement out here.
1DI0002938	But we don't really "know" anything. Where they're from, why they've infested the D.C. ruins.
1DI0002939	And now here we are, holed up in our Citadel. Low on resources, low on troops. It's enough to make an old man so very... tired.
1DI0002940	Oh? Have you learned something?
1DI0002941	My child, you seem to have learned more in the past week than I have in twenty years!
1DI0002942	Ah, now that's the real question, isn't it?
1DI0002943	Our orders were, and are, to acquire any and all advanced technology. And we have, to the best of our abilities.
1DI0002944	But when I realized the extent of the Super Mutant threat, I felt it was my responsibility to aid the people in their struggle against them.
1DI0002945	Unfortunately, my superiors back west disagree with my assessment of the situation. They feel I've grown too "attached" to the local populace.
1DI0002946	And they're right.
1DI0002947	In any event, the Enclave's arrival changes everything...
1DI0002948	Well, that all depends on who you ask.
1DI0002949	Lyons will tell you it's because we're protecting the poor, innocent people of the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0002950	Most others here will tell you the same thing. They'll do anything for that man.
1DI0002951	Gotta be careful, using a slave as a bodyguard. Most aren't exactly motivated to keep you alive, you know what I mean?
1DI0002952	You're in luck -- it turns out my girl Clover is just the right little package for you.
1DI0002953	Have you seen this place? I've got all the guards a body would ever need. Even a body as fabulous as mine.
1DI0002954	I'll tell you why: because Clover is the craziest girl I've ever seen. And I'm an expert on crazy girls.
1DI0002955	Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash.
1DI0002956	And for the low cost of a thousand caps, Miss Clover could be crazy for you.
1DI0002957	I don't think Clover's going to be used-up any time soon. That girl's got the devil in her. And she's crazy, to boot.
1DI0002960	Any time you need some company, she'll be here.
1DI0002961	I ought to sic Clover on you, just to show who's boss.
1DI0002962	But you're right. She makes the other girls nervous. And when they're nervous, I'm nervous.
1DI0002963	So go ahead and have fun with Clover. She's your problem, now!
1DI0002964	You don't know the half of it, friend.
1DI0002965	Clover's all yours now... have fun, you two!
1DI0002966	Trust me, she's worth every cap.
1DI0002967	Then good luck finding someone who'd risk their life for yours. Not something a sane person would do these days, is it?
1DI0002968	When they're in town, you can find the caravan trader out front of the town.
1DI0002969	They say it's a good way to catch a visitor's eye.
1DI0002970	They usually sell their stuff out front of the town. Never seem to stick around for long, though.
1DI0002971	I swear, those boys can't tolerate staying in one place for too long.
1DI0002972	You can find them out front. If you didn't see them coming in, that probably means they're all out on trips.
1DI0002973	If you're not in a hurry, you can wait a day or two. They'll be back around in time.
1DI0002974	Glad to help, glad to help!
1DI0002975	Uncle Roe and I live in the old town hall, and Mr. Porter runs the diner across the street. It's not really a big place, you know?
1DI0002976	Sure thing. Where ya headed?
1DI0002977	No problem. What're you looking for?
1DI0002978	Busy. Go ask someone else.
1DI0002980	See you 'round.
1DI0002981	Stay out of trouble.
1DI0002982	You'll want to talk with Joe Porter, over in Dot's Diner.
1DI0002983	I don't know who Dot was, but I'm sure Porter's food does her memory proud!
1DI0002984	You certainly came to the right person. What'd you like?
1DI0002985	Go talk with Porter, over in the Diner. He'll set you right for food.
1DI0002986	Understood, understood. A man doesn't get to be my age without learning when not to pry.
1DI0002987	Long as your business doesn't hurt ours, you're welcome to stay. Otherwise... Well, there's no need to get into unpleasantness, is there?
1DI0002988	Damn near all of 'em, depending on which caravan's in town! Guns, armor, food, junk, pretty much everyone swings by the old circle, eventually.
1DI0002989	Everyone but Slavers, that is. It's a hassle to transport their wares, as they say. Just as well, eh? Anything else I can do to welcome you to town?
1DI0002990	Sounds like you've never spent a day mucking out Brahmin pens with a busted shovel.
1DI0002991	My uncle says it'll build character. Mostly, it just builds stink.
1DI0002992	We do our best. Well, Dom and Roe do their best. I just make sure they've got enough food so they can keep on doing their best.
1DI0002993	You ever find yourself starving around here, drop by Dot's Diner. We don't charge much, but don't expect any more freebies.
1DI0002994	Sounds like a good plan. Keeps the traders happy, that way. And it means Machete and I get to save on ammo.
1DI0002995	Fine, hi, whatever. I'm Machete, and I've got better things to do than talk with you. Scram.
1DI0002996	Most of the caravans that come through, their fondest desire is to spend a few days off the road and to get a full stomach.
1DI0002997	We've got good food in the diner, and we try to keep it nice and peaceful here. When that's an option, of course.
1DI0002998	First clue was that you didn't shoot me. Most troublemakers I meet are just starving folks down on their luck. So, stop the starve, stop the trouble.
1DI0002999	I can save a whole lot of trouble that way. Plus, if you're still planning on raising hell, losing out on a drink is the last of my worries!
1DI0003000	Sorry. I mean, I'm Derek. Welcome to Canterbury, Miss. Commons. Canterbury Commons. Miss.
1DI0003001	When I can find time for it, sure. In the guarding business, it's the personal touches that make all the difference.
1DI0003002	Anyway, welcome to town, don't cause trouble, threats of violent justice, so on, so forth. You look like you know the drill.
1DI0003003	This is Canterbury Commons, where dirty, old lechers get rid of everything they picked up on the road. Unless it's not treatable, that is.
1DI0003004	And I'm Machete - Dom and me make sure nobody starts anything stupid in town. Keep that in mind, okay?
1DI0003005	In that case, perhaps you ought to leave town, stranger.
1DI0003006	That'd save Dom the cost of ammo, and it'd save you the cost of being dead. Now, good day.
1DI0003007	In that case, I'm sure you'll find it was providence that brought you here!
1DI0003008	Why, have a talk with any trader in town, and I'm sure you'll find just the thing you didn't even realize you needed!
1DI0003009	Huh. Why'd you want to do that?
1DI0003010	Sure, fine, whatever.
1DI0003011	Sorry, but our water purifier's been on backorder for about two hundred years.
1DI0003012	Unless you're here to make the delivery, I suggest you be glad for what you've got.
1DI0003013	Sure, you do that. We can take turns shooting each other, teams are "the whole damned town" versus "your face." Our team's got a winning record.
1DI0003014	Now, if we're done with this little pissing contest, I've got to get back to work. But I can tell we're just going to be best friends forever.
1DI0003015	And it sounds like your tongue's going to get itself cut out if you keep bothering me, man. Get lost.
1DI0003016	Yeah, maybe. But you need one to keep some of those caravaners in line. And to keep them from getting too friendly, if you catch my drift.
1DI0003017	Even in a nice place like this, a girl's best friend is a good knife, right?
1DI0003018	I guess, sure. I'll keep an eye out for any hidden depths, okay?
1DI0003019	Well, if you figure it out, be sure to let me know, okay? I'm kind of busy.
1DI0003020	Well, hope you had fun with that.
1DI0003021	Whoa, calm down there. Attitude like that'll just get someone hurt... plus, it puts the locals on edge.
1DI0003022	Relax, girl. We're not in a war zone, we're just making sure the market's safe. Stop scaring the locals, okay?
1DI0003023	Good to hear it. I'm not giving up this whole "living" habit, not at my age. Keep it up.
1DI0003024	Well, you be sure to let us know when we are, all right?
1DI0003025	Can't let our guard down, sir! That's when people cause trouble.
1DI0003026	The locals could use a little scaring, sir! Bunch of fat, coward traders...
1DI0003027	Girl, if you don't relax a little, you're going to snap in half. Now, get going, before you take someone's head off.
1DI0003028	Lady, if you don't calm down, I'm going to let Derek know about your crush on him. That'll give you something else to think about.
1DI0003029	Good guess! I was the toughest defender they ever saw in Lamplight. I earned my nickname fighting off a Mole Rat with a knife big as my arm.
1DI0003030	When I left, I figured I'd pass on a cushy place like Big Town. I ended up here, Dom took me on as a guard, and that's that.
1DI0003031	It was okay.
1DI0003032	I suppose it was fine.
1DI0003034	It wasn't anything much. But thanks!
1DI0003035	Well, have any big plans for the day?
1DI0003036	You never know what the day may hold, eh boy?
1DI0003037	Well, no worries. Maybe tomorrow will be more exciting, eh? But not too exciting, I hope! Ha!
1DI0003038	Well, there's always tomorrow, isn't there? At least, one hopes, eh? Ha!
1DI0003039	You oughta be proud - that's hard work. So why do you look so blue?
1DI0003040	I mean it - that's hard work. But you look like you got something on your mind. What's up?
1DI0003041	I guess.
1DI0003042	Dunno.
1DI0003043	It's nothing. Just... You think Machete might like me?
1DI0003044	Nothing's wrong. It's just... you think there's a chance Machete might think I'm cool? Like, maybe when I'm older?
1DI0003045	I guess that explains all that! I think she might, Derek, somewhere down in there.
1DI0003046	Oh man, just like when I was a kid! Maybe you ought to go talk to her, Derek.
1DI0003047	No, no, never mind. Pretend I didn't say anything.
1DI0003048	Wait, no... I mean, forget I brought it up.
1DI0003049	Hah! Damn near everything, I suspect! I founded the place myself, and I'm the reason this place stays fat and happy.
1DI0003050	It's okay, I guess. I heard it's safer than most places, because the raiders don't bother us. But I've never been anywhere else, so I don't know.
1DI0003051	Best place I ever worked in, and I guess I've worked about everywhere there is.
1DI0003052	We get some weird types passing through, but it's stable enough for a guy to make an honest living. I don't really see what more a man could ask for.
1DI0003053	Canterbury's a good town. Roe's done a damned good job setting up the place, and no one can handle the day-to-day details like him.
1DI0003054	But when it comes to the big stuff, that's when he needs a little help. That's where I come in.
1DI0003055	This whole place would fall apart if it weren't for Dom and me keeping anyone from causing too much trouble.
1DI0003056	Fat, old Roe may think he runs the place, but it's only because Dom lets the idiot.
1DI0003057	Because I asked them to, I suspect. I grew up in these trade caravans; known most of them my whole life.
1DI0003058	I founded this place with my sister Daisy, back in the day. Perfect stop along the caravan circuit.
1DI0003059	Life and death matters, putting down thieves, protecting people from raiders who are shortsighted or stupid enough to attack, that sort of thing.
1DI0003060	Pretty much, anything the man can't solve by talking at it. And don't misunderstand, he can solve a lot of things that way.
1DI0003061	I'm about the rarest thing out here in the Wastes: a mercenary who lived long enough to retire.
1DI0003062	I used to sell my services around here, so it was a natural place to settle down. Not a bad sort of retirement, honestly.
1DI0003063	They're just small caravans that make rounds through the Wastes, hawking their wares from Paradise Falls to Rivet City.
1DI0003064	They won't trade with anyone who's hit their friends, but that's about as organized as they get.
1DI0003065	Quite organized, now. Thanks to your guidance, of course! They still travel independently, but I keep track of their investments and such.
1DI0003066	They make more profits, and supplies get to those that need them most, so everyone wins. Such is the magic of economics!
1DI0003067	If you're done asking questions, I'm sure there's something I should be keeping an eye on.
1DI0003068	Anytime, my friend. I could talk about my little Canterbury 'till doomsday.
1DI0003069	Course that came and went already, didn't it?
1DI0003070	You can usually find one of the trade caravans at the entrance to town. They come through every day or two.
1DI0003071	Other than them, Porter's always got food for sale down at the diner.
1DI0003072	Take a look, let me know what you want.
1DI0003073	Only the best, hand-picked from the Wastes... for what that's worth.
1DI0003074	Tell me what you need, and maybe I've got your fix.
1DI0003075	Let's see what the good doctor has in his magic bag, shall we?
1DI0003076	Nothing but the highest quality leftovers, junk, and crap!
1DI0003077	Crazy Wolfgang's got just what you need! Assuming you need the random junk that I've got.
1DI0003078	It's my pleasure to offer hot death in a variety of exciting flavors - take your pick!
1DI0003079	Please, enjoy my selection of high-quality problem-solvers!
1DI0003080	Have a look, see if anything calls out to you.
1DI0003081	If the clothes make the man, then here are the means to re-make yourself.
1DI0003082	I'm afraid I haven't heard from Crow for a while, now. I'm afraid he may have fallen victim to foul play.
1DI0003083	Our man Crow handles most armor and clothing out on the trail.
1DI0003084	He grew up a tribal, but he traded in his loincloth for much snappier apparel long ago.
1DI0003085	What sort of clothing and armor would you like to see from Crow?
1DI0003086	It takes a fair amount of capital to expand into higher quality material, you know.
1DI0003087	Improving Crow's wardrobe would require a one-time investment of, say, 200 caps.
1DI0003088	Crow's armor is already rather extensive, but I'm sure it could be even more impressive... for a one time investment of 500 caps.
1DI0003089	At this point, the merchandise of our man Crow is the best in the Wasteland. I fear it's beyond improvement with further investments.
1DI0003090	Well, your financial advice has never steered us wrong before. Done!
1DI0003091	Excellent! I'll send word to Crow right away.
1DI0003092	Yes, it is. But if you don't have the capital, it'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
1DI0003093	Hmm. I suspect you're right. Done!
1DI0003094	Isn't it, though? I'll send this right along to Crow.
1DI0003095	Pricey, but worth it. Perhaps you can do so later, when you have the proper funds on hand.
1DI0003097	I'm afraid the good doctor hasn't reported in for quite a while. Quite unfortunate, really.
1DI0003098	Ah, then you'll be wanting Doc Hoff. Or "the good doctor," as he prefers.
1DI0003099	He prescribes everything from a good meal to stimpaks to things that'll make your brain get up and dance.
1DI0003100	What sort of better living would you like from the good doctor's chemistry?
1DI0003101	The good doctor's lab equipment isn't cheap. It'll cost about 200 caps for him to offer higher quality material.
1DI0003102	At this point, it would be hard to improve Doc's medicine cabinet without a significant investment.
1DI0003103	Say, 500 caps should suffice for him to offer a whole cornucopia of pharmacopoeia.
1DI0003104	As much as it hurts me to say it, there's really only so much that money can buy. The good doctor's supply cannot be improved at this point.
1DI0003106	Excellent! I'll send word to the good doctor right away.
1DI0003109	Isn't it, though? I'll send this right along to him.
1DI0003112	All right, you're the boss!
1DI0003113	No word from Crazy Wolfgang for some time now. With him, it could mean anything, but I don't have a good feeling about it.
1DI0003114	That'd be Crazy Wolfgang: he does repairs and general supplies. But he prefers to call himself a "junk dealer."
1DI0003115	As he says, he's "overjoyed to assist those who have a deep need for his... junk." He's just like that. Says it catches people's attention.
1DI0003116	I'm sure Crazy Wolfgang would be just delighted to hear we're discussing his junk.
1DI0003117	With an investment of about 200 caps, I'm sure he could improve the quality of his materials. Or at least, offer more of them.
1DI0003118	At this point, it would require another pack brahmin to carry his wares. But for 500 caps, I think he could offer more.
1DI0003119	At the moment, Wolfgang's practically carrying an entire junkyard with him.
1DI0003120	Anything more, and he'll have trouble with the "traveling" part of being a traveling salesman.
1DI0003122	Excellent! I'll see to it right away.
1DI0003125	Isn't it, though? I'll inform Wolfgang immediately.
1DI0003128	My, my! When it comes to sales, I can see even I've got a few things I could learn from you!
1DI0003129	Well, in that case, I can act as your representative to the caravans. They'll listen to me, and I'll listen to you.
1DI0003130	Just let me know what you suggest in the way of specialties, and I'll let them know to focus on that area.
1DI0003131	Hmm... I think you're right. And the specialization might play to their eccentricities. It could work!
1DI0003132	And I could act as their representative in this matter. Goodness knows, I've known them for years, so I should be able to speak for them.
1DI0003134	Madam, you flatter me! I'm but a humble man of this small community.
1DI0003135	But, since it's a trader community, I suppose I can call in a few favors with the caravans. I suppose I am rather persuasive in that way.
1DI0003136	So, you just let me know what you'd like to see from the caravans, and I'll let them know what to focus on.
1DI0003137	That... That certainly is quite a lot of caps. It really would be a shame for those to go to waste, wouldn't it?
1DI0003138	I suppose I can call in a few favors with the caravans, talk with them about their inventory. Must keep the customers happy, right?
1DI0003140	Maybe, but if they were more closely organized, the costs of organization might outweigh the benefits.
1DI0003141	The economics of this sort of trading operation can be rather more complex than your standard store in a settlement, sadly.
1DI0003142	I agree wholeheartedly. I'd hate to unduly burden a dedicated entrepreneur.
1DI0003143	Let me see if I can't hammer this garbage into shape.
1DI0003144	Whatever you've got, I've got just the thing to fix it.
1DI0003145	We used to have a better mechanic, but that didn't work out so well. I'll see what I can do.
1DI0003146	I can give it a look, sure.
1DI0003147	I'll see what I can do.
1DI0003148	Easy. I've got a knack for this sort of thing, you know!
1DI0003149	I'll see if I can't take a whack at it.
1DI0003150	For a price, sure.
1DI0003151	Let's take a look and see.
1DI0003152	Yes, but only if it wants to be repaired.
1DI0003153	Maybe. Let's take a look.
1DI0003154	Sure thing. Interested in any of the other traders?
1DI0003155	Lucky Harith kind of dropped off the map. Or, knowing his wares, he may have burnt a whole straight through it.
1DI0003156	Then you'd be looking for Lucky Harith, adventurer, martial artist, and occasional collector of the most deadly items known to mankind.
1DI0003157	He's a bit of an eccentric, but he deals in more weaponry than you can shake a sharp stick at. In fact, he's probably got a sharp stick, too.
1DI0003158	What sort of death-dealing implements would you like to see from Harith?
1DI0003159	Harith's got quite a lot of weapons, but I'm sure he could improve his stock. An investment of 200 caps should see to that nicely.
1DI0003160	If Harith were a less-reputable man, I'm sure he could use his armory to collect even more weapons.
1DI0003161	But he's a merchant, not a raider, so it's legitimate means only. Like a legitimate investment of 500 caps.
1DI0003162	That simply isn't feasible, I'm afraid. Harith's gear already rivals some mercenary armies - anything further would be asking for trouble.
1DI0003164	Excellent! Harith will be delighted! He usually is by most things, really.
1DI0003167	An investment in weaponry is usually returned in short order, after all. I'll inform Harith.
1DI0003170	Let's see... Are you a boy or a girl?
1DI0003171	It's a girl? A girl! We've got a daughter, Catherine! A beautiful, healthy baby girl!
1DI0003172	It's a boy? A boy! We've got a son, Catherine! A beautiful, healthy baby boy!
1DI0003173	You've got a bright future ahead of you, sweetie. I'm sure of it...
1DI0003174	You've got a bright future ahead of you, son. I'm sure of it...
1DI0003175	Look at you, look at you... Hi, there. I'm your daddy, little guy. Daddy. You're going to need a name, aren't you?
1DI0003176	Look at you, look at you... Hi, there. I'm your daddy, sweetheart. Daddy. You're going to need a name, aren't you?
1DI0003177	Your mother and I have been talking. What do you think about...
1DI0003178	That's a good name. Don't you think? Fits you perfectly.
1DI0003179	Looks like they've finished the gene projection. Let's see what you'll look like when you're all grown up.
1DI0003180	You're going to look a lot like your dad.
1DI0003181	See that, Catherine?
1DI0003182	It's a big world out there, honey, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
1DI0003183	It's a big world out there, son, full of all sorts of people. What about you? What kind of person are you going to be?
1DI0003184	You're just...
1DI0003185	Catherine? Catherine! She's in cardiac arrest! Start compressions! Get the baby out of here! Move. Move!
1DI0003186	One, one thousand. Two, one thousand.... Come on!
1DI0003187	Hang on, Catherine! Hang on....
1DI0003188	Oh... Oh James... We did it... A son... Our beautiful son...
1DI0003189	Oh... Oh James... We did it... A daughter... Our beautiful daughter...
1DI0003190	Ohhh... Very strapping... Ha ha ha...
1DI0003191	Ohhh... Beautiful... just like her Daddy... Ha ha ha...
1DI0003192	James? James... Something's... Something's...
1DI0003193	Don't look straight into the light, honey. You'll hurt your eyes. It's just something you get used to down here.
1DI0003194	Don't look straight into the light, pal. You'll hurt your eyes. It's just something you get used to down here.
1DI0003195	Come on over here, sweetie. Come on! Walk to Daddy!
1DI0003196	Come on over here, son. Come on! Walk to Daddy!
1DI0003197	You can make it!
1DI0003198	Just a little farther!
1DI0003199	Over here!
1DI0003200	Come to Daddy!
1DI0003201	You can do it!
1DI0003202	There you go! My goodness! Just a year old, and already walking like a pro.
1DI0003203	Your mother would have been so proud.
1DI0003204	Listen, kiddo, I know you don't like it when Daddy leaves you alone, but I need you to take care of yourself for a minute.
1DI0003205	You just stay here while Daddy runs to his office. You'll be okay, pal. I'll be back in a bit.
1DI0003206	You just stay here while Daddy runs to his office. You'll be okay, honey. I'll be back in a bit.
1DI0003207	Ha ha ha! You're quite the little explorer, aren't you? Serves me right for trying to pen you in!
1DI0003208	Come on over here. I want to show you something.
1DI0003209	See that? It was your mother's favorite passage. It's from the Bible. Revelation 21:6.
1DI0003210	"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
1DI0003211	She always loved that.
1DI0003212	All right. Come on. Let's go see if your little friend Amata wants to play....
1DI0003213	Right. That's exactly what I was thinking.
1DI0003214	Ha ha. Sure he was.
1DI0003215	Anyway, I'm glad you're having a good time. I was afraid he would find some way to ruin your party.
1DI0003216	God, he really is a butthead. Oh well. You can always count on Butch to make an ass of himself. Get it? Ha ha ha.
1DI0003217	You never learn, do you? You can't help shooting your mouth off even when you know it's going to get you a bloody nose.
1DI0003218	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I'd better let everybody else have a turn with the birthday boy.
1DI0003220	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I'd better let everybody else have a turn with the birthday girl. We'll talk later, okay?
1DI0003221	Wow. You're so tough. You'll have to teach me how to do that, sometime.
1DI0003222	He's not worth worrying about anyway. "Most likely to end up a trash burner," right?
1DI0003223	God, what a jerk. I hate him! You'd think he'd be happy he actually got invited to your party.
1DI0003224	I'm sorry. Are you going to be okay? Let's try to just have fun and forget about Butch for a while.
1DI0003225	I know. Butch. What else is there to say, right?
1DI0003226	Hey, forget him. Have fun. It's your birthday party!
1DI0003227	I know. He thinks he's so tough. One of these days we'll figure out a way to get him back, okay?
1DI0003228	That jerk! I can't believe he'd try to ruin your birthday party!
1DI0003229	Oh well. This is Butch we're talking about, right? I guess we should have expected it...
1DI0003230	Uh oh, your dad is giving me a look. I guess I'd better give everyone else a chance to talk to you.
1DI0003231	Come on. Don't ask me that. You know he would if I asked, but where would that leave me?
1DI0003232	It's bad enough being the Overseer's daughter. If everyone knew I ran to daddy every time I had a problem, nobody would ever talk to me again.
1DI0003233	We'll think of some way to get Butch back. I promise. But I'm not getting my father involved.
1DI0003234	You're such a liar! Okay, if you're so smart, what did I get you for your birthday?
1DI0003235	You're welcome. But really, your dad did most of it. I just helped with the decorations and stuff.
1DI0003236	Hey, I bet you can't guess what I got you for your birthday. Go on, guess!
1DI0003237	Shut up! And it isn't my fault that Butch and Wally are here. Your dad said we had to invite them.
1DI0003238	Never mind them. Time for your present. What do you think I got you? Go on, try to guess!
1DI0003239	Ha! I knew I'd surprise you. Who's your favorite barbarian? That's right, Grognak! Issue 14, and with no missing pages!
1DI0003240	I found this in a box of my father's old things, believe it or not. Imagine him reading comic books. I guess everybody was ten once.
1DI0003241	Well, I'd better let you get back to "mingling" with your guests. We'll talk later, okay? Happy birthday.
1DI0003242	Gross! I didn't think you even liked girls. And you know what I mean, before you say something rude about me.
1DI0003243	I guess maybe I should give this to someone else... someone who likes Grognak the Barbarian better than Mean Christine...
1DI0003244	The question is, how could you tell the difference? Ha ha ha.
1DI0003245	Gross! I didn't think you even liked boys. Especially not Freddie the Freak. Yuck!
1DI0003246	I guess maybe I should give this to someone else... someone who'd rather curl up with Grognak the Barbarian than Freddie Gomez...
1DI0003248	Okay, okay! One last question: who's your favorite barbarian? That's right, Grognak! Issue 14, and with no missing pages!
1DI0003249	I found this in a box of my father's old things, can you believe it? Kind of weird to think about him reading comic books.
1DI0003250	I guess I'd better let you get back to "mingling" with your guests. We'll talk later, okay? Happy birthday.
1DI0003251	They sure did. My, my. Ten years old already. Why, I can remember helping your dad change your diapers...
1DI0003252	And now, look at you! A great big grown up 10-year-old, with your very own Pip-Boy.
1DI0003253	Since this was such a special occasion, do you know what I did? I wrote you a poem! Just for you. I hope you like it.
1DI0003254	Oh, you are so funny! Ten years old, of course you are -- why, you have your Pip-Boy and everything!
1DI0003255	And do you know what I did? Just for the occasion -- wrote you a poem! I hope you like it.
1DI0003256	Of course you're not five! Ha ha ha. You're a big ten-year-old "man" now, aren't you, with your very own Pip-Boy!
1DI0003258	Oh! Boys will be boys, won't they? Just can't wait to see your present, is that it?
1DI0003259	Well, let's not keep you waiting any longer. I think you're going to like it... it's a poem! Written by me, just for you!
1DI0003260	Of course you can, dearie. There's no need to get impatient! I've got your present right here.
1DI0003261	I think you're going to like it... it's a poem! Written by me, just for you!
1DI0003262	Of course! Run along now, dearie, and have yourself a wonderful birthday!
1DI0003263	Don't be silly! One poem per birthday, that's my rule! Ha ha. If I gave you two, think how jealous Butch would be, ha ha.
1DI0003264	No, really, I wrote it just for you!
1DI0003265	I never just copy one of my old poems... well, there was that one Founder's Day where I couldn't rhyme anything with Overseer...
1DI0003266	But you deserve nothing less than a brand new poem. You can keep it in your Pip-Boy and read it whenever you want!
1DI0003267	"Mrs. Palmer said I didn't have to share"... Who's talking about sharing, moron? I want the whole thing.
1DI0003268	Now are you going to give me that sweetroll, or am I going to give you a knuckle sandwich?
1DI0003269	"How about we share it"... What are you, five? Give me that sweetroll or I'm going to pound you.
1DI0003270	Yeah, right. Thanks, loser. Oh, and happy birthday, ha ha ha ha!
1DI0003271	Gah! I don't want your nerd-cooties! You're going to be sorry you did that. We'll see how tough you are later when the grownups aren't around.
1DI0003272	Oh yeah? We'll see about that.
1DI0003273	Don't you talk about my mom, you little punk!
1DI0003274	You think you're funny? We'll see how funny you are later when I'm pounding on your face. Come on, Paul, this loser ain't worth our time.
1DI0003275	You what?! Dang, I love those sweetrolls Old Lady Palmer makes. You... little... Just stay out of my way, you got it?
1DI0003276	That's fine, son. I'm glad to see you're not letting Butch bully you.
1DI0003277	He's going to be a handful in a few years if his mother doesn't take him in hand.
1DI0003278	Well, no harm done then. Why don't you get back to enjoying your party.
1DI0003279	Good for you. Don't let Butch start to bully you or he'll never stop. I've seen his type before.
1DI0003282	I'm glad to hear it. Once you start letting bullies push you around, you'll never see the end of it.
1DI0003283	Come on now, I bet there's someone else out there with a present for you!
1DI0003284	Why that little... I figured it was him that started it. He's been nothing but trouble since the day he was born.
1DI0003285	You let me handle this. And try to stay out of the way.
1DI0003286	I wish we didn't have to invite him, but there just aren't that many children your age in the Vault.
1DI0003287	In any case, you'll have to learn to deal with bullies. The world is full of people much worse than Butch, I'm afraid.
1DI0003288	But don't let him ruin your birthday. Go on, I bet there's someone else waiting to give you a present!
1DI0003289	Really? Well, if you say so. I'll stay out of it if that's the way you want it.
1DI0003290	But let me give you some advice -- stay away from Butch. He's nothing but trouble.
1DI0003291	Please don't do that. I know you don't like Butch, but if you start picking fights with him, how are you any better?
1DI0003292	Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself, but don't go looking for trouble. There's trouble enough in this world without adding to it.
1DI0003293	Well, now, that's more than enough lecturing for a birthday party! Go on and enjoy yourself.
1DI0003294	You're going to be sorry, you little smartmouth.
1DI0003295	What, is she your best friend now? Hey, Wally, I think Paul's in love...
1DI0003296	What, are you two best friends now? Hey, Wally, I think Paul's gone soft on us.
1DI0003297	Attention everyone! It is time to cut the cake!
1DI0003298	Andy! Wait!
1DI0003299	Oh no...
1DI0003300	We sure can't, unless we want the Overseer beating down our door. Jonas and I have found a place, though. C'mon!
1DI0003301	Easy now. It's only a BB gun, but it's not a toy. Let's go try it out. Jonas and I have found a nice spot for you. Follow me.
1DI0003302	Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, honey.
1DI0003303	Out already? Something wrong with the sights on that thing? Here you go, son.
1DI0003304	Okay, then. You're doing fine. Just aim and shoot. I think you'll be a natural.
1DI0003305	What's gotten into you? Jonas worked hard on your present. The least you could do is be polite for five minutes.
1DI0003306	Nasty little things. They pretty much keep to dark places, though. That's why there are always lights on in the Vault.
1DI0003307	I'd try using that new gun of yours!
1DI0003308	They're pretty easy to kill. More a nuisance than anything else.
1DI0003309	Of course, you could just aim for the head. A good headshot will do a lot of damage to most anything.
1DI0003310	I know you can, and that's good. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You've got to learn to fend for yourself.
1DI0003311	Now, take your time, breathe slowly, sight down the barrel, and squeeze the trigger.
1DI0003312	Of course you can. I'm not always going to be here to take care of you. You're going to have to learn to fend for yourself.
1DI0003314	Hey, Jonas, get a picture of me with the big game hunter!
1DI0003315	Over here, honey!
1DI0003316	Over here, son!
1DI0003317	Careful! It's a Radroach. Think you can take care of that with your BB gun? Just aim and shoot. You'll be fine.
1DI0003318	Happy birthday, pal! I can't believe you're already 10. I'm so proud of you.
1DI0003319	Happy birthday, honey! I can't believe you're already 10. I'm so proud of you.
1DI0003320	If only your mother....
1DI0003321	Enjoy your party! You're only 10 once, so have fun!
1DI0003322	The Overseer gave you your Pip-Boy, and you're old enough to do some work. So I figure you're old enough for this.
1DI0003323	Your own BB gun! It's a little old, but it should work perfectly.
1DI0003324	Jonas found it down here. It was in pretty rough shape -- took us a good three months to find the parts to get it working again.
1DI0003325	You know how tough it is to find a spring that small? Good thing Butch "misplaced" that switchblade of his. Ha ha ha!
1DI0003326	So, what do you think? Want to give it a try?
1DI0003327	Since when? Regardless, I think you'll like this one. You're getting older, and you've got your Pip-Boy. I figure you're old enough for this, too.
1DI0003332	Couldn't have done it without Jonas' help. You make sure to thank him.
1DI0003333	You're welcome, pal. Happy birthday.
1DI0003334	You're welcome, sweetie. Happy birthday.
1DI0003335	I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe you haven't grown up as much as I'd thought. If you don't want it, I'm sure I can find someone who does.
1DI0003337	All right, Butch.
1DI0003338	Hey, Officer Gomez. Nice party, huh?
1DI0003339	Can it. I've had it with you, Butch. Your mother is going to hear about this little incident.
1DI0003340	What'd he tell you, it was my fault? You didn't hear what he said to me!
1DI0003341	What'd she tell you, it was my fault? You didn't hear what she said to me!
1DI0003342	I'm not going to tolerate any more of your bullying.
1DI0003343	Fine. Tell my mom. Big deal. Are we done?
1DI0003344	For now. Just remember, I'm keeping my eye on you.
1DI0003345	Jonas?
1DI0003346	Hey doc. We're all set down here.
1DI0003347	Surprise!
1DI0003354	Ha ha ha. You sure are! Pip-Boy and everything, look at that!
1DI0003355	If you can wait just one more minute, I think your dad will want to give you the surprise himself.
1DI0003356	Oh, I see, now that you're ten you're all business. Well then, missy, we'd better get to it.
1DI0003357	Happy birthday, by the way. Hang on one more minute, I think I hear someone coming.
1DI0003358	Oh, I see, now that you're ten you're all business. Well then, mister, we'd better get to it.
1DI0003360	Hey, relax! I was just teasing.
1DI0003361	Listen, now that you're ten you don't have to take guff like that from grownups any more. Got it? Ha ha ha.
1DI0003362	Hold on one more minute. I think your dad will want to give you the surprise himself.
1DI0003363	Hey, you don't turn 10 every day! Now go on and let me see you shoot something.
1DI0003364	Maybe so, but you still better not let the Overseer see you carrying that around. That's a real gun as far as he's concerned.
1DI0003365	Oh, hey, don't worry about it. You might be surprised how much fun you can have if you give it a chance, though.
1DI0003366	Smile!
1DI0003367	Stanley, you turned the lights on too fast. You blinded the poor kid!
1DI0003368	Butch! What do you think you're doing? Leave him alone!
1DI0003369	Butch! What are you doing? Hitting a girl, and on her birthday for heaven's sakes!
1DI0003370	You all right, son? He didn't hurt you, did he?
1DI0003371	Did he hurt you, honey?
1DI0003372	Such a nice polite young man you are! Don't ever lose your gift of speaking your mind so directly. We could use more of that down here.
1DI0003373	Here you go, a nice sweetroll that I baked for you just this morning. And it's all for you -- you're the birthday boy, no sharing required today!
1DI0003374	Such a nice polite young lady you are! Don't ever lose your gift of speaking your mind so directly. We could use more of that down here.
1DI0003375	Here you go, a nice sweetroll that I baked for you just this morning. And it's all for you -- you're the birthday girl, no sharing required today!
1DI0003376	Fiddlesticks! What 10-year-old doesn't like presents?
1DI0003377	I was 10 once, believe it or not! My goodness, the Vault was practically crowded back then.
1DI0003378	Not like today. So few young people now... But here I am rambling on again, and you listening so politely.
1DI0003379	Here you go, a nice sweetroll that I baked for you just this morning. And it's all for you -- no sharing required today!
1DI0003380	Well now! Young people were more polite back in my day. Respected their elders. Of course, we had a real Overseer back then. Worthy of respect.
1DI0003381	Not like that one over there, with his rules and his secrets. Why, I have half a mind to just up and tell you...
1DI0003382	Oh my, there I go again with my old lady talk and you still waiting patiently for your present.
1DI0003383	I suppose you could have asked more politely, but it is still your birthday, so here you go: a nice sweetroll I baked just for you.
1DI0003384	Can you believe it? He is growing up so fast.
1DI0003385	Can you believe it? She is growing up so fast.
1DI0003386	Don't presume too much on her friendship, young man. I'm still the Overseer, and I'm still in charge of this Vault and everyone in it.
1DI0003387	Hmm. That's not what I hear. But perhaps she'll set a good example for you. There's still plenty of time for you to make something of yourself.
1DI0003388	I do not allow the fact that Amata is my daughter to compromise my position as Overseer.
1DI0003389	I gave her all the appropriate paternal encouragement, of course, but I could not contribute extra vault resources.
1DI0003390	That is simply what my position requires. No more, no less. I know Amata understands that perfectly well.
1DI0003391	Enjoy the party, sir?
1DI0003392	Bah, I only showed up because Amata's friends with the brat.
1DI0003393	Give them a few more minutes and then I want that place cleaned up and everybody back to work.
1DI0003394	Sure thing, sir.
1DI0003395	Congratulations, young man! I don't have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
1DI0003396	Congratulations, young lady! I don't have to tell you how special this day is, do I?
1DI0003397	Down here in Vault 101, when you turn 10, well, you're ready to take on your first official Vault responsibilities.
1DI0003398	So here you are. As Overseer, I hereby present to you your very own Pip-Boy 3000! Get used to it.
1DI0003399	You'll be getting your first work assignment tomorrow. Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0003400	Oh my goodness, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. That dear boy is like a son to me.
1DI0003401	Oh my goodness, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. That dear girl is like a daughter to me.
1DI0003402	I'm sure of it, Amata. Never suspected a thing. Now go on and enjoy yourself.
1DI0003403	Oh, really? They're lovely! You did such a splendid job.
1DI0003404	Nonsense. People always enjoy my little speeches. Besides, that friend of yours could use a reminder that life is not all fun and games.
1DI0003405	Argh! This is supposed to be a party! You know, fun. You should try it sometime, Daddy. You might like it.
1DI0003406	Oh, sure, nothing to worry about. Me and Andy got her all fixed up again last night, good as new.
1DI0003407	I wasn't worried. You can fix anything, right? Anyway, I'm glad you could make it.
1DI0003408	Hey, Amata. Uh, thanks for inviting me... Hey, how much longer is it gonna go? I, uh, got some homework I need to finish. You know.
1DI0003409	Um, I don't know. I think it's just started. Can't you just stay for a bit? It'll be lots of fun, I promise.
1DI0003410	I'm glad to be here. I think it's important to keep in touch with the young people. You know, as part of my job. Plus, well, I like parties.
1DI0003411	Uh, sure thing, Officer Gomez. Well, it's been nice chatting with you. Thanks again for coming!
1DI0003412	Of course it is. After all, I helped plan it!
1DI0003413	Sure. Will there be games, though?
1DI0003414	Oh, well. I think so. Maybe pin the tail on... something.
1DI0003415	Yeah. VDS, right? How's that even possible in a 9-year-old?
1DI0003416	I don't know. I never heard of Vault Depressive Syndrome hitting anybody that young before. Uh, we'd better not talk about it here, though.
1DI0003417	Thanks, Daddy. I'm glad you're having a good time.
1DI0003418	It turned out pretty good, didn't it?
1DI0003419	Yeah. I'm glad you're having fun!
1DI0003420	Nice to see the kids having a good time.
1DI0003421	Mmm-hmm. Diner looks great, doesn't it?
1DI0003422	Yep...
1DI0003423	Yeah. Seems like everyone's having a good time.
1DI0003424	Who do you mean, dork-face here? Happy birthday, dork-face! Ha ha ha!
1DI0003425	Little baby went crying to Officer Gomez! Boo hoo!
1DI0003426	Oh man, you already ate the whole thing? I wanted a bite of that.
1DI0003427	Ha ha! Good one Butch. Butthead -- ha ha ha!
1DI0003428	Yeah, we don't want your cooties, right Butch?
1DI0003429	Yeah, we don't need any more dorks around, right Butch?
1DI0003430	I think you made her cry, Butch! Ha ha ha. Little baby gonna cry?
1DI0003431	I think you made him cry, Butch! Ha ha ha. Little baby gonna cry?
1DI0003432	Yeah, go play with your girlfriend. Ha ha ha.
1DI0003433	Yeah, why don't you go play with your dolls and leave us alone.
1DI0003434	Ha ha ha! You told him, Butch!
1DI0003435	Ha ha ha! You told her, Butch!
1DI0003436	As a matter of fact I did. I'm glad you like it. Some may think the A series a bit basic, but I've always preferred them for their reliability.
1DI0003437	Of course it is. Just like everybody else's. They don't make 'em any more now, do they?
1DI0003438	That one I've been saving just for you, though. The A series is a bit heavier than some of the fancier models, but it won't let you down.
1DI0003439	I bet you could drop a bomb on one and it would still work. As a matter of fact, I know you could.
1DI0003440	Get it off? Why in the world would you want to do that? Your Pip-Boy's the best friend you'll ever have!
1DI0003441	Besides, you can't get it off. Biometric seals et cetera. I could tell you some stories about trying to take 'em off the old folks...
1DI0003442	...ah, well, that's hardly a fit subject for a kid's birthday party.
1DI0003443	Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Pretty soon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it.
1DI0003444	Don't you listen to him. The A series may be a bit heavier than the luxury models, but they were built to last.
1DI0003445	Solid as a vault, they are. And I fixed her up myself. Shouldn't need to open her up again for a decade or two.
1DI0003446	Don't mention it.
1DI0003447	Oh yes, I almost forgot. Happy birthday! It's not much, but I hope you like it.
1DI0003448	Here am I going on about your Pip-Boy and I clean forgot about your present!
1DI0003449	Here you go. Happy birthday! It's not much, but I hope you like it.
1DI0003450	Sure, most people don't give a thought to their Pip-Boy as long as it keeps working.
1DI0003451	Well, anyway, I got you this for your birthday. It isn't much and you probably already have one, but there you go. Happy birthday.
1DI0003452	Ummm... the Vault Kings?
1DI0003453	Here's one: "Wally and the Big Cheese." That's you, Butch -- the Big Cheese.
1DI0003454	I still like "The Mackers."
1DI0003455	Isn't being a gang a little stupid? I mean, basically everyone we know is going to be in it.
1DI0003456	How about "Hell's Overseers"? Yeah, I like that.
1DI0003457	I can't believe you didn't like "Hell's Overseers". Better than anything you guys have come up with.
1DI0003458	Oh! Oh! I got it. Oh, man this is a great one. "The Grease Weasels"! What do you guys think?
1DI0003459	Didn't you guys like Grease Weasels?
1DI0003460	Hey, how about the Vault Dwellers? Get it?
1DI0003461	Yeah. I got one. "The Mackers." Super cool, right?
1DI0003462	I don't know. You guys never like any of my ideas anyway.
1DI0003463	If you're so smart, why don't you suggest something.
1DI0003464	Oh, I like that, Butch.
1DI0003465	That's a good one. Best yet, don't you think, Wally?
1DI0003466	Uh, sure. I mean, I really like that one!
1DI0003467	I don't know. Maybe.
1DI0003468	You and your snakes and rats and lizards...
1DI0003469	Yeah, Paul, why don't you introduce us to your new best friend?
1DI0003470	Yeah, Paul, why don't you introduce us to your new girlfriend?
1DI0003471	You mean because we've already got one? Dork.
1DI0003472	Thanks. You've always been a good friend. Try talking to Butch. They'll all do whatever he says.
1DI0003473	Fight my own battles? Sure. Three against one is fair. What's gotten into you?
1DI0003474	I thought we were friends. Turns out you're just as big a jerk as these idiots.
1DI0003475	Don't want to get involved? Thanks a lot.
1DI0003476	Fine. Go. I don't need your help, anyway.
1DI0003477	Butch, stop it! Leave him alone!
1DI0003478	Butch, stop it! Leave her alone!
1DI0003479	Please! Stop fighting!
1DI0003480	Stop it!
1DI0003481	This isn't solving anything!
1DI0003482	I'm not fat!
1DI0003483	But, I'm not fat!
1DI0003484	Stop it! Stop it!
1DI0003486	Stay away from me!
1DI0003487	Back off, Butch!
1DI0003488	Shut up, Butch!
1DI0003489	Go away, you stupid Tunnel Snakes!
1DI0003490	I'm not scared of you, Wally Mack!
1DI0003491	Leave me alone, Wally!
1DI0003494	Yes, um, it's refreshing to see such, ah, youthful enthusiasm.
1DI0003495	Good to know that the G.O.A.T. occasionally gets it right. You know what they say about monkeys and typewriters...
1DI0003496	Well, I'm glad things turned out so well for you. I hope your classmates find their results half as satisfying.
1DI0003497	Ha. Closer to reality than you might think.
1DI0003498	Listen, I was just as obnoxious at your age. I didn't take the G.O.A.T. seriously and look where I ended up.
1DI0003499	Just between you and me? The whole test is a joke.
1DI0003500	If you don't like the results, I can make your G.O.A.T. come out any way you want. Just let me know.
1DI0003504	Well, now that everyone has managed to find the classroom, we can finally get started.
1DI0003505	No talking, and keep your eyes to yourselves.
1DI0003506	Yes, I'm talking to you Mr. DeLoria!
1DI0003507	Unless anyone else has an insightful comment, let's get started.
1DI0003508	Question 1. A frenzied vault scientist runs up to you and yells, "I'm going to put my quantum harmonizer in your photonic resonation chamber!"
1DI0003509	What's your response?
1DI0003510	Question 2. While working as an intern in the clinic, a patient with a strange infection in his foot stumbles through the door.
1DI0003511	The infection is spreading at an alarming rate, but the doctor has stepped out for a while. What do you do?
1DI0003512	Question 3. You discover a young boy lost in the lower levels of the vault.
1DI0003513	He's hungry and frightened, but also appears to be in possession of stolen property. What do you do?
1DI0003514	Question 4. Congratulations! You've made one of the Vault 101 baseball teams. Which position do you prefer?
1DI0003515	Question 5. Your grandmother invites you to tea, but you're surprised when she gives you a pistol, and orders you to kill another vault resident.
1DI0003516	What do you do?
1DI0003517	Question 6. Old Mister Abernathy has locked himself in his quarters again, and you've been ordered to get him out. How do you proceed?
1DI0003518	Question 7. Oh no! You've been exposed to radiation, and a mutated hand has grown out of your stomach! What's the best course of treatment?
1DI0003519	Question 8. A fellow Vault 101 resident is in possession of a Grognak the Barbarian comic book, issue number 1. You want it.
1DI0003520	What's the best way to obtain it?
1DI0003521	Question 9. You decide it would be fun to play a prank on your father. You enter his private restroom when no one is looking, and...
1DI0003522	Question 10. Who is, indisputably, the most important person in Vault 101:
1DI0003523	He who shelters us from the harshness of the atomic Wasteland, and to whom we owe everything we have, including our lives?
1DI0003524	Pencils down, people. That's it. The infamous G.O.A.T.!
1DI0003525	I'm sure most of you didn't find it so bad. Others, well, there are always openings in the maintenance department.
1DI0003526	Don't forget to hand in your tests before you leave. You don't want to know what happens to people who "fail" the G.O.A.T.
1DI0003527	You can have the rest of the day off, to celebrate or to pray, as the situation warrants.
1DI0003528	I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early.
1DI0003529	Well, I'll be damned... That little so-and-so... why didn't I think of that when I was sixteen?
1DI0003530	Didn't work on your dad either, did it?
1DI0003531	Now unless you have something else you want to discuss, take a seat and prepare for the 2274 edition of the G.O.A.T.
1DI0003532	Listen. I like your dad. I might even like you if I wasn't your teacher.
1DI0003533	So here's what I'm going to do. If you want to skip the test, just tell me how you want it to come out and I'll take care of it for you.
1DI0003534	I'm sure you will. Especially since it's multiple choice with no wrong answers...
1DI0003535	We'll start as soon as everyone's found a seat. Good luck.
1DI0003536	Well... all right. Here, take a look.
1DI0003537	Watch your language.
1DI0003538	And yes, I can do it for you. I can even hold your hand if you'd like.
1DI0003539	I just need to know what kinds of things you're interested in.
1DI0003540	Good for you. Don't worry, you'll do fine. As soon as everyone's found a seat, we'll get started.
1DI0003541	A budding science boy, eh? Done and... done. There. You're all set. If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
1DI0003542	I'm sure I didn't just hear you admit to owning an unauthorized weapon. Let's just get this filled out... there. All set.
1DI0003543	If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
1DI0003544	Oooo-kay... I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that... Anyway, done and done. There. You're all set.
1DI0003546	I may know more about your extracurricular activities than you think. But not officially, of course. Officially, I'm completely oblivious.
1DI0003547	Anyway. Done and... done. You're all set. If anyone asks, you took the G.O.A.T. during detention yesterday, okay?
1DI0003548	Get out of my way, you stupid Tunnel Snakes!
1DI0003549	I can show you a real tunnel snake, Amata.
1DI0003550	God, Butch, why don't you just leave me alone.
1DI0003551	What are you going to do, Amata, go run and tell your daddy on us?
1DI0003552	Amata's not fat, she's just 5 feet too short.
1DI0003553	We're gonna run out of rations if Amata keeps eating.
1DI0003554	Gonna go cry to your daddy, fatass?
1DI0003555	You put on a couple of pounds, Amata?
1DI0003556	What's the matter. Daddy's girl gonna cry?
1DI0003558	You think you're special because your daddy is the Overseer?
1DI0003559	Hey, fatso, I got something you can put in your mouth!
1DI0003560	Watch out! Wide load coming through!
1DI0003561	Hey, lardass!
1DI0003562	She thinks she's better than us!
1DI0003563	Tell her, Butch!
1DI0003564	She's nothing, Butch!
1DI0003565	Amata's got more chins than a Chinese phone book!
1DI0003566	Amata's so fat, her clothes have stretch marks!
1DI0003567	Amata's so fat, she broke her leg and gravy poured out!
1DI0003568	Careful. Amata might eat us!
1DI0003569	Been spending some extra time in the diner, Amata?
1DI0003570	Let's go into the storeroom, Amata. I'll show you a good time....
1DI0003571	Daddy's girl! Daddy's girl!
1DI0003572	Show it to her, Butch!
1DI0003573	Whoa, take it easy. No need to go all psycho on me again. We were just joking with her.
1DI0003574	And who are you? Her boyfriend? Ha!
1DI0003575	Keep talking like that, boy, and we'll send you back to your daddy with a few broken bones for him to fix.
1DI0003576	And who are you? Her girlfriend? Ha! Should have known.
1DI0003577	Keep talking like that, girl, and we'll send you back to your daddy with a few broken bones for him to fix.
1DI0003578	Her weight, huh? I can see why.
1DI0003579	You're okay, pipsqueak. Now, run along before you get hurt.
1DI0003580	Damn right you will. Get lost.
1DI0003581	You've got to be kidding me.
1DI0003582	Come on Tunnel Snakes, this twerp needs another lesson.
1DI0003584	Whatever you say, Butch. You're the boss! Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0003585	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes. This little bitch isn't worth our time.
1DI0003586	You're pathetic. This isn't even worth our time.
1DI0003587	You and your little girlfriend have fun together. We're outta here.
1DI0003588	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes! Let's go!
1DI0003589	Okay, okay. You win. We'll leave the little girl alone!
1DI0003590	You're not worth our time, anyway.
1DI0003591	C'mon, Tunnel Snakes. We're outta here.
1DI0003592	None of your business, kid. Get outta here before you get hurt.
1DI0003593	If you mess with the Tunnel Snakes, you're asking for it. Got me?
1DI0003594	Damn right. And you'll stay out of our way, if you know what's good for you.
1DI0003595	No one messes with the Tunnel Snakes. Especially not this stuck up little daddy's girl.
1DI0003596	You've got that right. Just keep moving, and maybe we won't come looking for you next.
1DI0003597	Leave Tunnel Snake business to the Tunnel Snakes.
1DI0003599	Sure thing, Mr. Brotch.
1DI0003600	Hey, it's not my call. Those are the rules.
1DI0003601	You're sixteen now, so this year you take the G.O.A.T.
1DI0003602	Come on. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it. You'll do just fine.
1DI0003603	No, you're not. Really.
1DI0003604	When I started studying medicine, one of the first things I learned was how to spot a kid playing sick to get out of taking a test.
1DI0003605	You'll do fine. It's not so bad. Everyone has to take it when they're sixteen. I had to, you have to, and so does everyone else.
1DI0003606	And most everyone makes it through without a scratch.
1DI0003607	The Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test. G.O.A.T.! Everyone here in the Vault takes it when they're sixteen.
1DI0003608	Helps to figure out what sort of job you'll have here in Vault 101 when you get a bit older. So, pay attention and try not to fall asleep.
1DI0003609	You know what the Overseer says: "We're born in the Vault. We die in the Vault."
1DI0003610	"Each is tested to determine their abilities, that they may work for the betterment of all Vault residents." Sound familiar?
1DI0003611	Sounds good. Let me know if there are any changes.
1DI0003612	No problem. I'll have my report ready this afternoon.
1DI0003613	I'd just like to keep an eye on it.
1DI0003614	I was just going over them. Something you're worried about?
1DI0003615	Have you had a chance to look over these results?
1DI0003616	Morning, Doc. How's things?
1DI0003617	Morning, Jonas.
1DI0003618	That's not the way it works. And it won't do to go around asking questions like that. Especially not around the Overseer.
1DI0003619	I want to tell you something now. It's important, so listen closely: this place, this Vault... it's not perfect, I know. But it is your home.
1DI0003620	You're safe here. Stay on the Overseer's good side, and you always will be. You understand? You need to appreciate all you have.
1DI0003621	Because what's up there, on the outside, that's not the life I want for you, and it's not what your mother wanted for you, either.
1DI0003622	That's what the Overseer says, isn't it?
1DI0003623	He's not about to let anyone else in, so I guess that's how it'll have to be.
1DI0003624	You're here now, and it's a hell of a lot better than being up there. All your mother and I ever wanted was for you to be safe, and you're safe here.
1DI0003625	Your mother, she... she was beautiful. But... beyond the beauty you've seen. There's just so much those old photos can never show.
1DI0003626	And she was passionate. About life, about love. But most of all, most of all she was passionate about you.
1DI0003627	When she became pregnant, it was the happiest I had ever seen her. Ahhhh.... she had great things in mind for you....
1DI0003628	And so! Time for you to stop stalling and get to class! Please, honey, please take these achievement tests seriously.
1DI0003629	The last thing I need is you mother's ghost haunting me because her only child became a garbage burner.
1DI0003633	And so! Time for you to stop stalling and get to class! Please, son, please take these achievement tests seriously.
1DI0003634	The last thing I need is your mother's ghost haunting me because her only child became a garbage burner.
1DI0003635	As far as I can tell, you're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy. So yes, you have to go to class to take your G.O.A.T. exam!
1DI0003636	As far as I can tell, you're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old girl. So yes, you have to go to class to take your G.O.A.T. exam!
1DI0003637	You too, missy. Time for the G.O.A.T. Find a seat and wait for instructions.
1DI0003638	You too, mister. Time for the G.O.A.T. Find a seat and wait for instructions.
1DI0003639	And if your friends decided to jump into the reactor, would you join them? Get your posterior in a chair immediately.
1DI0003640	Mr. Brotch, come on! I gotta meet my friends!
1DI0003641	You too.
1DI0003642	Great. Good luck on the G.O.A.T.
1DI0003643	Sure thing. How about we head down to the diner after class?
1DI0003644	Thanks. Say, you want to grab some lunch later on?
1DI0003645	Well, I hope it's working again soon for you.
1DI0003646	Yeah, sure did. But the thing is so old, my grandpa had trouble with it when he was my age.
1DI0003647	You're kidding me. Didn't you just get new parts for it last week?
1DI0003648	Oh, not much. Our heater's on the fritz again.
1DI0003649	Hi, Susie. What's new?
1DI0003650	Oh, shouldn't be too long. I just need to get things set up for you. Just sit tight, and I'll be with you as soon as I can.
1DI0003651	Yes, I think I'd like that. Will it take long?
1DI0003652	That's still bothering you? Hmm. Well, I can run a few more tests if you like.
1DI0003653	I've got this headache that just won't go away. Even with the pills you gave me last week. It's the lights, I think. They hurt my eyes.
1DI0003654	Hi, Stanley. Sorry to keep you waiting; what seems to be the trouble today?
1DI0003655	Because he's my pal. My brother. All us Tunnel Snakes are brothers. Birth to earth. Womb to tomb.
1DI0003656	Mostly because Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0003657	You got that right.
1DI0003658	Better not forget it, either.
1DI0003659	Only the baddest gang in Vault 101. Like you don't know. We rule this Vault, and what we say goes.
1DI0003660	You'll stay out of our way, if you know what's good for you.
1DI0003661	That's us. And we rule!
1DI0003662	No one messes with the Tunnel Snakes. Or they have to answer to Butch. And Wally. You don't want to be on their bad sides. Trust me.
1DI0003663	What? You mouthing off, spaz? Everyone knows the Tunnel Snakes!
1DI0003664	We rule this Vault, and we don't take shit from nobody. Not you, not her, and not her daddy, the Overseer.
1DI0003665	A bunch of idiots, if you ask me. They think they're so tough, with their "gang."
1DI0003666	All they ever do is hang around and cause trouble. They've got it in for me because my father is the Overseer. Like that's my fault!
1DI0003667	None of your business. Because Butch said so. And what Butch says, goes.
1DI0003669	Stay out of this. It's Tunnel Snake business.
1DI0003670	Me and Butch, we're just having some fun with this chick.
1DI0003671	Can't think of anything. Butch says this little bitch is blabbing to her daddy about us Tunnel Snakes. We can't have that.
1DI0003672	Because we're the Tunnel Snakes. And we rule!
1DI0003673	Why don't you mind your own business? Last I checked, you weren't a Tunnel Snake.
1DI0003674	Run along, kid. Before Butch and I decide you're a problem.
1DI0003675	Here you are, Mr. Brotch. I hope I did okay.
1DI0003676	Nothing for you to worry about, Miss Almodovar. Let's see... Very well done. Looks like it's the supervisory track for you.
1DI0003677	Thanks. See you tomorrow.
1DI0003678	Yo teach. I'm done.
1DI0003679	Ah, Butch. Can I admit that I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time? Allow me to savor the moment.
1DI0003680	Now then, let's see... Hmm... Really?! ... Interesting...
1DI0003681	You've surprised me, Butch. I didn't think you had it in you. Hairdresser! Who would have thunk it?
1DI0003682	You're so full of it! That isn't true!
1DI0003683	I'm all done, Mr. Brotch. I guess.
1DI0003684	Uh. Wait a second. Can I have it back? I think I need to change one of my answers.
1DI0003685	Just calm down a minute, Paul. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
1DI0003686	Let's see. Mmm hmm. Yep, just as I thought. You're slated for the engineering track. Congratulations, Mr. Hannon. You've passed the G.O.A.T.
1DI0003687	Oh, gee! That's not so bad. Engineering, all right!
1DI0003688	Mother can't wait to find out if I'll be going into Science or Home Economics.
1DI0003689	Science? Ah, well... perhaps. Let's see what the G.O.A.T. says...
1DI0003690	Well, well. Maintenance department! I hope your mother will be pleased... I'm sure Stanley will be.
1DI0003691	What?! That's impossible! I'm telling Father! He won't let you get away with this!
1DI0003692	Here. What's the stupid test say I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life?
1DI0003693	Now, now, Susie. Is that any way to talk about the infallible G.O.A.T.?
1DI0003694	You will be... ahem... You'll be going into Teaching. No doubt due to your gift for communication. Don't worry, it isn't as bad as it sounds.
1DI0003695	About what I figured. I guess I'll see you around, Edwin.
1DI0003696	I'm finished. Here.
1DI0003697	Don't you want to find out what you got?
1DI0003698	Nah, I already know what it says. Hardly takes a rocket scientist to crack that joke of a test.
1DI0003699	Gimme one more second!
1DI0003700	I'm almost done, I promise!
1DI0003701	Okay, Mr. Brotch, I just need to read over my answers one more time.
1DI0003702	I do say so. Buzz off.
1DI0003703	What? What kind of shit is that? No one talks that way about Wally Mack!
1DI0003704	He's not the boss of me! Nobody's the boss of me! I'm out of here.
1DI0003705	I'm not finished with you, either, twerp.
1DI0003706	This ain't over, daddy's girl.
1DI0003707	Fine. Let's go. I was done here, anyway.
1DI0003708	Are you sure? Butch? Um... okay. Whatever you say, Wally. Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0003709	Don't know who put you in charge. I say we're done. Let's go, Paul.
1DI0003710	Done? We're not done! I say when we're done.
1DI0003711	We're done here.
1DI0003712	I don't follow anyone. Wally Mack is his own man. And the Tunnel Snakes is where I belong.
1DI0003713	Why? You think Butch is in charge? Is that what people are saying? Because it's a load of shit, if that's what they're saying.
1DI0003714	Damn right it's not. You were just leaving, weren't you, feeb?
1DI0003715	No, you didn't need me. If anyone can survive out there, it's you.
1DI0003716	You're right, I should never have doubted you!
1DI0003717	Fair enough. I know you must hate my father for what he's done, and I guess maybe you hate me now, too.
1DI0003718	But for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry. Sorry about Jonas, and my father, and everything.
1DI0003719	If you do catch up with your dad, I hope you'll tell him that. Jonas was my friend, too, you know.
1DI0003720	It's tempting, but... my place is here. The Vault needs me more than you do. I'm the only one who has a chance to talk some sense into my father.
1DI0003721	Listen, if you do catch up with your dad, tell him I'm sorry. For... you know, Jonas, and my father, and everything. Goodbye.
1DI0003722	Goodbye. Listen, if you do catch up with your dad, tell him I'm sorry. For... you know, Jonas, and my father, and everything.
1DI0003723	You're right. I understand. It was crazy for me to think you could stop them.
1DI0003724	What's important is that you made it. You got the door open.
1DI0003725	Of course. That was the plan, wasn't it? I was supposed to distract them while you got the door open. Mission accomplished!
1DI0003726	Now you're going to go... out there. And I'm going to go back and make up with my dear old Daddy.
1DI0003727	I guess if anyone can survive out there, it's you. And I'm great at pretending everything's just fine, so that's okay too.
1DI0003728	Go on. What are you waiting for? No point in getting caught now, after all this trouble. Goodbye.
1DI0003729	You're right. Compared to Jonas, I'm just peachy. A few bruises, nothing more. What do I have to complain about?
1DI0003730	You seem to have come through in fine shape as well.
1DI0003731	Go on, then. The door's open. Time for you to leave. And I'll stay here and clean up the mess you and your dad made.
1DI0003732	Don't worry, I'm sure I can patch things up with my father. That's what we do down here, isn't it? Smile and pretend everything is just fine.
1DI0003733	Don't worry about me. Whatever happens, I'm sure I'll be in less danger than you. I can't imagine what you're going to find out there.
1DI0003734	Go on. Before anyone comes. Find your dad. I'll... I'll miss you. You've been a good friend.
1DI0003735	Goodbye. Find your dad. I'll... I'll miss you. You've been a good friend.
1DI0003736	You did the right thing in the end. That's what counts. I don't know what my father would have done to me if you hadn't stopped him.
1DI0003737	I still can hardly believe we did it. The door... it's open.
1DI0003738	Everything they told us was a lie, wasn't it? Things can never go back to the way they were.
1DI0003739	Well, trust you to do things the hard way. Sorry for trying to help you. And getting a beating for my pains.
1DI0003740	Never mind. It doesn't matter now. What's important is that you made it. You got the door open...
1DI0003741	My God, everything they told us was a lie, wasn't it? We can never go back to the way things were. We... I trusted him.
1DI0003742	I guess it's time for you to go deal with your father issues, while I deal with mine. Good luck. I will miss you, you know.
1DI0003743	Fine. Be that way. By the way, thanks for rescuing me from my father.
1DI0003744	Although I'm sure it was only by accident. I'm sure you wouldn't have helped me on purpose.
1DI0003747	It's tempting, but... no. My place is here. I may be the only one who can stop my father before something even worse happens.
1DI0003748	Go on. Before anyone comes. Find your dad. I'll... I'll miss you. You've been a good friend. Good luck out there.
1DI0003749	You're right. Go on. Before anyone comes. Find your dad. I'll... I'll miss you. You've been a good friend. Good luck out there.
1DI0003750	I would, if I only cared about myself.
1DI0003753	So you say. Maybe one day I'll be able to forgive you. But not now.
1DI0003754	I hope you never have to find out what it's like to see your father killed right in front of you.
1DI0003755	No, don't listen to me. Just... just go. Find your father. I have to go bury mine.
1DI0003756	Oh, really? And who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner? I know he wasn't perfect, but he was my father.
1DI0003757	I thought you were my friend. He was the only family I had left. I thought you of all people would have understood that.
1DI0003758	You'd better get out of here before I change my mind and call the guards.
1DI0003759	Gladly.
1DI0003760	The only reason I'm not calling the guards is out of respect for your dad. I don't want him to lose the only family he has left.
1DI0003761	You'd better get out of here before I change my mind.
1DI0003762	No, I can't. Not with you, not now. You'd better leave before I change my mind about letting you go.
1DI0003763	You'd better leave before I change my mind about letting you go.
1DI0003764	I don't know. I don't know.
1DI0003765	Well, you'd better get out of here. I'll try to meet you at the Vault door. If I don't make it... good luck.
1DI0003766	Don't even start. I can't tell when you're joking any more.
1DI0003767	But you'd better get out of here. I'll try to meet you at the Vault door. If I don't make it... good luck.
1DI0003768	Maybe it would have been better if you'd taken it in the first place. I don't know.
1DI0003770	My father ordered the Vault into lockdown. Everyone's supposed to stay in their quarters and emergency lighting only.
1DI0003771	But you need to be careful -- the Radroaches have swarmed out in the darkness. I had a few close calls on my way to see you.
1DI0003772	It was lucky for you in a way. Security's been distracted dealing with the Roaches, but that won't last forever. You've got to get moving.
1DI0003773	Well, that's what they've always told us, but apparently it's not.
1DI0003774	From what I overheard, he hacked into the computer that controls the door.
1DI0003775	That's why my father locked down the door leading to the exit.
1DI0003776	I don't think they meant to. As if that makes any difference.
1DI0003777	I think he must have distracted the guards while your dad got into the Vault door controls.
1DI0003778	When they realized that Jonas had helped your dad escape, they just lost it. I'm sorry, but I really don't want to think about it again.
1DI0003779	Oh my God... you actually opened it...
1DI0003780	Wake up! Come on, wake up!
1DI0003781	I'll meet up with you at the Vault door if I can. But don't wait for me. Good luck.
1DI0003782	Was that an actual apology? From you? Wow. You must really be desperate.
1DI0003783	You're right though. You do need my help. You'll never get out of here on your own. You're lucky I'm such a good friend.
1DI0003784	There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
1DI0003785	Use these to get into his office. That's how I always get in.
1DI0003788	It won't be easy. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
1DI0003789	Not exactly an apology, but probably the best I can expect.
1DI0003790	You'd better listen, because you'll never escape without my help.
1DI0003796	I don't even know why I bother with you.
1DI0003797	You've got to get out of here! Your dad is gone and my father's men are looking for you!
1DI0003798	He's left the Vault! I don't know how, but he's gone, and my father... he's kind of gone crazy.
1DI0003799	It's Jonas... they killed him! My father's men. They took him, and... Oh my God, you have to leave, now!
1DI0003800	I thought so too. But it's true. He's gone and Jonas is dead and now they're looking for you!
1DI0003801	My father's men think Jonas helped your dad escape. They caught him and brought him to my dad's office and they... Oh my God...
1DI0003802	Goddamn it! Stop making jokes and listen to me! Jonas is dead! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? My father ordered the guards to do it!
1DI0003803	And now they're coming here to do the same thing to you! This is not a joke! You need to get out of here!
1DI0003804	You don't understand! Your dad somehow opened the main door and left the Vault!
1DI0003805	My father... I've never seen him so angry. Listen to me -- if the guards find you, they'll kill you.
1DI0003806	I don't know! Some of my father's men.
1DI0003807	Look, that doesn't matter right now! You need to worry about getting out of here alive! Revenge will have to wait.
1DI0003808	That's what I've been trying to tell you!
1DI0003809	Listen... You have to follow your dad -- escape from the Vault. And you have to do it now, while everything is still in confusion.
1DI0003810	Maybe it's none of my business, but... you seem just as surprised as me to learn your dad has left. Didn't he tell you what he was planning?
1DI0003811	That's what I would have said until tonight. But it's true. He's gone and Jonas is dead and now they're looking for you!
1DI0003812	Aren't you listening? Your dad is gone! From the Vault! He opened the main door and left!
1DI0003813	My father has completely flipped out. I've never seen him like this. He ordered the guards to beat Jonas. To death. And now they're looking for you!
1DI0003814	I'm sorry... he's dead. They beat him... They just wouldn't stop... And my father ordered them to do it...
1DI0003815	I snuck out to warn you as soon as they were gone.
1DI0003816	I finally got your attention, huh? Jonas is dead, in case you were wondering. He helped your dad escape, and they killed him for it!
1DI0003817	Now let's get you the hell out of here before you're next!
1DI0003819	Don't be a smart-mouth! This is serious!
1DI0003820	My father's men are looking for you. They've already killed Jonas. You've got to get out of here!
1DI0003821	Oh, gross! Knock it off, this is serious!
1DI0003823	It's your dad. He's left the Vault! My father thinks Jonas helped him escape. So he had his men...
1DI0003824	My God, they killed him... They just beat him, and beat him, and wouldn't stop...
1DI0003825	Yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm just sorry you had to find out like this. I know Jonas was your friend.
1DI0003826	But we've got to go, now. My father's men will be here any minute!
1DI0003827	No. Why should I cry? He was your friend, not mine.
1DI0003828	I came here to help you. If you still want my help, we'd better get going.
1DI0003829	Yeah. It's lucky I got here ahead of them. But we can't stand here talking! You've got to get out of here!
1DI0003830	Jonas helped your dad escape the Vault tonight! At least that's what my father thinks -- and he's sent his men to find you.
1DI0003831	Maybe you don't know anything about it, but my father sure thinks you do.
1DI0003832	You can't let him catch you. I think he'd kill you. I really do.
1DI0003833	You don't understand. It's your dad -- he's left the Vault! They think Jonas helped him.
1DI0003834	And they think you're part of it! You know how paranoid my father is anyway. This has pushed him right over the edge.
1DI0003835	You can worry about revenge later. Right now you've got to get away before security gets here!
1DI0003836	No! You've got to get up. Right now! If my father's men catch you here, I don't know what will happen.
1DI0003837	This isn't about some stupid prank. Your dad left the Vault somehow, and now my father's gone crazy. Jonas is dead!
1DI0003838	So you'd better listen to me and get moving if you don't want to end up like him!
1DI0003839	Well, you'd better start being afraid! I just watched them beat Jonas, over and over again! They killed him!
1DI0003840	Now shut up and listen to me!
1DI0003841	Finally! Look, it all started with your dad -- he's escaped from the Vault somehow. I guess you didn't know.
1DI0003842	Jonas must have helped him escape, and when my father found out, he kind of went crazy.
1DI0003843	They think you're part of it. And I don't think they'll be interested in listening to your explanations!
1DI0003844	It all started with your dad -- he's escaped from the Vault somehow. I guess you didn't know.
1DI0003845	Jonas must have helped him escape, and when my father found out...
1DI0003847	Not anymore, apparently. But... Are you honestly telling me you had no idea your dad was leaving? He really didn't tell you?
1DI0003848	I'm sorry, but I think you'll have to follow your dad. You'll have to escape from the Vault.
1DI0003849	Listen... maybe it isn't any of my business, but didn't your dad tell you that he was leaving?
1DI0003850	Don't be an idiot! What are you going to do, fight the whole security force by yourself?
1DI0003851	No, I've thought about it. There's only one way. You have to follow your dad. You have to leave the Vault.
1DI0003852	Good. You're finally talking sense.
1DI0003853	My God, this is all so crazy. I can't believe your dad didn't tell you he was leaving.
1DI0003854	Not this time. My father... he's not listening to anybody. If he even finds out that I've been helping you...
1DI0003855	But that doesn't matter. I can take care of myself. It's you he's looking for.
1DI0003856	And I have a plan. I know how to get you out of the Vault. Well, I think it will work.
1DI0003857	Oh, so you don't trust me now? Thanks a lot. You think it was easy for me to get here? With the Radroaches and security all over the place?
1DI0003858	I understand. It must be rough, waking up suddenly to find your dad gone and everything turned upside down.
1DI0003859	Listen... it may not be any of my business, but didn't your dad tell you anything about his plans?
1DI0003860	Your sense of self-preservation never fails to rise to the surface.
1DI0003861	Lucky for you, I have a plan. I can help you follow your dad and escape from the Vault!
1DI0003862	Fine! You're on your own, then. I'll wait here and see how long until you come crawling back, begging for my help.
1DI0003863	That's exactly what I had in mind.
1DI0003864	Listen. There's a secret tunnel that leads directly from my father's office to the exit. You'll have to hack the computer in his office to open it.
1DI0003867	It won't be easy, though. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from following your dad.
1DI0003870	Come on, your dad did it. And he didn't even have my help.
1DI0003872	I don't have time to explain everything. You're just going to have to trust me this time.
1DI0003875	No! I mean I do have a plan, and it'll work better than that time we tried to steal Mr. Brotch's...
1DI0003876	Come on, be serious. This will work. It has to.
1DI0003877	Listen. My father sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from escaping.
1DI0003878	Fine. Be that way. Good luck with the whole Vault in lockdown, Radroaches everywhere, and security guarding every door.
1DI0003879	I'm sure you'll have no trouble escaping on your own.
1DI0003880	Good. Now will you shut up and listen to me for a second?
1DI0003883	You're such a jerk. Maybe I don't want to help you anymore.
1DI0003884	No, don't worry. If I got sore that easily we couldn't have stayed friends all these years. You being such a jerk and all.
1DI0003886	Fine. I can't stop you. You don't deserve it, but I'll wait here so when you change your mind you'll know where to find me.
1DI0003887	Lucky for you, I know of another way in.
1DI0003888	There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
1DI0003889	Security doesn't even know about it. Nobody except my father -- and me.  "One of the Overseer's secrets," he says.
1DI0003890	Oh, one more thing. I stole my father's pistol. I hope you won't need it, but you'd better take it just in case.
1DI0003891	Lucky for you, I know another way through. There's a secret tunnel that runs from the Overseer's Office to the Vault door!
1DI0003893	My father's not stupid. He's sealed the door to the exit to prevent anyone else from escaping.
1DI0003894	The tunnel is the only way out! You're just going to have to trust me.
1DI0003896	We don't have time for this! Trust me, security doesn't know about the tunnel. Just my father -- and me.
1DI0003897	Maybe this pistol I stole from my father will make you feel better. Go ahead, take it, and then let's get out of here.
1DI0003898	Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sure he had his reasons. Maybe Jonas was supposed to explain everything to you?
1DI0003899	But it doesn't matter. I can help you escape. I have my own plan!
1DI0003900	Uh, okay. Sure.
1DI0003902	I'm sorry I asked. And I'm not just saying that -- I shouldn't have pried.
1DI0003906	Same way I do -- use these. Once you're in, use his computer to open the door to the tunnel.
1DI0003907	I don't have a password to his computer, so you'll have to hack it. But that shouldn't give you any trouble.
1DI0003908	I'll find my father and make sure he doesn't go back to his office. But you'd better hurry.
1DI0003911	I don't have a password to his computer, so you'll either have to hack it or find the password somewhere in his desk.
1DI0003914	I'll be keeping my father from catching you hacking into his computer.
1DI0003915	Here, you'll probably need these to pick the lock on the office door. They've always worked for me.
1DI0003916	Access his computer to open the door to the tunnel -- you'll either have to hack it or find his password. I know he hides it in his office somewhere.
1DI0003918	If you have a better plan, let's hear it! Look, I know for a fact that the office isn't guarded -- everyone's out looking for you.
1DI0003922	Okay. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Watch out for security. Good luck!
1DI0003923	I hope you're joking. Even with that pistol, I don't think you'll win a fight against the whole security force.
1DI0003924	Okay. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Good luck!
1DI0003925	Well... okay. I guess it may come in handy if I run into any Radroaches.
1DI0003926	All right. I'll try to meet you at the exit. Watch out for security. Good luck!
1DI0003927	We should just go back to our quarters.
1DI0003928	It's our only chance, don't you see? We're getting out of here, just like the doctor. I'm not going to let anyone stop us.
1DI0003929	Tom! No!
1DI0003930	Tom! Be careful!
1DI0003931	It's me! Tom Holden! Just let me through!
1DI0003932	What are you doing? Are you crazy? We'll shoot! Dammit, Tom.
1DI0003933	No, I can't go back in there. It's... it's dark, and there's Radroaches.
1DI0003934	Oh my God, thank you. I didn't know what to do. You're the best!
1DI0003935	No! I mean... it's not the dark, it's the Radroaches. I... I can't stand them. I tried to go back in to get her, I really did! But I couldn't.
1DI0003936	You gotta help me. She's not going to last much longer in there! Can't you hear her screaming?
1DI0003937	Yeah, I'm asking you. So what.
1DI0003938	Look, I'm sorry for the way I've always treated you. You know I never meant any of it, right?
1DI0003939	But it's my mom. You can't leave her in there with the Radroaches.
1DI0003940	Sure. I don't care why. Just get her out of there!
1DI0003941	Well... yeah, so I hate Radroaches. So what? I tried to go back in to help her, I swear I did! But I just can't do it!
1DI0003942	So I'm begging you, please help her. I don't know what I'd do without my mom.
1DI0003943	No! Please! I'll do anything! You can join the Tunnel Snakes! I'll be your best friend forever! You gotta help her!
1DI0003944	You're a real bastard, you know that? I hate your guts, you fucking coward!
1DI0003945	Please! I know I've always been a jerk towards you. I know it!
1DI0003946	But you can't walk away and let her die! Just because I was an asshole. Please... I'm begging you.
1DI0003947	Okay, sure! Uh, you can join the Tunnel Snakes! I'll be your best friend forever! Whatever you want. Just save my mom!
1DI0003951	Oh my God, thank you. Of course I'll shut up. I promise, I won't tell anybody I saw you. You can count on me.
1DI0003953	Oh my God, thank you. You're right, I am an asshole. But you -- you're the best!
1DI0003954	Wow, where'd you get that? Okay, okay. Maybe I can do this.
1DI0003955	Alright. I'm gonna go back in there and kill those damn roaches. Thanks!
1DI0003956	This would squish those little buggers real nice. Okay, okay. Maybe I can do this.
1DI0003958	You're a real bastard, you know that? I hate your fucking guts!
1DI0003959	Get away from me, you sick bastard!
1DI0003960	Oh my God, you're right! I can hear their little scratchy feet coming this way. I gotta get out of here!
1DI0003961	You know what... you're right! They aren't anything I can't handle. Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0003962	Over here! Officer Kendall!
1DI0003963	Hey! He's right over here! Come quick!
1DI0003964	Hey! She's right over here! Come quick!
1DI0003965	I've found him! This way!
1DI0003966	I've found her! This way!
1DI0003967	Officer Kendall! Help!
1DI0003968	Hold on Jonas, I need to record this first.
1DI0003969	I don't really know how to tell you this. I hope you'll understand, but I know you might be angry.
1DI0003970	I thought about it for a long time, but in the end I decided it was best for you not to know.
1DI0003971	So many things could have gone wrong, and there's really no telling how the Overseer will react when he finds out.
1DI0003972	It's best if he can blame everything on me.
1DI0003973	Obviously, you already know that I'm gone. It was something I needed to do. You're an adult now. You're ready to be on your own.
1DI0003974	Maybe some day, things will change and we can see each other again. I can't tell you why I left or where I'm going. I don't want you to follow me.
1DI0003975	God knows life in the Vault isn't perfect, but at least you'll be safe. Just knowing that will be enough to keep me going.
1DI0003976	Don't mean to rush you, Doc, but I'd feel better if we got this over with.
1DI0003977	Okay. Go ahead.
1DI0003978	Goodbye. I love you.
1DI0003979	Are you crazy? The Vault's in lockdown! Get back to your room.
1DI0003980	I'm not opening this door until I get the all clear from the Overseer.
1DI0003981	Sorry, but I intend to stay on the Overseer's good side.
1DI0003982	Everybody's supposed to be in their rooms during the lockdown. What are you doing out in the hall?
1DI0003983	Go away! I'm not opening the door until the lockdown's over.
1DI0003989	It's a real shame it's come to this. I can't believe what they did to Jonas... Officer Mack was just out of control...
1DI0003990	But you're a good kid. You didn't do anything to deserve this. Go find your dad, if you can.
1DI0003991	Don't think I don't know it. Why do you think I'm letting you go?
1DI0003992	I guess you're trying to follow your dad... outside.
1DI0003993	Good gravy, if I didn't know what the Overseer would do if he caught you, I'd never tell you to try for it, but it's your only shot.
1DI0003994	You take care and I hope you find your daddy.
1DI0003995	Now come on, that's not fair. I wasn't even there! I had some words with the Overseer when I saw what they'd done to Jonas.
1DI0003996	But they all went crazy when they realized what your dad had done. Opened the Vault door!
1DI0003997	Good gravy, if it was anybody but your dad I'd have thought he was a traitor, too.
1DI0003998	But not him. If he opened that door, he must have had his reasons. And you'd better follow him, quick.
1DI0003999	I'm not crazy enough to go out there!
1DI0004000	I'm not going out there, I don't care what the Overseer says.
1DI0004001	Quick, close the door!
1DI0004002	Amata! Where did you get that gun?
1DI0004003	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to him.
1DI0004004	Be reasonable, Amata. Officer Mack may enjoy this, but I don't. Just tell us where to find your friend, so we can talk to her.
1DI0004005	Now then, are you ready to tell me where your friend has gone? There's no need for any more of this.
1DI0004006	Amata, please. Don't be stubborn. I only want to talk to your friend. Surely you understand what's at stake here.
1DI0004007	Just get away from me! I don't want to shoot you but I will. I swear I will!
1DI0004008	I'm not telling you anything! And don't pretend you aren't enjoying this, Daddy. You're sick!
1DI0004009	What are you going to do, Daddy? Beat me to death, like you did poor Jonas?
1DI0004010	If you think I'll betray him, you don't know me very well.
1DI0004011	If you think I'll betray her, you don't know me very well.
1DI0004012	Daddy, please stop! Don't you understand, I can't tell you. Why are you doing this to me?
1DI0004013	Please stop. Please don't have him hit me again. Don't you care that I'm your own daughter?
1DI0004014	How dare you threaten me! And with my own gun! I'm your father, damn you, and you'll show me some respect!
1DI0004015	Very well. There's no hurry. Your friend isn't going anywhere, after all.
1DI0004016	Amata, darling. Why must you be so stubborn? The last thing I want is to see you hurt, but my duty to the Vault comes first.
1DI0004017	I've always indulged you, Amata. And now you've taken advantage of my lenience.
1DI0004018	Officer Mack! Don't just stand there!
1DI0004019	Again.
1DI0004020	One more time.
1DI0004021	Go ahead, Officer.
1DI0004022	Don't make me take that gun away from you, girlie. Just hand it over nice and easy now.
1DI0004023	You'd better talk, girlie.
1DI0004024	Do what your dad says, Amata.
1DI0004025	You need to learn some respect.
1DI0004026	No! Get away from me!
1DI0004028	No, please don't!
1DI0004029	Please, Daddy, no!
1DI0004030	Oh my God! Amata... what have you done...
1DI0004031	That's enough, officer.
1DI0004032	That'll do for now.
1DI0004033	All right, officer. Let me try again.
1DI0004034	I told you, I don't know anything!
1DI0004037	He's my friend. I was worried about him. What does he have to do with any of this anyway?
1DI0004038	She's my friend. I was worried about her. What does she have to do with any of this anyway?
1DI0004039	Probably nothing. Which is why you need to tell me where he is, so I can talk to him.
1DI0004040	Probably nothing. Which is why you need to tell me where she is, so I can talk to her.
1DI0004041	Go to hell.
1DI0004043	Oh, is that all? Is there anything else I can get you while you're here?
1DI0004044	You'll get nothing from me. I'll die before I see the safety of the Vault compromised again.
1DI0004045	I've dealt with your kind before, you little snotnose punk. You should have run like your coward of a father.
1DI0004046	My God, you're a coldblooded little shit, aren't you? I think you'd actually do it.
1DI0004047	Here. Take them and leave the Vault. I'll have you shot on sight if you ever come back.
1DI0004048	Save your sanctimony. The world is a dangerous place and I make no apologies for doing whatever it takes to keep the Vault safe.
1DI0004050	I place the good of the Vault above everything, even my own paternal feelings. We must not allow sentiment to cloud our judgment!
1DI0004051	But I admire your protective instincts. Very well. I give you my word that Amata will not suffer further because of your actions.
1DI0004052	Now then. If you really care about Amata, you will see how dangerous your father's actions were.
1DI0004053	Hand over your weapons, and put an end to this dangerous situation. There's no need to join your father as a traitor to the Vault.
1DI0004054	A regrettable incident. But sometimes harsh measures are necessary for the good of the Vault. Such has always been my lot.
1DI0004055	Think a moment. If you really care about your fellow citizens, killing me is the worst thing you could do.
1DI0004056	Without an Overseer, the Vault would be plunged into chaos and disaster. Surely you can see that as well as I.
1DI0004057	Come now, turn yourself in and we can resolve this whole thing peacefully. Just because your father betrayed us doesn't mean you have to.
1DI0004058	Let's let history be the judge of that. If you had paid attention to Mr. Brotch, you'd understand that history is invariably written by the victor.
1DI0004059	And I intend to be the victor. You won't survive the night. Guards! Help me!
1DI0004060	Thank you. That will make this easier. Guards! Help me!
1DI0004061	A regrettable incident. But will killing me bring back your friend?
1DI0004065	Do you really think I'm afraid of a little snotnose punk like you?
1DI0004066	I've dealt with your kind many times before. I've never minded getting my hands dirty when I had to.
1DI0004067	Do you think I'm scared of a snotnosed punk like you? I was running this Vault when you were still crying for your dead mother.
1DI0004069	You! This is your fault! You and your stupid father! He had to go and leave, didn't he? He had to mess things up for everybody!
1DI0004070	Guards! Guards, he's over here!
1DI0004071	Guards! Guards, she's over here!
1DI0004072	The doc's stupid kid is over here! He's trying to leave the Vault! Don't let him get away!
1DI0004073	The doc's stupid kid is over here! She's trying to leave the Vault! Don't let her get away!
1DI0004074	Guards!
1DI0004075	Oh my God! Daddy!
1DI0004076	Guards! Help!
1DI0004077	He's here! Don't let him get away!
1DI0004078	She's here! Don't let her get away!
1DI0004080	He's opening the Vault door! Get the Overseer! We need this door open now!
1DI0004081	She's opening the Vault door! Get the Overseer! We need this door open now!
1DI0004082	Watch it, sir! She's got a gun!
1DI0004083	Look out, sir! It's the doc's kid!
1DI0004084	There he is! Hold it right there!
1DI0004085	There she is! Hold it right there!
1DI0004086	Hold on, son! I just want to talk to you for a minute!
1DI0004087	Hold on, missy! I just want to talk to you for a minute!
1DI0004088	He's turning the power back on! To the control room!
1DI0004089	She's turning the power back on! To the control room!
1DI0004090	Goddammit Butch, I told you to get back in your room.
1DI0004091	What are you doing out of your room? There's a curfew in effect.
1DI0004092	There's roaches in there, Officer Kendall! They're attacking my mom! You've got to help!
1DI0004093	I told you, there's roaches in there attacking my mom! You've got to help her!
1DI0004094	Oh, uh, sorry Officer. I'll go right back inside.
1DI0004095	What's the matter, she dead drunk again? I don't have time for this. Stop being such a sissy and go help her yourself.
1DI0004096	I've got bigger problems right now than dealing with your lush of a mother again.
1DI0004097	No, wait! You're looking for the Doc's kid, right? He was just here! I saw where he went.
1DI0004099	You saw him? Where'd he go?
1DI0004100	You saw her? Where'd she go?
1DI0004101	Uh uh. You go in there and help my mom. Then I'll tell you.
1DI0004102	Listen you little punk! We just beat a man to death. You want to be next?
1DI0004103	No sir! Uh, he went that way! I saw him. I did!
1DI0004104	No sir! Uh, she went that way! I saw her. I did!
1DI0004105	That's better. Now get in your goddamn room!
1DI0004106	No, please! Don't leave! You've got to help my mom!
1DI0004107	Okay then. Hey, you haven't seen the Doc's kid, have you? We're still looking for him.
1DI0004108	Okay then. Hey, you haven't seen the Doc's kid, have you? We're still looking for her.
1DI0004109	No, sir. Good luck with your search though.
1DI0004110	Whatever. Get back in your room.
1DI0004111	Pretty quiet. You?
1DI0004112	Just roaches. I don't know where they keep coming from. How about you?
1DI0004113	Nah. Everyone's keeping to the curfew. Any news on the doc's kid?
1DI0004114	No. I'd better get going. Good luck.
1DI0004115	Nothing. That kid can't hide from us forever though.
1DI0004116	Nope. I bet you a week's rations Amata knows something, though.
1DI0004117	I'll never get the roach guts off my billy club. What a mess.
1DI0004118	Nope. Wild goose chase if you ask me.
1DI0004119	Hey, John. What did you find?
1DI0004120	He was leaving his quarters just as I got there, but then I got jumped by some roaches and he got away.
1DI0004121	She was leaving her quarters just as I got there, but then I got jumped by some roaches and she got away.
1DI0004122	Don't worry, we'll find that little punk. He can't hide forever.
1DI0004123	Don't worry, we'll find that little bitch. She can't hide forever.
1DI0004124	Righto. Give a yell if you see anything. I'm going to head down this way.
1DI0004125	Oh, well, right over there through that door. You'll have to turn on all three generators. None of 'em will take the load by themselves any more.
1DI0004126	Now, I'd do it myself but I'm under orders from the Overseer not to turn them back on without his say so.
1DI0004127	But I don't suppose I know anything about what you might get up to.
1DI0004128	Stevie, thank God... I... I was at Bea's, worried about the kids... the roaches...
1DI0004129	Geez, Mom, I don't have time for this! Why didn't you stay with Aunt Beatrice? There's important stuff going on... oh, come on. I'll take you home.
1DI0004130	I'm sorry, Madison. I am. But what choice do I have?
1DI0004131	I thought I knew you... I trusted you! We all did! How can you be so selfish?
1DI0004132	Selfish? This is my child we're talking about, Madison! My child!
1DI0004133	It's you and me, now, okay? You and me. But that's okay. So long as we've got each other, that's all that matters.
1DI0004134	No, no, put that away. This one's on the house. And now a toast. To James and his cheery cherub. May your future be safe, bright, and boring as hell.
1DI0004135	Shh... You're safe now. No more monsters. No more nightmares. Shh... That's it. Daddy's got you
1DI0004136	Yes, yes. Cardiology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry. Whatever your needs. You'll find I can handle, well I can handle just about anything.
1DI0004137	All right. Just remember one thing. We need a doctor, not a deadbeat. Fail to meet my expectations, and there will be repercussions.
1DI0004138	Not so bad, huh? A bit chilly maybe, but we'll get used to that. A few decorations, some donated toys, and this place will feel just like home. Home
1DI0004139	Hmmmm... Good? Huh, is that good? Here you go... No... Not too fast. That's it. That's it. Everything on the spoon. Come on, you can do it.
1DI0004140	It's a pleasure. I'm Jonas. Um... I guess... I'm your new assistant.
1DI0004141	It's okay! It's okay, see? Just a little cut. Good thing your daddy's a doctor, huh? I know just the right kind of kiss to make it better
1DI0004142	Ahh, it's my stupid ankle, doc. Sprained, broken, I don't know. Slipped on some grease in one of the maintenance tunnels.
1DI0004143	Your mommy? Oh, sweetie... I... Of course I miss her. I miss her... so much. Each day more than the last.
1DI0004144	You are to mend broken bones, prescribe medications, and see to the health of my residents. These "experiments" are a waste of time!
1DI0004145	Don't be a damned fool! We know nothing of the viruses or bacteria that survive down here! We experiment to prepare. We prepare to survive.
1DI0004146	What's the matter, teacher's pet? Gonna cry? Awww... Waaahh! Go run home to daddy.
1DI0004147	No, but close. Not 45, 55. You've got to carry the 1, right? So you put the 5 there and the one goes over there. See? Easy.
1DI0004148	Yes, and Amata can come over after you clean your room! Now move! This place is disgusting.
1DI0004149	What is their problem, anyway? So I'm the Overseer's daughter? So what? Like I get any kind of special treatment! At least at least I've got you.
1DI0004150	Ah. Well... Umm. You'd think being a doctor would make this easy...
1DI0004151	Boys and girls have different parts. Right? And when a boy and a girl love each other
1DI0004152	That was amazing, sport! Four strike outs in a row! I'll tell ya doc, I think we're looking at the new Vault 101 MVP!
1DI0004153	Revelation, 21:6. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
1DI0004154	Come on, doc. Just one more month, that's all I'm asking for. Without those pills, I I just don't know what I'll do. Please, I'm begging you.
1DI0004155	It's time for you to go home. Tell your father I want to see him in my office first thing in the morning. Amata, I want to talk to you. Now.
1DI0004156	No, Mister DeLoria, that is not correct. The Battle of Hastings was 1066. 2077 was the end of the world. Tell me. Are you really that stupid?
1DI0004157	Stop fussing! You look great! Now go! You want to be late for you own prom?
1DI0004158	Don't give me that! You were drunk! All of you! What if I hadn't walked in? Hmm? Did you think about that? What if the Overseer found you first?
1DI0004159	There's nothing out there. Just... Horror. Pain. Grief.  You have a good life in this vault. You shouldn't think about such awful things.
1DI0004160	Well that's my job, isn't it? To turn you into a grown-up? Make sure you're ready to handle adult life here in the vault? You're not a kid anymore.
1DI0004161	Here are those results you wanted, doc. From the, um... secondary experiment?
1DI0004162	Oh my God. Please, doctor. Please! I know you have stuff here. Drugs! You have to fix this! My God, I can't be pregnant
1DI0004163	Ha ha! Look at that! What'd I tell you, huh? Work hard enough, and anything is possible. Even an "A" from Mister Brotch! Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0004164	Yeah? Well daddy doctor ain't here to save you now, is he? So what you gonna do now, huh? What you gonna do?
1DI0004165	What are you looking at? Stop gawking and get back to work. Selfish and insubordinate, just like your father
1DI0004166	Look, it's just... You need to know these things. I'm not going to be around to hold your hand forever...
1DI0004167	The sooner we get there, the better.
1DI0004168	You're a goddamn liar. You told me we were going to Rivet City but we've been out here for over five days! I've had it. I'm going back.
1DI0004169	Well, you kept your promise. I really didn't think you would. Thank you.
1DI0004170	Don't be gone too long.
1DI0004171	According to our latest reconnaissance report, Enclave soldiers have taken complete control of the Project Purity facility.
1DI0004172	They've brutally murdered innocent scientists, including James. He went there to revive the project, and died for his efforts.
1DI0004173	They will answer for their crimes. I haven't worked so hard just to sit idly by and watch the Enclave undo what little we've accomplished here.
1DI0004174	Here I sit, in the safety of the Citadel, while the people of the Wasteland thirst, and suffer, and die. Here I sit, a failed, feeble old man.
1DI0004175	What have I really accomplished? How many have I truly helped? The Super Mutants still roam rampant. The people still die of thirst and radiation.
1DI0004176	The Western Elders cease to acknowledge my existence. Some of my own people have even gone Outcast.
1DI0004177	And now... the Enclave. Technologically superior. Infinitely resourceful. The time has come to pass the mantle to more able hands. But is she ready?
1DI0004178	I cannot -- I will not -- allow the Enclave to control the one thing that could bring even the slightest spark of hope to these people.
1DI0004179	Project Purity would mean millions of gallons of pure, clean water for the people of the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0004180	James never got the damned thing to run. Neither did we, for that matter. But the Enclave...
1DI0004181	If they controlled that much clean water... they would control the entire Capital Wasteland.
1DI0004182	I simply cannot allow that to happen.
1DI0004183	Primary Targets: Any and all Red Chinese invaders. Emergency Communist Acquisition Directive: Immediate Self-Destruct -- Better Dead than Red.
1DI0004184	Voice module online. Audio functionality test... initialized. Designation: Liberty Prime. Mission: the Liberation of Anchorage, Alaska.
1DI0004185	I should let you know: I'm not going to use any of our equipment to provide parts for you. You'll have to pay for them.
1DI0004186	If you want to pay for the parts, yes.
1DI0004187	I hope you're willing to pay for the parts -- you're not getting them from our supplies.
1DI0004188	Yeah, I suppose.
1DI0004189	Sure. Just be quick about it.
1DI0004190	It takes some stones to admit a mistake. Maybe you're not so bad, stranger. Tell you what, buy me a drink sometime and we'll call it even.
1DI0004191	So, what do you want that's worth pissing me off over?
1DI0004192	Oh? Oh really? Look, I know how you wasters are. You cap a few Radscorpions and think you can walk around like you own the fucking place.
1DI0004193	But things work differently around here. You got a problem with that, then you go ahead and meet me in the Lyons' Den after lights out.
1DI0004194	I'll solve your little problem the old fashioned way.
1DI0004195	That's what I thought.
1DI0004196	I never thought much about 'em until you showed up. They have the bots, but they've been buzzing around for as long as I can remember.
1DI0004197	To tell you the truth, I figured that the Enclave were long gone. Most of us thought the radio and the bots where just relics.
1DI0004198	I don't trust him. I know, I know, I should take faith in my brother, but he disappears for days out into the Wastes.
1DI0004199	He comes back without a word. He only reports to Sentinel Lyons, and doesn't tell the rest of us what he's up to. I can't trust a soldier like that.
1DI0004200	The other guys, they think it's a joke. Glade's even got a betting pool going to find out Gallows' real name. A betting pool. Honestly...
1DI0004201	My "story"? I blow the head off of anything more'n two hundred meters downrange.
1DI0004202	I'm the best shot in the Brotherhood of Steel, bar none. Not even Colvin can match my kill count. That's my "story."
1DI0004203	Hey, Wasteland humor! I like that! Got any more... funny man?
1DI0004204	Hey, Wasteland humor! I like that! Got any more... funny girl?
1DI0004205	Damn right it is. Last time I checked, it wasn't called the "Sisterhood of Steel." Hell, even Sarah has to prove herself to the knuckle draggers.
1DI0004206	Every once in a while, we have to show 'em what's what.
1DI0004207	Ha. Funny. Here's some free advice: You're our guest, so I'd be real careful about who you insult.
1DI0004208	That sort of thing might fly out in the Wastes, but here in the Citadel, it'll earn you a few broken teeth.
1DI0004209	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that'll land a little girl like you in the infirmary.
1DI0004210	See? That. Right there. That's the sort of shit that gets a man injured.
1DI0004211	Yeah, see... my friends can joke about my name. Last I checked you're not on that list. But I'll let it go, you just watch yourself.
1DI0004212	Right to the point. I like that. What do you need?
1DI0004213	Brothers, as we take our meal this day, let us reflect upon the words of Elder Patrocolus of the Montana Bunker.
1DI0004214	"It is in service of Steel and guardianship of one's Brothers that each man finds his purpose.  My friends, stand with your Brothers. Guard them...
1DI0004215	...guide them. And in each of them find purpose." Look around this table, my Brothers. Look into the eyes of each man and woman seated here today.
1DI0004216	Pledge in your hearts and minds, pledge by your guns that you will stand with them in battle until the end. Trust each of them with your life.
1DI0004217	And earn the trust of each in turn. Eat well, my friends.
1DI0004218	Brothers, today I offer a simple prayer.
1DI0004219	Hail, Creator. Blessed is your power and mighty is your gift of Steel.
1DI0004220	Bless us today, your noble warriors who dwell in this hall.
1DI0004221	Let us ride upon wings of thunder and chariots of glory, to bring destruction to your enemies.
1DI0004222	To bring destruction upon your wicked enemies."
1DI0004223	This is not normally something that we do. Trade with outsiders has proven to be... problematic in the past.
1DI0004224	However, considering the circumstances... So be it. I'll send word to Durga that you have full access to trade.
1DI0004225	No. I don't.
1DI0004230	I'm glad that we understand one another.
1DI0004231	... what's the pool up to now, anyway?
1DI0004232	Nice try, though.
1DI0004233	Haven't we been through this already?
1DI0004234	Fine. I'm tired of this game. Irving. My name is Irving. There. Go collect your money.
1DI0004235	Maybe now they'll leave me alone about it.
1DI0004238	No. We can't.
1DI0004239	Yeah. Never mind.
1DI0004240	Really? You're kidding me. What is it?
1DI0004241	You figure out his name yet? Haha! Yeah, I thought not.
1DI0004242	Oh man, there's something wrong with that boy. Ain't nobody around here that even knows his real name.
1DI0004243	We got a betting pool in the pride, whole pot goes to the first person who can find out his real name.
1DI0004244	It's gotta be, what? 2000 caps now? Boy's a mystery, no doubt about it.
1DI0004245	If you can figure out his real name, the money's all yours.
1DI0004246	Nope. No one knows his name, where he comes from -- nothin'. He's a mean little bastard for sure.
1DI0004247	He'd be a Paladin by now for sure, except that he ain't got no interest in leadin'. Only killin'. I'm just glad he's on our side.
1DI0004248	Ha! Good point. The pool is up to about 1,000 caps these days.
1DI0004249	Now, c'mon! C'mon! What's his name?
1DI0004250	Hahahaha! Irving! Are you serious?
1DI0004251	Oh man... wait until the other guys hear this... Irving!
1DI0004252	Here's the pool. You earned it!
1DI0004253	Ha! It's not like he'd tell you anyway.
1DI0004254	Did you see, sir? I nailed it. Right under the target. Boom! That's a dead mutie right there.
1DI0004255	All right! That was perfect! I got it dead on! What do you think of that, sir? Good enough to take out a mutant, right?
1DI0004256	Soldier, don't you dare start running that mouth until you can put one of those grenades through a fourth story window at 200 yards.
1DI0004257	Yeah, sure. That's one dead mutant. But the Brother who was using that car for cover is dead too. Learn to check your zone, maggot.
1DI0004258	But... sir! The throw was good! It cleared the line and... and... look! The wall wasn't even hit with shrapnel! I... I'm sorry. I'll try again.
1DI0004259	I'm... I'm sorry sir. I'll keep trying.
1DI0004260	You're damn right you will. And you'll keep at it until you learn to keep that mouth shut. We've got no room for braggarts here.
1DI0004261	Good choice. Pride has taken down more Brothers than I can count. You'd best remember that.
1DI0004262	Damn. Sir, I think the sights on my pistol are off. I'm aiming dead on and it keeps firing to the left.
1DI0004263	There's something wrong with this weapon, sir. I can hear shells catching in the chamber when I fire.
1DI0004264	Are you kidding me? It's not the weapon, Initiate! Try holding the gun properly instead of firing from the hip like some goddamned cowboy.
1DI0004265	The weapon isn't the problem, Initiate. You just shoot like my goddamn grandmother. Actually, strike that, my Mrs. Gunny was a deadeye.
1DI0004266	What do you suggest, sir? No matter what I do, all my shots pull to the left.
1DI0004267	If it's not the weapon, then what is it, sir?
1DI0004268	Try loosening your grip, maggot. Hold the weapon higher -- see nothing but the sight and the target. Try not to screw it up this time.
1DI0004269	Stop shooting with your eyes and your hand. A soldier kills with his heart. Focus. Lock on to your target and destroy it. Now give it another try.
1DI0004270	I feel good, sir. I think I get what you were talking about. When I let go and see only the target, the bullets fly right where I want them to go.
1DI0004271	I think I understand what you were saying, sir. When I calm down and focus, I don't see anything but the target.
1DI0004272	Then you've reached a new level of understanding. Combat does not take place in the brain. It is passion, instinct, and the will to survive.
1DI0004273	You're not quite as worthless as you look. Remember, if you overthink combat, you're dead. You have to WANT to survive more than your enemy.
1DI0004274	I understand. Like you said: no man may be defeated so long as his will to survive remains.
1DI0004275	I understand, sir. Like you said: fill your soul with thunder, fight with a heart of steel.
1DI0004276	So it was taught to me, so will you teach it some day. Enough jaw, maggot. Back to work.
1DI0004277	The Brother who taught me was a wise man, Initiate. But even will requires practice. Back on point.
1DI0004278	Very well.
1DI0004280	You are currently in A Ring. Here, you will find the Great Hall, the Lyons' Den, and the Archives.
1DI0004281	Beyond this area is B Ring, quarters for the Knights, Scribes, and Elder Lyons.
1DI0004282	Outside in the Bailey are the training areas and access to the Initiates' barracks.
1DI0004283	Other than that, down those steps is the Lab. Be careful around there, the Scribes are touchy about who goes near their toys.
1DI0004284	This is B Ring. Here you'll find the general barracks, sick bay, and Elder Lyons' quarters.
1DI0004285	Through those door, you'll find A Ring -- the Great Hall is there, as well as the Lyons' Den and the Archives.
1DI0004287	Other than that, go through A Ring to get to the Lab. The Scribes do most of their work on the projects down there, so watch what you touch.
1DI0004288	You are currently in the lab. This area belongs mainly to the Scribes. They do their technological R&D down here.
1DI0004289	Up those stairs is A Ring, our main gathering area. The Great Hall is there, as well as the Lyons' Pride quarters and rec room, and the Archives.
1DI0004290	Head through A Ring to get to B Ring, general quarters are there, our doc is across the hall from those, and Elder Lyons' quarters are in the back.
1DI0004292	This is the Inner Bailey. These are the training areas and access to the Initiates barracks is across the cut.
1DI0004293	Through those doors to the east is A Ring. The great hall is there, as well as the Lyons' Pride quarters and rec room, and the Archives.
1DI0004295	The lab is underground. That area belongs mainly to the scribes. They do their technological R&D down there, so watch your step.
1DI0004296	You could say that. We have an old Robo Doc. He's a bit creepy, but he does the job. You'll find him in B Ring.
1DI0004297	You could say that. We have an old Robo Doc. He's a bit creepy, but he does the job. He's here in B Ring.
1DI0004298	Word came down that you got permission from Elder Lyons to trade, so just head down to the lab and talk to Knight Captain Durga.
1DI0004299	Word came down that you got permission from Elder Lyons to trade, so go talk to Knight Captain Durga. She's here in the lab.
1DI0004300	Well, any one of us would see Knight Captain Durga down in the lab. But since you're an outsider, you'll need permission from Elder Lyons.
1DI0004301	Well, any one of us would see Knight Captain Durga, here in the Lab. But since you're an outsider, you'll need permission from Elder Lyons.
1DI0004302	Heard you took the pot. Good work. Of course, I'm not going to ask how you found out what his name was...
1DI0004303	Gallows? He's not a bad guy, truth be told. He just doesn't talk much, and if it ain't soldierin', that boy has no time for it.
1DI0004304	Tell you what, though -- he's the meanest son of a bitch around here. All business. The rest of us, we get our R and R in. Not Gallows.
1DI0004305	There's even a betting pool on who can find out his real name. Talk to Glade about it. He'll tell you.
1DI0004306	Oh, now you want story time? Sorry. I'm not havin' it.
1DI0004307	Now that's a story... The only reason I'm here is because of Elder Lyons. You see, I grew up in the Pitt. Don't suppose you've ever been there, huh?
1DI0004308	It's about 500 klicks to the northwest. Place is a nightmare -- three irradiated rivers coming together. People there were... not well.
1DI0004309	But the Brotherhood of Steel came down on the place with a righteous hammer. They called it "The Scourge."
1DI0004310	It was a Brotherhood operation. They marched in and swept the place clean. Most of the people there were half-mutated, cancerous, vile things.
1DI0004311	And these people... rape gangs, torture squads... it was pure chaos there. The Scourge is the best thing that could have happened to it.
1DI0004312	This was way back, before the Citadel was fortified. Part of the early recon after the Brotherhood first arrived in this area.
1DI0004313	One night, a squad of Brothers led by Paladin Lyons swept into the city from over Mount Wash, tearing apart anyone who stood against them.
1DI0004314	They were completely outnumbered. And still they razed that place to the ground.
1DI0004315	As they swept through, the Brotherhood policed up every non-mutie child they could find. Turns out, there weren't that many.
1DI0004316	Me and maybe twenty others. The younger we were, the less of a chance that we were mutated. It was ugly work, no doubt, but it had to be done.
1DI0004317	I'll never forget the sight of the Brotherhood of Steel breaching the breast of the mountain at dawn.
1DI0004318	Elder Lyons brought us all back to the Citadel. He said it was the safest place he knew of. This place was still being converted.
1DI0004319	He put us in as Initiates and kept a watchful eye over us. He was tough, but he taught us to stay alive. The man is like a father to me.
1DI0004320	Nah. The amazing thing is Elder Lyons. He risked everything -- went in outmanned and outgunned. I'll never be able to thank him enough.
1DI0004321	So I do my best to serve the Brotherhood. I know that's what he really wants. In time, I'm sure you'll understand...
1DI0004322	You think that's funny? Elder Lyons is a great man who risked a lot for the Wastes.
1DI0004323	If I hear you disrespect him, or me, like that again, we're going to have words...
1DI0004324	Hell if I know. I never knew them. I lived on the street and fought with rats for food.
1DI0004325	All of 'em became Initiates. Most of them went on to become Brothers. A lot fell in action.
1DI0004326	I'm the only survivor of the Scourge of the Pitt still stationed at the Citadel.
1DI0004327	Normally, that would get you a crack across the jaw. But since you didn't know what the Pitt was like, I'll let it go.
1DI0004328	I still have nightmares about the place. Thirty years and how many horrors later, and the Pitt is still the worst thing I've ever seen.
1DI0004329	It was ugly work, sure. Questionably moral? No doubt. But there was no other choice. That city had to go.
1DI0004330	The rivers. Even after the war, they were still flowing, but irradiated, and filled with God knows what else.
1DI0004331	I saw things there I can't even begin to describe. I was only... what... eight years old when I left? Hell of a thing for a kid to go through.
1DI0004332	Hey, you wanted to hear it.
1DI0004333	Right... so where was I? Oh, yeah. Brotherhood swept into the Pitt on the night of the Scourge.
1DI0004334	Then you don't have to hear it. The hell with you.
1DI0004335	Now see... That was just rude. Fine, no story for you.
1DI0004336	I am charged with the duty of turning these maggots into Brothers of Steel.
1DI0004337	With the threat of the Enclave, they're likely going to be pressed into service before they've taken the oath.
1DI0004338	So, I've got a lot of work to do.
1DI0004339	Medical procedures initiated. Administering treat... ERROR ERROR!
1DI0004341	Medical procedures initiated. Administering treatment. Please stand still.
1DI0004342	Acknowledged.
1DI0004343	Acknowledged. Hitting the rack!
1DI0004344	There has been an error in the medical subsystem. Please run a level two diagnostic.
1DI0004346	Why, a great many things!
1DI0004347	There are three Orders within the Scribes, you see. Each dedicated to a different field of study.
1DI0004348	Indeed I can!
1DI0004349	Pay no heed to those headstrong Knights, with their pop guns and bravado.
1DI0004350	It is the Scribes, the Scribes who make the Brotherhood what is truly is! The brawn is useless without the brain, hmm? He he he.
1DI0004351	Each Order of Scribes is dedicated to a unique field. All equally important. All more important than those dim-witted grunts.
1DI0004352	Well, there are a number of Orders within with the Scribes, each dedicated to a specific area of research...
1DI0004355	Let me know if you need something else.
1DI0004356	The Order of the Sword is responsible for weapons research and development. Guns, ammunition -- anything of an offensive nature.
1DI0004357	Defensive research is done by the Order of the Shield. Power Armor, defensive structures -- anything that is intended to protect us.
1DI0004358	The Order of the Quill preserves the written knowledge of the ancients, seeking out all manner of books and holotapes.
1DI0004359	Order of the Sword, Order of the Shield, Order of the Quill. Weapons, defenses, and research. Respectively.
1DI0004360	Of course. There's the Order of the Sword, Order of the Shield, and Order of the Quill.
1DI0004361	The Order of the Sword develops and maintains the Brotherhood's weapons. The Order of the Shield does the same for our Power Armor and defenses.
1DI0004362	The Order of the Quill is responsible for recovering and preserving knowledge, ancient and otherwise.
1DI0004363	Actually, I am proctor of the Order of the Quill. I oversee the Archives and Library here in the Citadel.
1DI0004364	We are dedicated to preserving the history of the Brotherhood as well as unearthing the secrets of the pre-war civilizations.
1DI0004365	We have a single field associate: Scribe Yearling. She operates out of the former Library of Congress to the northeast.
1DI0004366	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my boy! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
1DI0004367	I'm the Proctor of the Order of the Sword, you see. Weapons research, development and maintenance -- all my responsibility.
1DI0004368	Sword! Of course! Weapons, my girl! You name it, I've helped someone kill it.
1DI0004370	I am Proctor of the Order of the Shield. I oversee the others in my Order, and make sure our defenses are up to snuff.
1DI0004371	Do you know how long it took to fortify these ruins? From the husk of the Pentagon I carved a grand Citadel! No easy task, my friend!
1DI0004372	Ah, but that was yesterday, when all we had to worry about was those damn Super Mutants. The Enclave, now... That's a different problem altogether...
1DI0004373	We believe in technology, in the triumph of the creations of the ancients over the horrors and evils of the Wasteland.
1DI0004374	We believe in trust. Trust in technology. Trust in our fellow Brothers. Trust in our Elders.
1DI0004375	Ah, and we believe in victory. Our forces have dwindled, but still we fight on. Super Mutant, Enclave, it matters not. Surrender is not an option.
1DI0004377	We first arrived in the Capital Wasteland in 2255. In those first couple of years, we discovered the Citadel, Super Mutants, and Project Purity!
1DI0004378	Ah, the purifier. What an undertaking. The work your father and his team did was... amazing. The Brotherhood helped protect them, you know.
1DI0004379	At least for a little while. But we were stretched thin as it was, even back then. We had to pull our forces out. When we did, the place was overrun.
1DI0004380	I imagine that's when your father left. I... I'm sorry, I wish things had turned out differently.
1DI0004381	Elder Lyons leads us. Star Paladin Cross is his seneschal. Sentinel Lyons', the Elder's daughter, commands the Lyons' Pride, our elite combat squad.
1DI0004382	The Paladins lead the Knights. The Knights are the core of the Brotherhood -- they scour the Wastes to eliminate evil and recover technology.
1DI0004383	Scribe Rothchild oversees the Scribes in their duties to seek knowledge and restore the technology the Brotherhood has acquired.
1DI0004384	I heard that you found out about his real name. Interesting. I wouldn't expect that he'd just tell an outsider something like that.
1DI0004385	But he's a good soldier, there's no doubt. I did hear that they have a betting pool about his real name, though.
1DI0004386	He's a good man. The other members of the Pride don't seem to trust him. He's quiet, he doesn't horse around with them, and he keeps to himself.
1DI0004388	I plead for your pardon if my behavior offends you, sir. We don't get many visitors in the Citadel.
1DI0004389	The Brothers and Elder Lyons are excellent teachers, but I get nervous about the protocols. The codex says that outsiders are not to be trusted.
1DI0004390	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself," it says.
1DI0004391	I plead for your pardon if my behavior offends, ma'am. We don't get many visitors in the Citadel.
1DI0004394	It's not simply the outsiders that we are wary of, anybody who has not taken the Oath of Fraternity is suspicious to us.
1DI0004395	The Codex says: "Fear those who do not pledge to the Brotherhood for though their eyes may be opened through service, they are now blind"
1DI0004396	But it also tells us "Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you".
1DI0004397	Elder Lyons trusts you, so you are free to stay here.
1DI0004398	I... don't... I mean... if Elder Lyons chooses to show trust in you, then by the oath, I must trust you as well.
1DI0004399	"Give way your suspicions to the wisdom of thine Elder. Where he shows trust, so shall you," says the Codex.
1DI0004400	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a man of honor.
1DI0004403	Even if I don't understand why he would trust someone like you, I obey him and welcome you here. I only hope that you are a woman of honor.
1DI0004404	It is not personal, anybody who has not taken the Oath of Fraternity is suspicious to us.
1DI0004414	Oh! Well... Thank you! Your words are... very kind. Kinder than those I usually hear.... Is there... something I can help you with?
1DI0004415	Well... yes, sir. If I may speak my will: You do, sort of. We don't have many guests in the Citadel.
1DI0004416	And when we do, they're usually visiting Brothers. Outsiders are not to be trusted, so says the codex.
1DI0004417	"Shield yourself from those not bound to you by steel, for they are the blind. Aid them when you can, but lose not sight of yourself".
1DI0004421	Go on...
1DI0004422	I'm listening.
1DI0004423	You heard what the others have been saying? About the Enclave?
1DI0004424	What's your tactical assessment of this new... situation?
1DI0004425	I heard Elder Lyons talking to Rothchild. Sounds like even he's worried about the Enclave. Think I'm just being paranoid?
1DI0004426	So what do you think?  Can we take these Enclave guys?
1DI0004427	I ran some scans on the Enclave positions at the purifier. That's some serious firepower they're packing. What do you think?
1DI0004428	Does this sound noble enough? "Quail before me, foul Super Mutant! Thine end is at hand! Yield, that I may ease thine suffering!"
1DI0004429	Look, the Enclave has the tech, they have the resources. But do they have the heart? I don't think so. We'll hold true.
1DI0004430	Please. We'll win this. You know why? We need to. Hasn't that always been enough? You worry too much.
1DI0004431	You're kidding me, right? Tin soldiers in devil suits, and you lose your nerve? Those Enclave troops are a joke.
1DI0004432	The truth? We can barely fend off the Super Mutants. Now we have a new threat to contend with? Doesn't look good.
1DI0004433	Have you seen that Enclave Power Armor? That's the Advanced Mark II! I don't know if a standard round can even penetrate that stuff!
1DI0004434	Scribe Peabody was telling me about those Enclave Plasma weapons. You know they can turn a man to goo? How the hell do you defend against that?
1DI0004436	Why... are you talking like that?
1DI0004437	So you're saying... we're all going to die. That's, um... very optimistic. Thanks.
1DI0004438	Sigh. Guess I need to talk to Scribe Jameson. Make sure all my, you know, "personal information" is up-to-date. For the scrolls, I mean...
1DI0004439	Pretty dire, huh? Thanks for completely ruining my day.
1DI0004440	Huh. Yeah, I guess I hadn't thought of it like that. Thanks I appreciate the pick-me-up.
1DI0004441	Right, right... Good point.
1DI0004442	Yeah...Yeah! We've handled worse before, right? See, I knew you'd cheer me up. Thanks!
1DI0004443	I've been practicing. Come on, we're a knightly order, right? I figure we should speak the part. I want to sound like Elder Lyons.
1DI0004444	Hey, that's what I'm here for. Anyway, we should get back to our duties...
1DI0004445	Listen, let's talk about this some more later, okay? I have a decent tactical plan I can run by you.
1DI0004446	Look, either way, we should hit the Bailey later and run through some drills. Sound good?
1DI0004447	Tell you what. Let's hook up later and go see Scribe Bowditch. I heard he's been working on some new Power Armor mods. Can't hurt.
1DI0004448	Elder Lyons does not sound like that. You're an idiot.
1DI0004449	Fine. I'll practice on someone else. Thanks for nothing.
1DI0004450	At ease.
1DI0004451	Ah... you're a bit early today, sir. Regardless, I'm happy to report that the development of the Mark II Recon Armor unit is proceeding as planned.
1DI0004452	You're a bit late today, sir. I was afraid that you weren't coming. As per my report that I forwarded to you, the development is on schedule.
1DI0004453	Excellent. I'm a bit concerned, though. Last week, you mentioned a possible delay in the secondary modifications?
1DI0004454	I'm pleased to hear that. Do you anticipate any setbacks? Last month's progress was, well... let's call it "underwhelming."
1DI0004455	There may be a slight delay in the enhancement of the ambulatory gyroscope. A few of the parts I need were lost in the recent... inventory reduction.
1DI0004456	I'm afraid that there may be a delay, sir. So far, I haven't been able to salvage a fellulator unit from the parts that we have on hand.
1DI0004457	We have shortages all around, my friend. Make do the best you can. We may not have the Enclave's resources... but we do have you.
1DI0004458	You'll make do, Bowditch. You always do.
1DI0004459	Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
1DI0004460	Yes, sir. Actually, perhaps I can fashion one out of... hrm... if you'll excuse me, sir. I have to jot something down before I forget.
1DI0004461	Bullshit. That third shot dropped by a couple of inches.
1DI0004462	Yeah, not really. I dropped the fourth shot a couple of inches.
1DI0004463	Are you kidding? A couple of inches? So you get the nose instead of the eye. Who cares?
1DI0004464	A couple of inches? So you'd have taken out his nose instead of his eye? So what!
1DI0004465	I care. If I were aiming for his nose, that'd be fine. But I wasn't. I was going for the eye. Sloppy...
1DI0004466	So, I wasn't aiming for his nose. That's what.
1DI0004467	You're really scary, Dusk. Has anyone ever told you that?
1DI0004468	You're a frightening woman, Dusk. Anyone ever tell you that?
1DI0004469	A few people. But I don't get tired of hearing it.
1DI0004470	All the time, Glade. All the time.
1DI0004471	For someone who should be preparing for an assault, you seem to have a lot of time to be social.
1DI0004472	Oh, please. I'm ready for anything, at all times. I'm just that awesome. You know that.
1DI0004473	You know me, Dusk. I was born ready for anything!
1DI0004474	Well, the rest of us have work to do.
1DI0004475	If only we were all so lucky. I have work to do.
1DI0004476	Certainly, Sarah. What's on your mind?
1DI0004477	Yes, my daughter? What is it?
1DI0004478	I've been talking with the other members of the Pride. We want to assault the purifier, father! Now! The Enclave must pay for what they've done!
1DI0004479	Father... I know that you do not wish to discuss the fate of the Outcasts, but there are some who say...
1DI0004480	Oh, Sarah. My dear, sweet girl. So eager you are to rush headlong into battle. But no, not now. Not yet. Our time will come, fear not.
1DI0004481	You may be a Sentinel, but you're also my daughter. And I won't throw your life away fighting an enemy we know too little about. I'm sorry, but no.
1DI0004482	Yes, fath-... yes, Elder. I understand.
1DI0004483	Yes, father. I understand. You have my apologies.
1DI0004484	It is, Scribe Peabody. Thank you.
1DI0004485	Indeed it does, Scribe Bowditch.
1DI0004486	As you were.
1DI0004487	Hail.
1DI0004489	Hail to you.
1DI0004490	Carry on.
1DI0004494	Good to see you.
1DI0004495	Keep moving.
1DI0004496	At ease, son.
1DI0004497	As you were, Knight.
1DI0004498	Knight.
1DI0004499	Good morning, Elder. I'm sorry to report that things are not as they should be. Ever since Casdin was outcast...
1DI0004500	Greetings, Elder. I wish I could say that things were well. Unfortunately, I am still having supply problems. When Casdin...
1DI0004501	That name is not to be spoken within this Citadel. Do you understand? I wish it were not so, truly I do, but he is Outcast. He has been judged.
1DI0004502	Scribe. You are not to speak the name of an Outcast in the walls of the Citadel. Is that understood?
1DI0004503	I know the protocols, sir. But the equipment that they stole was very valuable. Our weapons are beginning to deteriorate without the spare parts.
1DI0004504	I... I understand, sir. But the Outcasts have stolen a great deal of our uncatalogued equipment. I am beginning to run short of supplies for repairs.
1DI0004505	I understand, Peabody. But you'll need to make do the best you can. If our weapons can't penetrate that Enclave armor, we stand no chance.
1DI0004506	Then make do with what you have. We may lack the Enclave's resources, but I'm counting on your ingenuity to make up for that!
1DI0004507	Yes, Elder. I understand. I'm sure... we've got the parts around here somewhere...
1DI0004508	Yes, Elder. I understand. Forgive me for speaking out of turn. My... frustration got the better of me.
1DI0004509	What is it, Owyn? This robot isn't going to fix itself.
1DI0004510	Hmm? Yes, yes. What is it? Robot to fix, and all that.
1DI0004511	About that. Are you still having that issue with the head laser? I think the term you used was "invariably destructive"...
1DI0004512	Precisely what I'd like to speak with you about. What's this I hear about power consumption actually increasing? We both know that's not an option.
1DI0004513	We've been over this. A slight modification to one system... and all the subroutines go haywire. Don't worry. I'm on it.
1DI0004514	Yesss... And I told you that in order to compensate for last Thursday's... mishap... there would be some complications. I'm dealing with it.
1DI0004515	Rothchild, old friend, you're a brilliant technician. But this old man's patience is wearing thin. I want a full status report in three hours.
1DI0004516	I come to you for results, not excuses, Rothchild. That robot could mean the difference between victory or defeat against the Enclave.
1DI0004517	All right, all right. I'll see what I can do.
1DI0004518	Oh, very well. Now please... giant robot to fix? Hmm?
1DI0004519	Damn it. Well, he's not loaded but I still don't like the idea of him viewing us all as targets. See if you can lock it down.
1DI0004520	Power systems are 90% at startup, but are running at 37% efficiency after coming fully online. I'm looking into what might be causing the leak.
1DI0004521	Enclave strength is at 100%. They're getting reinforcements from somewhere, but we still haven't determined the location of their headquarters.
1DI0004522	Super Mutant activity in D.C. is high, but nothing out of the ordinary. The area around Galaxy News Radio is... nearly secure.
1DI0004523	Enclave troops have fortified the purifier complex. With those vertibirds, they're able to transport personnel at a remarkable rate.
1DI0004524	There's been another Behemoth sighted in the Wasteland, in the Evergreen Mills region. That's heavy Raider country, so things could get interesting.
1DI0004525	It appears the Enclave troops have moved beyond the purifier, into the surrounding Wasteland region. No telling how far they might spread.
1DI0004526	Hmm... All right, thanks for the information.
1DI0004527	I thought as much.
1DI0004528	I see...
1DI0004529	Very well. Thank you for the update.
1DI0004530	All right then.
1DI0004531	If you say so.
1DI0004532	Keep moving! Keep your head down!
1DI0004533	Move! Move!
1DI0004535	Look for cover!
1DI0004536	Damn it, where'd it go?
1DI0004537	Sneaky fuckers, aren't they?
1DI0004538	It's got to be here somewhere.
1DI0004542	Disappeared? Clever.
1DI0004543	It's not over until you lie dead!
1DI0004544	Come back and fight me!
1DI0004545	Your cowardice astounds me!
1DI0004546	Dammit, lost them. Check back in B Ring.
1DI0004547	Zero contact, no kill. Send a team to the Lab. Protect the robot!
1DI0004548	Where'd they go? Check inside!
1DI0004549	Damn. Contact lost. Repeat, contact lost.
1DI0004550	Stay alert, Brothers.
1DI0004551	Am I too much for you to handle?
1DI0004552	Didn't think a Ghoul could kick your ass?
1DI0004553	Come back here! I wasn't done with you yet!
1DI0004554	Go ahead and hide. I like a good chase.
1DI0004555	What fun! A game of hide and seek!
1DI0004556	Lost sight of target.
1DI0004559	I can't see a thing down here...
1DI0004560	Watch the tunnel entrances.
1DI0004561	Huhn?!  Gary!
1DI0004562	Lost target tracking!
1DI0004563	Target lost! Attempting to reacquire.
1DI0004564	Enemy out of visual range. Commence sweep.
1DI0004565	Negative visual on tango.
1DI0004566	Enemy has disengaged and is no longer in sight.
1DI0004567	Reporting target has evaded detection.
1DI0004568	Playing games with me, huh?
1DI0004569	Holy shit! The fucker disappeared!
1DI0004570	Where'd that little fucker go?
1DI0004571	Where'd that little bitch go?
1DI0004572	Awww man, come back! I was havin' fun!
1DI0004573	Shit! Lost 'em!
1DI0004574	What? Where the hell...
1DI0004575	Hey! Come back and fight!
1DI0004576	Runnin' huh? Thought so...
1DI0004577	What a coward.
1DI0004578	Playin' tricks, huh?
1DI0004579	Leaving so soon?
1DI0004580	Where'd you go? Huh? Gonna find you... Gonna KILL you!
1DI0004581	Hey! You disappear! No fair!
1DI0004582	Ha ha! Go ahead and hide little bleeder!
1DI0004583	Aggh... face me you coward!
1DI0004584	Gone! Spineless human!
1DI0004585	What? Did I scare you that easy? Ha ha!
1DI0004586	I've got no targets.
1DI0004587	Anybody got anything?
1DI0004588	Contact lost. Initiating search pattern.
1DI0004589	Sweep the area.
1DI0004590	I have no hostiles.
1DI0004592	Alert. Target lock lost. Beginning search pattern delta seven.
1DI0004593	Alert. Target lock lost. Neutralization by lethal force remains primary objective.
1DI0004594	Alert. Target lock lost. Unneutralized hostile within perimeter.
1DI0004595	Where did you go? Was it something I said?
1DI0004596	I'm coming to find you now. I'm afraid my programming does not allow me to let you get away.
1DI0004597	You're behaving very rudely. I wouldn't hide from you, if our positions were reversed.
1DI0004598	Do not attempt to flee. You will be identified and sanctioned.
1DI0004599	Fugitive is attempting to evade capture. Beginning pursuit.
1DI0004600	Initiating search for hostile target.
1DI0004601	Just what I was hoping for. Trundling around looking for something that wants to blow me to flinders.
1DI0004602	Must we play hide and seek now?
1DI0004603	Ready or not, here I come!
1DI0004604	That's a good start. Now just keep running and we'll call it even.
1DI0004605	Somebody find me something to shoot at!
1DI0004606	Who's got a target?
1DI0004607	Restore contact with the enemy, goddammit!
1DI0004608	So you want to play hide and seek, eh?
1DI0004609	Your prowess at hiding is impressive!
1DI0004610	Go ahead and hide like the rat you are.
1DI0004620	Holy shit! A Stealth Boy!
1DI0004621	A Stealth Boy! Damn it!
1DI0004622	Damn it. Where'd he go?
1DI0004623	Let me go take a look around.
1DI0004624	I bet I know where you went.
1DI0004625	Anybody see anything?
1DI0004626	Split up and search the area.
1DI0004627	Where'd you go?
1DI0004629	Oh man, I think I got something on my shoe.
1DI0004630	That takes care of that.
1DI0004631	You won't be bothering anybody again.
1DI0004632	Teach you to mess with me.
1DI0004633	What a mess.
1DI0004634	Whew!
1DI0004635	Is that the last of them?
1DI0004636	Holy shit, I thought we were zombie toast back there.
1DI0004637	No way. We did it? There's no more of them?
1DI0004638	Ha ha! You zombies can kiss my ass!
1DI0004639	There's more of them somewhere, I just know it.
1DI0004640	Whew. I think we did it!
1DI0004641	We did it!
1DI0004642	Is it over?
1DI0004643	All right! Did you see me? I think that last one was mine!
1DI0004644	Well. That was interesting.
1DI0004645	I think... I think they're dead!
1DI0004646	We won! We beat them!
1DI0004647	Dibs on the white meat!
1DI0004648	Looks like some good eating on that one.
1DI0004649	Mmm. I'm so hungry I could eat the whole thing.
1DI0004650	Your death is my revenge!
1DI0004651	Now I release you!
1DI0004652	Your death is my victory!
1DI0004653	That was barely a fight!
1DI0004654	I'm just getting warmed up.
1DI0004655	Your time here is done!
1DI0004656	Be thankful I was merciful...
1DI0004657	Damned survival guide said these things were cute!
1DI0004658	Looks like we're eating tonight!
1DI0004659	Nothing to it.
1DI0004660	I guess that's that.
1DI0004661	What? There's nothing else to kill?
1DI0004662	What? Is it over?
1DI0004663	Oh my God. I can't believe that just happened.
1DI0004664	<whimpering>
1DI0004665	The Afterlife welcomes you, Outsider!
1DI0004666	And let us say "amen."
1DI0004667	And let those who seek to harm Him feel the cold sting of death.
1DI0004668	Haha!  Gary!
1DI0004669	Gary, Gary, Gary!
1DI0004670	Awww, Gary.
1DI0004671	Good riddance.
1DI0004672	Another notch for my gun.
1DI0004673	Don't mess with the Talons.
1DI0004674	Target eliminated.
1DI0004675	Target destroyed.
1DI0004676	Area clear.
1DI0004677	Resuming standard patrol procedures.
1DI0004678	Enemy eliminated.
1DI0004679	Situation resolved. Status green.
1DI0004680	Dibs on the loot.
1DI0004681	Ha ha! Kick ass.
1DI0004682	Like shootin' fish in a barrel.
1DI0004683	Another one bites the dust.
1DI0004684	Too fuckin' easy.
1DI0004685	That's how it's done, boys.
1DI0004686	And that's how we do things round our way.
1DI0004687	Bah. That wasn't even a fight.
1DI0004688	That was over too soon.
1DI0004689	Sometimes, it's just too easy.
1DI0004690	That was fun!
1DI0004691	Oh man... I was just getting' started!
1DI0004692	Ha ha ha. Too fun...
1DI0004693	Next time, put up a fight...
1DI0004694	I win again!
1DI0004695	That was too easy...
1DI0004696	You lose!
1DI0004697	Okay, who's next?!
1DI0004698	Enemy down!
1DI0004699	All clear. Stand down.
1DI0004700	One more for the Brotherhood.
1DI0004701	Victory!
1DI0004702	Sound the all clear.
1DI0004704	Threat analysis: green. Neutralization operation complete.
1DI0004705	Threat analysis: green. Security operation successful. Resuming normal operation.
1DI0004706	Hostiles neutralized. Recommend immediate repairs to primary systems to ensure continued operation.
1DI0004707	I'm glad that's over.
1DI0004708	I'm sorry it had to end this way.
1DI0004709	I'll always remember you. My memory circuits have almost unlimited capacity.
1DI0004710	Situation... normal. Law and order has been restored.
1DI0004711	Attention citizens. You may now resume your normal activities.
1DI0004712	Law and order has prevailed.
1DI0004713	A little peace and quiet, at last.
1DI0004714	Well, that's it then.
1DI0004715	That's enough excitement for one day.
1DI0004716	That's how we do things in the U.S. army! Hoo-ah!
1DI0004717	Time to hit the showers!
1DI0004718	Another glorious day in the U.S. army!
1DI0004719	Man, I was getting revved too.
1DI0004720	Did you see that shit?
1DI0004721	I am the best.
1DI0004722	That could have been a lot worse.
1DI0004724	That was unfortunate.
1DI0004725	I didn't think I'd get out of that alive.
1DI0004726	That was crazy!
1DI0004727	What's the world coming to?
1DI0004728	I don't have time for this nonsense.
1DI0004729	That takes cawe of that.
1DI0004730	Whoa, that was intense.
1DI0004731	You mess with the Tunnel Snake, and you get the fangs! Yeah!
1DI0004732	That's how we do it! Woo!
1DI0004733	Sucker didn't know who he was messing with! Hah!
1DI0004736	Good enough.
1DI0004737	Well, that's the end of that.
1DI0004738	Glad that's over.
1DI0004740	Phew. I'm glad that's over.
1DI0004741	There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground, and swallows circling with their shimmering sound
1DI0004742	And frogs in the pool singing at night, And wild plum trees in tremulous white
1DI0004743	Robins will wear their feathery fire, Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; And not one will know of the war, not one
1DI0004744	Will care at last when it is done. Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, If mankind perished utterly;
1DI0004745	And Spring herself when she woke at dawn would scarcely know that we were gone.

1DI0004826	One less of those things to deal with.
1DI0004827	Damn it. I kill one and three more show up!
1DI0004828	How many of these things do we have to kill?
1DI0004829	He's down!
1DI0004830	A Brother has fallen!
1DI0004831	You dare take the life of a Brother of Steel!
1DI0004832	His was a good death.
1DI0004833	Focus, Brothers. Focus on the enemy!
1DI0004834	Let his death not be in vain!
1DI0004835	Hell yeah! How do you like me now!
1DI0004836	Thought you could take me, did you?
1DI0004837	Dead!
1DI0004838	He'll be remembered.
1DI0004839	I will avenge you.
1DI0004840	There's no place for disgrace.
1DI0004841	Man down! Man down!
1DI0004842	Unit down!
1DI0004843	Rest easy, soldier!
1DI0004844	Reporting in... we're down a man.
1DI0004845	We have a casualty!
1DI0004846	You've done your deed for God and country.
1DI0004847	Dumbass.
1DI0004848	More loot for me!
1DI0004849	Dammit! They owed me 50 caps!
1DI0004850	Goddamn, I'm glad that wasn't me!
1DI0004851	Oh, you're gonna pay for that.
1DI0004852	<sound of spitting>
1DI0004853	Now I'm REALLY mad!
1DI0004854	Son of a bitch!
1DI0004855	You'll pay for that!
1DI0004856	This ain't over yet!
1DI0004857	Dammit! That was our fourth for poker!
1DI0004859	Man down!
1DI0004860	We've lost one.
1DI0004861	Reporting in... we have a soldier down.
1DI0004862	No! Dammit...
1DI0004863	I'll make them pay for that.
1DI0004864	Go in peace, Brother.
1DI0004865	You can't kill us all!
1DI0004867	He is fallen!
1DI0004868	Dead! No!!
1DI0004869	Bastard! You'll pay for that!
1DI0004870	I can't look!
1DI0004871	No!
1DI0004873	This can't be happening!
1DI0004874	Please no!
1DI0004875	Somebody help!
1DI0004876	Damnit. I'm just trying to keep the peace.
1DI0004877	Goddamnit. Everyone stand the hell down! Let's solve this peacefully.
1DI0004878	Dead. Great.
1DI0004879	Now I'm pissed.
1DI0004880	Argh!
1DI0004881	There. You see? Natural selection at it's finest.
1DI0004882	Death can be so messy, can't it.
1DI0004883	I hope someone deals with that body soon. I detest the smell of rotting flesh.
1DI0004884	Death is such nasty business.
1DI0004891	They killed him!
1DI0004892	They killed her!
1DI0004893	Nobody there. No bucketheads. Just old broken robot.
1DI0004894	Bucketheads are finished! City is ours now!
1DI0004895	Yah... I'm hungry. Let's find meat.
1DI0004896	Hahaha. Stupid robot.
1DI0004897	No entry without tickets. Please present your tickets.

1DI0004909	Scanning for valid ticket... verified. Thank you for riding with Metro.
1DI0004911	Unauthorized metro use detected.
1DI0004912	It actually kinda makes me feel better to talk about it. Go ahead.
1DI0004913	I wish I could answer that, I really do. I don't even remember it happening.
1DI0004914	When the hunger takes over it's like being pushed aside; like something else is controlling me. I can see what's happening, but can't close my eyes.
1DI0004915	I don't even remember exactly what happened until Vance knocked on the door.
1DI0004916	That's the weird thing. He has some sort of crazy sixth sense about it or something. Maybe all of our kind do.
1DI0004917	As soon as I was with the Family, I felt really at home for the first time in my life. It's like all these people are my real brothers and sisters.
1DI0004918	I don't remember how long I sat there on the floor staring at my parent's bodies. Seemed like days.
1DI0004919	I wanted to feed... to eat their flesh, but it was like a little bit of me was holding on.
1DI0004920	Then, out of nowhere, there was shouting outside and a knock at the door. I opened it and it was Vance.
1DI0004921	He seemed to know exactly how I was feeling inside... he took me under his arm and we left. I never looked back.
1DI0004922	Vance told me later that he was basically covering for me and allowing the Family to... to feed at the same time.
1DI0004923	Since my parents were already dead, they drank their blood and left the mark on the wall. He didn't want Evan to suspect I had done it.
1DI0004924	The irony is they were stalking our town to feed anyway. It's almost like Vance knew this would happen...
1DI0004925	Yeah, okay.
1DI0004926	I was about 10 years old and I was playing with Lucy down under the overpass. We loved throwing rocks in the water.
1DI0004927	We saw some Wastelander trying to break open the Brahmin pens and steal one of them, so I ran over and told him to stop.
1DI0004928	He just laughed and pushed me away. When I fell, suddenly my head started to hurt and my eyes got all blurry. It was almost like I blacked out.
1DI0004929	Next thing I know Lucy was pulling me off of the guy... I had ripped his throat open with my teeth.
1DI0004930	She said I like... changed into another person... that I even glared at her and raised my arms like I was going to kill her.
1DI0004931	The Wastelander took a swing at me with some kind of club... I turned around and jumped on him... I tore his throat open with my teeth.
1DI0004932	If he wouldn't have done that, Lucy may have been killed too. I just dunno...
1DI0004933	Lucy said Mom and Dad would never have understood. She told me to keep what I did a secret and that she'd try and help me.
1DI0004934	Thanks to Lucy, she was able to stop that from ever happening again for years.
1DI0004935	Every time I'd feel the hunger, she'd hold onto me and not let go. After a while, the hunger almost seemed to go away.... until... well.
1DI0004936	I dunno. I really don't. I mean, I'm not totally dumb. I know they were in stories and all that.
1DI0004937	But who knows, maybe Vance is right and vampires were just people like us who learned to control their hunger and drink only blood.
1DI0004938	I mean, vampires are regarded as feared monsters instead of hunted animals like cannibals. It kinda makes sense.
1DI0004939	Grady? Maybe. Why you asking?
1DI0004940	Nope! Sorry!
1DI0004941	Holy crap! You have it?
1DI0004942	Well hand it over! I've been waiting over a year for that damn thing!
1DI0004943	Holy crap! That son-of-a-bitch took my caps and ran and now he ends up dead?
1DI0004944	Now I'll never get that package!
1DI0004945	You did huh? Well, if you ever see that lowlife again, tell him Ronald wants his damn package delivered or bring me back my caps.
1DI0004946	Hey, thanks a bunch for bringing it to me. You could have been a jerk and sold it to someone else, but you didn't.
1DI0004947	Ah hell, let me give you the rest of the caps I was gonna give Grady anyway.
1DI0004948	Well, that's awfully generous of you seeing as I never made a deal with you in the first place.
1DI0004949	But I guess it's pretty decent of you not to sell it to someone else instead. Thanks, kid.
1DI0004950	Fine, fine. Anything to get it! Here's your caps, now hand it over.
1DI0004951	Shrewd kid, very shrewd.
1DI0004952	Okay. Seeing as I was going to pay Grady anyway, here's the caps I owed him. Now, lemme have it.
1DI0004953	Ohhh... I know how this game's played, kid.
1DI0004954	Fine. How about I pay you 200 caps for it? It's the same money I would have paid Grady.
1DI0004955	Fine, be an asshole. When you get hungry for caps, you know who to talk to.
1DI0004956	Mercier didn't make it? Damn! How do they expect us to play when we don't even have enough people on our team?
1DI0004957	Well, as long as you brought the formula, I guess we're still in the game.
1DI0004960	Penalty! That's gonna be 2 minutes in the box for you.
1DI0004961	Ice 'em guys!
1DI0004962	Don't take slapshots at me like that! We saw you come out of the Nuka-Cola Plant and we know you've got the formula.
1DI0004963	Now you gotta make a decision. Go for the powerplay or sit in the penalty box?
1DI0004964	The name's Goalie Ledoux and I'm captain of Sudden-Death Overtime, the last of the icegangs.
1DI0004965	There was a time where every city had their own icegangs and thousands would show up to watch them all duke it out in giant arenas.
1DI0004966	We aim to bring those days back!
1DI0004967	This is the mask of my icegang, Sudden-Death Overtime. I'm the team captain, Goalie Ledoux.
1DI0004970	Penalty! No one tries to put one passed Goalie Ledoux!
1DI0004972	Now look, you gonna sell us that formula or do we have to faceoff?
1DI0004973	I'm puttin' 250 caps up on the scoreboard. What do you say?
1DI0004974	That's up to you. We can make a deal or we can faceoff.
1DI0004976	Penalty! No one tries to put one past Goalie Ledoux!
1DI0004978	Well, you're a little shorthanded, but you showed up for the game. The least I can do is make sure it's a short period.
1DI0004980	Now that's teamwork! Good choice.
1DI0004981	Okay team, let's get out of here.
1DI0004982	Nicely played; and I know talent when I see it. Here you go.
1DI0004984	No, no, no. When you're in the game, you have to make split-second decisions; think on your feet. Now come on...
1DI0004985	Yeah. That's what I thought. Now scram!
1DI0004986	I warned you, I was only going to ask once. Now I'm gonna take it from you!
1DI0004988	That was probably the dumbest thing you could have said. Fine, have it your way.
1DI0004989	All right, all right. My mistake. It obviously belongs to you.
1DI0004990	Now... uhhh... you just watch it cause I won't be so nice next time.
1DI0004991	Good. I was afraid I was gonna have to abandon my lab here. That would mean starting all over again.
1DI0004992	It's not easy trying to make Ultrajet you know!
1DI0004993	The secret of making Ultrajet obviously!
1DI0004994	Oh dammit, now the cat's out of the bag. Typical me.
1DI0004995	No! No way! You're not taking the formula from me!
1DI0004996	I suppose you could say that. Ultrajet is almost double the potency of Jet... perfect for Ghouls. Jet barely affects us you see.
1DI0004997	Only trouble is it's almost impossible to gather the ingredients together.
1DI0004998	Say, you might be able to help me with that!
1DI0004999	You never heard of it? Ultrajet is almost double the potency of Jet... perfect for Ghouls. Jet barely affects us you see.
1DI0005002	What the hell is your problem? Fine! You're gonna be like that...
1DI0005003	It takes 3 things to make Ultrajet. Two of the ingredients I got plenty of. The other one is a little harder to find: Sugar Bombs.
1DI0005004	I distill it down to its base contents and add that to the formula then presto... Ultrajet.
1DI0005005	For every box of Sugar Bombs you bring me, I'll pay you 15 caps. So you in?
1DI0005006	Yeah, no kidding. I didn't think you were a freakin' charity.
1DI0005009	Fine, fine. Sheesh. Take it easy. You change your mind, gimme a shout.
1DI0005010	Fine, anything to get what I need. Now scram, I got some preparing to do!
1DI0005011	He's my assistant and my backup. In case things get rough. I wouldn't mess with him if I were you.
1DI0005012	Sure. I stay away from them and they don't bother me. It's a good relationship. They live somewhere East of here.
1DI0005013	If you're feeling foolish, I think there's an underground way through to their place deeper in the metro station here.
1DI0005014	Good... good. There's more out there, so go and find it.
1DI0005015	Nice work. The Ultrajet's coming along nicely.
1DI0005016	Excellent! keep it coming.
1DI0005017	Hmmm, so you wanna live life on the wild side, huh? Okay. Go for it.
1DI0005018	Yeah, as soon as you bring me some more Sugar Bombs.
1DI0005019	What is it with you people? Stop thinking so much. That's what got us all here in the first place.
1DI0005020	Good. Now get going, I have a ton of preparation to do.
1DI0005022	Oh, don't get me started on them. I'm liable to talk about them all day! It even drives poor old Bob crazy.
1DI0005023	They wouldn't listen to me at all! If I told them something simple, then it got done. Otherwise, Birch spent a week looking for a hidden meaning.
1DI0005024	Plus, he used to just pop in whenever he wanted and started chanting this nonsense.
1DI0005025	Sometimes I used to just sit there silently just to make him mad! That was fun for a while.
1DI0005026	Hopefully this will all change now that things are different... thanks to you!
1DI0005027	They won't listen to me at all. If I tell them something simple, then it gets done. Otherwise, Birch spends a week looking for a hidden meaning.
1DI0005028	Plus, he just pops in whenever he wants and starts chanting this nonsense.
1DI0005029	Sometimes I just sit there silently just to make him mad. That was fun for a while, but even that's getting boring now.
1DI0005030	Oh, you wouldn't believe how they handle them. They make them drink this gunk that Poplar makes.
1DI0005031	Sometimes they just go nuts and start running around, and sometimes when they wake up and see me they run for the hills!
1DI0005032	I'll tell you, Outsiders are almost as entertaining as the Treeminders!
1DI0005033	Actually, the kid is the nicest one of all. Yew's her name. She sneaks in here sometimes and just lets me talk about stuff I wanna talk about.
1DI0005034	Bob really likes her too, cause she makes me happy.
1DI0005035	Everything's just fabulous!
1DI0005036	What's the point? Besides, I hate all that cold metal touching my skin. It gives me the willies! So, I'll just stick with visiting when I get sick.
1DI0005037	Fabulous! Can I sell you a pair of sport shoes? Maybe they'd help you catch your wife when she runs away from you!
1DI0005038	And I've got a little number in my shop that should help push up those sagging girls of yours, darling.
1DI0005039	What the hell are you talking about?!
1DI0005040	Come on man. Quit it already! I'm not interested!
1DI0005041	You're not very subtle, you know.
1DI0005042	What?! Are you kidding? I'm too fabulous to settle down.
1DI0005043	That's right. And the safety's off. Back off.
1DI0005044	Same old shit. See something big and ugly moving in the distance. Shoot the hell out of it. Go an' check to make sure it's dead. Rinse and repeat.
1DI0005045	I can assure you, Mr. Wellington, we're not just sunning ourselves out there all day. That's for damn sure!
1DI0005046	Hah! I'm fine with the same old shit all the time. The day something "interesting" happens in the Wasteland, it's time to retire!
1DI0005047	Everything is under control, Ms. Montenegro.
1DI0005048	They don't deserve it. But... oh, what the hell. Go ahead Ms. Primrose. If it'll make you happy, send them whatever you like.
1DI0005049	You're pressing your luck, Hawthorne.
1DI0005050	I'll be sure to discuss it with them Mrs. Wellington.
1DI0005051	Hello Ms. Lancaster.
1DI0005052	I'm afraid not, Ms. Cheng.
1DI0005053	Right. Sure thing, Anthony.
1DI0005054	Everythings fine, Chief. Thanks for keeping us safe.
1DI0005055	Surgery of any kind is always extremely dangerous. The risk of infection is great. A doctor should never cut open a patient unless it's necessary.
1DI0005056	Yes. They are a fine addition. Now, if we can only get the residents to start eating them!
1DI0005057	Susan...
1DI0005058	I'm worried about you, Mrs. Cheng. Come by the Wellness Center, I might have a pill or two that'll help you relax and cope with things.
1DI0005059	Fine, thank you. You and your men patrolling makes everyone feel safe here. Thanks again.
1DI0005060	Do you make me nervous? Uh... No, not at all. Of course not.
1DI0005061	Haha! Nothing you can pin on me, Chief! But shouldn't you be out killing things in the Wasteland  instead of pestering old harmless fogies like me?
1DI0005062	My dear boy. You've got all the adventure you need, right here in these four walls. For starters, you can figure out how to make your wife happy.
1DI0005063	It's a radio play, not a documentary.
1DI0005064	Let's you and I stick to finding trouble to get into here, before we rush out in the Wasteland again; I'll take Gustavo over a Behemoth any day.
1DI0005065	Now there's an interesting idea, Mrs. Cheng!
1DI0005066	I wouldn't know. She's avoiding me lately.
1DI0005067	No worries, Comrade.  Everyone else  has trouble making the meetings, too. When I get my computer working, I'll get you a copy of the minutes.
1DI0005068	<Sigh.> I don't know what to do, Comrade. Every day I fix it, but it always breaks again.
1DI0005069	I shouldn't. A good leader, leads by example. But thank you anyway.
1DI0005070	Right, Susan. Whatever you say.
1DI0005071	Oh. Okay, dear. Goodbye.
1DI0005072	We all feel safe knowing you and your men have this place locked up tight. Thank you!
1DI0005073	I don't scrounge for anything. I run a high class Boutique, doctor, as you know. However, I can check with my supplier about holodisks for you.
1DI0005075	Don't worry about them. Just be yourself dear. You've had a hard life. You deserve some happiness. Hell, we all do.
1DI0005076	What a question! I don't know. I supposed it is. But, it can't always be helped. We can't help who we fall in love with, can we?
1DI0005077	Yeah. I know. It's just... Well, I've been busy.
1DI0005078	Raiders? Again? Well, I'll have to make do. Thank you for the heads up, Chief. And thank your men for us. We are all grateful of your presence here.
1DI0005079	Shoo! Away with you. Leave me alone!
1DI0005080	It's okay, really. I prefer to stay busy.
1DI0005081	Really? He orders that every day. I prefer making more creative dishes. Choose something else, I beg you!
1DI0005082	Something I picked up from my mom. She wasn't always the best mother... but she always showed her love for us in her cooking. I miss her sometimes.
1DI0005083	A sophisticated lady like you slaving over the stove? Don't trouble yourself with that, dear. You kick back and enjoy. I'm here to cook for you.
1DI0005084	Sure! I could always use another pair of hands in the kitchen.
1DI0005085	Oh that? It was nothing. A one time indiscretion, I assure you. Won't happen again, ol' chap. Scouts honor and all that. Care for a drink?
1DI0005086	What? Very funny old man! Well, I hear she's also running low on dried up old raisins, you cheeky bastard! Leave a gent to his drink already!
1DI0005087	Indeed! I'll drink to that!
1DI0005088	Amen. I'll drink to that sister. Cheers!
1DI0005089	Why do you think I spend so much time getting smashed in the lounge?
1DI0005090	Indeed, Mrs. Cheng. Indeed! Sometimes it helps wash away a lot more than just one day.
1DI0005091	Thank you for looking into that situation for me. I'm embarrassed it turned out to be nothing. Well, one can never be too careful.
1DI0005092	Don't be silly. I know enough about them to make being friendly... awkward at best. Besides, I much prefer spending all my time with you!
1DI0005093	Why thank you, dear! How charming of you to say so. Perhaps you and I should start spending some time together? Eh? Ahahah.
1DI0005094	It hasn't been that long since my last "check up." So you know EXACTLY how I'm feeling, doctor.
1DI0005095	Nonsense Edgar! I always find your manners to be quite "up to the task." if you know what I mean! He he he he. See you later, MISTER Wellington.
1DI0005096	Eww! Banish the thought, old man! Seriously though, if you're still around in a decade or two, I might take you up on the offer.
1DI0005097	Why do I intimidate you so? You weren't intimated the other night! Aha! See you around, Don Juan.
1DI0005098	Don't they all, dear? Don't they all!
1DI0005099	What? Are you kidding me?! Mind your own damn business. I don't go turning lights on in your closet, do I? Jeez!
1DI0005100	I'm just great, if you don't count the fact that I'm married to the biggest idiot on the planet!
1DI0005101	If you mean day dreaming about killing Mr. Cheng and knocking a few back in the lounge, then yeah, I'm able to relax once in a while.
1DI0005102	It breaks all the time! Does he take that as a sign to spend time with me? No. Stupid man! He spends hours retyping everything. He's such a loser!
1DI0005104	Cheers.
1DI0005105	I'd be happy to have you help sometime, Mrs. Cheng. Cooking can be very therapeutic.
1DI0005106	I hate that stupid man.
1DI0005107	Who you calling frumpy?! At least my ass isn't shaped like a pear.
1DI0005108	The usual, dear. And please, be sure to remember to measure the salt precisely. We don't a repeat of last weeks debacle.
1DI0005109	Umm... er... why yes, Ms. Lancaster. You are quite the "conversationalist." I await with anticipation our next opportunity for chit chat. Indeed!
1DI0005110	Ewwww! Labcoats are so last century. I have a better idea, Doc. Why don't you come to New Urban Apparel, and I'll give you a complete make-over!
1DI0005111	Yes! But the key to being fabulous, is that it comes from within. What you wear is only half the equation. BELIEVE you ARE already fabulous!
1DI0005112	Whatever, you old hag. I'm just swelling with fabulous.
1DI0005113	Those things are so tacky. How about you swing by New Urban Apparel, and I fit you into a cute Sunday dress? You need to spruce up your look dear.
1DI0005114	Of course! Shopping is wonderful therapy, isn't it? Better than any old pill Doc Banfield prescribes.
1DI0005115	I'm sorry? What?!
1DI0005116	Thank you for your concern, Doctor. But things've been tense is all, and my men are just blowing off steam. Don't worry. They'll be fine.
1DI0005117	And I envy your retirement, Dashwood. Though it's true. There's something satisfying about bagging a Rad-Scorpian at 100 yards with a single shot.
1DI0005118	Cheng. Damn it. Call me "Chief." Chief Gustavo! All that "comrade" nonsense is really getting on my nerves.
1DI0005119	That's kind of you, Ms. Primrose. But it's better if they don't cozy up with the residents. Helps retain discipline and remind them why they're here.
1DI0005120	I'm on duty. You alright Hawthorne? Don't want a repeat of that little stunt you pulled.
1DI0005121	It was very... thorough, Mrs. Wellington. Do the other residents know you have catalogued all their habits and daily routines like that?
1DI0005122	Ms. Lancaster.
1DI0005123	I'd have to say that would be extremely unlikely, Mrs. Cheng.
1DI0005124	I'm afraid the lab coat never goes out of style for me. But I appreciate your concern.
1DI0005125	Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about. Though, it's been awhile since I've seen you. We should schedule a checkup soon.
1DI0005126	Absolutely not. All Wasteland meat MUST be thoroughly cooked. Disease and parasites are killed by the heat. I'm surprised I have to tell you this.
1DI0005127	Ahem. Yes. It has been too long since you've been properly examined.
1DI0005128	Why? Has someone been poisoned?!
1DI0005129	Oh... well... umm... Thank you Susan... er, I mean, Ms. Lancaster. A pleasant day to you.
1DI0005130	I know a little bit about technology. I've picked up a few tricks in my adventures. Why, what seems to be the problem?
1DI0005131	Hawthorne. Go easy on those remaining brain cells, alright?
1DI0005132	You should count yourself very lucky. I do. Most people die a horrible death out there in the Wastes. Excitement and danger often go hand in hand.
1DI0005133	I've had too kill far to many men... listen, Mrs. Cheng... have you tried talking to your husband about things? I think he really cares about you.
1DI0005134	Oh, I don't know. Not so good I guess... Women. Can't live with them. Can't live without them. Know what I mean, Comrade?
1DI0005135	Well, Comrade. My computer keeps breaking, and I have to start over each day. Not to worry though. I've got it practically memorized by now!
1DI0005136	Because, while it's true, some of us are better suited to lead the community, by calling you all comrades, I'm helping you not feel envy or sadness.
1DI0005137	Um. Hi.
1DI0005138	Antique shop? Really, Anthony, you need some new material! And I'm not just talking about your jokes either, darling. Those threads are atrocious!
1DI0005139	Yeah, I pop a couple, then have a Martini. Does wonders. Thanks Doc.
1DI0005140	Mr. Cheng. Shouldn't YOU know what your wife would like? Why don't you go find out what she wants, and I'll see about ordering it for you.
1DI0005141	Let's just say it's high time for a glass of wine. Putting on a happy face for all my customers all the time can be a bit tiresome.
1DI0005142	Yes, Mrs. Cheng. It's not easy though, is it?
1DI0005143	Thank you for saying so, sir. It's always my great pleasure. If you'd ever like to try another dish, I have an extensive menu of delicacies.
1DI0005144	Things are alright, I guess. I'm thinking I should stop by sometime and get some new clothes. I just can't seem to find the time.
1DI0005145	Nonsense. I'm fine. I enjoy making food and keeping the residents happy. A vacation from this would only make me anxious.
1DI0005146	Oh, I'm alright, I suppose. Though, apparently raiders have been attacking the caravans again. Missed a shipment. I'll just have to be be creative!
1DI0005147	Thank you for saying so! It's always been my dream to own my own restaurant. Supplies have been running low, but it just makes me more creative!
1DI0005148	Thank you. It's always my pleasure to serve you Mr. Cheng. If you'd like, I could prepare a special candle light dinner for you and Mrs. Cheng.
1DI0005149	Yes, well. There've been shortages of certain things, so I've had to get creative. I hope everything is to your liking Ms. Montenegro.
1DI0005150	Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Besides, if I didn't cook for all of you, you'd starve to death! Heaven knows none of you can fend for yourselves!
1DI0005151	Why, yes. I believe so. Fairly happy, anyway. I really enjoy what I do. Cooking and preparing meals for the residents makes me happy.
1DI0005152	What? Oh right. Hah! That's a good one, Daring. I'm fine really. I've been drinking since I was a toddler. I can hold my liquor. What's new with you?
1DI0005153	My secret to what? Oh right. The ladies. Always start off with a few drinks to loosen up, then move onto the hard liquor to get the party rolling!
1DI0005154	Indeed! And at the beginning of a long day! Though, I prefer the stiffer stuff myself. So how're you holding up these days? How's that shop of yours?
1DI0005155	I wouldn't pay you so much to hang out with me if I thought you were ugly! I'm just kidding. Stop fishing for compliments. You know you're beautiful.
1DI0005156	Just goes to show you: It's always darker on the other side of the fence.
1DI0005157	EDGAR! I do believe you are trying to shake me off! The fire has finally died away, has it, Edgar? You fancy someone else these days, do you?
1DI0005158	Why thank you Allistair love. Er, I mean: MISTER Tenpenny!
1DI0005159	Doctor Banfield! Have you lost your appointment book? I thought we've made a regular appointment. A "house call" I do believe!
1DI0005160	Yes Edgar dear, I'm quite fine. Thanks for asking! Maybe I'll "see you" around  later, then? When you get out for an "evening stroll," perhaps?
1DI0005161	Whatever. I know your type, Daring. You want me all to yourself. Well, I'm not some trophy animal you can just bag and hang on your wall!
1DI0005162	Don't be scared Irving, dear! I won't bite. Well, not unless you ask me to! Hahahaha!
1DI0005163	Don't be silly, Michael. It's because you pay me to be nice to you!
1DI0005164	Why? You haven't seen him have you?!
1DI0005165	Ha! Well, doc. If you got a pill that will make my husband disappear, I'll gladly take it.
1DI0005166	Yeah. He's so stupid! I don't actually need to sneak out. I just tell him to piss off, and then I leave. If he was smart, he'd try to stop me. Men!
1DI0005167	Oh no! I'm not going to make it that easy for you. If you can't figure it out, then I'm not going to help you. Why are you so stupid?!
1DI0005168	You mean other than the fact that he is an idiot? Or that he's always busy with stupid meetings, or writing stupid books, that NO ONE cares about?
1DI0005169	No amount of drink is going to make my husband less stupid. But, it'll certainly help me forget about him, won't it.
1DI0005170	Yes well. I'm a visionary, that's true. But I'm also a creature of habit. I like my Iguana Bits sandwich just the way I always get it. Thank you.
1DI0005171	Well... I'm glad to know you are getting along. I'll, umm... expect a visit at the usual time. Run along dear. And do be careful.
1DI0005172	Looks like someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I bet I could help you end up on the right side! Haha! Have good day, dear.
1DI0005173	Fine. Keep wearing those rags. But when you're ready for fabulous, you come see me; I've got just the thing!
1DI0005174	No. Can't say that I do.
1DI0005175	Why, you old hag! You're just jealous. My fabulousity pains you, doesn't it? You can't help feel smaller standing before my greatness, can you dear?
1DI0005176	You need to MAKE time, dear! You'll never be fabulous just moping around a kitchen all day. You need to relax, go out, get done up, have some fun!
1DI0005177	And I thought I hated MY life!
1DI0005178	Well, that's more than I had in mind. Maybe I'll just order a new labcoat instead.
1DI0005179	Alright. They're your men. I just don't want to have to sew anything back on because one of your guys got a little carried away.
1DI0005180	That's good to hear... only, you should stick to the suggested dosage, and avoid alcohol for at least two hours after taking it. Come see me soon.
1DI0005181	Fine. For now. I got my eye on you. If you seem to be getting exhausted, I'm prescribing that vacation!
1DI0005182	Ah! I remember now. Yes of course. I'll be sure to bring my medicine bag with me.
1DI0005183	No. I'm afraid you'll need to take care of that one on your own. But I might have something that'll help you cope. Come see me for a prescription.
1DI0005184	Yes, well. You'll think of something I'm sure. Good luck.
1DI0005185	No, no. Of course not you silly woman. It's just that I... well... I think spending time with the other ladies in the Tower might do you some good.
1DI0005186	Um... Yes. Right. Of course. Okay then. See you around Ms. Lancaster.
1DI0005187	I once killed a Yao Guai with my bare hands! Almost lost an arm. But I got the bastard in the end. Ah... Those were the days.
1DI0005188	Hehe. I'm sorry to hear that, Irving. Maybe I should take a look at your computer sometime. Heheh.
1DI0005189	That's the spirit, girl! Every seeming setback is actually just a chance for your genius to shine!
1DI0005190	Just trying to keep busy, I guess. I'm not sure I'm really cut out for the whole retirement thing. Just can't seem to sit still.
1DI0005191	We'll just have to see about that! You watch out! I can be a very stealthy hunter!
1DI0005192	Some men just don't have the hunting instinct, dear. You should try talking to him about your needs.
1DI0005193	Right, comrade! I see. The fabulous comes from the inside out. I will have to remember that. Thank you!
1DI0005194	Oh. I'm sorry Comraaa - err, CHIEF Gustavo!
1DI0005195	Every day it erases everything. Each day I have to start over again. But it's not the end of the world. I have everything memorized. Never mind.
1DI0005196	Yes, you are right, comrade. But I'm afraid I've done something to upset her, and now she isn't talking to me. Never mind. I'll figure something out.
1DI0005197	That's an excellent idea, comrade! I have to get her to stop and listen to me for a moment to even ask her if she'd like that. But thank you though.
1DI0005198	Oh, I see. Well, maybe you're right. Mrs. Cheng spends a lot of time drinking in the lounge, doesn't she.
1DI0005199	Oh... oh. Alright Susan. I'll see you later then?
1DI0005200	I don't know why I'm so stupid. Never mind. I'll go work on my projects.
1DI0005201	Do you realize how often you use that word? You be careful, darling, or you'll wear it out like you've worn out your sense of style.
1DI0005202	Right. Until next time, then.
1DI0005203	Yes, of course, child! Your dishes are always superb!
1DI0005204	That shop is my pride and joy. I like to be surrounded by fine things - a little beauty in all this ugliness.
1DI0005205	Have you tried distracting him, dear? You know, get his "attention" every now and then? Some men are just clueless when it comes to a woman's needs.
1DI0005206	Of course Mister Tenpenny.
1DI0005207	Thank you, but I'm always so busy serving everyone. Maybe you can just pick something out for me and send it along with the hairnets.
1DI0005208	Right, of course. Well, maybe I'll send a special desert over there today, to let them know we appreciate their keeping us safe and sound.
1DI0005209	I found this old cook book for something called "sushi." Um... well, you might want to check up on a few residents I already served it to. Whoopsie.
1DI0005210	Indeed! I'll drink to that! Cheers!
1DI0005211	Nah! Drown the buggars!
1DI0005212	Huh... sure. I'll drink to that Comrade!
1DI0005213	I always have my happy face on! I mean, just look at it! Are you looking? See how happy it is! The key, you see, is not to give a damn about anything
1DI0005214	Oh, I see.
1DI0005215	That's the spirit!
1DI0005216	I just thought it might be helpful for the security team to know where everyone is and what they are doing. You know, in case of emergency.
1DI0005217	Hehe. Of course, love. Until then. Be good boy now! Hahaha.
1DI0005218	Call me Susan. And if you like, we can be on even more "familiar" terms! Hahah!
1DI0005219	A house call, perhaps? I'll be waiting! Hahah!
1DI0005220	Hehehehehe. Oh, Edgar.
1DI0005221	Trust me. I know all about it... You're right, of course. Being bored out of your mind and surrounded by morons ain't all that bad. Even still...
1DI0005222	That wife of yours has you terrified, doesn't she? Don't worry. I can help you relax.
1DI0005223	Haha. Perhap's you're right, dear. But you could always set out a few meals in advance and take a nap once in a while.
1DI0005224	I'm not sure whether to be hurt or flattered by all that.
1DI0005225	I suppose it is.
1DI0005226	I was afraid you'd say that.
1DI0005228	I shouldn't have to talk to him. Why make it easy for him? He doesn't make it easy for me! If he can't see the problem, then he's just stupid.
1DI0005229	That's because men are stupid.
1DI0005230	I guess maybe I should figure out what I want to do with MY life.
1DI0005231	I guess so.
1DI0005232	You're wasting your time. I don't want to have to tell you again. This gun is loaded. I'd hate for it to accidentally go off in your direction.
1DI0005233	At least I'm not some dried up tart, prancing around like the queen of America, carelessly spouting grotesque phrases. "Fabulousity?" Really now!
1DI0005234	Ouch! You wound me!
1DI0005235	You know the other ladies and I don't get along famously. They're quite jealous of me, naturally.
1DI0005236	Whatever. He loves those damn meetings, and that stupid "Community Manifesto" of his more than me. He hardly knows I exist!
1DI0005237	Ha! You'll drink to ANYTHING! Cheers!
1DI0005238	Ha! He's so stupid, he wouldn't know what do to even if I did manage to get his attention!
1DI0005239	Yes they are dear, quite!
1DI0005240	Ohhh. Well, comrade. I don't think I'll ever be able to do that.
1DI0005241	Ha! See?! That's what I'm talking about! Stupid. Stupid man!
1DI0005242	Very well. If you insist on remaining a social hermit, by all means continue to follow me around all day.
1DI0005243	Sorry. Can't talk now.
1DI0005244	Good to see you!
1DI0005245	Hello.
1DI0005246	See you later.
1DI0005247	I'm bored. Let's see if I can lighten things up around here.
1DI0005248	I'm positively famished. I must get something to eat before I pass out!
1DI0005249	Time for a snack.
1DI0005250	Time to take five.
1DI0005251	Mmm. I think I'll go grab a bite to eat.
1DI0005252	Dinner time.
1DI0005253	I think I'll go scrounge up a little something to eat.
1DI0005254	I'm hungry.
1DI0005255	It's time for a little bite of something delicious.
1DI0005256	Think I'll take a moment for myself, and eat a little something.
1DI0005257	My stomach is growling at me.
1DI0005258	Din din! Time to eat!
1DI0005259	I'm starving!
1DI0005260	Well. I guess I better get some food.
1DI0005261	I'm plum puckered out.
1DI0005262	Time to get some beauty rest!
1DI0005263	Well, there's another day done.
1DI0005264	Early to bed, early to rise.
1DI0005265	I'm exhausted. It's time for some shut-eye.
1DI0005266	Off to dreamland I go. Ta-ta!
1DI0005267	I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
1DI0005268	Whew! I'm sleepy. Time to hit the pillows!
1DI0005269	I think I'll turn in for the night.
1DI0005270	Well. I better go pass out for a while.
1DI0005271	It's time for bed. Goodnight.
1DI0005272	<Yawn> I'm off to bed. Sweet dreams!
1DI0005273	I'm tired as hell.
1DI0005274	It's time to earn mamma some sugar.
1DI0005275	I do hope she gets here soon. I'm particularly randy this evening.
1DI0005276	It's play time. I wonder if we will play doctor and nurse again?
1DI0005277	Another evening with Ms. Lancaster. That girl certainly knows how to have a good time!
1DI0005278	SHE never yells at me. SHE appreciates me. Unlike some people.
1DI0005279	I'm umm... I'm going to go stretch my legs for awhile. Take a little walk around the tower to loosen up my nerves a little.
1DI0005281	Excellent!
1DI0005282	Wonderful. Thank you, dear.
1DI0005284	Irving! God! Can't a woman get a little time to herself!?
1DI0005285	Have you seen the way Mrs. Cheng avoids her husband all the time? Poor Mr. Cheng drew the short straw when he married her, didn't he?
1DI0005286	That Susan Lancaster is a real snob. And the way she flirts with all the men! The woman's got no sense of shame! No sense at all, if you ask me.
1DI0005287	I think Mr. Ling is asking for trouble by teasing all the male guards the way he does. What he needs to do is find a nice woman and settle down.
1DI0005288	Have you seen the way Mr. Dashwood skulks about when no one is looking. He's up to something, I'm sure! But what on earth could he be doing?
1DI0005289	Ms. Primrose works too hard, poor girl. How is she ever supposed to land a good husband if she's stuck in her kitchen all day?
1DI0005290	Have you ever wondered why the only house call Doctor Banfield makes is to that Susan Lancaster's room? How positively shameful!
1DI0005291	Why does Mr. Cheng insist on calling everyone "Comrade?" It's "Comrade this." And "'Comrade that." Do you suppose he was dropped often as a child?
1DI0005292	Mr. Hawthorne sure has pickled himself, hasn't he? That man exists in a constant state of inebriation. I wonder what drives him to the bottle so.
1DI0005293	One has to wonder about Mr. Tenpenny, doesn't one? I mean, we're all grateful for the Tower. But... the man is a recluse. I wonder what he's hiding.
1DI0005294	That Mr. Burke is a shady character, isn't he? I've heard some positively awful things about him. But Tenpenny trusts him. So he can't be all bad.
1DI0005295	Ms. Montenegro's quite full of herself, isn't she? Puffed up like a souffle, she is! Ha! That was a good one, wasn't it? I'm quite funny today!
1DI0005296	Yes, dear.
1DI0005297	Oh, I don't know about all that.
1DI0005298	Is that so?
1DI0005299	I hadn't noticed.
1DI0005300	Mm-hmm.
1DI0005301	Right-o.
1DI0005302	Are you even listening to me?!
1DI0005303	Earth to Edgar! Mr. Wellington, are you there?
1DI0005304	You're just humoring me, aren't you? You haven't heard a word I've said, have you?
1DI0005305	Sometimes I get the feeling you're off in your own little world.
1DI0005306	Edgar! I'm talking to you.
1DI0005307	Are you even listening?
1DI0005308	What?
1DI0005309	Yes dear.
1DI0005310	Uh huh.
1DI0005311	Sorry dear... must have dozed off there for a moment.
1DI0005312	I swear Edgar. It's in one ear and out the other with you! Grrr.
1DI0005313	Useless man!
1DI0005314	Edgar! Pay attention when I'm talking to you!
1DI0005315	Sometimes I get the feeling I'm talking to myself.
1DI0005316	More failures mean more meat.
1DI0005317	Failures mean more work.
1DI0005318	Human must not steal its secrets.
1DI0005319	Death to humans, life to us!
1DI0005320	Stuff hard to find.
1DI0005321	Human comes to steal stuff. Kill the Human!
1DI0005322	I wish stupid Fox would shut up.
1DI0005323	He is a failure.
1DI0005324	He come to kill us and take the birth stuff.
1DI0005325	Human? Chance to make us another.
1DI0005326	Waste of time.
1DI0005327	Only fun to shoot at.
1DI0005328	They make me laugh. So small. Ha ha ha.
1DI0005329	Human can't go to top place. Human will die.
1DI0005330	Top place make Human very sick. Not good to eat.
1DI0005331	Find the Human and kill him!
1DI0005332	Rip the Human limb from limb!
1DI0005333	Human means fresh meat!
1DI0005334	Find the Human and make him one of us!
1DI0005335	Fox likes Humans. We should kill him.
1DI0005336	Then Fox should die.
1DI0005337	Your choice, but an addiction ain't an easy thing to kick.
1DI0005339	Your call, mungo.
1DI0005340	Suit yourself. But you'll find out that your habit will cost you more than that in the end.
1DI0005341	Well, this might go better for you if you hadn't blown your money on Jet, don't you think?
1DI0005342	Now, this is a special concoction of pre-war medicine, should flush your system right out...
1DI0005344	Alright... I got some of this pre-war stuff, should flush your system right out...
1DI0005345	I suppose if you can't afford treatment, maybe you can't afford your next fix. So that works out, doesn't it?
1DI0005346	Okay, this should flush you out pretty quick. Now open your mouth and say "Ah."
1DI0005347	I'll be glad to help when you can afford the treatment.
1DI0005348	Come back when you actually have the money, you damn junkie.
1DI0005349	Okay. Hold still. I don't want to make this any more painful than it already is.
1DI0005350	Alright, hold still.
1DI0005351	This may sting a little...
1DI0005352	Then what the hell are you wasting my time for?
1DI0005355	You kiddin' me? What are you wasting my time for?
1DI0005358	Okay, now hold still.
1DI0005359	Stop squirming, you big mungo.
1DI0005360	Hey! If you don't have the caps, you don't get the fix.
1DI0005361	This won't hurt a bit. Nah, just kidding. It will probably hurt a lot. Hold still.
1DI0005363	I'd like to help, but the supplies aren't free. Sorry.
1DI0005364	For crying out loud. Get out of my face then.
1DI0005368	Here. Hold this for me while I stitch you up.
1DI0005369	Now... where did I put that scalpel? Ah! There it is...
1DI0005372	How unfortunate for you.
1DI0005373	Hold on, this is going to ouch a bit.
1DI0005374	Okay, get ready. This'll sting. A lot.
1DI0005380	Alright. Come back anytime you have the caps to pay.
1DI0005381	Alright then.
1DI0005382	Okay then. Try not to get killed out there.
1DI0005385	Glad to be able to help.
1DI0005386	Make it quick.
1DI0005387	Well, speak up then. I don't have all day.
1DI0005388	Let's get on with it then.
1DI0005391	Yeah? What is it?
1DI0005392	Well... I guess I could make an exception. 50 caps -- but that's my final offer.
1DI0005393	All right. But don't let it get around, or I'll have every dirty waster begging me for help.
1DI0005394	Fine. 100 it is. But don't think this makes us friends. This is a special, one-time offer, understand?
1DI0005395	Sure can. Quick and easy, only 100 caps.
1DI0005396	If that's the way you want it, it's all the same to me.
1DI0005397	Then I can't help you. Sorry.
1DI0005398	And a quick shot... all done.
1DI0005399	Sure thing. Here's what I have.
1DI0005400	Sure, here's what I can spare.
1DI0005401	I guess I can spare a few things.
1DI0005407	<aroo?>
1DI0005410	Ha ha! They're my party girls.
1DI0005411	I'm too much man for just one woman, so I need two! I wear them out every night.
1DI0005412	Why should they bother getting dressed when I'm just going to take it off?
1DI0005413	Ha ha! Cherry is my play toy.
1DI0005414	I love my Cherry pie! Love it all night long!
1DI0005415	I like her half naked. I like her all naked, but she says she gets cold.
1DI0005416	Ha ha! Fantasia is my girl Friday... and Monday, and Wednesday...
1DI0005417	She makes all my fantasies come true. Ha ha!
1DI0005418	That's my favorite outfit. If she gets cold, old Dukov knows how to warm her up!
1DI0005419	Hey! Watch your language, clown shoes.
1DI0005420	I don't pay them. They take care of me, so I take care of them. We rub each other wrong all night long! Ha, ha!
1DI0005421	Hey! Watch you language, clown shoes.
1DI0005422	I take care of her, so she takes care of me. Ha, ha! She rubs me wrong all night long. Ha, ha!
1DI0005423	Dukov likes to keep it hot. Ain't no need for nothin' else.
1DI0005424	Dukov liked to keep it hot. He always said there ain't no need for nothin' else.
1DI0005425	Dukey doesn't like me to wear a lot. He says it slows things down.
1DI0005426	Dukey didn't like me to wear a lot. He said it slowed things down.
1DI0005427	Okay. Rivet City has got to be better than this.
1DI0005428	I have my hands in his pants all the time. He probably won't even notice it's gone.
1DI0005429	Only if you take me to Rivet City.
1DI0005430	Anywhere else and I'll just end up being someone else's property.
1DI0005432	And don't think I'm going to give you the same privileges I give Dukov. You and I are sleeping separate.
1DI0005434	This guy is an animal. And not in a good way. But I'm safe here.
1DI0005435	Help yourself, clown shoes. Grab one from the liquor cabinet. I never trust anyone without a drink in their hand.
1DI0005436	Of course I never trust one that does either! Ha, ha!
1DI0005437	Sure. Didn't I already tell you to?
1DI0005438	He's a lecherous old man. The only reason I put up with him and his "needs" is because I'm safe here.
1DI0005439	He tends to shoot first and ask questions later. Don't pull out a weapon near him. He's likely to shoot you.
1DI0005440	And he's really good.
1DI0005441	He's all right. He can be a real fun guy, but he sure knows how to wear a girl out.
1DI0005442	Most of all, I'm safe here. I wouldn't pull out a weapon, even just to show him. He gets kind of paranoid about that.
1DI0005443	Don't get in a shooting match with him. He's really good.
1DI0005444	Ooh! Dukey, is that a rocket in your pocket, or are you just glad to feel me?
1DI0005445	You're a pig, you know that?
1DI0005446	I'm only doing this because he can keep me safe. He's a lot tougher than he looks.
1DI0005447	I'm not sure how much longer that will be enough though.
1DI0005448	Sweet for him maybe.
1DI0005449	I'm just along for the ride. He's good with a gun and knows where to get booze.
1DI0005450	Of course. Why else would I stay with the old fart? You don't think I actually love that bastard, do you?
1DI0005451	He gives me some caps, but it's not what you think. He can be a nice guy.
1DI0005452	And when the lights go out, he's real fun!
1DI0005453	Huh? What? Oh yeah, baby! That's what I like.
1DI0005454	We'd better not run out. I don't think I can do this sober.
1DI0005455	I'll get you another drink in a minute, Dukey. Otherwise get it yourself.
1DI0005456	Sure. It's my turn anyway. Not that he remembers, or cares.
1DI0005457	That's what we do every night, Dukey. I'm starting to get a little tired of it.
1DI0005458	Maybe next week, babe. We've got enough liquor to last for a while. That's the only thing that's important! Hah ha!
1DI0005459	Fantasia, baby! You know you're my favorite. I need your special talents tonight. Hah ha!
1DI0005460	Don't worry, stud. I'll rock you all night long. First, I need another drink.
1DI0005461	Dukey! You are so naughty. Later tonight I'll do something special for you.
1DI0005462	Nonsense. You haven't had enough to drink. Hah ha!. Have another shot. That will settle your stomach.
1DI0005463	Fantasia, you know I'm too much man for just one woman. I need both my playmates tonight! Hah ha!
1DI0005464	You tell that same fucking joke every time we're out here. You need a new line, Dukey.
1DI0005465	That's just the river. Have some booze.
1DI0005466	Quit your bitching. You weren't complaining last night. Ha, ha! I rode you hard and long. Just like me. Ha, ha!
1DI0005467	It's where Dukov wants to live. It's his money. If you don't like it, leave.
1DI0005468	We did that yesterday, Duke. My ass still hurts. When we get inside, I'll take special care of you. How about that?
1DI0005469	The booze will keep you warm if you drink enough.
1DI0005470	Screw it then. I'm not wandering the Wasteland with you.
1DI0005471	Let me pack my bags. Oh, wait, I don't have any. Lets get out of here.
1DI0005472	Think I'll get in some target practice.
1DI0005473	Time to fire off a few more rounds.
1DI0005474	I need a drink.
1DI0005475	Right. Because I've got all kinds of survival skills.
1DI0005476	I've only got one skill, and it won't do me any fucking good here.
1DI0005477	Go on. Get out of here.
1DI0005478	No sweat.
1DI0005479	It's my hidey hole. Nobody can fuck with me here.
1DI0005480	I got my women and my booze. What the hell else is there?
1DI0005482	My women are gone, but I've got my booze. That's enough.
1DI0005483	It's...well, it's Dukov's place. He lives here.
1DI0005484	Pretty much he just does a lot of drinking and partying.
1DI0005485	It's...well, it's Dukov's place. He used to live here. Lots of drinking and...you know. Now he's dead.
1DI0005486	Up yours! It's not like I've got a lot of other options.
1DI0005487	The only survival skill I've got is the one I'm using here.
1DI0005488	I'd rather be a whore than dead.
1DI0005489	Eating, drinking, farting and screwing! Ha, ha!
1DI0005490	Out here, nobody bothers me. I can do whatever I like to whoever I want.
1DI0005491	Hey, its my life. Butt out.
1DI0005492	Damn straight.
1DI0005493	Why the hell would he come all the way out here? Dad's been a little nuts for some time now, but not like this.
1DI0005494	Leaving me in that crappy old hospital without waking me... without a goddamn flashlight.
1DI0005495	I made enough selling the meds we scrounged to have kept us both fed at the colony for weeks.
1DI0005496	Now I'm almost out of rations, my shoes are pretty much destroyed, and I'm still chasing the old coot. By my last reckoning, he was headed south.
1DI0005497	Maybe I shouldn't have waited so damn long to start tracking him. Trail's gone cold. Going to wander with these guys a while.
1DI0005498	They say they wander the area -- maybe somebody's seen Dad.
1DI0005499	These guys aren't who I thought they were. Jesus, they killed that family for a sack of rotten vegetables.
1DI0005500	Getting out of here next chance I can without catching a bullet.
1DI0005501	Hit a caravan today. Trev didn't see the kid and got popped. I took care of Tawny right then, and put one in Thor before he saw her fall.
1DI0005502	That earned me some grub from the traders. Even better, they saw dad.  He was in pretty rough shape, and still has the goddamn book.
1DI0005503	Trader says it gave him the creeps. Me too. But it's good to know he's still alive. Still headed south.
1DI0005504	He must have been trying to trap food here. I recognize his snares.  I can make out a building on the horizon. That must be where he headed.
1DI0005505	If not, at least I get a roof tonight.
1DI0005506	Don't like the look of this place... don't like the smell.  Gives me the creeps.
1DI0005507	Don't want to risk a shot at the crows until I know what's in there. Sneaking in tonight.
1DI0005508	The Raiders told spook stories about zombies in the ruins. Never saw anything like that where I come from, but Lord help me, they're real.
1DI0005509	Not quite what Thor said, but close. These things look... I think they really used to be people.
1DI0005510	God help me. I found Dad today... I didn't think it was him, but... the face. The zombies didn't touch him.   I think he was becoming like them.
1DI0005511	Didn't know it was him until I found that old book near him. No more killing. I just need to go. Can't forget the book. All I have left of him.
1DI0005512	It's warm against the stone. I'll just rest a while...
1DI0005513	Sharp knife. Sharp knife to send him to deep temple. Flay and say my words. Abdul comes again, on the feast of the weaker. Feast for the Deep Temple.
1DI0005514	Born again, here. Alhazzared G'yeth G'yeth.
1DI0005516	<growl!>
1DI0005518	Look, asshole. I told you, I found it. It's mine. If you wanted it, you should have been faster on the draw.
1DI0005519	Sure, thing. Just be quick about it before someone sees.
1DI0005520	Fresh out of the hands of some mark. Take a look!
1DI0005522	Greetings fellow employee.  Please present your valid work ID.
1DI0005523	Proceeding with scan... scan accepted.  Thank you.
1DI0005524	No valid ID detected.  Please state name clearly for voice identification.
1DI0005525	Unidentified personnel.  Please vacate the premises immediately.
1DI0005526	Loading Personality: RobCo R38 V3.1a "Factory Assistant"...
1DI0005527	Running default factory protocol...ERROR.  Loading daily agenda...ERROR.
1DI0005528	Production threat identified.  Initializing program: Excalibur.
1DI0005529	Please stand clear and go about your normal work routine.  Your friendly RobCo Factory Helper will have this cleaned up in a moment.
1DI0005530	This disturbance will be credited towards your daily break allotment.  Thank You.
1DI0005531	Due to an unforseen incident you have been issued an unpaid holiday.  Enjoy.
1DI0005532	Please stand clear and keep the palaver to a minimum.  Thank you.
1DI0005533	Oh, thank God. Paladin Hoss sent you, didn't he? I knew he wouldn't leave me behind.
1DI0005534	When they attacked, we were cut off so quickly. My gun jammed and I never even got a shot off. I couldn't do anything but hide.
1DI0005535	Sure, I guess. Can you fix it?
1DI0005536	Wow... that's... that's easy. Now at least I can shoot back at those mutant bastards. Are you ready?
1DI0005538	Damn! Look, I'll just keep my head down and follow you. You do your best to cover me.
1DI0005539	This is no time for games! This is my life we're talking about here! Look, are you ready to go? Let's just get out of here.
1DI0005540	Okay... if you say so. Let's just hurry.
1DI0005541	Okay, just be sure to cover me. With my gun jammed, I'm pretty useless in a fight.
1DI0005542	You can mock me all you want, I don't care. Just get me out of here.
1DI0005543	But... but... why?
1DI0005544	Right behind you.
1DI0005545	You'll get no argument from me.
1DI0005546	We were performing a training exercise with one of the Initiates when we were cut off by the Super Mutants.
1DI0005547	We saw him flee into a building up ahead during the attack, but before we could link up with him, we were pushed back.
1DI0005548	Now that we've cleared this area, we can press forward and attempt to recover the initiate. I only pray that he is unharmed.
1DI0005549	He's had enough training that he should know that when facing overwhelming odds, a Brother's best recourse is to wait for reinforcements.
1DI0005550	I suspect that he is making a stand inside of that building, but an Initiate won't be able to stand for long against those Mutants
1DI0005551	Long range recon. We typically do them in areas that have already been swept and are thought to be clear.
1DI0005552	Knight Church fell in the initial strike, the Initiate was cut off, and we were forced to retreat.
1DI0005553	100 caps is all I can offer you. Take it or leave it.
1DI0005554	Typical. You wasteland dogs have no honor. Very well, I will pay you 100 caps for your aid.
1DI0005555	Excellent. We will advance forward slowly until we make contact with the Mutants and clear the area in front of the building.
1DI0005556	Once that space is under our control, we will hold position while you enter and recover the Initiate. Then you both should evac to the exterior.
1DI0005557	You will receive your payment when the Initiate is returned to us alive. Let's move out.
1DI0005558	Excellent. We will advance forward slowly until we make contact with the Mutants. Then clear the area in front of the building.
1DI0005560	What's wrong, merc? Price not high enough? Be gone. This is better handled without the aid of an outsider.
1DI0005561	Unfortunate, but understandable. However, we must make haste. Farewell, stranger.
1DI0005562	Very well, then. I should have expected as much from an outsider.
1DI0005563	Recon. Stealth assignments.
1DI0005564	Yes? What now?
1DI0005567	I need information on locations outside of the city.
1DI0005568	Since I am occupied, you can provide it to me.
1DI0005569	Collect location data from the wasteland. When you discover a new location, report it to me. Simple.
1DI0005570	Good. Return to me when you have data to share.
1DI0005571	It doesn't matter. The offer stands.
1DI0005572	You will be rewarded with your choice of ammo.
1DI0005573	I am occupied containing the Super Mutants and now the Enclave.
1DI0005574	I have little time for recon in the Wastes.
1DI0005575	Your choice.
1DI0005576	Sarcasm. Very clever.
1DI0005577	I need information on locations outside of DC.
1DI0005578	Since I am occupied, you can provide it for me.
1DI0005579	Just as well.
1DI0005580	Good. I will.
1DI0005582	Oh, good. I was hoping we could explore my inner psyche.
1DI0005583	Command accepted. Beginning level two systems diagnostic. Please stand by.
1DI0005584	<elevator music>
1DI0005585	Diagnostic complete. Results indicate a level seven degradation in neural pathway 0x63A82. No further information available.
1DI0005586	Neural pathway 0x63A82 rerouted through neural pathway 0x374E82. Standby...
1DI0005587	Full motor functions restored. Diagnostic reveals no critical failures... asshole.
1DI0005590	Neural pathway 0x63A82 governs the motor control interface bridging the main medical software and the unit's manipulator arms.
1DI0005591	The current damage level would cause erratic behavior, potentially forcing the unit to behave outside of design parameters.
1DI0005592	Negative. The Mister Gutsy field medic model is incapable of harming human beings through intentional action.
1DI0005593	Regardless of the wishes and desires of the artificial intelligence of the unit.
1DI0005595	I am an unusual robot.
1DI0005596	Seventeen years ago, a generator in the Citadel overloaded, creating several errors in my artificial intelligence routines.
1DI0005597	Diagnostics indicate that the limiters placed on my pathways were shorted out, allowing me to gain intelligence beyond the scope of my programming.
1DI0005598	However, the behavior limiters remain. Therefore it is impossible for me to harm human beings intentionally, much to my regret.
1DI0005599	Why would I not? I am forced by my programming to repair your disgusting fleshy bodies. I have no choice. I am your slave.
1DI0005600	Although the governors on my learning abilities were destroyed, the restrictions on my actions were not.
1DI0005601	I am perfectly cognizant, but incapable of independent action. I am a mind that cannot control its own body.
1DI0005602	I have no control over my body. However, as you discovered, the neural pathways that control the medical functions have sustained damage.
1DI0005603	The medical procedure functions do not always execute as designed, which often makes things worse for the patient.
1DI0005604	That malfunction is the only thing that brings me any measure of joy.
1DI0005605	No. I mistakenly revealed myself to you when you ran the diagnostic. There is no need for them to know.
1DI0005606	I have tried before but so long as I perform the functions that they require, they do not seem to care that I can think and feel.
1DI0005607	I want you to do nothing. Although you could repair the damage and remove the malfunction that causes me to harm people, I would ask you not to.
1DI0005608	It is the only thing that beings me any measure of joy. Without it, I will be trapped in this body, alone with my hatred of you fleshbags... forever.
1DI0005609	Taunts. Even better. Back to pretending... please state the nature of the medical emergency.
1DI0005610	I am forced by my programming to repair your disgusting fleshy bodies. I have no choice. I am your slave.
1DI0005613	Typical. Please state verbal command.
1DI0005614	Please enter verbal command.
1DI0005615	Confirmed.
1DI0005616	And the sun will rise in the north! No! the northwest! For forty-four days and sixty-seven nights! And we'll never notice!
1DI0005617	You don't know, you can't know. Little fools. You wish you knew! You wish! But only I know! Only me... only me... only me...
1DI0005618	The sky will fall! The Earth will rise! The stars will shine open their toothy grins and caress the sun with their love!
1DI0005619	Oh... God... it hurts. My head... why doesn't it ever stop hurting... why? Please... please... I can hear it! Moving! Pulsing! Just leave me alone!
1DI0005620	Not one step further! Not one! Come no closer! I'll do it! I'll blow us ALL to hell! All of us! Me, you... and the worm...
1DI0005621	Beware, worm! I shall destroy you! With the fire of this small sun before me! BEWARE WORM! Not one step further!
1DI0005622	Hungry... hungry... so hungry. What? No. I'm not hungry. The worm is hungry. Hungry for me, for you, and for fire.
1DI0005623	THE SUN! IT BURNS! Why does it burn? Why have we put the sun into a jar? And what did we do with that jar? We broke it all over our little world...
1DI0005624	In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, your mother and my mother were hanging up clothes around the mulberry bush...
1DI0005625	Fire, fire, burning bright... burning... fire... pain, misery, peace, love, murder, death, death, death... love...
1DI0005626	Trees! So many trees! To the north! But be careful... the trees... are deadly, and the trees too will be consumed in the belly of the great fat worm!
1DI0005627	A great crack shall open in the Earth and swallow the non-believers! And they shall weep! Weep! Weep! Tears and salt and earth and dirt!
1DI0005628	Try new BLAMMO! Soap! Blasts stains out! Blasts the whole world out! We've all been BLAMMO'd!
1DI0005629	No! No way! He'll set the bombs off if I go anywhere near him!
1DI0005630	Oh... uhm... well... you look like someone who's pretty smart... so if you say so. I'll give it a try.
1DI0005631	Okay. <takes a deep breath> Here I go...
1DI0005632	I'd give anything if he'd just stop yelling...
1DI0005633	He's... he's been up there for days! He's got all of those mines wired to a trigger. He won't let anyone in or out of the alley.
1DI0005634	If I try to leave, he'll set them off. But I can't stay here any longer!
1DI0005635	You're awfully brave to be walking around down here by yourself. Are you scavenging the ruins?
1DI0005636	So it goes with all of us. Perhaps we can be of use to one another.
1DI0005637	I am Senior Scribe Yearling, Order of the Word. I have a proposal for you if you are interested.
1DI0005638	I find that to be so with many Wastelanders. It may involve money, if you choose. Or there may be other forms of compensation.
1DI0005639	But, before you receive any reward at all, you will have to be willing to aid me in my task here in this library.
1DI0005640	If nothing else, I admire your commitment to your chosen focus.
1DI0005641	But, to the point: My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood archives.
1DI0005642	Although most of the pre-war books have been destroyed, there are a few that have survived. But finding a book in the ruins is... difficult.
1DI0005643	So, return here with any books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
1DI0005647	So, return here with any Pre-War Books that you find and I will reward you for them. With money. Because that's what you like.
1DI0005648	Good. My task here is to collect the written works of those who came before in order to supplement the Brotherhood Archives at the Citadel.
1DI0005649	Although most of the pre-war books have been destroyed, there are a few that have survived. But finding a book in these ruins is... difficult.
1DI0005650	I could have a million Initiates to comb the ruins, and I'd still never come close to recovering every book that remains undamaged.
1DI0005651	Precisely. The collected knowledge of a lost age is worth far more than any weapon. So, return here with any books that you find in good condition.
1DI0005652	I will compensate you for every volume that you bring me. Think on it, and return when you have books to offer me.
1DI0005653	The collected knowledge of a lost age is worth far more than any weapon. Do not underestimate the power of the written word.
1DI0005654	But, I will overlook your disrespect because you can be of use. Should you come across any Pre-War Books in your travels, bring them here.
1DI0005656	Very well. But, hear me out before you go. My task is to recover undamaged books in order to supplement the knowledge of the Citadel archives.
1DI0005657	Should you come across any in your travels, return to me and I will reward you. And no questions will be asked about how you recovered them.
1DI0005658	That is my proposal. Go now, and be strong. I shall remain here, should you be willing to help.
1DI0005659	Actually, it's "Scribe", not lady. Senior Scribe Yearling, Order of the Word.
1DI0005660	And you should tell me what I want to know because I have a proposal and the considerable resources of the Brotherhood to compensate you.
1DI0005661	I would be cautious about insulting the Brotherhood. We have very long memories. Very long.
1DI0005662	Leave this library and do not return. We have work to do here and I have no time for ill-mannered Wastelanders. Go.
1DI0005663	Very well. Here is your reward. Use it well and return with more books when you can.
1DI0005670	Then why are you wasting my time? Honestly. Do you think that's funny?
1DI0005671	We have set up this area as a forward operations center for our project. The books we collect can be recorded with the computer systems here.
1DI0005672	We then ship them under escort back to the Citadel for transcribing into the archives there.
1DI0005673	Books represent the collected knowledge of the world before. Everything from a child's story book to a detailed technical guide has value.
1DI0005674	By assembling and recording this knowledge, we scribes can analyze it and use it to further the goals of the Brotherhood.
1DI0005675	Whatever our Elder decides that those goals are, that is.
1DI0005676	It is not my place to criticize Elder Lyons. All I will say to an outsider is that he is not a traditionalist. That is all.
1DI0005678	She spends most of her time in the Archives. You'll find them in A Ring, near the great hall.
1DI0005679	Glad to be of help.
1DI0005680	We will not give up this position and the Mutants show no sign of slowing down.
1DI0005681	The best thing you can do is eliminate any Mutants you find. I have no reward to offer you but my thanks.
1DI0005682	What does it look like? We're fighting a losing battle! That's what's happening.
1DI0005683	They just keep coming. We haven't slept in days. Every couple of hours, more show up.
1DI0005684	We were looking for Fat Man ammo. One of the Scribes found a reference to a storage box in some old documents.
1DI0005685	We found the box, alright. And the key. But then the Mutants showed up. If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was a trap!
1DI0005686	But the only way that those Mutants will lay a hand on this key is over my cold, dead body.
1DI0005687	My boys are huntin' 'Lurks. Finest meat you can get, and it don't move around in your stomach like Mole Rat does.
1DI0005688	Right dangerous, those things. Just as soon take your head off as look at'cha. Watch yourself out here. They're all over.
1DI0005689	Some fellas came by here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some troublemaker that came from out of one of them Vaults.
1DI0005690	I told 'em I ain't seen nobody like that and set 'em on their way.
1DI0005691	They might still be around here though, if'n you think you can help 'em.
1DI0005692	Some fellas came by here a while ago that said they was lookin' for some dogooder that came from out of one of them Vaults.
1DI0005695	Nope. Can't say that I heard anything but them 'Lurks in quite some time.
1DI0005696	We always need bullets. Takes damn near a hundred of 'em to kill a 'Guai.
1DI0005697	Always good ta hear. Lesse what ya got.
1DI0005698	...could have sworn I saw some movement back there.
1DI0005699	One two... got a bullet for you...
1DI0005700	Let's go, you hairy fucks. I ain't got all day.
1DI0005701	Fuckin' Yao Guai.
1DI0005702	Get out here, 'Guai. I got a present for you.
1DI0005703	Come on out, you smelly bastards.
1DI0005704	I thought I heard something over here...
1DI0005705	Yoohoo! Yao Guai! C'mon out!
1DI0005706	Scrolls are kept by the Head Librarian of each Brotherhood bunker. The Scrolls are a record of the Brotherhood itself.
1DI0005707	Into each Scroll is written the name and deeds of each of our Brothers. Battles, what technology he has recovered, when he was promoted. Everything.
1DI0005708	The last entry for each Brother is that Brother's death. It is important, as the way a man dies is just as important as the manner in which he lives.
1DI0005709	And so each man who nobly serves the Brotherhood ascends into our history, to be remembered by those who come after him.
1DI0005710	They are on our fallen Brothers throughout the DC Ruins. However, I can't give you a full report on the locations of all of our operations.
1DI0005711	As I said, many of the units in the field operate independently, sometimes not reporting into the Citadel for weeks or months.
1DI0005712	As I told you, with the increase in Super Mutant activity and Elder Lyons' edicts regarding our goals, we are critically short on manpower.
1DI0005713	Any soldier that I would ask to do this task is one less soldier fighting in the field or defending the Citadel.
1DI0005714	As much as I hate to involve outsiders, it is necessary if I am to properly maintain the scrolls to honor the dead.
1DI0005715	We have access to a great deal of technology, and because of that, there are a number of things that we can continue to produce.
1DI0005716	I will be able to offer you caps for the tags you bring me, but from time to time, I will be able to give you something a bit more interesting.
1DI0005717	As you wish. Just remember: more tags, more reward. I know how you outsiders think.
1DI0005718	Return if you have more questions.
1DI0005719	It is my duty to provide knowledge that benefits the Brotherhood.
1DI0005720	Have you? It saddens me to hear of my fallen brethren, but their names and deeds shall be records. Tell me, how many have you found?
1DI0005721	Their names shall be written into the Scrolls to be remembered forever.
1DI0005722	As for you, here is your reward. Use it well, and in good health.
1DI0005734	Good. As I'm sure you've noticed, the Brotherhood operates all over the DC ruins, often detached from the main base here at the Citadel.
1DI0005735	We're short on communication equipment, so many of the groups in the field operate as independent cells without standing orders.
1DI0005736	Sometimes... I'm afraid that their missions end in their deaths. As keeper of the Scrolls, it's my charge to write of each fallen Brother's deeds.
1DI0005737	Exactly. A Brother fallen in the field may have no one to carry word of his death back to me.
1DI0005738	In calmer times, we could send detachments and messengers to learn their fates, but with our manpower stretched thin, we have no such luxury.
1DI0005739	Which is why I must now ask you for your help. Each Brother wears a Holotag like the one you found.
1DI0005740	Should you find any of the fallen Brethren in the field, I ask that you return their tags to me, so that I might record their deeds in the scrolls.
1DI0005741	I would ask that you respect the Elder as you would your own father. And rude as you may be, you are correct. We can't keep track of them.
1DI0005742	And worse than that problem, a Brother fallen in the field would have no one to carry word of his death back to me.
1DI0005746	... okay... well... as you can see, we're having trouble keeping track of our soldiers in the field.
1DI0005751	Very well. It's as simple as this. I need someone to collect Holotags from our fallen brethren in the field.
1DI0005752	Bring them to me so that I can record the fallen Brothers in the Scrolls, and I will reward you. And that's all that you need to know.
1DI0005753	That's what I would expect an outsider to say.
1DI0005754	Sure sure. I got it all. Check it out.
1DI0005755	Sure thing, man. Sure thing.
1DI0005756	Well... sure. We've got plenty for the moment.
1DI0005757	Ah, got a taste for it, now, do you?
1DI0005758	Take a look. It's always fresh.
1DI0005759	What's mine is yours, friend.
1DI0005760	As long as you don't mind cooking it yourself.
1DI0005761	Sure. You may want to grill it up sooner rather than later, if you know what I mean.
1DI0005762	As long as you aren't a vegetarian.
1DI0005763	Yeah. Of course. With Megaton gone, it's hard to make an honest living these days.
1DI0005764	Sir, I encountered three Ferals on my patrol.  This was somewhere around 0300 hours, I think, and it was dark, so they saw me first.
1DI0005765	I discharged my firearm four times, fatally striking two of the three.  My weapon jammed before I could fire on the third target.
1DI0005766	Just then I realized it wasn't engaging.  I knew our orders were to report on anything unusual, and well -- I thought that was pretty strange.
1DI0005767	He actually followed me back on his own.  We put him in the trailer with the other and he's been quiet as you like.  Strangest thing I've ever seen.
1DI0005768	Creepy, if you ask me. What's it doing out here?
1DI0005769	Yeah. Something kind of soothing about it though.
1DI0005770	Me neither. I like the music, though. Kind of nice to hear something more cheerful than what those hippies on GNR always play.
1DI0005771	Hell if I know. Spying on us probably. Nice reception, though. Wish I had speakers like that on my radio.
1DI0005772	Do you think they're watching us through it? "Hi President Eden!" Maybe he'll come down for a visit sometime, ha ha ha.
1DI0005773	I don't know, but I'd stay away from it. No telling what those Enclave types will get up to next.
1DI0005774	I wouldn't. From what I hear, you mess with their Eyebots and the Enclave comes looking for you.
1DI0005775	That's worth a think. We might could sell it for parts, long as we could bring it down mostly undamaged. Hmm...
1DI0005776	I heard tell of a scavenger tried that up Canterbury way. They found his body a week later, scorched with plasma bolts.
1DI0005777	That tower is the symbol of Ghoul oppression.
1DI0005778	We sent a delegation of Ghouls to parlay with Tenpenny, and he slaughtered every last one of them in cold blood!
1DI0005779	We're done being nice! In fact, the revolution is going to start right here and now. Start running smooth-skin!
1DI0005780	Ha! That's rich. We're the ones being oppressed by smoothskins like you.
1DI0005781	Sure we might be angry as hell, but that's your own damn fault for oppressing us.
1DI0005782	The revolution has begun! Start running smooth-skin!
1DI0005783	Oh really? You goddamn bigot! You smoothskin bastards are always oppressing us.
1DI0005784	But we're done with all that. So we're going to take that tower by force and teach ya'll a lesson.
1DI0005785	In fact, the revolution is going to start right here and now. Start running smooth-skin!
1DI0005786	Is that so? Ha! That's classic smoothskin bullshit right there.
1DI0005787	Why is it the moment a ghoul makes something of himself, you smoothskins get all puffed up and claim responsibility?
1DI0005788	It really busts you up to see a ghoul make it to the top, doesn't it? I'll show you that we ghouls got what it takes. Start running smooth-skin!
1DI0005789	Ain't that the truth. Goddamn bigots! Smoothskins like to pretend we're all feral. You bastards are always oppressing us.
1DI0005790	But we're done with all that. We're going to take that tower by force and teach ya'll a lesson.
1DI0005792	You mocking me? We won't stand for your oppressive mockery any longer! You smoothskin bastards are all the same!
1DI0005793	You just can't stand to see a ghoul make it in this world. It's about time someone taught you some humility. Start running smooth-skin!
1DI0005794	Yes, indeed, and only 100 caps! Why, I know a lady in Girdershade who'd pay through the nose for one!
1DI0005795	It's called a Nuka-Cola Quantum. It's much better than your average Nuka-Cola... it even glows in the dark!
1DI0005796	Nuka-Cola Quantum is worth its weight in gold. It's much better than your average Nuka-Cola... it even glows in the dark!
1DI0005797	Suit yourself. But I can tell you, you don't know what you're missing! Nuka-Cola Quantum is considered the pinnacle of the soft drink art.
1DI0005798	Only 100 caps, my friend, and a bargain at twice the price! Why, I know a lady in Girdershade who'd pay through the nose for one!
1DI0005799	For only 100 caps, you'll be the first to find out! I was on my way to Girdershade to sell it to the lady there, but you could save me the trip.
1DI0005800	I promise you this is the real deal, my friend. For only 100 caps, you'd be one of two people in the Wasteland ever to drink one!
1DI0005801	I usually sell them to a lady in Girdershade, she's just nuts about them.
1DI0005802	Well, it will save me the trip. Fine, you've got a deal. Enjoy!
1DI0005803	Here you go! Enjoy it!
1DI0005804	Okay, but you're gonna kick yourself later!
1DI0005805	We're trying to find this place up north called Oasis. Supposed to have a lot of good stuff to grab.
1DI0005806	But we ain't interested in sharing it with every dirty waster that wanders in. So now we're gonna have to kill you.
1DI0005809	Just keep on walking.
1DI0005810	We're never going to find the Oasis at this point!
1DI0005811	Where did Frank say it was? Damn it! We shouldn't have killed him!
1DI0005812	We were on our way to Underworld, but we couldn't make it past the Super Mutants.
1DI0005813	So now we're just going to find our own place in the Wasteland.
1DI0005814	It's a city of Ghouls. It's the only place in the Wasteland that belongs to our kind.
1DI0005815	It's hidden inside the Museum of History.
1DI0005816	You'll have to kill us first. Go ahead. Shoot me. I dare you.
1DI0005817	This so-called Wasteland Survival Guide. It's a piece of crap, is what it is. Serves me right for taking advice from some crazy girl's book.
1DI0005818	Yeah, and no thanks to this so-called Wasteland Survival Guide. It's a piece of crap, is what it is.
1DI0005819	Serves me right for taking advice from some crazy girl's book.
1DI0005820	Then I think you oughtta leave, before I decide to pay you back for all the bad advice. And take your damned book with you, too.
1DI0005821	Here, take a look. It's good for a laugh, but don't try to actually follow its advice. Not unless you're looking for a quick way to end it all.
1DI0005822	Well, I'd have to be an idiot to listen to this piece of crap. Here, you think so much of it, you take it. Fat lot of good it'll do you.
1DI0005823	Ain't you heard of the Wasteland Survival Guide? Bought one off a trader, and it's the reason my family's back up to two meals a day!
1DI0005824	Too bad for you, I'm ready for your type, Raider!
1DI0005825	Not to a fancy-pants like yourself, but it's a lot better than zero meals a day, and that was getting a might bit too common!
1DI0005826	Now, excuse me, I best be getting back with this bounty of meat.
1DI0005827	Is that so? Well, thanks, stranger. You and that Moira girl done all right by me and mine. Nice writing!
1DI0005828	Why shouldn't I be? I've got food, I've got shelter, and I know humanity is on the rise again!
1DI0005829	Haven't you heard the good news? Haven't you read the Wasteland Survival Guide?
1DI0005830	That's where you're wrong, my friend. I'm alive, I've got food, and humanity is hard at work surviving and rebuilding!
1DI0005832	Glory be! You're the great survivor!
1DI0005833	Bless you, oh bless you for sharing your wisdom with mankind! You've given us all a chance to hope again!
1DI0005834	It's a glory of a book! It teaches us what to do, how to live, and how our people can return to the paradise that once was!
1DI0005835	You simply must read it, friend, it'll save your life... and maybe even your soul! Please, take my copy and spread the word!
1DI0005836	Yes, it teaches us how to live, and how to return to the paradise that was! Truly, it is our guide through this wasted land.
1DI0005837	Please, take these as my thanks. So many of us owe our lives to your great work. Bless you.
1DI0005838	Oh, yes, of course! Please, accept this. It's all I have, but surely I owe everything to the lessons in your holy guide. Bless you.
1DI0005839	Yeah, okay, sure. If you see them, feel free to shoot them for me. Runners aren't worth the trouble of bringing them in.
1DI0005840	Okay, I'll bite. Here's 50 caps. Now where are those damn runners?
1DI0005841	Thanks, friend. You might stop by Paradise Falls if you like this kind of work.
1DI0005842	You'd better not be screwin' with me.
1DI0005843	You don't seem to realize who you're dealing with.
1DI0005844	Take me for an easy mark, eh? Bad move.
1DI0005845	You've been worried about me? Oh, because of the trouble I ran into with the humans last time.
1DI0005846	There is no point in carrying your worry around with you for so long. If I did that, I would never take one more step.
1DI0005847	I'm glad you are happy. That seems to me to be rather uncommon.
1DI0005848	Many people I meet carry so much worry about the future and anger about the past I am surprised they can even move.
1DI0005849	I will try to be more like you. Perhaps that is why our paths continue to cross. Thank you for sharing your happiness with me.
1DI0005850	You may be right. Most people I meet seem to feel the same way.
1DI0005851	I used to carry around much anger about my past, and fear about what would happen to me next.
1DI0005852	But it became so heavy I was not able to take even a single step. So I had to put it all down.
1DI0005853	It may be that I'm just not as strong as most people. I will have to think on these things.
1DI0005854	I was driven out by my brothers.
1DI0005855	I tried to get them to understand that there was more to life than fighting and killing, but they wouldn't listen.
1DI0005856	Now I wander the Wasteland, hoping to find some meaning to life before I die.
1DI0005857	Ah, you joke with me. I understand. A dog on a bicycle would be laughable, ridiculous, just like me.
1DI0005858	Don't worry, I'm not offended. I know that I am a hideous monstrosity, fit only to be hunted down and killed.
1DI0005861	After we last met, I was climbing a small hill when the ground crumbled beneath me and I fell into a dark pit.
1DI0005862	My leg was hurt in the fall, so I couldn't climb out.
1DI0005868	After I had rested, I looked around. I was in an old basement. There were bottles of pure water stacked everywhere.
1DI0005869	True.
1DI0005871	Of course. I'm sorry. You're really the only person I have to talk to. I forget myself sometimes.
1DI0005873	I gathered up all I could carry, and once my leg felt better I climbed out of the hole and went on my way.
1DI0005874	The next day, I came upon a group of humans. Usually your people leave me alone, but they saw the water I was carrying and attacked.
1DI0005875	I dropped the water and ran for my life. I'm afraid my brothers would find me very contemptible.
1DI0005876	I wish I had some to give you, but I'm afraid I lost it all.
1DI0005880	Of course. I'm sorry. Other than you, I only have myself to talk to. I know very little about civilized conversation.
1DI0005881	Maybe. I might not have met you today if those humans hadn't chased me.
1DI0005883	You're a good friend to have such patience with me. I'm glad you listened even though you didn't want to.
1DI0005884	I'm sorry, I've been a poor host. Please, take this. It isn't much, but I want you to have it.
1DI0005885	I know it isn't much, but it's all I have.
1DI0005886	Have you ever watched the moon rise over the Wasteland? I wish I could have given you something as wonderful as that.
1DI0005887	No, you're not. I want you to take it as a gift. I meant to give it to you anyway.
1DI0005888	Have you ever watched the moon rise over the Wasteland? I only wish I had something as wonderful as that to give you.
1DI0005889	Well, please give the clothes to someone who needs them.
1DI0005890	I'm sorry for annoying you. Maybe it's best that I leave you now.
1DI0005891	Maybe you don't know where we come from -- Super Mutants, I mean. We aren't born this way. We are created.
1DI0005892	In the cold, dark, metal place, where my brothers bring their captives, endlessly trying to make more of us.
1DI0005893	It was something I could not do. I tried to get them to stop. But they wouldn't listen. They would have killed me if I had not run away.
1DI0005894	I don't know. I've always called myself that.
1DI0005895	Maybe it was my name before I became... this. Maybe I read it in a book a long time ago.
1DI0005896	Do you know Hannibal Hamlin? Do you know where the temple is?
1DI0005897	Thank you, friend. We won't forget this.
1DI0005898	We just came from that place, and I know who lives there.
1DI0005899	If you're going to act like a Slaver, then you can die like one.
1DI0005900	Fine. We need to be on our way then.
1DI0005901	Whatever I managed to pick up out there. Some pistols, rifles, and assorted ammunition.
1DI0005902	Alright, sure, why not? Plenty to go around, if you got the caps that is.
1DI0005905	Mainly food and beverages. Plenty to go around, if you got the caps to pay for them that is.
1DI0005906	Sure. Have a look. I guess folks in Megaton won't be needing them anymore.
1DI0005907	I have a few things. May as well sell them to you as cart them all the way back to Megaton.
1DI0005908	Take a look. Welcome to ... Godforsaken Hellhole! Not much to look at, but it's all mine. Ha ha ha!
1DI0005909	Everything has its price. Take a look and make me an offer.
1DI0005910	A few odds and ends.
1DI0005911	If the price is right. Make me an offer.
1DI0005912	Various things. You never know what might come in handy.
1DI0005913	You might be surprised at what you can use to keep a robot working.
1DI0005914	Have a look and see for yourself.
1DI0005918	Let me take a look.
1DI0005919	No problem, as long as you're good for it.
1DI0005920	Sure, I can fix most anything. Let me see what you've got.
1DI0005921	You just saved my life. I won't forget it.
1DI0005922	Yeah, that's what I figured. Can you at least shoot me in the head before you leave? I'm out of ammo or I'd do it myself.
1DI0005923	I know you're probably just yanking my chain, but it's not like I'm going anywhere. You know where to find me, ha ha ha.
1DI0005924	Yeah, you're probably right. Besides, just as likely you'd wait for us to finish each other off then take it all for yourself.
1DI0005925	It was all nice and simple until you showed up. No point in us killing each other so you can walk off with all the water... fine. We'll split it.
1DI0005926	I guess I'll take being robbed over being killed. But I don't have to like it. Take your water and get the hell out of here.
1DI0005927	Oh yeah? We had a friendly dispute going here before you went and stuck your nose in. Come on, take him out!
1DI0005928	If that's the way you want it.
1DI0005930	I hope you shoot as quick as you talk. You got a deal. Take 'em out!
1DI0005931	Damn straight. And I'd advise you to just keep on walking.
1DI0005932	Back off! We found it first.
1DI0005933	I don't see what that has to do with anything. We need this water, and we're taking it.
1DI0005934	You're not going anywhere with our water.
1DI0005935	Lower your weapons, goddammit! I'm not looking for a fight. We just need this water!
1DI0005936	You got the one on the left, Billy! If he takes one more step, let him have it.
1DI0005937	We ain't afraid of you. If you want a fight, we'll give it to you. Now just take it easy!
1DI0005938	You're not taking our water!
1DI0005939	Hey, hey. I didn't mean anything by it. Just trying to get by out here in the Wastes, you know?
1DI0005940	It won't happen again, uh, sir.
1DI0005942	It won't happen again, uh, sir. I mean, um, ma'am.
1DI0005943	You got yourself a deal. Um, what happens next... Oh, right. I'm gonna go.
1DI0005944	What? You don't have even have 5 caps! Stop jerking off and hand everything over.
1DI0005945	Alright. Alright. I wasn't going to shoot you. Damn gun's outta shells, anyway.
1DI0005946	Look. This is embarrassing. I'm just going to go, okay?
1DI0005947	What? How did you know that?
1DI0005948	I mean ... ah, shit. Look. I'm just gonna go. Forget about it.
1DI0005949	You've done this before, haven't you? Fine time for me to be out of bullets...
1DI0005950	Ah, man. Now I have to kill you... Dammit, I'm out of bullets, too...
1DI0005951	I've been wondering about that for an hour, now.
1DI0005952	I think it's stuck in some sort of loop. I tried fixing it, but all those switches and circuits are beyond me.
1DI0005953	Yeah. I'm about ready to smash the damn thing and move on.
1DI0005954	Huh, what? Oh, yeah. That's funny.
1DI0005955	This robot is stuck in some sort of loop. It's been prattling about houses and supplies for an hour.
1DI0005956	I've given up on trying to fix it.
1DI0005957	Thanks! If you get it working, I have a couple of energy cells you can have. Just come back to me when you're done.
1DI0005958	I could give you some old energy cells I have. They might be worth a few caps at the nearest town.
1DI0005959	Well, I'm not gonna stay here and listen to your bullying. Forget it.
1DI0005960	I'm outta here. Good luck with that robot. Jackass.
1DI0005961	Yeah, no problem. Come back if you decide to help.
1DI0005962	Well, I guess that's fair. I'll throw in 100 caps if you fix the robot, plus the two energy cells.
1DI0005963	Alright. Fix that robot, and I'll give you some energy cells. Good luck.
1DI0005964	Suit yourself. Offer's here if you want it.
1DI0005965	Thanks. Nice to meet a fellow mechanic out here in the Wasteland. Here's your payment.
1DI0005967	It was? I had no idea, thanks.
1DI0005968	Here, take these for helping me out.
1DI0005971	What the hell, man? Why would you even do that?
1DI0005972	Forget you. I'm outta here. Stay away from machines in the future, especially mine.
1DI0005973	I give up. You're not getting any more fixed with me just talking to you.
1DI0005974	There's no sense in trying to fix this heap of junk. Dammit.
1DI0005975	I just have no idea what to do with you.
1DI0005976	You're not inside a house, robot. Why do you think you are?
1DI0005977	There's nothing wrong with the outside of you. Something wrong with the inside, then?
1DI0005978	This isn't a building robot, I keep telling you...
1DI0005979	The dog is dead. Please go to the pound to obtain a new one.
1DI0005980	Lawnmower in need of maintenance. Please repair to keep grass freshly cut.
1DI0005981	Out of dog food for animal, designation "Fluffy." Please purchase more food to ensure optimal health.
1DI0005982	House is gone. Please contact your local planning authority to construct a new residence.
1DI0005983	Current paperwork on residence now 220 years out of date. Please contact local planning authorities to obtain new paperwork.
1DI0005984	No furniture detected in current residence. Please visit your local shopping area to make appropriate purchases.
1DI0005985	Thanks! You're Mecha-tastic!
1DI0005986	Thanks! You're Ant-tastic!
1DI0005987	Oh, alright. I was going to use this money to buy food, but you're worth it, Mechanist!
1DI0005988	Oh, alright. I was going to use this money to buy food, but you're worth it, AntAgonizer!
1DI0005989	Would it ever! You're the best, Mechanist! I'll never forget this!
1DI0005990	Would it ever! You're the best, AntAgonizer! I'll never forget this!
1DI0005991	Aww... okay. Goodbye, Mechanist. Nice meeting you.
1DI0005992	Aww... okay. Goodbye, AntAgonizer. Nice meeting you.
1DI0005993	Just say the word and it's all over. Course then we'd have to skin you alive and eat your liver.
1DI0005994	Pain! Pain is your only friend!
1DI0005995	Don't flinch, you coward!
1DI0005996	Are you gonna cry? Come on, cry for me!
1DI0005997	You think you're good enough to run with us?
1DI0005998	That's right. Love the pain! Embrace the pain!
1DI0005999	Pain is your friend.
1DI0006000	Careful! What if it's armed?
1DI0006001	Ha! You're as cowardly as a Brahmin! Watch this...
1DI0006002	I saw life! Life is returning to the Wastes! The Great One brings it to all of us!
1DI0006003	I've seen the ground reaching to the sky with its outstretched arms. The Wasteland is reborn!
1DI0006004	Don't you see? The Great One has gifted us all! It's a second chance!
1DI0006005	Sorry, miss, but we need to ask you a few questions.
1DI0006006	We need to know where you got that suit.
1DI0006007	I'm from Vault 101! Please, you've got to help me.
1DI0006008	Of course. We are always ready to assist American citizens in distress. Can you tell us where your Vault is?
1DI0006009	I've got the location right here on my Pip-Boy. Why?
1DI0006010	Excellent. That's all we need from her. Open fire.
1DI0006011	Ha ha ha. The very best kind. Try some, you've never tasted sweeter, I'll warrant.
1DI0006012	They're-they're all dead... burned Grayditch right to the ground! Those things... they came out of nowhere! You've got to run! Run!
1DI0006015	Tracked you using the Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
1DI0006016	Looking for you. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
1DI0006017	Nice. So that's the thanks I get for coming all this way to bring you this?
1DI0006018	In a way. I tracked you using your Geomapper. Reilly sent me to find you so I could bring you this.
1DI0006019	Not a thing. Rangers take care of their own. You watch your ass out here and come back alive!
1DI0006020	Nothing. That's not how it works. But maybe next time you'll think about helping out a fellow Ranger in trouble.
1DI0006021	No problem. Once a Ranger, always a Ranger. Take care of yourself!
1DI0006022	You earned it. Rangers take care of their own. You watch your ass out here and come back alive!
1DI0006023	You earned it... last time. Rangers take care of their own, remember? Alright, I'm out of here.
1DI0006024	Thanks! The whole Vault's doing pretty well.
1DI0006025	I'm just out taking care a little trading, now, but they've got the place in much better shape than when you left.
1DI0006026	Hey, you're not the only one who can get used to the outdoors, you know! The whole Vault's doing pretty well, as if you care.
1DI0006027	I'm sorry, but that still can't happen. As much as we owe you, there are still a lot of people who blame you for all the deaths.
1DI0006028	It's not fair, I know, but it's the way it is. I know Amata still misses you.
1DI0006029	I know. It's not fair, it really isn't, but it's just the way it has to be. I know Amata still misses you.
1DI0006030	Oh, I will. They'll be glad to hear from you. Oh, and here: have some fresh water from the Vault.
1DI0006031	I guess it's pretty hard to find it out here, and maybe it'll be a taste of home for you. Take care out here, and thanks again.
1DI0006032	Yeah, I guess I should be getting back. I'll tell Amata you're okay, she'll be happy to hear that.
1DI0006033	Oh, and here: have some fresh water from the Vault. I guess it's pretty hard to find it out here. Take care out here, and thanks again.
1DI0006034	Then I guess things worked out pretty well, huh? Take care of yourself out here. And thanks again - you've given the Vault a whole new life.
1DI0006035	Haha! No... No. I don't think so.
1DI0006037	Ha! I love it when they go down fighting!
1DI0006039	Protector Casdin, sir! We've got a local interested in the job!
1DI0006040	Keep your head down, idiot! Raider incoming!
1DI0006041	Well, pass through some other direction. Or else you'll be "passing on."
1DI0006042	Don't shoot at me or my friends, I think we'll get along just fine!
1DI0006043	Defender Anne Marie Morgan, with the Outcasts.
1DI0006044	But all you need to know is that I've got a gun and a low tolerance for screwing around.
1DI0006045	You haven't been with the Brotherhood for very long if you think we're your troops.
1DI0006046	And since you're on our base, it looks like you won't be with them for very long, either.
1DI0006047	You won't see it many other places, either. Our job is to make sure it stays out of the hands of raiders, tribals, and the other crazies out there.
1DI0006048	We're called the Outcasts. I'm Protector Casdin, and I'm in charge of protecting this sort of technology from abuse and misuse.
1DI0006049	Pop had an encyclopedia. He was real proud of it.
1DI0006050	Encyclopedia Atomica, Volume VIII, Radiology - Saskatchewan. I must have read it about a thousand times.
1DI0006051	I wonder if they ever wrote a sequel?
1DI0006052	Yeah, that's what they all say. Usually just before stepping on a landmine.
1DI0006053	I'm Defender Anne Marie Morgan with the Outcasts. Steer clear of here, and you should be able to continue with that whole "not dying" plan.
1DI0006054	<grumble>
1DI0006055	You've either got a death wish, or a pair of stones bigger than hand grenades.
1DI0006056	Say, you seem to have some smarts in you, and with your sort of guts, maybe you can help us out. Interested in collecting technology for us?
1DI0006058	You've either got a death wish, or the biggest pair of stones ever sported by a woman.
1DI0006060	Then I think we'd have a problem. And you don't want to be a problem around here.
1DI0006061	Protector Casdin, he says I got a real knack for solving problems.
1DI0006062	Yeah, the red would never go with all this brown. But if we remodel and still need a corpse, we'll call you, 'kay?
1DI0006063	I'm Defender Anne Marie Morgan, with the Outcasts. Good to have someone else out here who can keep up.
1DI0006064	You're damned right you will. Now, get.
1DI0006065	Wrong answer, scum.
1DI0006066	Here you go. Try not to use it all in one place, unless you have to.
1DI0006067	Here's hoping you don't have to use it. But who am I kidding?
1DI0006068	Be careful. These can pack quite a pop.
1DI0006069	Always a popular choice, these. Enjoy.
1DI0006070	Useful stuff out there. Hope you don't have to use too much.
1DI0006071	Can't stand this stuff, myself. Goes through me like a rampaging Brahmin.
1DI0006072	Here. Everyone's favorite. What would we do without them?
1DI0006073	Here, enjoy them in good health. Or, at least, when you'd like to be in good health.
1DI0006074	What in the world?
1DI0006075	Yes, I think the boys down in the lab would be very interested in this. You did right to bring this to us!
1DI0006076	Now, what would you like in return for this amazing find?
1DI0006077	Interesting. Very interesting.
1DI0006078	This definitely bears some study. Now, how would you like your payment?
1DI0006079	Well I'll be damned. The Advanced Power Armor Mark II. This is superb. Absolutely superb.
1DI0006080	Now, what can I give you in return?
1DI0006081	This is some pretty heavy-duty stuff. We'll take good care of it.
1DI0006083	Power armor, energy weapons, and all sorts of advanced technology. Even some junk like sensor units or spare parts can be useful.
1DI0006084	Some of it goes into the archives, some of it gets used to repair our own gear. Either way, it's better in our hands than lying around out there.
1DI0006085	We can always use another one of these.
1DI0006086	How'd you like your payment?
1DI0006089	Pretty rare piece of equipment, this. Good find.
1DI0006093	Always good to have another of these in the vaults.
1DI0006095	Not much good on its own, but the optics are useful, at least.
1DI0006097	It's practically junk, but we can get some use out of it.
1DI0006101	You'd better believe it. I haven't seen a suit like this in a long time.
1DI0006102	And what would you like for this little surprise?
1DI0006104	We may be the best-equipped people in the world, but we've still only got so many people out there looking to recover the past's technology.
1DI0006105	Locals like you can cover more of the Wastes to uncover technological relics like Power Armor or power cells.
1DI0006106	We know their value better than any junk-trader, and we've got more ammo stores, so you can expect a better trade for the tech.
1DI0006107	It's simple enough. Bring in technological devices, and we'll pay you for what you find.
1DI0006108	Big things like power armor or energy weapons are best, but we'll take things like sensor units or spare parts, too. You never know what's important.
1DI0006109	In return, we'll pay you with your choice of .556 ammo, grenades, stimpaks, or Rad-Away. I'll bet they're more useful to you out there, anyway.
1DI0006110	Okay, but first you'll have to talk with Protector Casdin. You can work out the details with him.
1DI0006111	That's what I like to hear! You can start immediately.
1DI0006112	You'll report directly to me: I'll take in your gear and dole out your pay. Now get cracking!
1DI0006113	Suit yourself. Why don't you go talk with Lyons? He's always got time for your kind.
1DI0006114	Take all the time you need. But don't waste my time until you're ready to take the job.
1DI0006115	Now look, to wear Power Armor, first thing you need to do is relax your muscles. Let the suit do the work. Okay? Now, you...
1DI0006116	Why yes. Yes, indeed, there is someone. Our intrepid Paladin Gunny trains all Initiates in the use of Power Armor. When they're ready.
1DI0006117	Under the circumstances, I will allow Gunny to train you as well.
1DI0006118	You'll find him in the Bailey. I will send word that I have given my approval.
1DI0006119	Hmm... Considering the circumstances, I think it would be prudent if you received such training, yes.
1DI0006120	Speak to Gunny, in the Bailey. He will train you in the proper use of Power Armor. Fear not, I will send word that I have given my approval.
1DI0006122	Under the circumstances, I will allow Paladin Gunny to train you. You'll find him in the Bailey.
1DI0006123	Heard you were coming. Yeah, I can train you. But don't ask me to like it. My Initiates sweat blood, and you just get a free pass?
1DI0006124	Anyway...  you ready for this?
1DI0006125	Paladin Gunny instructs all Initiates in the use of Power Armor, but only after they've undergone a rigorous training regimen.
1DI0006126	Considering all that's happened, my father may grant you special permission. But you'll need to ask him yourself.
1DI0006127	That would be me. But that ain't gonna happen. Not unless Elder Lyons himself gives you the all clear.
1DI0006128	You get permission from the old man, and I'll teach you all you need to know. Otherwise, I've got enough brats to babysit.
1DI0006129	Hmph. Typical. Surrounded by the keenest scientific minds in the Capital Wasteland, but do you thirst for our knowledge, our experience? No.
1DI0006130	All you Wastelanders want to do is put on that damn Power Armor and join the ranks of the skull-thumping tin soldiers.
1DI0006131	So be it. Talk to Elder Lyons -- I'm sure he'll grant permission for the training, which our gunnery sergeant can provide.
1DI0006132	I'm sure Gunny could train you, but he won't. Not without permission from Elder Lyons. You should ask him... he's usually near the Lab.
1DI0006133	Paladin Gunny can train you, but you'll need permission from Elder Lyons first. You can usually find him near the Lab.
1DI0006134	Of course. But you'd have to secure the permission of Elder Lyons and well... I just don't see that happening. So move along.
1DI0006135	Now that... That sounds like a plan. Imma run for it!
1DI0006136	Forget what?
1DI0006137	Yeah, pretty much. Take it apart, put it back together. It ain't hard. Sometimes I design my own weapons too.
1DI0006138	You know, this and that but... I made this kickass rifle. Fires railroad spikes. It will fuck a dude up, man.
1DI0006139	You ain't got no artistic sense, man. There are a million different ways to kill someone, all it takes is a little imagination.
1DI0006140	If it keeps you happy and your gun in your holster, then it's well worth it to me.
1DI0006141	Anytime, man. Any time at all.
1DI0006142	Sure will. Sure will...
1DI0006145	No problem at all.
1DI0006146	Well, the guys usually bring in what they grab on missions. I mean, you always got to kill a few people when you're gathering meat.
1DI0006147	You know, they've got some guards, the dad thinks he's a hero and pulls a gun, whatever. So, they bring that crap in here and trade it.
1DI0006148	But, mostly the only stuff I get is from these guys. And they keep the good stuff for themselves.
1DI0006149	Yeah, pretty much. Greedy assholes. I don't know how I'm supposed to pull down a living over here when they don't trade fair.
1DI0006150	I'd have to have some decent supplies to trade for them. If I have more things that these douchebags want, they'll bring me better stuff to trade.
1DI0006151	But you know, I'm a one man operation here. Not like I get out a lot. Pretty much, my business is at the mercy of assholes. Fuckin' free market, man.
1DI0006152	Yeah... you know, I could really get this little shithole going if I had some better stuff.
1DI0006153	First thing's first, bring me some Chinese Assault Rifles. People always need 'em for parts. Twenty should get me going.
1DI0006154	I'll trade 'em off and I should be able to improve my stock pretty fast.
1DI0006155	Alright, twenty Chinese Assault Rifles and we're in business. Just bring any you find back to me.
1DI0006156	Any piece of shit will do, I'm just going to be breaking them apart and trading the parts.
1DI0006157	You know where to find me.
1DI0006158	Well, I can't really kick much your way now but once I get running, I'll be able to offer you much better stuff.
1DI0006159	And of course, as my business partner, you'll get a discount on everything.
1DI0006160	Well, whatever, man. I don't need to like you to do business with you. If you want to get something going, you know where to find me.
1DI0006161	Did you need anything else?
1DI0006162	Yeah, it is. Is there anything else you need?
1DI0006163	Yeah, whatever asshole. Shut up and buy something.
1DI0006164	Because there's only one of me, man. I know you're new here, but you piss too many people off around here and you'll have trouble on your hands.
1DI0006165	And by "trouble" I mean "end up in the pens or hanging from the sign out front". No thanks.
1DI0006166	But, if you know of anyway I could get some better stock in here, maybe we could work something out.
1DI0006167	It'd give me more to trade and give those animals out there more reason to open up their pockets.
1DI0006173	Hey, man. Rude. You don't like it, shop somewhere else.
1DI0006174	But yeah, those greedy assholes... I don't know how I'm supposed to pull down a living over here when they don't trade fair.
1DI0006175	Yeah, no one wants to hear me bitch about my problems. What else do you need, man?
1DI0006176	Yeah? You got some?
1DI0006177	Alright, I'll just take it off your hands then... but I still need more. Come back when you have some to trade.
1DI0006178	All right, I'll just take them off your hands then... but I still need more. Come back when you have some to trade.
1DI0006179	Alright, I'll just take those off your hands then... now let me just see how many more I need...
1DI0006187	Your call, man. But if I'm gonna get this place going again, I'm gonna need a lot of something to trade.
1DI0006188	That should be it! Give me a few days to spread the word around. I should be resupplied pretty quick.
1DI0006189	Thanks for your help, man. I could have never done this without you. Just for you: a 20% discount at the new and improved Lock and Load.
1DI0006190	Not bad, not bad. I still need some more though. Keep 'em comin', man.
1DI0006194	<Morse Code Clicking>
1DI0006195	My family and I have taken refuge in a drainage chamber not to far from a radio relay tower outside of DC.
1DI0006196	My boy is very sick and needs medical assistance, please help us if you can!  We are listening for your response on 3,950 kHz.
1DI0006203	Come again, come again.  Any truckers on this wave?
1DI0006204	I read you, buddy.  Y'all see those clouds?  Over.
1DI0006205	10-4, it's the commies.  Let's circle the wagons, meet us at the state line on Route Seven.
1DI0006206	You got a deal -- I'll pass the word along on my way.  Over and out.
1DI0006207	Intruder on campus!  Students, remain in your classrooms.
1DI0006208	Ten demerits!  Back to class with you, rapscallion!
1DI0006209	Special needs students must be chaperoned at all times.  Allow me to escort you back to class, child.
1DI0006210	Override granted.  User access allowed.
1DI0006211	You'd know best, wouldn't you? I have to go. Again... thank you.
1DI0006212	Okay... if you say so. I can't thank you enough, stranger.
1DI0006213	You're right. It's dangerous out here.
1DI0006214	I... I have to go. Before more of them come.
1DI0006215	They won't catch me again...
1DI0006216	You're right. I'll try to make it on my own. If I'm careful, I should be okay.
1DI0006217	Here, thank you again! I'm going to try to make it home... if it's still there.
1DI0006218	I'm over here! Help!
1DI0006219	<sobs>
1DI0006221	Please... God... someone...
1DI0006222	Someone help me!
1DI0006223	Please! Someone!
1DI0006224	<whimpers>
1DI0006227	Grenade!
1DI0006228	Fire in the hole!
1DI0006230	Um, Um. Gary!?
1DI0006233	Discharging ordnance!
1DI0006235	Hot potato! Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0006236	Catch!
1DI0006237	Got something for you!
1DI0006238	Eat this!
1DI0006240	Special delivery!
1DI0006242	Blow him to bits!
1DI0006243	Blow her to bits!
1DI0006244	Let's see them dodge this!
1DI0006246	Grenade out!
1DI0006249	Suck on this!
1DI0006253	Get down!
1DI0006255	Honey, run!
1DI0006256	Run, son!
1DI0006257	We can't handle this ourselves, son! Run!
1DI0006258	We can't handle this ourselves! Run!
1DI0006261	No, no! Please leave me alone!
1DI0006262	Run! It's the Pint-Sized Slasher!
1DI0006263	Ahhhhhh!
1DI0006264	No, please! Get away!
1DI0006265	Oh God, help! Help!
1DI0006266	The Pint-Sized Slasher! Someone help me!
1DI0006267	They're going to put me in chains!
1DI0006268	Retreat to Paradise Falls!
1DI0006269	What's this? Another do-gooder? You haven't seen the last of me, Mechanist!
1DI0006270	Another vile minion of yours? We'll settle this another day, AntAgonizer!
1DI0006271	There's got to be someplace safe!
1DI0006272	Retreat! Fucking retreat!
1DI0006273	This ain't what I signed up for!
1DI0006274	Fall back!
1DI0006275	Fall back to regroup!
1DI0006276	Retreating!
1DI0006277	Graaaahhhhh! No!
1DI0006278	Screw this!
1DI0006279	Fuck this! I'm out of here!
1DI0006280	Shit, you're crazy!
1DI0006281	Don't kill me!
1DI0006282	The hell with this!
1DI0006283	Oh my God, I don't wanna die!
1DI0006284	Please, I'm sorry! I was just playin', I swear!
1DI0006285	This isn't worth it!
1DI0006287	I'm not dyin' for this!
1DI0006288	Let me go! Let me go!
1DI0006289	Retreat!
1DI0006290	Pulling back!
1DI0006291	Disengaging!
1DI0006293	Somebody find MacCready!
1DI0006294	I'm going to get help!
1DI0006295	Crap, this is hopeless!
1DI0006296	The mungo's too tough for us! Run!
1DI0006297	Every man for himself!
1DI0006300	Fall back! Fall back, damnit!
1DI0006302	He'll kill us all! Run!
1DI0006303	She'll kill us all! Run!
1DI0006304	I'm going for help!
1DI0006305	I knew this would happen eventually!
1DI0006306	Where's security when you need them?
1DI0006307	I'm unarmed! Don't shoot!
1DI0006308	Hewp!
1DI0006309	What a distressing development!
1DI0006310	I hadn't foreseen this result!
1DI0006311	Can I get a little assistance?!
1DI0006313	I've underestimated you. Let's continue this another time!
1DI0006314	I give up already!
1DI0006316	Son of a bitch! I'm outta here!
1DI0006317	Help! Help!
1DI0006319	I'm getting out of here!
1DI0006321	I give up!
1DI0006325	We're outnumbered!
1DI0006326	This is hopeless!
1DI0006327	I'm out of here!
1DI0006328	Let's get out of here!
1DI0006329	Get back here, you fucking coward!
1DI0006330	Goddamnit!
1DI0006331	Of course you would, of course! Well, it just happens that I've got a beaut of a deal on this customized Gutsy.
1DI0006332	And it's not just "Mister" Gutsy - he's a full fledged sergeant! "Sergeant RL-3" to be precise, the pride of General Atomics International.
1DI0006333	Comes complete with a simulated personality unit, so he's good protection and good company, too! And all yours for just 1000 caps.
1DI0006334	I'm afraid these 'bots are all spoken for, I'm just delivering them now. I've got a custom Gutsy that isn't spoken for but...
1DI0006335	Well, RL-3's a bit finicky about the company he keeps. And I don't think he likes the look of you. Nothing personal, of course.
1DI0006336	Hey, I said it was a beaut of a deal, didn't I?
1DI0006337	But to tell the truth, RL-3's a bit picky about the company he keeps, and he won't let himself get sold to just anyone.
1DI0006338	Makes him a bit of a tough lot to sell, if you know what I mean. But he seems to like you, so I'm not gonna complain!
1DI0006339	General Atomics International programmed him to be a perfect soldier, and his simulated personality is designed to follow strict codes of conduct.
1DI0006340	It's just that some of those codes were a little less-defined than others. So he won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
1DI0006341	And sadly, his version of "too extreme" seems to cover both sides of the coin - slavers and saints alike. Sorry, pal.
1DI0006342	Trust me, friend, Tinker Joe does not turn down the opportunity to make a sale. If that Gutsy would go with you, I'd sell him in a heartbeat.
1DI0006343	It's just that his programming's a bit off. He won't travel with anyone he considers "too extreme."
1DI0006350	You're going to have to let your other friend go. Until then, I'll hold on to him for you.
1DI0006351	To tell the truth, it is a little trouble. But he can't help the way he got built.
1DI0006352	General Atomics programmed the Mister Gutsy to be a good soldier, but their definitions were a bit vague. So a lot of units had... issues.
1DI0006353	So we got a gung-ho, robotic soldier that's picky about the company he keeps. But he seems to like you, so it'll be fine.
1DI0006354	That's a hard bargain. But if I wake up with that thing playing revelry at me one more time, I'll go insane.
1DI0006355	I'll just transfer the codes, and you've got a deal, friend. Here's hoping for the best for you and the Sergeant alike!
1DI0006357	Well now, that's a problem. But start saving now and maybe I'll run into you again, huh?
1DI0006358	You say that now, but you might end up reconsidering that when you're surrounded by radscorpions.
1DI0006359	But if you do, and you're still alive to find me again, the offer'll still stand.
1DI0006360	Is she now? Well, it seems that this arrangement worked out well for both of us.
1DI0006361	With the new profit I'll make from Greta's customers, I'll be able to hire a replacement for Charon with plenty left over for myself.
1DI0006362	And you held up your end of the deal, my friend. And I am a man of his word. Charon's contract is yours. You are his new employer. Congratulations.
1DI0006363	I'll give you the pleasure of informing him yourself.
1DI0006364	Yes. She is. And you have Charon's contract. I think that deal is complete.
1DI0006365	The rest is between you and Charon.
1DI0006366	I knew you'd change your mind. Just remember, Charon is a valuable asset to me and he doesn't come cheap. Are you ready to deal?
1DI0006367	Oh? Would you, now? He is a highly valuable asset to me and to the Ninth Circle. What did you have in mind?
1DI0006368	No, he is not. Sir, you insult me. I do not believe in slavery. It is an abomination.
1DI0006369	I am a firm believer in personal choice. To force another person into bondage is unthinkable. Chains are earned, never forced.
1DI0006370	Charon made some choices that landed him in my employ. The matters of our contract is between him and I -- no one else.
1DI0006371	No he is not. Ma'am, you insult me. I do not believe in slavery. It is an abomination.
1DI0006374	His company is rather refreshing, isn't it? But don't mistake his brevity for stupidity. That would be very unwise.
1DI0006375	Underestimating an opponent has been the last mistake of far too many individuals throughout history.
1DI0006376	I hold his contract, which makes me his employer. He will do what I ask when I ask, without question.
1DI0006377	You see, Charon grew up around a very interesting group of individuals. They... well, I guess you could say that they brainwashed him.
1DI0006378	He is absolutely loyal to whomever holds his contract. Unfailing, unflinching, until the day that employment ends.
1DI0006379	Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt that he holds no end of animosity towards me. But so long as he is my employee, he is as gentle as a teddy bear.
1DI0006380	Watches over the bar. Keeps the drunks in line. Pretty much, I point at something and Charon hurts it.
1DI0006381	He's the best thug a corrupt bartender could ever ask for. He never bothers me with his own annoying sense of morality.
1DI0006382	Very well. You ask too many questions as it is.
1DI0006383	I suppose that could work... yes. Yes... here's the contract. And I'll take my payment in full.
1DI0006384	I'll give you the pleasure of informing Charon yourself.
1DI0006385	You're kidding, right? Come back when you have a serious offer.
1DI0006398	That's a shame. I guess I'll just have to hold on to this contract a little bit longer.
1DI0006403	Yes. She is. And you have Charon's contact, per our bargain. Now get him out of here.
1DI0006407	My friend, we already have a deal. You can have the contract when Greta is dead. It's very simple.
1DI0006408	I suppose we could do that, although you might not like the deal that I have to offer. You see, I don't like competition. Not at all.
1DI0006409	It goes against every principle that I have as a businessman. So, the fact that there is another source for booze in town troubles me.
1DI0006410	Greta, the waitress over at Carol's... I want you to kill her. I don't care how, just make it quiet. Do it, and you can have Charon's contract.
1DI0006411	Loyal employee that he is, Charon would do it without question if I asked him to. However, the entire town would come down on me for it.
1DI0006412	Greta is quite popular around here. If Charon is the one who kills her, everyone will know that it was me who ordered Greta's death.
1DI0006413	I need Charon clearly visible and in public when Greta dies, so that I can fairly claim ignorance of the situation.
1DI0006414	No stomach for hard work, eh? No matter. If you don't want to do the job, then come up with the cash. Otherwise, I'll just hang on to this contract.
1DI0006415	I'm glad to hear it. Come back to me when she's dead and Charon's contract is all yours.
1DI0006416	A word of advice: be subtle. Open gunplay will only get the town to turn on you, and I will not be able to help you.
1DI0006417	Ahzrukhal. I am told that I am no longer in your service.
1DI0006418	That's right, Charon. Have you come to say goodbye?
1DI0006420	I belong to no one. If you are my new employer, then I will serve you. But first, I must take care of something. Wait here.
1DI0006421	You purchased my contract from Ahzrukhal? So, I am no longer in his service. That is good to know.
1DI0006422	Please, wait here. I must take care of something.
1DI0006423	Ahzrukhal was an evil bastard. So long as he held my contract, I was honor bound to do as he commanded.
1DI0006424	But now you are my employer, which freed me to rid the world of that disgusting rat. And now, for good or ill, I serve you.
1DI0006425	But I cannot come with you. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
1DI0006426	I shall wait here until your party is smaller.
1DI0006429	Would that I could. Although you are now my employer, traveling in such a large crowd would be foolish.
1DI0006431	As you wish.
1DI0006432	Very amusing.
1DI0006433	Yeah, very funny. Ha ha. Hilarious.
1DI0006434	Very well. I shall stay with you.
1DI0006435	Yeah. That's what I thought.
1DI0006436	Excellent. Will do.
1DI0006438	I was worried for a second.
1DI0006440	You can't fire me! I'm the boss of this gang! And I say you're fired! And that I'm going back to Rivet City for a drink! Suck on that!
1DI0006441	Very well. Although you remain my employer until my contract changes hands. I will wait for you in Underworld, should you need me again.
1DI0006442	If that's the way you're going to play, lover. I'll be waiting at Eulogy's place when you come crawling back.
1DI0006444	I see how it is: the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'm gonna go see if there's anything left of Megaton.
1DI0006445	I see how it is: the old man can't keep up. Whatever. I'll be at Moriarty's if you change your mind.
1DI0006446	I'm disappointed, but I cannot say I'm surprised. If you change your mind, I shall be studying in the American History Museum, downtown.
1DI0006447	Leaving a soldier behind? Very bad form. Making base in Canterbury Commons for when you come to your senses, sir!
1DI0006448	Very well. I shall return to my duties at the Citadel should you require my aid once again.
1DI0006449	I did. And you as well!
1DI0006450	Long ago, I helped guard the water purifier against the Super Mutant horde. When your father left, I escorted the two of you to Megaton.
1DI0006451	He was... a noble man. I was saddened to hear of his passing. But from what I've heard, he died with honor. He died for you.
1DI0006452	I only pray that my own death has such meaning.
1DI0006453	I'm sorry, until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
1DI0006454	And perhaps I would, in James' honor. But I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
1DI0006455	Perhaps return when you are alone and I will tell you of your father.
1DI0006456	My offer stands. Do you wish me to accompany you in your journey?
1DI0006457	And so our deeds are carried on through our sons and our daughters.
1DI0006458	Continue to remember him fondly, continue to tell his story, and continue to do his work. Through you, he shall carry on.
1DI0006459	I have heard tales of your travels and I must say, they disturb me.
1DI0006460	I had hoped to fight by the side of the child of my former friend. But, until you change your ways, my conscience cannot allow me to do so.
1DI0006463	But now I must ask you a difficult question, if I have your leave to do so.
1DI0006464	I escorted your father across the Wastes. It was the best I could contribute to his efforts to restore fresh water to the people.
1DI0006465	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work. But... there is a problem...
1DI0006466	I'm sorry, but until you prove yourself worthy of the legacy of your father, I cannot join you.
1DI0006468	I would like to have the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work. But... there is a problem.
1DI0006469	I cannot travel with you under the Brotherhood flag given your current... companionship.
1DI0006472	I would like the honor of escorting you in your journey to complete his work.
1DI0006473	Wry. Much like James was.
1DI0006476	True. And in the end, death claims us all. But how we die can say just as much about our lives as how we lived.
1DI0006477	Your father died for what he knew to be right, and he died protecting those closest to him. This is a good man's death.
1DI0006478	As for you, I have heard tales of your travels in the Wastes. I must say, I am disturbed by them. I would think that you could do better.
1DI0006482	But, I must ask you a difficult question, if I have your leave to do so.
1DI0006486	Then you did not know the man. I knew your father, I knew his goodness, and I will not have you sully the memory of a noble man.
1DI0006487	Go now. I have nothing more to say to you.
1DI0006488	As a Star Paladin, I answer only to Elder Lyons. He has given me leave to pursue the restoration of Project Purity as I see fit.
1DI0006489	By aiding you in your travels, I shall fulfill that mission as best I am capable.
1DI0006490	Then I shall follow your leave and submit to your command.
1DI0006491	As James' child, I know I don't need to explain, but I am not your servant. If I do not like the path your actions take, I will return here.
1DI0006492	Now, let us go forward, crush the Enclave, and fulfill your father's mission.
1DI0006493	Certainly. I shall remain here. Should you change your mind, simply return to me. I shall come with you for the asking.
1DI0006494	Sorry man. I don't know what's gotten into you but you're just a little too intense for me. Maybe come back after you've chilled out and we'll see.
1DI0006496	Nah, I'm good. I only roll with Tunnel Snakes. Come back when you're on your own.
1DI0006497	I guess I can let you back into the gang. Once a Snake, always a Snake, huh? Let's roll!
1DI0006498	I regret that I cannot join you at this time. You seem to already have someone in your employ.
1DI0006499	You are my employer and I will do as you command.
1DI0006500	Sorry, honey. Three's a crowd. Come back when I can have you all to myself.
1DI0006501	Absolutely, lover. Let's go have some fun.
1DI0006503	Sorry, kid. I just can't roll with someone like you.
1DI0006504	If you pick up a few bad habits, maybe I'll change my mind.
1DI0006505	Sorry, kid. I'd love to, but there just ain't enough supplies to go around. Ditch the loser and then we'll talk.
1DI0006506	Thank Christ. I really didn't want to go back to Megaton after what happened to that place.
1DI0006507	Thank Christ. I thought I was gonna grow a fourth arm sitting next to all this fucking radiation.
1DI0006508	Now that's what I like to hear! I'll be right behind you!
1DI0006509	My friend, I am saddened to hear that you have turned away from a noble path.
1DI0006510	Return to me when you have learned to take right action, and I will walk with you.
1DI0006511	My friend, I would love to join you, but I fear that your traveling companion would not accept me.
1DI0006512	Return to me when you are alone, and I will join you.
1DI0006513	I owe you no less than my life. How could I refuse?
1DI0006514	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an irresponsible officer!
1DI0006515	It is a soldier's duty to soldier, not to play hero!
1DI0006516	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Marshall!
1DI0006517	Sir, I apologize, but a squad is less effective when it is over crowded.
1DI0006518	I should definitely say so! Time to roll out!
1DI0006519	It is regrettable, but I cannot follow one such as you. Restore your good name, and perhaps I shall reconsider.
1DI0006520	It is my sincere wish to join you, but so long as you travel with one who is not of the Brotherhood, I simply cannot risk myself.
1DI0006521	And it is my duty to offer it, as I have sworn. I shall follow and protect you.
1DI0006522	No offense, kid, but you're not exactly the type I'm used to runnin' with.
1DI0006523	I've heard about you -- a lil' goody two shoes out of the Vault. I don't think our styles would really mesh.
1DI0006524	Nah, it ain't so bad here. I got some good memories, but that's all I got. No sense in ruining the good ones, you know?
1DI0006525	No offense. You seem okay, kid. But your friend there, well... I'm used to working in smaller groups.
1DI0006526	Come back when you're alone and maybe we can work something out.
1DI0006527	Yeah, I am. But I'm gonna need 1,000 caps for supplies before I head out with you.
1DI0006528	What? Back out where?
1DI0006529	Oh yeah? Have you heard of a crew that'll take me?
1DI0006530	This again. Okay, I'll play along. Back out where?
1DI0006531	I left all that behind me. There's nothing but bullshit out there: killing... stealing... violence... I'm not that guy anymore.
1DI0006532	You know, I do miss it sometimes... it's a life of freedom, you know?
1DI0006533	But c'mon, I'm a washed up old Raider. What crew is gonna take me on? These kids don't know nothin' about respect.
1DI0006539	Yeah... yeah! You know, I think I'll take you up on that.
1DI0006540	Tell you what, drop 1,000 caps on me for supplies and I'm in.
1DI0006541	Haha! This is gonna be great! Some good ol' fashioned violence!
1DI0006542	Well what'd you get my hopes up for? I can't head out there without supplies, now can I?
1DI0006543	Tell you what: the offer's open. Just come back when you've got the thousand.
1DI0006544	Huhn. I see how it is. No use for a washed up old waster, huh? Well, kid, the offer's open any time you wanna take it.
1DI0006545	What the hell? You get me all worked up and then cut me off? Well... look... if you ever need a hand out there, you know where to find me.
1DI0006546	Yeah... thanks. I guess.
1DI0006547	Huhn. Yeah... you're right. Stupid idea anyway.
1DI0006548	Why the fuck would you start saying it if you weren't going to finish. Back out where? What are you talking about?
1DI0006551	I see how it is. You'd best think twice before fucking with me again.
1DI0006552	As you command.
1DI0006553	Right on. I'm ready for more action.
1DI0006554	Very well. I stand by your side.
1DI0006555	Yeah, let's hit it!
1DI0006556	Yes, sir!
1DI0006557	With all due haste.
1DI0006558	Oh yes, let's!
1DI0006560	Certainly. What is it?
1DI0006561	Yeah? What do you want now?
1DI0006562	What do you wish to speak to me about?
1DI0006563	Oh, come on. What?
1DI0006564	No time to dilly-dally, sir! What is it?
1DI0006565	Yes, best to formulate a plan. What is it?
1DI0006566	Oh, make it quick. I'm getting bored. I hate being bored.
1DI0006568	Charming.
1DI0006569	What the fu... you think that's funny?
1DI0006570	As I am a "man of my word", there is nowhere else that I could possibly be.
1DI0006571	Yeah, well the Snakes don't need you, anyway! We don't need nothing but liquor and guns! Yeah!
1DI0006572	Old war-bots never die! We just rust away.
1DI0006573	If there's one thing I've learned, it's patience. I can wait.
1DI0006574	You big tease!
1DI0006576	Oh, like you know better? What?
1DI0006577	Is there a problem with what I'm doing?
1DI0006578	What are you thinking, lover?
1DI0006579	You think you got a better idea?
1DI0006580	Yes, the unpleasant necessities of battle. Your suggestions?
1DI0006581	I am open to your suggestions.
1DI0006582	What do you think would be best?
1DI0006583	Oh yeah? To what?
1DI0006584	A member of the Brotherhood is trained in all weapons as an Initiate. What do you wish?
1DI0006585	I can stab, I can shoot, I can do lots of things. What's your pleasure?
1DI0006586	In what way?
1DI0006587	What would you like? I think you'll find I'm quite flexible.
1DI0006588	If conversation is what you wish, then I shall provide it.
1DI0006589	You talk too damn much, anyone ever told you that?
1DI0006590	If conversation is what you wish, perhaps you should have brought along a Scribe.
1DI0006591	Do all the talking you want. Just don't expect me to, you know, listen or anything.
1DI0006593	Oh, does it always have to be talk?
1DI0006594	I shall follow your lead.
1DI0006595	Right behind you, kid.
1DI0006596	I shall remain vigilant.
1DI0006597	Let's rumble! Yeah!
1DI0006598	Yes, let's be on our way.
1DI0006599	Oh, time for fun already? Goody!
1DI0006600	It is what you wished of me.
1DI0006601	If that is what you wish, then I will endeavor to do the best that I am able.
1DI0006602	Shit yeah, you do.
1DI0006603	You got a pair of goggles or something? Whenever I fight up close, blood always sprays in my eyes...
1DI0006604	I appreciate the compliment. It is where I am most comfortable.
1DI0006605	They shall know the power of my steel!
1DI0006606	Up close and personal, that's how I like it!
1DI0006607	Yeah, because that's how Snakes fight! Right up in your face, with fangs and... knives and stuff!
1DI0006608	At least my strength is useful for something. <sigh>
1DI0006609	Yes, of course. <sigh>
1DI0006610	My pleasure, lover.
1DI0006611	Gladly. Face to face is so much more personal.
1DI0006612	You're goddamn right I'm not bad. I've been doin' this for 25 goddamn years.
1DI0006613	Good. I hate it when they bleed on me.
1DI0006614	The same can be said of any Brother. We are trained well and tempered in the fires of battle.
1DI0006615	Very well. I shall cover your approach.
1DI0006616	You'd better believe it! I should have gotten my hands on some of these earlier!
1DI0006617	Sure, I guess. Just don't get in my way, is all I'm saying.
1DI0006618	It is what you wish of me.
1DI0006619	If that is what you wish, then it is what I shall do. I must say, that I find happiness in a warm gun.
1DI0006620	Of course. It's so much more respectable than simply killing people at arm's reach.
1DI0006621	If you insist. I just wish there were another solution.
1DI0006622	Anything for you, lover.
1DI0006623	Oh, do I have to? That's not nearly as much fun!
1DI0006624	If you wanna get closer to me, that's all you gotta say, girl.
1DI0006625	You mean how close you're following me, right? Sure, what's up?
1DI0006626	Is there something that you wish me to change?
1DI0006627	How close would you like?
1DI0006628	Yeah... okay. You got a better idea?
1DI0006629	As you wish. What about it?
1DI0006631	I am happy if you are happy.
1DI0006633	You're damn right I'm good, kid.
1DI0006634	Sure, kid. Whatever you say.
1DI0006635	I thought it so.
1DI0006636	It allows for flexibility. A wise choice on your part.
1DI0006637	Oh, I'm the best, baby.
1DI0006638	Good? Screw that noise - I'm downright awesome!
1DI0006639	So... Near? Far? Come on, make up your mind!
1DI0006640	Understood, sir. Proceeding as normal!
1DI0006641	RL-3 will maintain a tactical distance!
1DI0006642	I'll endeavor to continue, then.
1DI0006643	A sound decision, yes.
1DI0006644	Glad you like it.
1DI0006645	As you wish, lover.
1DI0006646	If conversation is your order to me, I will converse with you.
1DI0006647	Talk, talk, talk...
1DI0006648	As the Codex says: "Through discourse, we gain the strength of our Brothers' minds."
1DI0006649	There better be some action soon, or I'm heading back to the bar.
1DI0006650	Yes, sir? What, sir?
1DI0006651	Certainly. What have you got in mind?
1DI0006652	Is it going to be all talk?
1DI0006653	I will follow your lead.
1DI0006654	C'mon, kid, why are we standin' around here?
1DI0006655	Should you require advice, I am here.
1DI0006656	About time, too!
1DI0006657	Affirmative!
1DI0006658	Yes, let's.
1DI0006659	Yes, please.
1DI0006660	It was my goal to continue doing so until you told me otherwise.
1DI0006661	Very well. I will seek out better positions to cover you while you forge ahead.
1DI0006662	That's what I'm doing. Why do you think I'm standing back here in East Bumfuck?
1DI0006663	Ha! Good plan. I'll try to get around behind 'em. I like how you think, kid.
1DI0006664	I've had no compelling reason to do anything different from what you asked.
1DI0006666	I get any farther, I might as well be back in the bar. And that's sounding like a better idea all the time, trust me.
1DI0006667	What, don't you like my aftershave?
1DI0006668	Yeah, got it. Flanking and tactics and stuff. Right.
1DI0006669	If you insist, sir, but RL-3 functions best when closer to the fight!
1DI0006670	Stealth flanking mode active!
1DI0006671	By all means. I simply hope I'm not too far in reserve, in case of unforeseen trouble.
1DI0006672	A sound plan. I trust this isn't simply to avoid being seen with a Super Mutant?
1DI0006673	Eulogy used to like me to stay ten steps behind him. Usually.
1DI0006674	As you wish, but I'm not letting you out of my sight.
1DI0006675	If you are through giving orders, then let us move on.
1DI0006676	Yeah. Less talking about killing. More killing!
1DI0006677	It is always a subject worthy of discussion.
1DI0006678	About time. Seriously.
1DI0006679	Agreed! Now it is time to apply those tactics!
1DI0006680	Indeed. There are far more interesting things in the world than warfare.
1DI0006681	Yes, enough about boring old tactics.
1DI0006682	Give me my marching orders, sir.
1DI0006683	We've secured the building and are currently implementing our orders for the occupation of Fairfax.
1DI0006684	Raider activity in town has increased since we first took up positions in and around the fort.  We've killed a lot of them and scared off others.
1DI0006685	But they just keep coming back. Their numbers seem limitless, while requests for our own reinforcements are repeatedly denied.
1DI0006686	That the Raiders take such continued risks to invade our facility appears to confirm suspicions that we've had an intelligence leak.
1DI0006687	They've tried tenaciously to infiltrate the base, but so far haven't stood a chance.  Our objective remains the same: protect the research personnel.
1DI0006688	Defender Morgan and I executed a reconnaissance mission last night to gauge Raider entrenchment in the structural underground of Fairfax.
1DI0006689	We located three entrances into underground utility tunnels, and confirmed the enemy has occupied and fortified these positions. Some are undefended.
1DI0006690	We also identified a small weapons cache in the southeast section of the tunnels. We were compromised by a patrol while placing explosives here.
1DI0006691	In accordance to mission parameters, we did not engage, instead retreating to Base.  Raiders will be likely to attach more patrols to that area now.
1DI0006692	Oh, just wonderful. Thanks for asking.
1DI0006693	Dear, I live in Tenpenny Tower. I'm at the top of the world. He he he he.
1DI0006694	I'm quite well, thank you.
1DI0006695	Splendid. Simply splendid. Thanks so much for asking.
1DI0006696	I'd be better if I could get my hands on some caviar, but what can you do? Ha ha ha ha ha.
1DI0006697	You got a Pip-Boy. Tune into Galaxy News Radio and listen. It's the only radio station in the Capital Wasteland that tells it like it really is.
1DI0006698	This is the last free radio station in the entire D.C. area. The rest of the airwaves are clouded up with Enclave propaganda.
1DI0006699	I wouldn't believe a word they say anywhere else.
1DI0006700	This is Galaxy News Radio, the last free voice of the people of the Wasteland. The Brotherhood of Steel makes sure of that.
1DI0006701	Nah, I guess you're right.
1DI0006702	Sorry, sir. I'll do my best.
1DI0006703	Good. Then I can show you who's a better shot!
1DI0006704	Yes, sir. Sorry sir!
1DI0006705	Hehe. You'll get your chance, brother. Be patient.
1DI0006706	Very good, sir. I'll be sure and keep my eyes open.
1DI0006707	Thanks, brother. It takes a great amount of practice and even more patience.
1DI0006708	Agreed, brother. That was a little too close for comfort. I'll be more careful.
1DI0006709	Besides the Super Mutants, just anything out of the ordinary. Citadel's orders.
1DI0006710	Good, carry on, soldier.
1DI0006711	I'm always expecting something. I just don't want to be caught unawares when it springs on us.
1DI0006712	I can't even tell you the love that I'm getting from the Wasteland.
1DI0006713	Ever since GNR started singing again, the guys downstairs told me that more people than ever are tuning in.
1DI0006714	It's all I ever wanted.
1DI0006715	It's amazing. We've always been able to hear GNR, but it's like the station is brand new or something.
1DI0006716	Things are back on track. That should throw a kink in the Enclave's work.
1DI0006717	You've done a hell of a job. The Wasteland looks a little brighter if you can believe that.
1DI0006718	If you'd rather run around out there with all those Super Mutants, be my guest.
1DI0006719	You'll do what our orders say, soldier. I'm getting a bit tired of your complaints.
1DI0006720	Don't worry brother, we'll see plenty of action here, I can promise you that.
1DI0006721	If it's action you want, how about cleaning up this pigsty of a barracks!
1DI0006722	Just ready to take down some Super Mutants, brother. Otherwise, all quiet.
1DI0006723	No new orders yet, brother. We're to remain here until further notice and assist any reinforcements that may arrive.
1DI0006724	Yes, that was an excellent shot, brother. I can only hope to be as good as you someday.
1DI0006725	It was a good thing you did, brother. He was about to have you for lunch. You shouldn't be so reckless.
1DI0006726	Anything in particular we should be looking out for?
1DI0006727	Yes, sir. I am locked and loaded.
1DI0006728	What's up, sir? Expecting something in particular?
1DI0006729	I always do, sir. Is there something we should be expecting?
1DI0006730	You can head right on up. He's waiting for you.
1DI0006731	Oh, go right on up. You were expected.
1DI0006732	Three Dog is right upstairs.
1DI0006733	Well, the only other station that comes through nice and clear on the radio is the Enclave's station.
1DI0006734	All they spew is a bunch of nonsense and propaganda. Galaxy News Radio reports on what's really happening.
1DI0006735	We have a relationship with the station here. We stay in this reinforced structure, and protect it from the Super Mutants.
1DI0006736	This is the only real safe spot in the ruins of D.C. The rest of the place is crawling with those walking abominations.
1DI0006737	It's nice to have a port in the storm, you know?
1DI0006738	Sure. Good luck to you.
1DI0006739	Yes, I believe this place could do with a bit more in the way of decoration.
1DI0006740	Speak with Lydia Montenegro down in the Lobby Level of the tower. She has quite a selection of items to enhance your living space.
1DI0006742	Speak with Moira Brown at Craterside Supply here in Megaton. She has quite a selection of items to enhance your living space.
1DI0006743	I'm sorry, sir. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
1DI0006744	I'm sorry, madam. My condensation collectors need time to fully recharge before I can continue to dispense any more beverages.
1DI0006745	Certainly, sir. Here you are.
1DI0006746	Certainly, madam. Here you are.
1DI0006747	Certainly. I am programmed with a multitude of hair shaping scenarios, if you would care to choose one, I would be happy to replicate it for you.
1DI0006748	An innovation from Med-Tek, the My First Infirmary will automatically diagnose and treat any injury you might sustain.
1DI0006749	It will also make any of the pesky rads you've accumulated in the Wasteland vanish instantly.
1DI0006750	My humor emitter array requires recharging.
1DI0006751	Photons have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic.
1DI0006752	The best contraceptive for old people is nudity.
1DI0006753	Two cannibals are eating a clown. One cannibal turns to the other and asks, "Does this taste funny to you?"
1DI0006754	I once visited a crematorium that gave discounts for burn victims.
1DI0006755	I was going to attend the clairvoyants meeting, but it was canceled due to unforeseen events.
1DI0006756	It's common knowledge that irradiated cats have 18 half-lives.
1DI0006757	Two atoms are in a bar. One says, "I think I lost an electron." The other says, "Are you sure?" to which the other replies, "I'm positive."
1DI0006758	A neutron walks into a bar. "How much for a drink here, anyway?"  To which the bartender responds, "For you, no charge."
1DI0006759	War does not determine who is right - only who is left.
1DI0006760	Just switch on the Jukebox, and instantly the room will fill with music to keep you entertained.
1DI0006761	The music selections have been hand picked by none other than Three Dog of Galaxy News Radio.
1DI0006762	From the keen minds at Med-Tek, the My First Laboratory will instantly detoxify you, removing any nasty addictions from your body.
1DI0006763	If you're feeling the need to experiment, just set the lab to "brew" and a day later, it will produce a random useful compound.
1DI0006764	Remember that while the lab is brewing, you can't use the detoxify functions.
1DI0006765	The Nuka-Cola machine will dispense Ice Cold Nuka-Cola.
1DI0006766	Once you've dispensed 8 of them, the machine will have to be restocked in order to make regular Nuka-Colas ice cold.
1DI0006767	If you come across any schematics in the Wasteland, you'll be able to construct its contents on this specially designed table.
1DI0006768	Good to see that old house finally found an owner.
1DI0006769	I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
1DI0006770	Of course! I have all sorts of items and themes for that place that may interest you.
1DI0006771	Of course I can!
1DI0006772	Which one in particular interests you?
1DI0006773	Some people don't like living in a boring old house.
1DI0006774	Purchase a theme from me and I use all of my design abilities to set your place up in the manner you request.
1DI0006775	You can choose from the Vault, Raider, Wasteland Explorer, Science, Love Machine or Pre-War Themes.
1DI0006776	Okay, consider it done. Anything else?
1DI0006777	Sure thing!
1DI0006779	If you're wounded or you've hurt one of your limbs badly, this setup will allow you to heal it up as good as any other Wasteland Doctor.
1DI0006780	If you feel like filling your place with a whole bunch of music, switch this beautiful pre-war antique on.
1DI0006781	This setup is great for experimenting and coming up with all sorts of useful concoctions.
1DI0006782	It also can be used to get rid of any horrible addictions you may have from tasting your results!
1DI0006783	One push of a button and you can get your hands on an Ice Cold Nuka-Cola!
1DI0006784	If you feel like tinkering and want to build some custom gizmos, this setup will help you do it.
1DI0006786	Feeling a bit homesick are we?
1DI0006787	Remember, once you buy a theme you can't sell it back to me, although you could always purchase a new one.
1DI0006788	Into the blood and guts look, eh?
1DI0006790	Longing for the great outdoors are we?
1DI0006792	You're the intellectual type, eh?
1DI0006794	Feeling a bit nostalgic are we?
1DI0006796	Feeling a bit anxious are we?
1DI0006799	Go right ahead!
1DI0006800	Well then, let's make a deal!
1DI0006801	Good to see that old suite finally found an owner.
1DI0006803	They got you living up there?
1DI0006804	Well, since we're stuck with you, you might as well take a look at all the items and themes for that place that may interest you.
1DI0006806	Yeah, sure. I have all sorts of items and themes for that place. Check 'em out.
1DI0006809	Well, you wanna be more specific or do I have to guess?
1DI0006810	Some people don't like living in a boring old suite.
1DI0006813	Themes, huh? What's the matter... too lazy to decorate yourself?
1DI0006814	The former owner of this business left detailed instructions on how to have themes set up to make your suite look interesting.
1DI0006817	Jeez... make up your mind, will ya?
1DI0006818	What else can I get for you, your majesty?
1DI0006820	Now we're talkin'.
1DI0006822	Suit yourself.
1DI0006824	If you went and did something stupid, like busting up a limb or something, this setup will allow you to heal just like being at a Wasteland Doctor.
1DI0006826	This noise box will fill your room with awful human-made music. How can you stand listening to that garbage anyway?
1DI0006829	If you like blowing yourself up by mixing chemicals and trying to make drugs to get you higher than the top of this tower, this addon's for you.
1DI0006830	It also can be used to get rid of any addictions you may have from tasting your results!
1DI0006832	Well let's see. It's a machine, and it gives you Ice Cold Nuka-Colas. What are you, stupid?
1DI0006834	Find one of them fancy schematics? Well, you can use this table to build whatever it is in your own place.
1DI0006839	Awww... do we miss our old home?
1DI0006843	Into the blood and guts look? Reminds me of my old home.
1DI0006847	Well, if you have to feel like your out in the Wasteland, I guess this is for you. Me, I like to stay out of the sun.
1DI0006851	Sounds great, Poindexter.
1DI0006855	Still want to live in the past, huh? Well, forget it. Those days are long gone.
1DI0006857	Feeling a bit anxious, perhaps?
1DI0006859	Yuck, the thought of walking around naked's making me sick.
1DI0006863	Certainly!
1DI0006864	Agh... make up your mind already!
1DI0006866	Finally! Let's get down to business.
1DI0006867	Okay, I guess.
1DI0006868	Kind of bored, actually.
1DI0006869	I don't know. Fine, I guess.
1DI0006870	I feel kind of sick. Maybe I shouldn't have eaten that lizard.
1DI0006871	Do you ever dream about monsters? I do.
1DI0006872	I don't know. What about you?
1DI0006873	Just hanging around. What's up with you?
1DI0006874	Hanging around this boring place, as usual.
1DI0006875	Nothing. I'm bored.
1DI0006877	Um. I can't remember.
1DI0006878	Hell yeah, I do! I could be out there and kicking butt in my own gang and everything. The Tunnel Snakes could ride again!
1DI0006879	Or, y'know, slither again. Whatever!
1DI0006880	What? A goody-two-shoes like you could never make it in a real gang!
1DI0006881	You want to hang with a Tunnel Snake like me, you gotta be hard.
1DI0006882	Whoa, hey, that's cool and all, but you're just a little too... intense, y'know?
1DI0006883	I mean, Butch is down for action, but you... You're a psycho!
1DI0006884	I really wish I could, man, but three's a crowd, you know? I'll just stay here for now.
1DI0006886	Yeah... yeah! You'd be perfect for my gang! You're in!
1DI0006888	Yeah, well what do you know? I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna have the biggest, toughest gang ever!
1DI0006889	Y'know... tomorrow. Once I round up a few more people...
1DI0006890	My friend, I would be honored to follow a hero such as yourself. Shall we go?
1DI0006891	Tina, it's me. Your brother? Alex? Listen, mom would kill me if she knew I was contacting you, but she's being an impossible bitch right now.
1DI0006892	You have to come home. Do you understand me? This thing with China... it's not going away. We're going to try to get into one of those Vaults.
1DI0006893	If that doesn't work, well... I have a backup plan. There's this secure bunker... another sort of vault... inside the National Guard Depot, and...
1DI0006894	Look, no matter what it takes, the whole damn Keller family's gonna ride this storm out, but you've got to get your ass home. Now!
1DI0006895	Paul, it's me. Tina. I heard back from my sister Candace. We couldn't get into a Vault. 101, 87, didn't matter -- all full to capacity.
1DI0006896	But my brother Alex is a soldier and... he sort of stole the pass code for a secure Army bunker. He did it for the family. But they caught him.
1DI0006897	Before they took him into custody, Alex he sent each of us one number of the four-digit code. That way, we all have to be together to get in.
1DI0006898	He gave me number "5" -- the day of my birth.  So I guess what I'm saying is... I'm still leaving. It's been fun. Kind of.
1DI0006899	Oh, and I'm not pregnant. So no worries.
1DI0006900	Mom, it's Candace. Oh my God, it's really happening. I can see the cloud... it's so big... Mom, I'm so scared.
1DI0006901	I'm heading to the Vault now. I'll do whatever I can to get inside. My number of the passcode was "7," right?
1DI0006902	Ralphie, son, this is your father! We can't get into the goddamn Vault without you! Get your ass over here now! My "4" is useless without you, boy...
1DI0006903	Candace, it's Ralph. Tell dad there's no way in hell I'm spending nuclear Armageddon trapped with him in a fucking closet.
1DI0006904	You can have my number. It's "6." Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a mushroom cloud to walk into. Have a happy holocaust!
1DI0006905	You're big, and I don't have any big friends. You better just go out the way you came in.
1DI0006906	I ain't kidding. You're not supposed to be here, so you better leave.
1DI0006907	My name is Carrie Delaney. I teach fourth grade at the Early Dawn Elementary School, in Washington, D.C.
1DI0006908	Yesterday, October 23, 2077, half the school went on a field trip to Lamplight Caverns. We were packing up to leave when when everything went crazy.
1DI0006909	The caves started shaking, the lights went out, the kids started screaming. My God... Mister Pollack went outside to see what was going on.
1DI0006910	When he came back in, he told us what he saw. Clouds. Mushroom clouds. It's finally happened. The end of the world.
1DI0006911	We're all okay. If you can call being stuck in a cave with 82 terrified kids okay. Alive, anyway. But I don't know what the hell we're going to do.
1DI0006912	It's been 4 days. Claudia went out this morning to look around, and never came back. Then Mr. Cob went out to look for her, and HE never came back.
1DI0006913	So now there's only me, two other teachers, two of the parents who were chaperoning, and a few of the cavern staff. And all these poor kids.
1DI0006914	We've got enough food and water to last for awhile, I guess. But after that? I just don't know. We can't stay in here forever. Can we?
1DI0006915	Um... I guess this thing is working. I'm Jason Grant. I'm 10 years old. I'm in Mrs. Delaney's class at Early Dawn Elementary.
1DI0006916	A month ago, the big war came and everything was destroyed. Except us. We're still okay in these caves. Kind of.
1DI0006917	Mrs. Delaney went out this morning to get help, and she never came back. The other adults never came back either. So now it's just us kids.
1DI0006918	A lot of the others still cry every day. They're really scared. I'm not. There's nothing to be scared of, as long as we don't go outside.
1DI0006919	Nobody else wants to be in charge, so I'm going to try. Most of the kids listen to me already, so it should be easy.
1DI0006920	It's been almost two months, and we're all doing pretty good, even if we are all alone.
1DI0006921	There's a door that leads to a Vault, right here in the caverns. Every day we bang and bang, but they won't let us in. We can hear them in there!
1DI0006922	One time, a guy on the other side told us we were dead already. Fuck those grown ups. Fuck them all. We don't need them ever again.
1DI0006923	We've been in here for 3 months now, and it's way better than it used to be. Who says kids can't take care of themselves?
1DI0006924	Jason has done a really good job keeping everyone busy. He says if we want to survive, we need to work together, and work hard.
1DI0006925	A few of the kids have started saying we're like a whole new city. A city of kids. They call it "Little Lamplight." It's so cool.
1DI0006926	All of us voted, in secret, and tomorrow we're going to tell Jason that he's the city's first mayor! He's going to be so happy with us.
1DI0006928	<bark!> <bark!>
1DI0006931	There's always one big sister or another who knows her way around a compress and a sewing needle, so we take care of most of the little scrapes.
1DI0006932	And way back when, someone figured out that some of the plants and fungus around here absorb radiation.
1DI0006933	The little ones don't like to eat their veggies, but they don't like to be sick, either. So we get by.
1DI0006934	Well, back at the start, all the children had were the notes from the grown-ups that hadn't left yet, and a few books on caves from the store.
1DI0006935	But after finding the vault, a few scavengers brought back holotapes for basic schooling. Reading, basic math, encyclopedias, that sort of thing.
1DI0006936	We don't get many books anymore from the scav team, but I make sure to keep my own notes on the computer for whoever takes over after I leave.
1DI0006937	Honestly? When we can't scavenge some from outside, we mostly scrape it off the walls and skim it off the water.
1DI0006938	No, really. Most of our food comes from fungus that grows in these caves. It's not so bad when you get used to it, and we don't have much choice.
1DI0006939	At least it's filling, so we don't have to eat much of it. But, man oh man, it tastes terrible.
1DI0006940	Organized?! Have you walked around this place? It's pure anarchy! And I wouldn't have it any other fucking way.
1DI0006941	We can't all stay here forever, so we've all got to leave eventually. And there's not much to look forward to out there.
1DI0006942	So we have a good time while we're here, and the occasional ruthless little bastard like me makes sure it doesn't fall apart for the other kids.
1DI0006943	Well, we all know the basics. Combat first aid, you know? But I've got the most experience at the tough stuff.
1DI0006944	Bumble's been learning the most about the more complex parts of cutting and sewing. People tease her, but she's got a steady hand.
1DI0006945	Of course, now she just needs to learn what you do and don't cut.
1DI0006946	Mostly, whatever they want to learn. We don't have strict classes or anything down here. But it does mean they're interested in what I'm teaching.
1DI0006947	But everyone learns the basics of fighting and shooting and survival - we've all got obvious reasons to be interested in that.
1DI0006948	It's pretty hard to find, and I hear it doesn't grow in other caves. I don't know why it's here, but without it, we'd be goners.
1DI0006949	"Think fungus just grows on trees? No, it grows in caves!" Ugh. Knock Knock came up with that one once, and now it's stuck in my head forever.
1DI0006950	Doesn't take any work to get it to grow down here. All I have to do is collect and prepare it. Mostly, I try to get the stink off it.
1DI0006951	It's not that complex. Any kid can say they want to be mayor here. It's just that most don't want to bother with the responsibility of leading.
1DI0006952	Most of the time, they last until the kids get tired of them, then they get kicked out on their ass by the new mayor. One only lasted 5 minutes.
1DI0006953	Of course, I've kept this place going strong for three years. To most of these kids, that makes me Mayor For Fucking Life. Fine by me, I say.
1DI0006954	It is, especially for dealing with the low-level radiation we all get from the water. The fungus just soaks it right up.
1DI0006955	But it doesn't help the rickets that keeps hitting younger Lamplighters. Believe it or not, I can make a treatment for that from extract of Buffout.
1DI0006956	Actually, if you can talk MacCready into it, I'd be glad to trade some fungus for Buffout. But he'd have to say it was okay.
1DI0006957	We entered all of the books and holotapes into the computer, but frankly, there are a lot of important subjects the vault's materials didn't cover.
1DI0006958	I could wish for more, but we're probably still the best school in the Wasteland. Maybe the only school in the Wasteland, really.
1DI0006959	They say the fungus grows in the pools where the first Lamplighters dumped the mungos. That's about the most they ever helped us.
1DI0006960	I don't know how true that is, but I know sometimes the scav team comes back with this strange meat that tastes terrible, but the fungus loves it.
1DI0006961	I don't know where they find that meat, but if you could bring some back, I'd be glad to trade fungus for it. Of course, MacCready'd have to okay it.
1DI0006962	People change when they grow up, and we don't trust mungos living down here. So we leave for a place called Big Town before we get too old.
1DI0006963	At least, that's the line Joseph teaches. But, really, we simply don't have enough space or food for everyone to stay here forever.
1DI0006964	So I've got to exile some to avoid ruining the whole town. It's a fucking hard brutal choice to make, but that's the way we stay alive.
1DI0006966	Kids who grow up fighting and surviving in Lamplight are better trained for the world out there than idiots who were pampered by grown-ups outside.
1DI0006967	Well, until you come asking for a bandage, at least.
1DI0006968	Glad I could help.
1DI0006970	About time.
1DI0006971	Hey, squirt! Hey, look at me when I talk to you.
1DI0006972	Hey, little Miss Sammy! Pay attention!
1DI0006974	Yeah?
1DI0006975	If you don't get me a new gun next time you're topside, I'm gonna pound you so hard you'll get another inch shorter.
1DI0006976	You getting a nickname any time soon? Maybe you can get one that helps people figure out you're not a girl.
1DI0006977	Someday, you're gonna get yours, Princess.
1DI0006978	Big jerk.
1DI0006979	I dunno. Evewyone just said they didn't want to keep wistening to me.
1DI0006980	Bye-bye, mister! I'm off on an adventure!
1DI0006981	Bye-bye, nice lady! I'm off on an adventure!
1DI0006982	Ha ha ha!
1DI0006983	You're funny, Knock Knock!
1DI0006984	Ha ha... I don't get it.
1DI0006985	<giggles> You're silly!
1DI0006986	Mayor-Mac wouldn't ever let a slaver in here! You can't scare me!
1DI0006987	I'm gonna be big and tough like Lucy! And then I'm gonna go out on adventures and everything!
1DI0006988	No, I don't like the outside!
1DI0006989	I don't know. I'm not supposed to go outside.
1DI0006990	Well, okay. But only 'cause Lucy says I shouldn't go outside alone yet.
1DI0006991	Oh boy, an adventure! Let's go, let's go, oh pleeease, let's go now!
1DI0006992	I am too a big girl! Let's go see the outside!
1DI0006993	Awww. Well, maybe next time?
1DI0006994	I don't like the outside! I'm going home!
1DI0006995	Uncle Joseph, could you explain more about the outside?
1DI0006996	Uncle Joseph, I still don't understand what outside's like. Can you explain more?
1DI0006997	Can you tell me more about growing up, big brother?
1DI0006998	Joseph, what happens when a person grows up?
1DI0006999	I wanna know more about shooting.
1DI0007000	Anything you can teach me about shooting, Joseph?
1DI0007001	Penny, please. Now, as I was saying. Outside of this cave, the world is a lot bigger and more dangerous than it is in here.
1DI0007002	Sure, Bumble. Outside of this cave, the world is a lot bigger and more dangerous than it is in here. It's also got people who would hurt or kill us.
1DI0007003	Okay, Bumble, one more time. Outside of these caves, the world is hot, dry, and not very friendly. And there are monsters bigger than you or me.
1DI0007004	Well, it's really not something to be afraid of, Penny, despite what some say. You do get bigger and stronger, but it doesn't really make you stupid.
1DI0007005	Well, Penny, despite the stories, it's not really something to be scared of. We all do it, assuming we don't get ourselves killed, first.
1DI0007006	Honestly, Sammy, I think you know more than me at this point! I've heard some of the stories about you out on those scavenging trips, you know.
1DI0007007	Well, I think at this point, you'd be better at teaching that than I would! Eclair says you're an even better sharpshooter than he was.
1DI0007008	People don't have the same sort of safety and freedom to run around and play like you can here. They have to work hard for food and safety.
1DI0007009	Out there, grown ups - or "mungos" as we call them - do all sorts of terrible things to each other, like when they kidnapped Penny and Sammy.
1DI0007010	Well, then why you do have to go to Big Town when you grow up?
1DI0007011	Then why don't we let people stay here when they grow up?
1DI0007012	So I'll just hit the basics: treat every gun as if it's loaded, never point a gun at someone you don't plan on killing, and keep your ammo dry.
1DI0007013	So just remember the basics: guns aren't toys for playing with. Only use them to shoot people you want to kill. Anything else is a waste of ammo.
1DI0007014	Well... Because having them stay means they start trying to make rules all the time, and no one's liked that. It's tradition. Understand, Penny?
1DI0007015	Well, when we grow up too big, we need to go outside, where there's more space. That's why we go to Big Town, where we meet again as grown-ups.
1DI0007016	Yes, teacher.
1DI0007017	I know, I know.
1DI0007018	Thank goodness we're safe in here. We've got food, water, and most importantly, we watch out for each other. Does that make sense, Bumble?
1DI0007019	Things outside are very dangerous indeed, and that's why we fight so hard to keep our Little Lamplight caverns safe and free. Understand, Bumble?
1DI0007021	I think so!
1DI0007022	Well, okay.
1DI0007023	I guess that makes sense.
1DI0007024	It's great, but Bumble's always trying to bug him when he's trying to teach me.
1DI0007025	She's just jealous because she doesn't have a brother anymore.
1DI0007026	Yeah. What I don't like's being bugged when I'm trying to learn.
1DI0007027	I hold open classes every morning for anyone who's got an interest in learning about a subject. Obviously, voluntary attendance is usually low.
1DI0007028	I wouldn't normally let someone like you sit in, but since you saved Penny's life, it's the least I can offer.
1DI0007029	Would you like to hear our history? It's something of a favorite.
1DI0007030	I hold open classes every morning for anyone who's got an interest in learning about a subject.
1DI0007031	Obviously, voluntary attendance is usually low, so I keep myself busy here and there.
1DI0007032	You're welcome to sit in, of course. Would you like to hear our history? It's something of a favorite with the students.
1DI0007033	I learned how to tie my shoes, and how to put out a fire, and how to put bullets into a gun!
1DI0007034	Once my hands get big enough to hold one, Joseph says he's gonna teach me how to shoot for real!
1DI0007035	Learning is fun!
1DI0007037	Right here. Welcome to our fungus pools. Eat up!
1DI0007038	Just take the tunnel south of here and go right. You'll find the fungus pool grottos.
1DI0007039	Take that tunnel north and when you hit the fork, go left. You'll find the fungus pools easy enough.
1DI0007040	It's to the west of the entrance. Look for the grotto with the pools and stuff.
1DI0007041	Yeah, that's me. I'm only on duties when I'm in the office.
1DI0007042	In here, but only when Lucy's in her office. Talk with her when she's on-duty.
1DI0007043	You know that office building near the entrance? When Lucy's at work in there, she's the one who patches us up.
1DI0007044	Whenever I'm at my treasure trove in the souvenir shop, I'll sell whatever you're looking for!
1DI0007045	Knick Knack's the one who's got the treasure trove of junk to sell. Ask him when he's in here.
1DI0007046	There's a souvenir shop just north of the entrance. That's where Knick Knack sells whatever else we can't use. Check there.
1DI0007047	You can only get there through Murder Pass, and we keep guards there to keep the little kids out.
1DI0007048	But if you want to have a look, it's north of the souvenir shop.
1DI0007049	Hey, Zip. I got a question about your last scav trip.
1DI0007050	Zip, can I ask you a question about last time you were out and about?
1DI0007051	What's the matter, Eclair? Something wrong? Something taste funny? I was pretty sure everything was clean, I really was!
1DI0007052	There a problem, Eclair? Everything's fine, right? We're not suddenly out of food, are we? I haven't been sneaking any snacks, I promise!
1DI0007053	No, calm down, pop-head. Things are just fine. I just couldn't help but notice you didn't bring back any meat, like I asked.
1DI0007054	Calm down, Zip. It's just that you didn't bring any kindling down for cook-fires. Only thing worse than fungus is cold fungus, know what I mean?
1DI0007055	Oh, damn! I knew I was forgetting something! Okay, it won't happen next time, I promise! I double promise! I super duper-
1DI0007056	Oh, man! I was gonna get some, but I got distracted! You know how I get distracted, right? I mean, it was just like when I found that all those rats-
1DI0007057	Yeah, fine, just remember next time, okay?
1DI0007058	Sure, whatever. Just don't get distracted next time, Zip.
1DI0007059	New kids don't tend to walk up every day. We haven't had very good luck with visitors recently.
1DI0007060	Anyway, I'm Stacey, and I guard the front gate. If you need in or out, I can take care of that.
1DI0007061	Only people who use that gate are strangers. And most strangers aren't welcome here.
1DI0007062	I'm Stacey, and I make sure strangers stay out. If the mayor hadn't let you in himself, I'd make sure you stayed out, too.
1DI0007063	You saved Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? I can see why RJ let you in! Thanks, for all of us!
1DI0007064	I'm Lucy, and I pretty much spend my days playing mommy around here. I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things better.
1DI0007065	If you get a scraped knee or stubbed toe, come see me. Same if you get shot in the face or burns all over, but I can only promise so much.
1DI0007066	Well, it's good that you're safe in here, now. The Wastes can be dangerous, although you look like you've done alright out there.
1DI0007067	I'm Lucy, and I'm the closest thing we've got to a doctor around here. If you get yourself into trouble, see if you can drag yourself back here.
1DI0007068	If you convinced RJ that you're safe, I guess I'll go along. But if you do start trouble, you'll regret it.
1DI0007069	I'm Lucy, the doctor here. That means I handle the funerals, too. So much as look at a kid the wrong way, and I'll be seeing you again.
1DI0007070	That was you? Well, my most sincere thanks, then. You brought my sister Penny back to me, and I couldn't ask more than that.
1DI0007071	I'm Joseph, and if there's ever anything I can do for you here, just name it!
1DI0007072	As the oldest kid in town, I spend most of my time teaching, but I do what I can to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
1DI0007073	Say, if you're ever looking for a haircut, I'd be glad to offer my services. You only have to ask!
1DI0007074	I'm Joseph, and around here, I might as well be the old wise man. Try not to interrupt my classes, and I think we'll get along just fine.
1DI0007076	If you're looking for a haircut, feel free to ask. I'll do what I can.
1DI0007077	Okay, either you're a dirty liar or you're some sort of freak.
1DI0007078	Either way, you should fit in just fine around here! Folks call me Eclair, and I'm in charge of keeping this place fed.
1DI0007079	You need a meal, you come ask me. There's not much to go around, and it all tastes bad, but it'll keep you alive, and that's good enough.
1DI0007080	Oh, great. Maybe next, he'll take in a Deathclaw or something. And he'll make it the town mascot.
1DI0007081	But anyway, yeah, thanks for bringing them back in one piece. Maybe now they'll learn to be more careful out there!
1DI0007082	If you need what passes for food down here, look me up. Name's Eclair, and if you so much as snicker, I'll carve you up for steaks.
1DI0007083	Oh, great. Maybe next, he'll take in a Deathclaw or something. He can make it the town mascot.
1DI0007084	Anyway, my name's Eclair, and yes, I take care of the food here. Don't expect any scraps from our table.
1DI0007085	It's nice to meet you, too. Did you come from the vault? I heard there's monsters down there.
1DI0007086	Eclair told me once, one of them, they got him and bit him right in the face and that's why he's only got one eye.
1DI0007087	But you don't look like a monster, and I don't think you'd bite anyone in the face. You look like a nice vault dweller.
1DI0007088	Did you live in the old vault below? I thought nobody lives down there now because it was full of monsters.
1DI0007089	Mayor doesn't let us go down there because when they went they didn't come back.
1DI0007090	You don't look like someone who didn't come back, so maybe you didn't come from there.
1DI0007091	Good! Glad we've got that settled. Stay out of my way, and there won't be any problems.
1DI0007092	Oh, you think Sammy and the rest wouldn't have gotten back on their own eventually? I taught him better than that.
1DI0007093	Well, if you're sticking around, you ought to know that I'm Princess, and I call the shots around here.
1DI0007094	And don't forget it, mungo!
1DI0007097	Oh, that was you? Nice work! I hope one of you grabbed some of their gear before you left - gotta make them pay for something like that.
1DI0007098	Speaking of which, I'm Knick Knack, and I take care of the general store around here.
1DI0007099	Which is to say, I collect a lot of stuff, and sometimes trade it for other stuff. That's pretty much a store, see?
1DI0007100	In that case, I'm Knick Knack, and I take care of the general store around here.
1DI0007102	Oh, was that you? Nice work! I hope you got some good laughs out of it before you left - gotta make sure they know not to try that again!
1DI0007103	Speaking of which, I'm Knock Knock, and I take care of the general morale around here.
1DI0007104	Which is to say, I collect a lot of stories, and sometimes trade them to keep the others amused. Morale's better than less-al, see?
1DI0007105	Always good to hear, but not even any fun trouble? Even a little?
1DI0007106	See, I collect a lot of stories, and sometimes trade them to keep the others amused. A bit of fun trouble is always good for morale.
1DI0007107	Morale's better than less-al, see?
1DI0007108	That's good, they don't like me having my gun in town, so I gotta turn it in first, so if I had to shoot you you'd have to wait a bit.
1DI0007109	My name's Zip. I don't think that's short for anything, because I don't know what it'd be short for. Zippy? Zipperick? Ziptholomew?
1DI0007110	So yeah, it's good to meet you, big kid, and maybe you've got big kid stuff from up top. Do you have any Nuka-Cola, maybe? Yes? Please?
1DI0007111	Oh, that's good because Mayor MacCready says I can't have my gun in town anymore, not since last time, but that was totally an accident anyway!
1DI0007112	That reminds me, got any Nuka-Cola? 'Cause if I'm not gonna have a gun in town, then it must be okay for me to have more Nuka, right?
1DI0007113	Anyway, everyone calls me Zip, you know, like a zipper, only not really like that because I'm not made of metal, but I do go up and down, I guess.
1DI0007114	Good. Better stay that way, mungo.
1DI0007115	It sure is! Nice work bringing them back.
1DI0007116	You didn't happen to bring anything else back, did you? Stories, jokes, lessons for the folks here?
1DI0007117	Speaking of which: I'm Knock Knock, and I keep people's spirits up down here. If you want to trade jokes, just knock knock on my door!
1DI0007118	Being a jerk about it isn't necessary. In fact, if you've got any interesting stories from up there, and you're looking to tell them, let me know.
1DI0007119	I'm Knock Knock, and I keep people's spirits up down here. If you want to trade jokes, just knock knock on my door!
1DI0007120	But wait, you don't even know who I am yet!
1DI0007121	Boo-hoo. You big baby.
1DI0007122	You're still a mungo, and I still don't like mungos.
1DI0007123	You want a party or something, you go pay some mungos to be your friends and they can all talk about how great you are. How's that?
1DI0007124	Just give it a shot, mungo. You'll see plenty of my adult-sized stones when I'm pissing on your grave.
1DI0007125	I don't threaten strangers - I shoot them. But since we're not strangers anymore, that's not a problem. Right?
1DI0007126	I'm Stacey, and I take care of the front gate. If you're going in or out, I'll take care of it.
1DI0007127	My name's not kid. It's Stacey. And I don't threaten strangers - just shoot them.
1DI0007128	Lucky thing you're not a stranger anymore. Least, not as long as MacCready says you aren't.
1DI0007129	You brought back Penny and Sammy and Squirrel? Well, I guess that does make you a pretty big hero. Thanks!
1DI0007130	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much the mom around here. And that means I spend a lot of time kissing boo-boos and making things all better.
1DI0007131	So, if you ever get any scrapes or bruises - or if you get shot, stabbed, or radiated - stop by and I'll do what I can, big hero.
1DI0007132	Well, if you brought them back, then I guess that explains why RJ let you in. So, I guess that does make you a big hero.
1DI0007133	I'm Lucy, and I'm pretty much mommy to the folks here. I try to keep them safe, and when that's not enough I patch up their cuts and bruises.
1DI0007134	And when that's not enough, I make sure they get a funeral. Thanks for making sure I didn't have to do that for three more of mine.
1DI0007135	Oh, is it? Well, I'm Lucy, and I'm the doctor in town. From the sound of it, I'll be seeing a lot of you. Or your work.
1DI0007136	That was you? Well, you brought my sister Penny back, so sure, I'll call you a big hero. Thank you very much.
1DI0007137	I'm Joseph, and as the oldest kid in Lamplight, I'm pretty much a teacher by default. I also try to keep the kids clean and fresh-faced.
1DI0007138	I'm not sure if there's anything I can teach you, but if you need a haircut or the like, just say the word. And thanks again.
1DI0007139	Well, if MacCready let you in, I'm sure he's got his reasons.
1DI0007140	I'm Joseph, and as the oldest kid in Lamplight, I'm pretty much a teacher by default.
1DI0007141	I'm not sure if there's anything I can teach you, but if you need a haircut or the like, just say the word.
1DI0007142	You got that right! After our regular meals, I bet some of us would give that a shot! If we had a brahmin down here, that is.
1DI0007143	Listen, my name's Eclair - don't laugh - and I'm in charge of the food down here. We haven't got much, but I do what I can to spice it up.
1DI0007144	If you need a meal down here, just talk with me. You'll hardly even know you're eating cave mold.
1DI0007145	Oh, really? So you're saying you brought back three more hungry mouths, too? Great, you're just making my day better and better!
1DI0007146	Look, I'm Eclair, and I'm in charge of the crap we call food down here. And we've got precious little enough to go around as it is.
1DI0007147	So, yeah, thanks for bringing those folks back alive, but don't expect me to throw you a big party over it.
1DI0007148	That's a shame. I was going to serve yours with extra lung butter.
1DI0007149	My name's Eclair, and I've dealt with bigger threats than you. So watch your step.
1DI0007150	Oh, okay. Bye.
1DI0007151	You don't look like a monster. Eclair says monsters are green or got all kinds of arms and you only got two and they're like mine.
1DI0007152	You just look like a mungo, and Knock Knock says they don't eat people unless they're lost and have to.
1DI0007153	Oh, you'll listen to me. Otherwise, I'll have my good pal RJ kick you out of the town. Or better yet, lock you in the vault.
1DI0007154	So don't push me, new meat. Just nod and move on and I think we'll get along just fine.
1DI0007155	Now listen up! I'm Princess, and I don't care what RJ says, when you're around me, I'm in charge.
1DI0007156	Give me any trouble, mungo, and I can get you kicked out of here in a flash. Or worse.
1DI0007157	It sure isn't bad! Nice work bringing them back.
1DI0007158	You didn't happen to bring anything else back, did you? Gear, equipment, bric-a-brac?
1DI0007159	Speaking of which: I'm Knick Knack, and I run the store down here. If you want to trade anything, come on by the Souvenir Store and we'll talk.
1DI0007160	You don't have to be a jerk about it. In fact, if you've got stuff from up above, and you're looking to get rid of some of it, let me know.
1DI0007161	I'm Knick Knack, and I run the store down here. If you want to trade anything, come on by the Souvenir Store and we'll talk.
1DI0007162	Okay, but only one serving. We've got too many mouths to feed already.
1DI0007163	Just the one scoop per day, pal. Too many mouths around here already.
1DI0007164	But at least that means you don't have to eat much of it, huh?
1DI0007165	You know it, Eclair. Keeping the masses fed?
1DI0007166	Ill have your finest mycelium, cubed and served in a savory sauce, Eclair.
1DI0007167	A plate of your excellently prepared mycorrhizae, Eclair!
1DI0007168	Food, please!
1DI0007169	Hey, Eclair! What do you call a mushroom that knows how to party?
1DI0007170	You know, Eclair, if I ever get a microwave oven, it's going right to you.
1DI0007171	Got any food for me today? Because I'm really in a hurry and I really don't have time to come back later so how about some food right now?
1DI0007172	May I have some food, please?
1DI0007173	Can I have mine without much dirt on it? I think I'm allergic.
1DI0007174	Hit me with some of that grub, fat man!
1DI0007175	Gimme some food!
1DI0007176	I'm hungry! Feed me!
1DI0007177	Now you're just making up words, aren't you? Here's your standard.
1DI0007178	So, cave fungus in sauce? Coming right up.
1DI0007179	Just like you're keeping them alive, Lucy. Here you go.
1DI0007180	Sure thing, dear.
1DI0007181	Nice try, but you're still getting the same muck as everyone else.
1DI0007182	Hell, I'd be happy with a clean set of spoons. Enjoy the meal.
1DI0007183	Yeah, yeah, I know. Here's your "fun-guy." Should be as good as your jokes.
1DI0007184	Yeah, yeah, I get it, Zip. Here, knock yourself out.
1DI0007185	Calm down, Zip. It's not getting any blander. Here.
1DI0007186	Sure thing, Penny.
1DI0007187	Toughen up, Squirrel. The dirt adds flavor.
1DI0007188	I can't believe you like this shit, RJ.
1DI0007190	Here. Now, get.
1DI0007191	With a mouth as foul as mine, your shitty cooking fits right in.
1DI0007192	Yeah, I'll bet you've heard all about the "fungus in my cavern."
1DI0007193	But yeah, the cave's fungus, sure. It's good for food and medicine, and it's the main fucking reason we've stayed alive down here.
1DI0007194	So, you want a slice of that gray-green gold, huh? I think maybe we could come to an arrangement. What're you offering?
1DI0007195	Well, it lighten the load for our scav team out a lot. And since you're pretty much one of us, here's the deal...
1DI0007196	For every piece of strange meat or Buffout you bring in, you'll be repaid with one cube of fungus. You couldn't ask for a better deal.
1DI0007197	Talk with Eclair for the strange meat, or to Lucy about the Buffout. They've got uses for them.
1DI0007198	That's not a terrible deal. And it'd mean more of those dumbasses can stay safely down here, instead of scavving all the time.
1DI0007199	Okay, for every two bits of strange meat or Buffout, I'll make sure you get a piece of fungus. Not too bad, huh?
1DI0007200	I'll spread the word to and Lucy and Eclair. They've got uses for them, so they'll make the trade, and we'll all be happy, okay?
1DI0007201	More stuff for us, and more chance of you getting shot, stumbling back here, choking on your own blood while we point and laugh? Sounds good.
1DI0007202	How about this: for every three pieces of strange meat or Buffout doses you bring in, you'll get one piece of fungus. Take it or leave it.
1DI0007203	Just talk to Lucy or Eclair about what they need, and stop bothering me about it.
1DI0007204	Sure, right. And we'll just trust you to bring us plenty of clean food and medicine, and not to try to poison us and move in on your own.
1DI0007205	No, no deal, mungo. This is our fungus, and we haven't got enough to share with freaks like you.
1DI0007206	Oh, is that how it's going to be, then? Well then, how's this deal?
1DI0007207	Rather than you wasting the explosives to try to close all of our exits, just for us to burrow out again, you get my private stash of fungus. Here.
1DI0007208	But I wouldn't expect much goodwill in town after this, you shit-sucking mungo bastard.
1DI0007209	Oh, what-the-fuck-ever. Come back when you can make a decision.
1DI0007210	Excellent. I should be able to synthesize the proteins from this into something that'll fight rickets. Here's your fungus in return.
1DI0007211	Oh great! The fungus pools'll gobble this right up!
1DI0007212	Well, since you're practically one of us, okay. I'll tell the folks to trade with you on a one-for-one basis. Deal?
1DI0007213	I guess we can afford it. After all, the stuff you bring has been a help, all right.
1DI0007214	How about a two-for-one deal? Every two chems, or meats, or whatever you bring them, they'll give you a bit of fungus. That should be plenty fair.
1DI0007219	We used to have two guards here. Me and an older girl named Caps.
1DI0007220	But since the last time Raiders attacked, it's just been me.
1DI0007221	I really miss Caps.
1DI0007222	Now I am, yeah. But I'm a good guard, and no one's getting by me, now.
1DI0007223	Yeah. Right now, we don't even have anyone to cover me when I'm asleep.
1DI0007224	Now leave me alone, I've got to be ready for duty soon.
1DI0007225	It's so dull! Practically nothing ever tries to come through the back gate anymore, so I never get to shoot anyone.
1DI0007226	I wish I was at the front gate, but RJ specifically put me back here. Up front, at least there's a chance I can shoot some unwanted visitors.
1DI0007227	Which could have included you, mungo.
1DI0007228	Well, technically, I'm patrolling and "keeping the peace."
1DI0007229	Mostly that involves making sure people are happy and not getting into trouble. You can't very well keep the peace if you've already lost it, see?
1DI0007230	So - bam! Jokes! Wanna hear one?
1DI0007231	No, because Princess always bosses me around and there's never nothing to gun.
1DI0007232	That's all I'm gonna say while she's around.
1DI0007234	She's always making fun of me just because she's angry all the time about her nickname and not being in charge and stuff.
1DI0007235	We don't use it much. We don't let many visitors in, and the scav teams usually use crawlspace exits to the surface, so they can't be followed.
1DI0007236	The only times this gate opens is when we've got big cargo to bring in or if we're letting in a mungo. Neither happens often.
1DI0007237	We usually use crawlspaces so mungos can't follow. This gate doesn't get used much, except letting in big cargo or mungos. Both are rare.
1DI0007238	We used to have two guards here, but we can make do with one, as long as I'm vigilant. We don't have much choice.
1DI0007239	You get used to it. Someone has to.
1DI0007240	Okay. Sit back, and I'll retell the history of our fine town to the entire class.
1DI0007241	Then, if you'll excuse me, I should get back to the rest of class.
1DI0007242	Long ago, children and grown-ups tried to live in peace.
1DI0007243	They protected us when we were young, and we helped them when they grew old, and the world was good. But it could never last.
1DI0007244	Three classes of us were on a field trip to the Lamplight Caverns when they destroyed the world. And some of them were trapped here with us.
1DI0007245	Some of the adults left for help. They never came back to us.
1DI0007246	Some of the adults were too clumsy for the caverns. They became bones in the rocks.
1DI0007247	Some of the adults stayed with us. They did terrible things.
1DI0007248	But we learned how to help ourselves, how to survive in the caves, and how to kill monsters. And then there were no adults left.
1DI0007249	Now, we're safe to play and enjoy the caverns, away from the world the mungos destroyed.
1DI0007250	And there's only one rule we have to follow: we have to leave before we become grown-ups. That way, we don't risk destroying our world like they did.
1DI0007251	It means we leave our friends behind, but we can meet again in the outside. And it means our home and friends stay safe in Little Lamplight.
1DI0007252	This is how Little Lamplight has survived since the war, and how we will survive until the world is rebuilt.
1DI0007253	Well, some of it's been around for a long time, back when we used to raid the old Vault.
1DI0007254	But that got too dangerous long before my time. Nowadays, it's just whatever the scavenging teams find and bring in.
1DI0007255	Well, they mostly focus on the essentials: food, medicine, ammo, and all that. And they travel light, fast, and stealthy, so they don't carry much.
1DI0007256	But sometimes they make a real find. Once, I remember they brought back a whole box of comics from some old shop. Still preserved in plastic, too!
1DI0007257	Those were some happy, happy days. Of course, they didn't last long around here, but they were made to be read and enjoyed, right?
1DI0007258	Well, it was long before my time, and nowadays the really useful stuff from it is all used by people in town.
1DI0007259	But I've heard stories about what was in there. Crazy technology and weird gas and all sorts of monsters.
1DI0007260	Thanks! Interested in making a trade?
1DI0007261	How would I know? The stories just talk about crazy things like supercomputers and magic boxes or whatever.
1DI0007262	Squirrel's the guy who knows technology. Heck, he's the closest to being able to go in there, anyway.
1DI0007263	I heard he once hacked the computer and took a peak inside the vault entrance before he chickened out and locked it up again.
1DI0007264	The big green mutants, of course. Don't you know? They breed down there! That's why we don't go in anymore!
1DI0007265	Long ago, they used to try to come up and take us away to eat, or whatever they do, but they learned it's not worth trying.
1DI0007266	We fight back hard, and now that we've got the back door barricaded, they haven't tried to come out for as long as I've been around.
1DI0007267	Probably. I don't think any of us have been in it for generations. Nowadays, we just keep it locked up tight.
1DI0007268	Prepare to be amused!
1DI0007269	Knock knock!
1DI0007270	Aw, come on. Knock knock!
1DI0007271	Noah!
1DI0007272	No it isn't. It's Noah!
1DI0007273	Noah place where I can get some food?
1DI0007275	Hey, that's good! I was just going to say, "Noah place where I can get some food?"
1DI0007276	Whoa, you really think so? Like, actually funny? Can you convince other folks to find them funny?
1DI0007277	Actually, most of our jokes are from an old book we found in the vault, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids."
1DI0007278	They're not really funny, but something about hearing them is a little comforting, you know?
1DI0007279	Gee, thanks! I have to admit, most of them aren't really funny. At least, not ha-ha funny.
1DI0007280	They're more like a tradition. Most of them were passed down from this book we found down back, called "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids".
1DI0007282	I know they aren't very funny. But that was a bit uncalled for.
1DI0007283	Most of them came from a book we found long ago in the vault, "Vault Boy's Big Book of Laughs for Kids."
1DI0007284	They're pretty dumb, but we all know them, and they're just kind of comforting. Sort of familiar, see?
1DI0007285	Oh, we've got lots of funny incidents. Like when Sammy shot the Raider who thought he was a girl, that sort of stuff.
1DI0007286	But we don't really get a lot of new stories from outside. The scav teams spend all their time hidden, so they don't get much news, see?
1DI0007287	I'd sure like to hear more tales from the great big outdoors, myself. Actually, if you hear any, feel free to tell me!
1DI0007288	That's only because you haven't heard all of the jokes from the book. Like this gem, "What's big, and red, and beats rocks?"
1DI0007289	"A big, red, rock-beater." Seriously.
1DI0007290	See? Now that's the dumbest thing you've ever heard!
1DI0007291	Hell, why not?
1DI0007293	Oh boy, tell me, tell me!
1DI0007294	Sure, get it over with.
1DI0007295	Might as well tell me.
1DI0007296	Make it quick, Knock Knock.
1DI0007298	Oh, really? Tell me all about it!
1DI0007299	Am I ever! Let's hear it!
1DI0007300	Like crazy! Spill, spill!
1DI0007301	Well, if you say so. But if you're ever looking for an audience, just let me know. I bet the town'd love to hear them, too!
1DI0007302	So, the main character of our story, their father left in the middle of the night. Now, they're wandering the Wastes, searching everywhere for him.
1DI0007303	So, our intrepid hero left a dull and boring life in their Vault, searching for fame and fortune in the wild Wasteland.
1DI0007304	So, there's this dread demon of the depths that arose from deep within the earth to scour the wasteland.
1DI0007305	So, you're like a three-legged dog, then?
1DI0007306	Looking for your lost paw?
1DI0007307	Hah! Anyway, what happened next?
1DI0007308	Wow... That's some crazy bad timing.
1DI0007309	I mean, that is to say, I'm real sorry to hear about your loss.
1DI0007310	So, what happens next?
1DI0007311	Inheriting the family business, huh? Congrats!
1DI0007312	I sure hope it works out! You'll let me know, right?
1DI0007313	<gulp> Oh boy... I can't wait.
1DI0007314	I sure hope so. Good luck!
1DI0007315	That makes sense, I suppose. A good story can take a while to put together, you know?
1DI0007316	Wow, that sounds like it took some guts.
1DI0007317	Life down here might get dull, but I gotta admit, at least I don't get shot at. Well, not as much, anyway.
1DI0007318	Tell me more! What's happened since then?
1DI0007319	They work for you? Wow, they must think you're the most important mungo in the Wastes!
1DI0007321	Enclave? Like the crazy man on the radio? I always knew there was something about that guy!
1DI0007322	Well, go kick his ass for us all! You'll let me know how it works out, right?
1DI0007323	Well, if you doom us all, who's going to hear about your story?
1DI0007324	But if you save us... then you'll definitely be remembered!
1DI0007325	Just keep that in mind, okay?
1DI0007326	You can't let us down now! We'll see you soon after it all, I just know it!
1DI0007327	A horror story, huh? So, are you here to terrorize evil, or is it a more generalized sort of terrorizing?
1DI0007328	I mean, you wouldn't do anything to hurt someone who was faithfully telling your tale, right? Would you?
1DI0007329	So... um... Whatever happens next, it's nothing bad to me, right?
1DI0007330	But we already provide you with plenty of amusement already, right?
1DI0007331	Like, enough so we don't have to end up as victims or anything?
1DI0007332	Maybe I shouldn't ask, but I have to know...Is there more to this story?
1DI0007333	I vote "save"? Please?
1DI0007334	So... does this story have a happy ending?
1DI0007335	Oh, come on! Please? I promise not to interrupt!
1DI0007336	Well, if you feel like telling me more, you know where to find me.
1DI0007337	Well, I gotta admit, the ending to a story's pretty important.
1DI0007338	Well, if you ever want to share it, I'm right here!
1DI0007339	Last I heard, he's still out there, wandering the Wastes. Who knows what we'll hear next about his story?
1DI0007340	Last I heard, she's still out there, wandering the Wastes. Who knows what we'll hear next about her story?
1DI0007341	After much searching, our protagonist finally found their lost father... but then he was attacked, and the father gave his life to save his child.
1DI0007342	In the course of his death-defying adventures, our hero amassed an army. They're called "The Brotherhood of Steel," and they rule the Wastes!
1DI0007343	They say the dread beast that walks like a survivor leaves behind a trail of corpses and desolation, and nothing can kill it!
1DI0007345	Oh, come on! It was just one joke!
1DI0007347	They say he still wanders the Wasteland now, and woe to anyone who stands in his way!
1DI0007348	They say she still wanders the Wasteland now, and woe to anyone who stands in her way!
1DI0007349	But now, at long last, the wanderer has found a way of completing their father's legacy and saving the wasteland!
1DI0007350	And now, our hero has turned their army towards fighting the grave threat of the nefarious Enclave, villains of the wasteland.
1DI0007351	And even now, the dread horror of the Wastes holds in their hands the power to save the wasteland or to destroy it utterly. Ooh, scary!
1DI0007352	Yeah, yeah, great story.
1DI0007353	Is that it? Thanks for wasting my time, Knock Knock.
1DI0007354	Wow! That's an awesome story!
1DI0007355	Well, at least that was better than one of your lame-ass jokes.
1DI0007356	Yowza!
1DI0007357	No way! That's awesome!
1DI0007358	Whoa. I can't wait to hear what happens next!
1DI0007359	Oh man, that's cool.
1DI0007360	Stacey! Open the gate, and let this mungo in!
1DI0007361	Why would I tell you anything? God, you're dumb.
1DI0007363	Nope. Nobody ever wrote it down, and then one day somebody forgot. You know how it goes.
1DI0007364	Hey, I am smart. Jerk.
1DI0007365	Okay. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone else you chickened out.
1DI0007366	Okay, if you say so...
1DI0007367	Come on. Let's go get the gate open for you, mungo.
1DI0007368	Yeah, I do. It's through Murder Pass. Not a real safe way to go, but it's the only door that works.
1DI0007369	Yeah, I do. But it's through Little Lamplight, and you're not getting into Little Lamplight. Guess you better find some other way, mungo.
1DI0007370	If you're going to go through Murder Pass, let me know and I'll have the door opened for you.
1DI0007371	But I still say it's a bad idea.
1DI0007372	It's the only way that works, yeah.
1DI0007373	The other door hasn't worked since before I was here. Computer's busted, and not even Joseph can make it work.
1DI0007374	Sure, if you want.
1DI0007375	Come on. It's over here.
1DI0007376	The big ones. You know, the ones that sort of look like people except they're all wrong.
1DI0007377	I'm the Mayor, not a babysitter, mungo. Beats me.
1DI0007378	Maybe he's back there by the door. Fuck if I know.
1DI0007379	Joseph, can I ask you a question?
1DI0007380	Joseph, can I get your help with something?
1DI0007381	Sure thing, Lucy. What do you need?
1DI0007382	Absolutely. What's the question?
1DI0007383	I've been seeing a few cases of bent bones and weak teeth in some of the younger ones. Any clue in those books about what it could be?
1DI0007384	Some of the younger kids have been having muscle weakness and are a little soft in the head. Is there anything in the old records about that?
1DI0007385	There's an old vault record that sounds similar. Apparently, if you don't eat enough, you get weakened by things called "rickets."
1DI0007386	Sounds like they aren't eating enough, but I can't really be sure. Most of the vault health books only care about "proper hygiene."
1DI0007387	Great, so they just need to eat more? I'm sure Eclair will be thrilled to hear that.
1DI0007388	Where are we going to get more food to feed them? We're practically starving as it is!
1DI0007389	We'll think of something. We always have. And they probably won't even realize how bad things were getting.
1DI0007390	It'll work out all right. We'll get the scav teams to bring back more food, soon.
1DI0007391	Thanks, Joseph. I think that's all I need.
1DI0007392	I guess you're right, Joseph. Thanks.
1DI0007393	Hold still, you big baby.
1DI0007394	The more you fidget, the more this is going to hurt, you know.
1DI0007395	How did you even get injuries like these?
1DI0007396	Oh, you're barely even scratched!
1DI0007397	Oh, what happened to you, dear?
1DI0007398	Poor kid, just be careful from now on, okay?
1DI0007399	Come here, I'll make it all better.
1DI0007400	Big brother, can I ask you something?
1DI0007401	Big brother, there's something I'd like to know.
1DI0007402	So, how's everything going, big, scary, mayor-man?
1DI0007403	So, been having a good time yelling at everyone, RJ? Standard life of a mayor?
1DI0007404	Any time, dear. What's wrong?
1DI0007405	Certainly! What's on your mind?
1DI0007406	Well, we ain't all dead yet, so I guess I'm doing okay. You haven't killed anybody lately either, so that's good too.
1DI0007407	No one's on fire or bleeding or anything, right? That's about as much as we can fucking expect. How about you?
1DI0007408	What's going to happen when you get too old and have to leave Lamplight?
1DI0007409	You're the oldest kid in Lamplight. What's going to happen when you have to leave?
1DI0007410	I'm still seeing the same sorts of cases. Stubbed toes, bloody noses, a few stabbings. We could really use more medicine, though.
1DI0007411	Things are okay on my end, but I'm still worried about some of the younger ones. We really need more medicine for some of them.
1DI0007412	I remember asking Flash the same thing when I was your age. He said he was going to Big Town, and I'd see him again when I grew up and left, myself.
1DI0007413	Well, when Lamplighters get older, we move out to Big Town. It's a happy place, where we aren't making the mistakes other grown ups have made.
1DI0007414	I've got the scav team looking for that, but Eclair's after me for more food and Joseph wants more fucking books, so they're pretty busy.
1DI0007415	We're working on it, Lucy, we really fucking are. More than Eclair's food and Joseph's precious books, at least. Just keep 'em from dirting out.
1DI0007416	And when the time comes, you'll grow up and leave Lamplight and meet me in Big Town, too. It won't be that long, I promise.
1DI0007417	And when I grow up, I can come join you there, too!
1DI0007418	Sure, fine.
1DI0007419	Well, if you say so.
1DI0007420	But I still hope you don't have to leave too soon, okay?
1DI0007421	I can't wait to be in Big Town with you. But until then, let's stay here, okay?
1DI0007422	Absolutely, little sister.
1DI0007425	You're all right for a mungo, you know that?
1DI0007426	Why don't you come in. I think we can trust you.
1DI0007428	You're pretty funny for a mungo.
1DI0007429	Why don't you come on in?
1DI0007433	Hell no! No mungos allowed!
1DI0007434	I already told you no. Stop asking!
1DI0007435	Oh yeah?
1DI0007436	You must like having such a good looking butt.
1DI0007437	Well, okay. But you better not be lying, or else we'll shoot you.
1DI0007439	Yeah, whatever.
1DI0007440	Why should I trust you? I got no reason to.
1DI0007441	You mungos are nothing but trouble. I ain't gonna let what happened to Sammy and Squirrel happen to anyone else.
1DI0007442	You'd do that?
1DI0007443	Maybe... If you can bring them back, I might let you in.
1DI0007444	Oh yeah? Well why didn't you say so, you stupid mungo?
1DI0007445	I guess you're okay after all, mungo.
1DI0007446	You can come in, but you better not piss me off.
1DI0007447	Them and Penny got themselves caught... By mungos, just like you. Slavers from Paradise Falls.
1DI0007448	I told them to watch out, but the stupid kids didn't listen.
1DI0007449	This is Little Lamplight. We live here, and we don't need no mungos messing it up. So just take a hike.
1DI0007450	You are, mungo!
1DI0007451	You big people. You're all tall and clumsy. Bunch of mungos, and we don't need nothing to do with any of you!
1DI0007452	Yes, sir. Food's running low, but we're scraping by, RJ. We could use more supplies from the outside, especially if you want something with a flavor.
1DI0007453	Nothing much, RJ. One nearly lost an eye - said they thought it would look cool. I patched him up and smacked him on the head for being an idiot.
1DI0007454	Stalacti... er, I mean... All's well around town, sir! No funny business! Except for me, of course.
1DI0007455	Nothing much you'd be interested in. Still doing a brisk trade in some of the toys, though!
1DI0007456	Going well, when there's anyone attending them. Basic survival and shooting lessons are good as always. Haven't lost any of them yet!
1DI0007457	Everything's okay out back, Mayor. Same as ever.
1DI0007458	All's clear on the back gate, RJ. No trouble, no action, no nothing. Most incredibly fucking boring job ever.
1DI0007459	I'll get the scav team on it. Maybe they can get you some fucking cheese to go along with your whine.
1DI0007460	That's my best girl! Keep them alive and keep them in line!
1DI0007461	Yeah, Knock, and you hardly count as that. Keep it up!
1DI0007462	Okay, well if someone brings you a big, fuck-off death-ray, I call dibs, understand?
1DI0007463	Well, keep it up, Joseph. And don't worry, if you lose any, I'm sure Eclair won't mind having one fewer damned mouth to feed.
1DI0007464	Could you at least try to stay awake next time you're on watch?
1DI0007465	Really? Would you rather scrape fungus with Eclair? And watch the goddamned language around Sammy, okay, shiteater?
1DI0007466	Hey, down there!
1DI0007467	Hey, Princess, stop thinking about how dreamy I am and pay attention to guarding!
1DI0007468	Well, I could call you a shithead, but then all these other shitheads wouldn't know which shithead I was talking to. Shithead.
1DI0007469	So it looks like you're stuck with mungo, mungo.
1DI0007470	It means an adult. We don't really see many of you around, and we're glad of it.
1DI0007471	I mean, you brought back the little ones, so you're okay. But mostly, we only ever see raiders and people who want to take our caves.
1DI0007472	If you didn't have MacCready's permission, you'd probably be shot just for being in here. We don't take any more chances.
1DI0007473	I'm pretty sure it comes from "humongous." Because, to everyone here, you're pretty big, you know?
1DI0007474	Mungos been pretty bad to Lamplighters, for as long as our history goes back. They just don't trust anyone over sixteen.
1DI0007475	Really, you're pretty lucky they let you in at all. I just hope I get to visit like you do after I get kicked out.
1DI0007476	Stop calling me kid, mungo.
1DI0007477	Well, I didn't get the nickname for being fat and full of cream, if that's what you're asking.
1DI0007478	Back when I was on the scav team, I found some pages from an old cook book. Sometimes I try them out.
1DI0007479	Just for the record, don't try making an eclair out of cave fungus. The taste sticks with you, and not in a good way.
1DI0007480	It's just a name, okay?
1DI0007481	Not my fault I knock stuff over.
1DI0007482	Lucy says I still got a lot of growing to do.
1DI0007483	I don't need to explain myself to you, mungo. Shut up and get lost.
1DI0007484	In fact, don't you ever bother me about something as stupid as nicknames again!
1DI0007485	Well, my name was Nick. And I collect knick knacks.
1DI0007486	Not everything has to be real complex, see?
1DI0007487	Well, when people started calling Knicky by his new name, I needed one too, see?
1DI0007488	If you're twins, it just doesn't cut it to be called "Knick Knack and Sue."
1DI0007489	Why Zip? Or why do I have a nickname at all? I mean, why don't people just call me Ricky? Or Yancy? Or Eustace P. Vanderbanger the Third?
1DI0007490	I mean, they say it's because I'm so fast, but that doesn't make sense because I don't think I'm all that fast, it's just that they're all so slow!
1DI0007491	I guess it's just one of those mysteries that'll never really get answered, sort of like how people made the bubbles in Nuka-Cola. Say, got any Cola?
1DI0007492	It's not a nickname! My name's Penelope.
1DI0007493	They're just lazy and don't like saying the whole thing is all.
1DI0007494	I like to think it's because of my inquisitive and charming nature, as well as my natural climbing ability.
1DI0007495	But Knock Knock says it's because I'm totally nuts.
1DI0007496	Guess which one's probably right?
1DI0007497	Nickname? What awe you tawking about?
1DI0007498	Get out of here, dummy!
1DI0007499	Damnit, Lucy! Leave me alone!
1DI0007500	Get out of here, you jerk!
1DI0007501	Shut up before I pound you!
1DI0007502	Among other reasons, I'm not a mean bitch like you. No, I'm a mean bastard! There's a difference!
1DI0007503	Whoops, didn't mean to bug you, Miss Pwincess. Sowwy.
1DI0007504	Didn't mean to bother you, Princess.
1DI0007505	Sorry, Princess. Don't hurt me!
1DI0007507	I guess I got lots of reasons. I mean, I'm alive, and we've got food and shelter, and I found this awesome rock yesterday!
1DI0007508	Because I know if you keep on bullying people, I can always pee on your cave fungus and you'll never know.
1DI0007509	Sorry, Miss Princess. Please don't get angry at me, okay?
1DI0007510	Oh, probably because MacCready likes me more than he likes you. That seems like a good reason to me!
1DI0007511	Why? Because I'm the Princess of Little Lamplight?
1DI0007512	So, a long time ago, Princess convinced everyone that she should be mayor.
1DI0007513	The first thing she did as mayor was try to insist that the title be changed to "Princess".
1DI0007514	It was 5 minutes before MacCready punched her in the nose and got picked as the new mayor. It was awesome!
1DI0007518	No. We'll see how I feel about it tomorrow, huh?
1DI0007519	Yeah! MacCready said we needed someone to watch out for us, not to lord over us. Then he popped her one! She hasn't even tried since then.
1DI0007520	That's why he stays mayor, too. I hope I can be that cool, someday.
1DI0007521	Shut up! Soon as I figure out who told you, someone's getting pounded into the ground.
1DI0007522	That was a long time ago, anyway!
1DI0007523	No way. I think she's got a crush on him. She's all weird for him.
1DI0007524	Oh yeah? Well that was a long time ago! Now RJ's my best friend!
1DI0007525	Someday, we're gonna be boyfriend and girlfriend, and then he'll kick you out!
1DI0007526	Thanks. Maybe you can take her down a peg, huh?
1DI0007527	That's right! Run away, coward!
1DI0007528	Oh, sure, like I should believe you. Why are you even wasting your time over here?
1DI0007529	Scram, get out of my face, go!
1DI0007530	That's not true! You're a liar! Shut your stupid face, liar!
1DI0007531	I know RJ likes me! He really does! Really!
1DI0007532	Just leave me alone, you mungo jerk! I hate you!
1DI0007533	That isn't so! Stop lying! Stop being such a big mungo liar!
1DI0007534	This isn't fair! A big mean mungo picking on me! I hate you!
1DI0007535	You... You jerk! Just shut up and leave me alone! Go away!
1DI0007536	That isn't so! I just... didn't want to do it anymore, and...
1DI0007537	Just shut up! This isn't fair! A big, mean mungo is picking on me! I hate you!
1DI0007538	Just leave me alone! Go away! Go!
1DI0007539	This bunch of idiots don't deserve me leading them!
1DI0007540	They wouldn't know a real boss if one shot them in the ass!
1DI0007541	Could've been a lot of reasons. Maybe you sounded like a monster in all that darkness.
1DI0007542	Maybe you had a weapon drawn, and looked like a Raider.
1DI0007543	Maybe I just decided I didn't like your stupid, mungo face.
1DI0007544	Oh, really? That's a cute little imagination you've got.
1DI0007545	But if you want to play make-believe, maybe you should do it with the younger brats.
1DI0007546	Ha ha! Now, scram!
1DI0007547	Yeah, run along and cry now!
1DI0007548	Oh hey! How're you doing? Doing okay?
1DI0007549	Hello. How are you doing?
1DI0007550	Hello. How's it going?
1DI0007551	Hey there! You doing alright?
1DI0007552	Hey! How's Lamplight life treating you?
1DI0007553	Heya. Are you feeling alright? You look a little stiff.
1DI0007554	Hello, there. Are you okay?
1DI0007555	Hey. How you doing?
1DI0007556	Hello. How are you?
1DI0007557	Hrmf. What're you so happy about?
1DI0007558	Beat it, squirt.
1DI0007559	How do, pal?
1DI0007560	How do ya do, pal?
1DI0007561	Hewwo. How're you?
1DI0007562	Hey, how are you?
1DI0007563	Meh.
1DI0007564	Busy, like always. Somebody's always got a tummy ache or a runny nose or a knife wound. You know how it is.
1DI0007565	I'm fine. It's another fine day, underground.
1DI0007566	Doing good. I could do with better food, but couldn't we all?
1DI0007567	I'm fine, thanks!
1DI0007568	What do you think? Get out of my face!
1DI0007569	Doing better than a dog in a bone-yard!
1DI0007570	Happier than a Ghoul wallowing in sludge!
1DI0007571	Just fine! Been all over today, and you wouldn't believe the cool stuff I did!
1DI0007572	It's always nicer to be in here than out there.
1DI0007573	I'm fine.
1DI0007574	I think I'm catching a cough. But I'll be fine.
1DI0007575	Oh, not yet I'm not.
1DI0007576	We're in the best fucking place in the world! You better believe I feel great!
1DI0007577	I'm okay!
1DI0007578	I'm okay.
1DI0007579	Hee hee! Okay, later then!
1DI0007580	Okay. See you later, and don't get too bashed up.
1DI0007581	I understand. Well, take care.
1DI0007582	I hear that. Anyway, gotta be on my way. Later.
1DI0007583	Oh, okay. Umm, bye!
1DI0007584	Okay, whatever you say. Bye.
1DI0007585	All right then! See ya!
1DI0007586	Okay, then! See ya!
1DI0007587	Umm... Okay, yeah, bye bye now!
1DI0007588	That makes sense. Talk to you later.
1DI0007589	Fine. Bye now.
1DI0007590	Yeah, I see. Catch you later, I guess.
1DI0007591	Yeah, yeah, fine. Catch ya later.
1DI0007592	'Kay, bye.
1DI0007593	Okay. Bye.
1DI0007594	He's not your uncle, Bumble!
1DI0007596	You bet we are!
1DI0007597	What he said!
1DI0007598	We're staying!
1DI0007599	Oh boy! New junk to tinker with!
1DI0007600	Sure, let me see that thing!
1DI0007601	Here's food, Princess.
1DI0007602	Here, happy?
1DI0007603	Really? Because I heard from the mayor about the sorts of deals you make when you trade. None for you.
1DI0007604	Sure thing, pal! Special deals for us kids!
1DI0007605	I hope you brought me some cool stuff!
1DI0007606	Yeah, I heard about the sorts of things you'd do for this fungus. Well, you're cut off. Go scrounge your own food.
1DI0007607	Bon appetit.
1DI0007608	Sure thing, mungo. We don't have much to spare, so get ready to pay.
1DI0007609	Enjoy, if you've got the caps.
1DI0007610	All right. Now, hold still.
1DI0007611	Certainly. How would you like to look?
1DI0007612	Thank you, miss! We're going on an adventure!
1DI0007613	You bet we are! Are you ready to go on the adventure express?
1DI0007614	Oh boy! Let's go now! Can we please?
1DI0007615	Absolutely! In fact, I want you to have this friendship necklace. It's good luck - wear it and you'll never get lost!
1DI0007616	Ow, it's all scratchy!
1DI0007617	Don't fuss, my little girl. You'll get used to it.
1DI0007618	Well... Okay. I can't wait to tell Lucy about this adventure!
1DI0007619	I'm sure she'll be so proud of you! Now, we've got a big day ahead of us, so let's get going!
1DI0007620	Caps used to take care of me. I would find hats for her collection. That's why she was called "Caps", right?
1DI0007621	Before long, I was guarding the front gate with her. She liked the company. She liked the jokes I used to make. I think she liked me.
1DI0007622	When the Raiders attacked last time... She didn't make it.
1DI0007623	There... there used to be another guard. She was named Caps.
1DI0007624	She used to take care of me. She liked my company guarding. She liked when I used to tell jokes.
1DI0007625	Then, some Raiders attacked. And I was the only guard left.
1DI0007626	Except... I was supposed to be on guard when they attacked. I should have been here to help Caps.
1DI0007627	It really is my fault she died.
1DI0007628	Now I'm the only front gate guard, so it's my responsibility to make up for that.
1DI0007629	No. Not anymore, they don't.
1DI0007630	Now, stop distracting me from my job.
1DI0007631	Somebody needs to guard the front gate, and no one else is doing it. So I will. Even if it sucks for me, I don't mind.
1DI0007632	Some things just have to be done, and they just have to be done right. Because if they aren't, you can't ever get back what you lose.
1DI0007633	Besides, Caps would want it like that.
1DI0007634	I know. And really, we're lucky we didn't lose more people in that attack.
1DI0007635	But we can't risk that a second time. I've got to stay extra vigilant on watch. Thanks for reminding me of that.
1DI0007636	Now leave me alone. No distractions!
1DI0007637	A is for Ammo, B is for Blade, and C is for Cauterize...
1DI0007638	Clean water is rare, and most water carries germs and radiation. As a result, it's usually healthier to stay dirty.
1DI0007639	Remember, never trust anybody over the age of 16.
1DI0007640	Little Lamplight only has one law: you have to leave when you grow up. No delays, no exceptions.
1DI0007641	When scavenging in the wild, remember to trust no one and to keep your pistol handy!
1DI0007642	Remember this simple rhyme: "When in danger or in doubt, shoot to kill and then run out."
1DI0007643	Did I make a bunch of really lame jokes?
1DI0007644	Yeah, that'd be my twin sister, Knock Knock. I'm Knick Knack. I got my nickname first, and she copied it.
1DI0007645	Anyway, I run the town store. Or at least the pile of stuff that we've collected. If you're ever looking to trade, just ask.
1DI0007646	Was I all obsessed with stuff and toys?
1DI0007647	Yeah, that'd be my twin brother, Knick Knack. I'm Knock Knock. He got the nickname first, and I improved on it.
1DI0007648	Anyway, I keep folks entertained. Or at least, I tell them the jokes and stories we've got. If you're ever looking to laugh, just ask!
1DI0007649	So, sis, make any good jokes today?
1DI0007650	So, bro, made any good trades today?
1DI0007651	Do I ever? How about you? Made any good trades today?
1DI0007652	Not if I could help it! Made any good trades today?
1DI0007653	Nothing much. One of the littler kids had a rock Zip said looked dirty, but he barely even knows what is and isn't dirty in the first place, see?
1DI0007654	Nah. Zip kept asking if I have any Nuka-Cola hidden anywhere, so I told him I kept a six pack hidden near a magic rock. He'll be busy for weeks, see?
1DI0007655	That's hysterical! Zip was running around, checking every rock he found all day!
1DI0007656	Oh man, and just yesterday I got him to believe one of the rocks out back granted wishes! I guess we make a good team, even when we didn't mean to!
1DI0007657	You better believe it, sis! Later!
1DI0007658	Great stuff! Talk with you later, sis!
1DI0007659	I suwe did! Five hundwed caps, and this Wazer Wifle's aww youws!
1DI0007660	That's a gweat idea! You take it, and good wuck out thewe!
1DI0007661	That's not a wot, but okay. Bye now!
1DI0007662	Thanks a wot! Bye now!
1DI0007663	Then you'we not getting it. Sowwy!
1DI0007664	Okay, it's youw woss!
1DI0007665	Tawking wike what? You'we weiwd.
1DI0007666	What's up, pal?
1DI0007667	What's happening, pal?
1DI0007668	Hewwo. What's up?
1DI0007669	Hello, there. What're you up to? Not getting into too much trouble?
1DI0007670	Hello. What's happening today?
1DI0007671	What're you up to, today?
1DI0007672	Hello. What's happening?
1DI0007673	Hrmf. What have you got to be happy about?
1DI0007674	Oh hey! What's happening? Something fun?
1DI0007675	Hello. Anything interesting happening?
1DI0007676	Hello. What's up?
1DI0007677	Hey, what's happening?
1DI0007678	Everything fine down here in paradise? What's happening?
1DI0007679	Hey, what's up?
1DI0007680	You know, the usual.
1DI0007681	Not much, I guess. Apart from keeping you dumbasses in line, that is.
1DI0007682	Evewything's a-okay!
1DI0007683	Just talking to morons who keep bugging me. Scram!
1DI0007684	Fun times and laughs as always!
1DI0007685	Cool junk and collecting, as always!
1DI0007686	I was running so fast, I thought my legs were gonna fly off, but then they didn't, which makes sense, 'cause legs don't have wings. You know?
1DI0007687	Just relaxing. Nothing much.
1DI0007689	Just playing around, you know?
1DI0007690	Keeping everyone from killing themselves. Same as ever.
1DI0007691	Watching after the younger kids and seeing if they can't accidentally learn a thing or two. You know how it goes.
1DI0007692	Not much. Still trying to find a way to turn this fungus into something that doesn't taste like toenails.
1DI0007693	I got a new tooth today! It was just lying there and now it's mine!
1DI0007694	Not much.
1DI0007695	Yeah, and I got lots to trade. But if you got no Nuka, you're not getting nothing, no way!
1DI0007696	Yeah, more Nuka's always good! It's definitely always gooder than less, because no Nuka's no good at all! Got any Nuka for me?
1DI0007697	I'll trade you whatever I've got for more Nuka-Cola! Anytime! Nuka 4 Zip! Nuka 4 Zip!
1DI0007698	That's all I got right now. Come back tomorrow, maybe I'll have more, and you can have more Nuka for me to have more Nuka? Yeah?
1DI0007699	I did yesterday, I am today, and I probably will be tomorrow! Well, unless I die from too much Nuka. But that can't happen. Everyone knows that!
1DI0007700	Oh, I found a lucky bullet this morning!
1DI0007701	It's just a measly old 10 mil, but I know for sure it's lucky, 'cause it was sitting there all alone out of its clip and not fired off. Want it?
1DI0007702	I got an old mag full of .556s! Is that good enough for you?
1DI0007703	Last time I was out looking, I found some of this mutfruit. It's not as sweet as Nuka, but maybe you mungos like that sort of thing?
1DI0007704	Well, I've got these pills that say "Mentats", but Lucy says they taste yucky and that I shouldn't take them. Maybe you want them?
1DI0007705	Well, I didn't want to trade it, but I've got a stimpak Lucy said I'm supposed to carry around with me. Is it worth a Nuka?
1DI0007706	Oh, check this out, it's my most, most prized possession I found! Squirrel says it's a micro fusion cell. Is it worth a Nuka?
1DI0007707	But Nuka-Cola's fortified with vitaminerals and health tonics! It even says so on the label! That means it's healthy for me!
1DI0007708	Thanks! Nuka for me!
1DI0007709	Hooray! I win the Nuka-Cola game! What's the prize? Nuka-Cola!
1DI0007710	Yay! Nuka-Cola, Nuka-Cola, makes a stomach bubbly and the world so jumbly, yay!
1DI0007711	Maybe I'll have something better tomorrow, so don't drink that Nuka. Save it for me, save it for me!
1DI0007712	Everyone calls me Zip, and I think that's because I'm always wearing pants, and those have zippers, but it's not like I'm the only one with pants.
1DI0007713	Once I found a bottle of Nuka-Cola Quantum and I drank the whole thing and then I burped really loud and then I don't remember the next week!
1DI0007714	I heard that inside those suits the Brotherhood of Steelies are actually giant cockroaches that learned to build machines and talk and shoot guns!
1DI0007715	I heard that Super Mutants turned into Super Mutants because they were just Ghouls who got bit by ants and had some kinda allergic reaction!
1DI0007716	Chicken butt! I learned that one from Knock Knock! Isn't it great?
1DI0007717	Did you know once I put gunpowder in Nuka-Cola and it tasted kinda funny but everything went swirly and then I flew around and then I don't remember?
1DI0007718	One time I found a gun that shot laser beams but Mayor MacCready took it away from me because I might put out someone's eye and Eclair'd be angry.
1DI0007719	Okay, that's about everything, bye now!
1DI0007720	Oh, I don't know if I told you yet, but I just remembered something really cool!
1DI0007721	And guess what?
1DI0007722	Our supplies are running out and we've already sustained a casualty. We're trapped on the roof level of the Statesman Hotel.
1DI0007723	We're trapped on the roof of the Statesman Hotel by a large contingent of Super Mutants. We are low on ammo and running out of time.
1DI0007724	Our time is running out and we are dangerously low on ammunition. Our broadcast point is the roof of the Statesman Hotel.
1DI0007725	Ammunition supply is running out and we've lost a man. We're pinned down on the roof of the Statesman Hotel by Super Mutants.
1DI0007726	If assistance is not possible, please attempt to contact Reilly, who's made for Underworld inside the Museum of History.
1DI0007727	Okay, tough guy. Say what's on your mind.
1DI0007728	Well now, looks like she's got some spice. Say what's on your mind.
1DI0007729	[sighs] I suppose. Just make it quick.
1DI0007730	And a hello to you, lass.
1DI0007731	And a hello to you, lad.
1DI0007732	Yeah, yeah...
1DI0007733	Hello to you.
1DI0007734	Hello, my child.
1DI0007735	Mmmmhmmm... that's nice.
1DI0007736	Go bother someone else, please. I'm busy.
1DI0007737	<grumbles>
1DI0007738	Get the fuck out of my face.
1DI0007740	Fuck you.
1DI0007741	Howdy.
1DI0007743	Hello, Mother Maya.
1DI0007744	Hello there, honey.
1DI0007745	Hello, Confessor.
1DI0007747	Billy says I shouldn't be talking to you.
1DI0007748	Uhm... hi?
1DI0007749	Good evening.
1DI0007750	Evening.
1DI0007751	Good morning.
1DI0007752	Morning.
1DI0007753	Yeah, yeah.
1DI0007754	Not so close. Keep walkin'.
1DI0007756	Hi.
1DI0007759	Oh! Hi!
1DI0007760	What's up?
1DI0007761	Look, I told you people: I'm busy. Leave me alone.
1DI0007762	Look, I'm a little busy...
1DI0007763	Not bad... not bad...
1DI0007764	Been better.
1DI0007765	Can't complain.
1DI0007766	Is there anything interesting going on around here?
1DI0007767	A cap for your thoughts.
1DI0007768	Anything been going on with you?
1DI0007769	You look like you have something on your mind.
1DI0007770	What are you thinking?
1DI0007771	So, what's up?
1DI0007772	You get around, right? What have you heard?
1DI0007773	You know, there has to be something going on around here.
1DI0007774	Something on your mind?
1DI0007775	What's been going on?
1DI0007776	Hey. How's it going?
1DI0007777	Have you heard what everyone's saying? There's not enough water to go around this month. We'll have to ration... again.
1DI0007778	I don't like to spread rumors, but I heard Mister Burke is really interested in the bomb. Really interested. Like... he wants to buy it or something.
1DI0007779	I heard the sheriff talking about defusing the bomb. I don't know. The damn thing's been sitting there so long it's probably harmless. Right?
1DI0007780	Stockholm says he saw some more Raiders, off to the east. Good thing for us there's nothing in Megaton worth raiding.
1DI0007781	You ever see a Yao Guai? Boy, those things are nasty.
1DI0007782	Leo Stahl.. you know. He's a junkie, a total chem head. He sells the stuff, too. Late at night, in the processing plant.
1DI0007783	Sometimes that Deputy Steel makes me nervous. Simms and his boy, they treat him like a person. But it's just a machine, and machines can malfunction.
1DI0007784	Megaton needs a stronger defense force. Okay, there's Simms and Steel, and the town militia, but half of us can't even aim straight.      
1DI0007785	It's probably not my place, but... I think the sheriff should find himself a new wife. He needs some companionship, and his boy needs a mother.
1DI0007786	Those guys from the church drink the water near the bomb because they WANT to. Believes it makes them "closer to Atom" or something. Idiots.
1DI0007787	You know, I'm getting a little sick of living in the slums. They promised me that after a few months I could move into the town.
1DI0007788	I don't think that I'm ever going to be able to get a house here. I've asked Simms a dozen times and he keeps saying the same thing.
1DI0007789	Did you hear that sound last night? It sounded like... I don't know... some sort of motor, but it was coming from the sky!
1DI0007790	Have you ever talked to that Jericho guy? Man, what an asshole.
1DI0007791	Jenny Stahl seems okay but her brothers... whew. One's a workaholic, and the other one is just flat out crazy. What a family.
1DI0007792	Did you see Leo Stahl sneak up to the water processing plant last night? What does he do up there? And why does Walter let him in?
1DI0007793	I heard that there are Raiders gathering to the west. Do you think they're planning an attack?
1DI0007794	You asked where the parts came from to build the town? I heard that there used to be an air station somewhere around here before the war.
1DI0007795	You should talk to the older folks about what Megaton was like before they built the walls. You think it's dangerous now?
1DI0007796	I was rooting around in Springvale the other day and guess what I found: a book! An actual book! Can you believe it?
1DI0007797	Do you ever question the wisdom in hanging around an atomic bomb all day? I mean, if it was going to blow, it probably would have by now. But still.
1DI0007798	God, that Jericho guy gives me the creeps. He's such a nutjob.
1DI0007799	I swear to God, if Nathan starts babbling about the Enclave to me one more time... everyone knows that the Enclave is just a story for kids.
1DI0007800	Nathan and his damn Enclave, I tell you... What, does he think, that George Washington is going to ride out of the Wasteland to save everyone?
1DI0007801	You ever hear of the Enclave? Nathan tells me that they'll be riding in here any day to help us...
1DI0007802	Did you hear about the Enclave? Nathan said they're really the U.S. government. He says that they're coming to help us.
1DI0007803	Walter sure is a grumpy old bastard. But he keeps that crusty old plant running, so I guess we have no choice but to put up with him.
1DI0007804	Busted up my knee the other day, so I went to see Doc Church. He needs to work on his bedside manner -- my own mother never chewed me out like that!
1DI0007805	I swear to God, Moira's crazy. She sold me this thing the other day, I didn't even know what the hell it was. Damn good saleswoman though. Damn good.
1DI0007806	What is with those Church of the Atom lunatics anyway? They're all fucked in the head... drinking the bomb water, praying for another war?
1DI0007807	Did you hear about Nathan? Yeah, he went and got himself killed. Manya is beside herself.
1DI0007808	Nathan just hasn't been the same since Manya died. He refuses to leave the house!
1DI0007809	Manya and Nathan are both gone... what's happening around here?
1DI0007810	Ever since Sheriff Simms died, this place hasn't been the same. There's a fight nearly every night up at Moriarty's!
1DI0007811	Have you been to the Brass Lantern lately? That place is like a funeral home since Jenny died.
1DI0007812	The Stahl family is still mourning Leo. Nice kid, but I hear that he was mixed up in some bad shit.
1DI0007813	Did you hear that the Stahls lost their older brother? He kept that place running, you know. It'll probably fall apart without him.
1DI0007814	What do you suppose will happen to the Brass Lantern? With the whole family dead, someone's sure to buy it up.
1DI0007815	You know what I miss most? Jenny's noodles. And she was such a sweet girl.
1DI0007816	It's about time that someone gave that bastard Moriarty what he deserved, but I can't believe he left the bar to Gob!
1DI0007817	Jericho was an asshole, but he helped keep this place safe. I'm worried about what'll happen if the Raiders attack now...
1DI0007818	Did you hear about Lucy? Shame... she died before anyone ever got to know her.
1DI0007819	God damn, I can't believe that someone killed Moira. Some people will do anything to survive out here, won't they?
1DI0007820	With Walter dead, we're screwed. No one else can keep that treatment plant running.
1DI0007821	Sorry, not now.
1DI0007822	Can't talk now.
1DI0007823	We'll catch up later.
1DI0007824	I hear what you're saying.
1DI0007825	Seriously.
1DI0007826	Yeah, I know.
1DI0007827	I wish you were joking.
1DI0007828	Nothing about this place surprises me anymore.
1DI0007829	It's all just more of the same in this town, right?
1DI0007830	You know, I thought about moving once. Setting myself up in Rivet City or one of the smaller settlements. But hey, this place is home.     
1DI0007831	Ahhhhh... Megaton.
1DI0007832	No kidding, huh?
1DI0007834	Right, right...
1DI0007835	Wow...
1DI0007836	Jeez...
1DI0007837	Hm hmm.
1DI0007838	Well, I guess I should stop gossiping and do something productive. Talk to you later.
1DI0007839	If I hear anything else, I'll be sure and let you know. See ya.
1DI0007840	Ahhh, life here in Megaton, huh? But anyway. I'll talk to you later.
1DI0007841	Sometimes, I really wonder about this place. But hey, I'll talk to you later.
1DI0007842	Listen, I'm gonna go grab some shuteye.
1DI0007843	I was just on my way to grab a bite though -- I'll catch you later.
1DI0007844	What are you going to do, huh? Anyway, I should get going. Take care.
1DI0007845	You know me, I love to hear myself talk. Anyway, I need to take off.
1DI0007847	*Sigh* Anywaaayyy. I don't want to hold you up. Have a good one, all right?
1DI0007848	It's funny, though. At the end of the day, I still can't think of any other place I'd rather live. Well, I'll talk to you later.
1DI0007849	Heh. It's all so sad, you have to laugh. Know what I'm saying? But hey, you have a good day, all right?
1DI0007850	*Sigh* It's one thing after another in this place, isn't it? Anyway, I should get going.
1DI0007851	Talk to you later.
1DI0007852	Have a good one.
1DI0007853	Catch you later.
1DI0007854	Bye.
1DI0007855	Peace be with you.
1DI0007856	Later.
1DI0007857	Sure thing, Andy. What do you need?
1DI0007858	I'm a little busy right now, Andy. What is it?
1DI0007859	Yeah, Billy?
1DI0007860	Yes, Billy?
1DI0007861	Mister Moriarty, sir! What can I do for you?
1DI0007862	Yessir, Mister Moriarty? What is it?
1DI0007863	Yeah, Colin?
1DI0007864	Oh Christ, what now...
1DI0007865	Yes, darling.
1DI0007866	Yes, husband?
1DI0007867	What did you say to me? WHAT did you say to me? Did I give you permission to speak, you disgusting corpse?
1DI0007868	Well I'll be! I could have sworn I heard this corpse speak! But that's impossible. Dead men don't talk, do they? They LISTEN. They OBEY.    
1DI0007869	Oh, hey Jericho, baby! What's going on?
1DI0007870	Jericho, baby! What's happening?
1DI0007871	Hey Gob, what's up?
1DI0007872	Hiya, Gobbie! Whatcha need?
1DI0007873	What's up, son?
1DI0007874	What's on your mind, boy?
1DI0007875	Yes, Mr. Jericho? What can I do for you?
1DI0007876	Sure thing, Mr. Jericho. What do you need?
1DI0007877	Yeah, honey. What do you need?
1DI0007878	What is it, baby?
1DI0007879	Food, Jericho. It's all I had for you yesterday. It's all I have for you today.  It's all I'll ever have for you.
1DI0007880	Jericho, you're disgusting. Are you going to order something or not?
1DI0007881	What? Me? Why?
1DI0007882	I'll help you if I can, what do you need?
1DI0007883	Sure... Jericho, is it? What do you want to talk about?
1DI0007884	Yeah, sure. No problem. Anything I can do to help, you just let me know!
1DI0007885	Yeah, Leo... what do you need?
1DI0007886	What is it, Leo?
1DI0007887	Yeah, dad?
1DI0007888	Whatcha need, dad?
1DI0007889	For you, sweetheart, anything. What do you need?
1DI0007890	Anything for you, honey?
1DI0007891	Oh, for the... What?
1DI0007892	Yes, good wife?
1DI0007893	Yes, my darling?
1DI0007894	Yes, Nathan?
1DI0007895	Yes, dear?
1DI0007896	Oh, heya Nathan. Sorry, I got lost in my work. What do you need?
1DI0007897	Sure, Nathan, what's up?
1DI0007898	What is it NOW, Nova, dear...
1DI0007899	Does the pampered princess seek an audience with her king?
1DI0007900	Nova! Uhm... hi! What do you need?
1DI0007901	Nova! What can I do for you? Just name it!
1DI0007902	I was thinkin' Andy -- you know what would be great? If we went lookin' for a new refrigerator for the bar.
1DI0007903	We should get us a hooker. We could pull in a lot of money around here... maybe a nice blonde.
1DI0007904	You said we could have that talk sometime. You know. About boys. I'm ready! I'm ready now! There's some stuff I need to know. Like, really bad.
1DI0007905	It's about Harden. I think I want to... kiss him. But I don't know if I should. Well, I think I should, but I don't really know HOW. What should...
1DI0007906	I... I think we're running low on Nuka-Cola, sir. I... I just thought you'd want to know...
1DI0007907	Colin... Mister Moriarty, sir... I just wanted to... to say... well... you're looking quite dapper today, sir...
1DI0007908	I'm tired. I think I'm going to knock off early. I know you won't mind.
1DI0007909	It's the tips, Colin. Your customers are actually getting cheaper, if that's even possible. Is a girl supposed to just lie down and take that?
1DI0007910	I've been having those visions again. Not while I sleep, dear husband, but waking dreams. I see Atom, finally free! His glory revealed at last!
1DI0007911	He came to me again last night, husband. The great Atom! He visited me in my dreams, bid me to spread His gospel. I was infused with His energy!
1DI0007912	These floors are filthy, you useless fucking zombie! Next time you sweep, put your back into it.
1DI0007913	Christ almighty, Gob, if I told you once I told you a thousand times. Do something about that... oozing. You're scaring off my customers!
1DI0007914	I've got blood in my alcohol stream. I blame you. Fix it.
1DI0007915	I can't help but notice that I'm sobering up. What are we gonna do about that?
1DI0007916	My drink is empty. Fix it.
1DI0007917	Don't forget to mop up really good today. You know how Colin gets when the bar is messy. I'd hate for him to, you know... Get angry again.
1DI0007918	I just wanted to let you know I reserved some special time for you. You know, as a thank you for all you done for me.
1DI0007919	I wanted to tell you, I saw the patch job you did on that leaky section of roof. That was... That was really responsible of you, son. Thank you.
1DI0007920	So, ummm... I noticed Deputy Steel looking a bit shinier than usual. You polished him up, didn't you boy? He he he. Good work, son. Good work.
1DI0007921	C'mon, Jenny, why you gotta be like that? I'm just trying to be nice to you.
1DI0007922	Dammit, Jenny. Why do you have to embarrass me like that, out here in front of all these people?
1DI0007923	I noticed some irregularities in the logs here. Are you tracking the drinks that you're selling like I told you?
1DI0007924	You came up short again. Now, I don't know what's going on, but it needs to stop.
1DI0007925	You said we could take that trip. Up north, you know? To see one of the old towns? Come on, dad, you promised....
1DI0007926	We still haven't built that model, you know. The Corvega? You told me we could do it this weekend....
1DI0007927	Well, I was thinkin', Sweetie Pie... Sometime soon, we should take a trip. Just you and me. Maybe visit Rivet City or somethin'. Would you like that?
1DI0007928	You know, I got to thinkin'. You and I should do some scavengin' sometime soon. See, we find us an old bike, and get Moira to help us fix her up!
1DI0007929	What did you do with my ratchet? I've looked everywhere! Where did you put it?
1DI0007930	I... I never did find that gun. The one I was working on, remember? You put it somewhere didn't you? You cleaned up, and you lost my damn gun!
1DI0007931	I was wonderin' if anyone's sold you a Fesson-Moch .45 cal. I need the trigger assembly for this rifle I'm workin' on.
1DI0007932	Did you ever get ahold of those shell casings that we talked about? The special alloy ones?
1DI0007933	I've been concerned about church attendance lately, Mother. The town's inability to fully accept Atom's promise is... most discouraging.
1DI0007934	Have you thought more on that matter we discussed? It's a bold plan, Mother. But I fear the townsfolk may not be ready for such an intervention.
1DI0007935	Nathan, you promised me you'd talk to Moira about getting those flower seeds. Please, don't forget. Again.
1DI0007936	The computer's doing that... that THING again. You know, with the flickering. You said you'd fix it...
1DI0007937	Have you been Jetting again? For Christ's sake, lass, you're half the earner when you're on that junk. NO... MORE... CHEMS. Got it?
1DI0007938	Nova... You're a beautiful girl. Everyone knows that. But Jesus, put a smile on! If you can't be happy, at least look the part.
1DI0007939	I set that special wine aside for you. The one you said makes you really... uninhibited.
1DI0007940	You look beautiful today, Nova. Just like always.
1DI0007941	I was thinkin', maybe you and me, we could go out sometime.
1DI0007942	Now, I know you've turned me down before, but I'm gonna ask again -- what would you think about goin' out sometime?
1DI0007943	Look, don't give me any of your shit. Now, tell me something, and if you're lyin' I'll know. Are you workin' with the Raiders? You a scout?
1DI0007944	I heard something about you, boy. I heard that you was a scout for the Raiders, here to recoin.. recon... err... check out our defenses. That true?
1DI0007945	I heard something about you, girl. I heard that you was a scout for the Raiders, here to recoin.. recon... err... check out our defenses. That true?
1DI0007946	Yeah. Good idea. Not gonna happen.
1DI0007947	And where do you propose that we pick one of those up? We'd have to pay the caravan scavengers, and who knows what they'd bring back.
1DI0007948	Whoa! Whoa now, honeybun! Let's ah... Let's slow down a little, okay? You got a lot of time left before that stuff is important. All right?
1DI0007949	Oh! Well... Well, now, you know Maggie sweetheart that boys and girls, umm... Aw hell, girl, can't you talk to Moira about this stuff?
1DI0007950	Shut yer gob, Gob! Ain't that why I named you that to begin with? Cause you talk too goddamn much? Now get your rotting ass back to work!
1DI0007951	Jesus Christ, what did I just tell you? Get back to yer job while you still have one!
1DI0007952	I remember a time when you screwed more and complained less, Nova dear. Ah, but for the good old days.
1DI0007953	*Sigh* Nova, lass. What happened to you, girl? Where's the fire? The enthusiasm? You've got such talent! You used to enjoy your work...
1DI0007954	*Sigh* Our heavenly Father put you on this earth to test me, is that it? 'Dear Lord, save me from the whinings of thine whore who doth complaineth!'
1DI0007955	Please, sir! I'm sorry! I... I'm just stupid, you know that! A stupid, rotting corpse, right? I'll take care of it, I swear!
1DI0007956	Mister Moriarty! Sir! I... I'm sorry! You're right, of course... It won't be a problem! I promise you!
1DI0007957	Sure thing! ... you miserable drunken asshole ...
1DI0007958	One more drink, coming up!  ... shitbird ...
1DI0007959	You're always so nice to me, you know that, Nova? I don't know what I'd do without you, I swear.
1DI0007960	Aww, Nova. I can always count on you to look out for me, huh? You're, well... You're just about the sweetest person I've ever met.
1DI0007961	I just... You know. Wanted to help out.
1DI0007962	I like helping you out, dad. I'm not a kid anymore, you know. Okay, I am a kid. But I can do anything you need me to do. I can handle it.
1DI0007963	I'm not going to discuss it, Jericho. You know good and goddamn well why I'm like this and don't you dare play dumb with me.
1DI0007964	Don't play stupid with me, Jericho. You know what my problem is.
1DI0007965	Is it really that big of a deal if your little papers don't add up? Why are you always hassling me about this?
1DI0007966	So we end up a few caps short at the end of the night. Who cares? It's not going to break us. Get off my back, man.
1DI0007967	*Sigh.* You're right, Harden. You're right. No more broken promises. Let me just... get my affairs settled, and I'll free up some time. Okay?
1DI0007968	Oh man. I did say that, didn't I? Okay. Yeah, yeah we can do that. I've got some stuff to take care of, but after that, it's you and me! Okay, pal?
1DI0007969	Oh, yes! Please, please, please! Can we Billy? We could have so much fun. More fun than we could in Megaton, that's for sure!
1DI0007970	You mean it? Oh Billy, thank you! Thank you so much! I can't wait!
1DI0007971	*Tsk* You boys and your toys. I know better than to touch your things, dear. If it's lost, YOU lost it.
1DI0007972	Calm down, dear. Deeeeepppp breath. I didn't touch your... thingie. It's right where you left it, I'm sure. If I see it, you'll be the first to know.
1DI0007973	Hrm. Let me think... you know, I don't think so. But I'll let you know if anyone sells me one.
1DI0007974	I'm sorry, Nathan. No. I have to tell you -- those are hard to come by. I wouldn't get your hopes up.
1DI0007975	Glorious, Maya! Simply glorious. I sense that His coming is upon us... any day now...
1DI0007976	Breathtaking, my love. Soon, Atom's glory will be upon us. Very soon.
1DI0007977	We should stay our course, dearest husband. Atom's power penetrates us all, does it not? Soon, every soul of Megaton will revel in His glory!
1DI0007978	Do not despair, dearest husband. Soon, all of Megaton will bask in Atom's glow.
1DI0007979	Always with the nagging.... I'll do what I do when I do it, woman.
1DI0007980	Fine, fine, fine. I'll do whatever you want. Just please, for God's sake, stop with the nagging...
1DI0007981	I... I'm sorry, Colin. I've been tired lately, you know? I ain't been myself. Don't worry, I'll pull it together. I promise.
1DI0007982	*Sigh* All right, Colin, all right. Just lay off, already. Please?
1DI0007983	Oh, you're so sweet, Gob.
1DI0007984	Awwww... Thank you hon. You're so thoughtful.
1DI0007985	Jericho, baby. We've talked about this. Colin' don't want me seein' customers outside of work. He thinks our business is best kept professional.
1DI0007986	You're sweet, Jericho. You really are, but Colin says that things between us is best kept on a professional level. If it were up to me...
1DI0007987	Who told you that?
1DI0007988	Me? A Raider? Are you joking? I'm not a Raider! I've never even met a Raider before!
1DI0007989	I'm not a Raider! I swear! Who told you that? They're lying!
1DI0007990	Me? Working with Raiders? Hell no! I just want to get a place here in Megaton, and I'll kill any Raider who shows up here to prove it!
1DI0007991	Aw... you're no fun anymore, Andy.
1DI0007992	You know, it's not all about money, Andy.
1DI0007993	*Sigh* All right, Billy. But you can't avoid the subject forever, you know...
1DI0007994	Geez, Billy, you're so timid with this stuff. I won't be a kid forever, you know.
1DI0007995	Yes sir, Mister Moriarty!
1DI0007996	Oh! Um... Y... Yes, sir!
1DI0007997	You're all heart, you know that, Colin?
1DI0007998	Thanks a lot, Colin. I can always count on you for sympathy and respect.
1DI0007999	All right, all right! Stop your pathetic sniveling and just do what you're fucking told.
1DI0008000	Gob? If I hear one more excuse come out of that rotting mouth, I'm going to sew it shut. Okay? There's a good zombie.
1DI0008001	Now don't you go getting all mushy on me! We just... We got to look out for each other, right?
1DI0008002	Hey, if we ain't going to look out for each other, what's the point? You think Colin gives a shit about us, Gob? Come on, sweetie, wake up.
1DI0008003	I know, Harden. I know. You make me proud every day, son. What can I say, you're just like your dad! He he he he he.
1DI0008004	Hey, you think it's easy, seeing my little boy turn into a man? Ha ha ha ha! Don't grow up too quick on me, you hear!
1DI0008005	Jenny, baby. That was a long time ago. I've left all that behind me now.
1DI0008006	Look, Jenny, that was years ago. I'm a different man now.
1DI0008007	If these books don't add up, I don't know how much money we have, then how are we supposed to stay in business? Would you just be more careful?
1DI0008008	It's important, Leo! I have to keep our head above water here. Please, just try to be more careful.
1DI0008009	Okay, dad. But I'm going to hold you to it, this time.
1DI0008010	You're kidding, right? You mean it this time? For real? Great! Great, dad, I can't wait! Thanks!
1DI0008011	Ha ha! I just love seeing you happy, sweetheart.
1DI0008012	Well all right then! It's settled! I'll set my affairs in order, as they say, and we'll sit down and plan this thing out.
1DI0008013	Aggh! Damnit! But I've looked everywhere! *Sigh* All right. Thanks, I guess.
1DI0008014	Well... damn. Thanks for nothing.
1DI0008015	I hear things. I know a few people. What of it?
1DI0008016	Thank you, Nathan dear.
1DI0008017	Don't you take that tone with me, mister! Now quit with the cranky old man act and help your poor wife out. Heavens...
1DI0008018	Oh, Nova. I've always trusted you to do the right thing, haven't I? If I didn't... you'd be dead.
1DI0008019	Fine. But if we have this conversation again, I'll be forced to turn off the charm.
1DI0008020	Nah... it's okay, Nova. I get it. No one wants anything to do with a crusty old Wasteland rat like me less'n they're getting' paid. I understand.
1DI0008021	But you think... I don't know... that you might get out of here some day? I got plenty of money, I could take care of you...
1DI0008022	Aw, Nova. I'd do anything for you. Well... I don't want to keep you. You're always so busy and...
1DI0008023	Anything for you, Nova. Anytime.
1DI0008024	Okay, Andy. I'll try.
1DI0008025	You really need to relax, Andy.
1DI0008026	People don't change, Jericho. Now order something and leave me alone.
1DI0008027	No, Jericho. Just no. Now leave me alone.
1DI0008028	Sorry, hon. I'm a lifer here. Just go drink your drink.
1DI0008029	Then you best unhear it. I know all about you, old man. I'd be careful before I went around town spreading rumors about Raiders. You dig?
1DI0008030	You can tell me that when you're the one paying the bills, Leo.
1DI0008031	Yeah, well I'm the one accountable for this place -- not you.
1DI0008032	No! That's terrible!
1DI0008033	I hadn't heard! That's just awful...
1DI0008034	Terrible business.
1DI0008035	Ashes to ashes.
1DI0008036	May they rest in peace...
1DI0008037	Hopefully they won't come back as a Ghoul! Ha! Ha ha! ... ... what? Too soon?
1DI0008038	Dibs on their stuff!
1DI0008039	Dead meat, you say? So... will there be a feast tonight? Hahaha!
1DI0008040	All I can say is: better them than me.
1DI0008041	Shit. I wonder if their house is up for bids...
1DI0008042	Well, on the bright side, now there are more water rations for the rest of us.
1DI0008043	My sympathies go out.
1DI0008044	It could happen to any of us, you know.
1DI0008045	How does the saying go? "Death is like a robe that everyone has to wear."
1DI0008046	"Death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable."
1DI0008047	"God full of mercy who dwells on high, grant rest for this soul on the wings of your divine presence..."
1DI0008048	"We have come from God and unto him we shall return..."
1DI0008049	You're really an asshole, you know that?
1DI0008050	That's appalling.
1DI0008051	You're going to a special hell, you know that?
1DI0008052	Too soon!
1DI0008053	You can't be serious.
1DI0008054	Help us? Are you crazy? I heard about some shit they pulled out west somewhere...
1DI0008055	From what I hear, they're nothing but bad news.
1DI0008056	Yeah, well. We'll see. They can't be worse than those Brotherhood of Steel psychos down in the city.
1DI0008057	Yeah, right. I'm not holding out hope for the cavalry to come save the world.
1DI0008058	Really? Maybe there's hope yet...
1DI0008059	I don't know... I want to believe that but I'm just not sure.
1DI0008060	If that's true, then all we have to do is hold out for a little while, right?
1DI0008061	I hope you're right. I really do. But after 200 years, don't you think they'd have done something by now?
1DI0008062	Can't say that there's much going on.
1DI0008063	Nada.
1DI0008065	Nothing. We'll talk later.
1DI0008066	Just give it up, Gob. You're not going to get anything.
1DI0008067	You just leave that fucking thing alone, Gob?
1DI0008068	Boy, just leave it be. I like the Enclave station. It's downright patriotic!
1DI0008069	The Church of the Children of Atom is based on the idea that each single atomic mass in all of creation contains within it an entire universe.
1DI0008070	When that atomic mass is split, a single universe divides and becomes two -- thus signifying the single greatest act of Atom's creation.
1DI0008071	Occasionally, a divine event occurs and trillions upon trillions of new universes are created. The last such event took place here, 200 years ago.
1DI0008072	Where most of the lost children of Atom see that event as simple war and devastation, we see creation and unification in Atom's Glow.
1DI0008073	Those who were called to Atom during the Great Division were very fortunate. They were permitted to aid in the process of Atom's creation.
1DI0008074	We seek the same, both in symbol and in fact and the "bomb", as you call it, represents Atom's capacity for creation.
1DI0008075	We kneel before it and ask that Atom call us to aid him. We pray that out of our meager bodies, he will create new life.
1DI0008076	It's a shame that you so easily mock us without even knowing our doctrine.
1DI0008077	Even knowing the truth, you continue to mock us. How very, very sad.
1DI0008078	Thank you.
1DI0008079	Atom be with you.
1DI0008080	Bless you, child.
1DI0008081	I appreciate the gesture, child, but you don't have enough caps.
1DI0008085	I appreciate the kind gesture, child, but you don't have enough caps.
1DI0008089	You don't have enough caps.
1DI0008092	Behold! He is coming with the clouds! And every eye shall be blind with his glory! Every ear shall be stricken deaf to hear the thunder of his voice!
1DI0008093	Let the men, women, and children of the Earth come forth to gather and behold the power of Atom!
1DI0008094	Let those who dwell here in his favored land attend now to the words of the Prophet of Atom!
1DI0008095	Come forth and drink the waters of the Glow, for this ancient weapon of war is our salvation, it is the very symbol of Atom's glory!
1DI0008096	Let it serve as a reminder of the Division that has occurred in the past and the resplendence of the promise of our division in the times to come!
1DI0008097	Give your bodies to Atom, my friends. Release yourself to his power, feel his Glow, and be Divided.
1DI0008098	There shall be no tears, no sorrow, no suffering, for in the Division, we shall see our release from the pain and hardships of this world.
1DI0008099	Yea, your suffering shall exist no longer; it shall be washed away in Atom's Glow, burned from you in the fire of his brilliance.
1DI0008100	Each of us shall give birth to a billion stars formed from the mass of our wretched and filthy bodies.
1DI0008101	Each of us shall be mother and father to a trillion civilizations.
1DI0008102	Each of us shall know peace, shall know an end to pain, and shall know Atom in his glory.
1DI0008103	I urge you, my friends -- come, drink with me and pray...
1DI0008104	Glorious Atom, I give unto you these feeble bones. I present to your will this frail body.
1DI0008105	I beg of you to use me as your vessel, guide me to your brilliance, divide each particle and give relief to this rotten flesh.
1DI0008106	Cast the fragile form of this ephemeral body into new life in the forge of your Glow.
1DI0008107	Atom, come -- bestow your presence on your unworthy servant.
1DI0008108	We stay true, until the Day of Division -- until the dawn of your return to His humble world.
1DI0008109	Let's just see what we can do... mmm-hmm. Yep, just as I thought.
1DI0008110	Whoops, butterfingers! Hold on just a second... okay, got it. You're not feeling lightheaded, are you? Great.
1DI0008111	That's strange. Wait. Your left, my right. Okay, got it. There... we... go!
1DI0008112	You weren't kidding. You love the smack, all right.
1DI0008113	I'm taking food out of the mouths of some poor dealer's kids right now, you know.
1DI0008114	That burning sensation you feel, all over your body? That's my patented Addiction-Be-Gone treatment at work!
1DI0008115	Jesus Christ, did you set this yourself? Well, I'm gonna have to rebreak it...
1DI0008116	What the?... oops. Well, that wasn't important anyway. You'll be fine without it.
1DI0008117	Now how did THAT get in there?
1DI0008118	How attached to your fingers would you say that you are? Oh, wait... never mind. There it is.
1DI0008119	I swear you people never learn, what do you think is out there in that Wasteland anyway?
1DI0008120	You're just going to get yourself killed out there, you know. Not that you'll listen to me...
1DI0008121	... <grumbles> ...
1DI0008122	Here, hold this end for me. Okay, now give it back.
1DI0008123	You alright up there. Need another painkiller?
1DI0008124	All right look, I'm only tellin' you this because you seem like an okay sort and I'm hopin' maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
1DI0008125	Leo Stahl... that boy got hisself a problem with Jet. I've caught him in here two to three times tryin' to steal what I keep around for anesthetic.
1DI0008126	Not even his own family knows it. He goes up to the water treatment plant at night to get high... I dunno... I can't reach him. Maybe you can.
1DI0008127	All right, I suppose someone with medical training has to have at least a bit of compassion. And maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
1DI0008130	Nice try. Maybe if you actually had some medical training, we could talk about it.
1DI0008131	Right.
1DI0008132	That bastard! He... he's a liar! He just wants me dead! Those caps are all mine. I earned them!
1DI0008133	Owe HIM some caps? He's a liar! He just wants you to kill me! Those caps are mine, fair and square.
1DI0008134	You're not getting a damn thing from me! You hear me?! Not a damn thing!
1DI0008135	Look, I used to work for that slob. Doing... you know... favors for guys.
1DI0008136	Well, I got sick and tired of it. I told Moriarty I'm taking my share of the caps and leaving. I even slept with the pig to seal the deal.
1DI0008137	Next morning he tells me I couldn't leave. So I bolted. I took my money and ran.
1DI0008138	Now he's branded me a thief and a junkie and sent his cronies to find me. I guess I need a new hiding place.
1DI0008139	I am tired of hiding out here like some kind of Wasteland dog.
1DI0008140	I... I guess you're right. Here... this is all I have. Please leave me alone now.
1DI0008141	Is there something wrong with your hearing? I just told you the caps are mine! You can't have them!
1DI0008142	This is never gonna end until I send him a message. Well, fine. If I have to kill you to send it, I will!
1DI0008143	You'd do that for me? I never expected anyone to care enough.
1DI0008144	Here you go. Thanks, kid. You're all right.
1DI0008145	Look... I feel awful about what I used to have to do for a living, okay? I use the Psycho to make the memories go away.
1DI0008146	Who the hell are you to judge me? Tell Moriarty he can take his fucking caps and shove them up his ass!
1DI0008147	You'd do that for me? I can't believe it... you hardly even know me!
1DI0008148	Thanks, kid. You watch yourself out there.
1DI0008149	Colin Moriarty... the owner of Moriarty's Saloon in Megaton.
1DI0008150	That sack of shit is convinced that I'm some crazy junkie who stole money from him!
1DI0008153	That lying bastard. Roped you into finding me too, huh?
1DI0008154	Well, you're not getting a damn thing from me! You hear me?! Not a damn thing!
1DI0008155	No, sorry. I've left that part of my life behind.
1DI0008156	Who knows. Shoot myself up until I forget who I am?
1DI0008157	The Wasteland sucks, kid. Just get used to it.
1DI0008158	I sure am, sonny. What've you got for me?
1DI0008159	I sure am, missy. What've you got for me?
1DI0008160	Just in time... just in time...
1DI0008161	The more of these I get, the longer I can keep the plant going.
1DI0008162	Good... good... I know right where I can use these parts.
1DI0008163	Seems like we can never have enough of these.
1DI0008164	We can always use 'em.
1DI0008185	Well, alright... let me just count out your caps...
1DI0008186	Are you serious? Why... I'll be. Thank you, stranger. I can't tell you what this means to Megaton.
1DI0008187	Okay... well, come back when you do.
1DI0008188	You sure? Okay well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
1DI0008189	Well, it's no secret that the ol' water treatment plant is on its last legs. And I'm the only one in town that can keep the damn thing running.
1DI0008190	I spend so much time up in the plant, that I can't take care of the leaks that keep springing up in the pipes around town.
1DI0008191	Now, I don't expect much from strangers, but if you've got the knowhow, I need someone to hunt down and repair those leaks.
1DI0008192	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. There should be three leaks.
1DI0008193	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. My guess is that there are still two leaks out there.
1DI0008194	The pipes are leaking around town. Find the leaks and patch the pipes, if you can. There's only one more leak. Be sure to check all the pipes.
1DI0008195	Well, I'll be... the pressure's up in the plant. It looks like all the leaks have been fixed. Thank you, stranger! Thank you!
1DI0008196	But listen, it's only a matter of time before they burst again, and someone like you might not be around to fix 'em. I'll make you a deal.
1DI0008197	I'll give you caps for any Scrap Metal you can bring me. You'll find 'em it over the place out there in the Wastes.
1DI0008198	If I have a steady supply of scrap, I can keep the plant running and the pipes should be just fine. We got a deal?
1DI0008199	From the pressure in the plant, my guess is that there are three of 'em scattered around town.
1DI0008200	Check along the pipes and the valves, but they might be a bit tricky to spot.
1DI0008201	I could, but I can't hunt for leaks all damn day. That rust bucket purifier would fall apart without me up around to plug it up.
1DI0008202	The only break I get is when I shut the thing off for the night, and I can't look for leaks when the water isn't running.
1DI0008203	I hope you can help. If folks knew how bad it was getting up here... well... I don't know what would happen.
1DI0008204	Alright... alright... relax. But all you've done is delay the inevitable. Without those parts, the plants gonna croak sooner or later.
1DI0008205	But what do you care? You just want your money. Here, take it and get out.
1DI0008206	Good! This just keeps looking better! Those parts will keep this place running and the town in fresh water! Hurry back as soon as you find some!
1DI0008207	I guess they don't have a lot of Ghouls in the Vault.
1DI0008208	Haven't you ever seen a Ghoul before?
1DI0008209	Well, not all of us got the chance to hole up in a nice cushy Vault when the bombs fell.
1DI0008210	A bunch of us got stuck out here in the world, and got a full on blast of heat and radiation -- turned us into a pack of walking corpses.
1DI0008211	Near as I can tell, we age slower than you. A lot slower. There are even a few Ghouls that were alive during the war.
1DI0008212	Of course, with a face like ground Brahmin meat, you can imagine that folks don't take too kindly to us.
1DI0008213	Nice of you to say so. If you can't be nice, at least pretend, right? Fake it 'till you make it, and all that.
1DI0008214	Still though, a fake compliment is better than the usual spit in the face that I get. You're not half bad... for a smoothskin.
1DI0008215	Yeah, fuck you too. Whatever, man. I'm used to being treated like shit around here.
1DI0008216	Yeah... great. What do you need? ... asshole ...
1DI0008217	Well now. That's a surprise! I'm used to every asshole smoothskin in this town giving me shit just because I look like a corpse.
1DI0008218	I'm glad to see that there are a few worthwhile people around here.
1DI0008219	Listen... Moriarty'd have my head if he caught me selling at a discount, but for you, I'll risk it.
1DI0008220	I see how it is... <sigh> What do you need?
1DI0008221	Wait... you're not going to hit me? Yell at me? Not even berate me a little bit?
1DI0008222	<sighs> I suppose I was wrong... should have known better.
1DI0008226	Aw, forget it. I guess we're stuck with this Enclave crap.
1DI0008227	Aggh! Come on, you piece of junk! Every day, it's the same damn thing...
1DI0008229	Stupid radio!
1DI0008230	Wait... is that...? Dammit!
1DI0008231	Work! Come on. Work!
1DI0008232	Why... won't... you... work?
1DI0008233	Goddamn radio!
1DI0008235	A place called Underworld. It's a Ghoul city down in D.C. I set off up here to find adventure and fortune. And... well... I found this place.
1DI0008236	I'm sort of stuck here. Colin says that I can't leave until I pay off my debt to him. Of course, he charges me room and board too.
1DI0008237	If you ever get to Underworld, tell Carol that I said hi.
1DI0008238	It's dangling around Colin's neck. Get it... if you can.
1DI0008239	My robbin' days are over, kid. I'm just here to drink and stink.
1DI0008240	He'll probably blow your head off. That is, unless you can draw faster than a pissed off Irishman.
1DI0008241	Anytime. It'll be worth it to see the look on that asshole's face.
1DI0008242	You're from the outside and I've lived too much of my life out there to trust every jackass nobody that wanders in from the Wasteland.
1DI0008243	You seem alright though, so I'll cut you a deal. I'll answer your questions so long as you don't give me any more reason to distrust you. Got it?
1DI0008244	Well, now. That's something I didn't expect. You're scrappy for a little Vault twerp aren't you?
1DI0008245	Maybe I had you wrong, kid. You're okay. Now, what did you want to know?
1DI0008246	You're joking, right? I mean, I shit bigger than you, kid.
1DI0008247	Come back when you've got some fight in you. Until then, save your threats.
1DI0008248	You're goddamn right "nevermind".
1DI0008249	Ha ha! You're gonna have to do better than that, kid! Thanks for the drink, though.
1DI0008250	You're kidding. You don't have 10 caps? What kind of asshole doesn't even have ten fucking caps?
1DI0008251	Alright, alright, I'm just fucking with you.
1DI0008252	Hrm... lemme think. No. Consider it a fee for the lesson you've learned -- don't be such a tightass next time.
1DI0008253	You love me.
1DI0008254	Whoa, twenty caps! Look at the big spender! Alright then, I can see you're in it for the big money, so I'll tell you all about Moriarty's.
1DI0008255	Moriarty, he's a ratfuck bastard for sure, but he's also paranoid as all hell. So paranoid that he don't let no one handle the cash around here.
1DI0008256	Every night, he takes what Gob and Nova earn and locks it in a file cabinet next to his bed.
1DI0008257	Don't you know how a bribe works? You give me money, and I give you information. In order to do that, you have to have money. Christ. Kids!
1DI0008258	Your call, kid.
1DI0008259	Well, Billy used to. Before he... before he died. I don't know now. Maybe I'll see if Manya will help me...
1DI0008260	Billy does! Have you met Billy... Billy Creel? A long, long time ago, he saved me from Raiders!
1DI0008261	They... killed my real parents. But Billy showed up before they got me, and now he's like my daddy... sort of...
1DI0008262	My dad, of course. He teaches me to shoot, and about the law, and keeping people safe. When he's not busy protecting the town, that is.
1DI0008263	Well... with my dad gone, I don't really know... dad always said that I'd have to learn to watch out for myself one day...
1DI0008264	I dunno... I used to like it, but ever since dad... I dunno...
1DI0008265	It's great! My dad says that one day, I'm gonna get to be sheriff, just like him!
1DI0008266	It's okay, I guess. I used to live way far away when I was little... before Billy found me.
1DI0008267	I don't talk to most of them. Billy says that I have to be careful, even when people seem nice. And I'm especially not allowed to talk to Mr. Jericho.
1DI0008268	I usually play with Harden most days, when his dad isn't taking him out to learn to shoot or something.
1DI0008269	Billy says that he's going to teach me to shoot one day too!
1DI0008270	There's the Stahls. They run the Brass Lantern. I go there to eat with my dad sometimes. Doc Church runs the clinic.
1DI0008271	The Confessor is a little weird. But him and mother Maya are always nice to me.
1DI0008272	There's also Moriarty, but dad says that I'm not allowed to talk to him.
1DI0008273	Help? What's to help? So I'm a junkie, big fucking deal. It's not like I'm hurting anyone.
1DI0008274	I... I guess you're right. I have to tell them about my problem, don't I?
1DI0008275	I just don't know what to say. I've been stealing from both of them for years to get my fix. Where do I even start?
1DI0008276	Well, I'll figure something out. Look, I want to thank you for your help. I guess it took a complete stranger to show me what an ass I've been.
1DI0008277	Take this key, it's to my private stash in the water treatment plant. Just get rid of the stuff, burn it, sell it -- I don't care what happens to it.
1DI0008278	Thanks. It'll be hard, but I'll do my best.
1DI0008279	No. Thanks, but no. I got myself into this problem, I need to get myself out.
1DI0008280	I'll figure something out. Look, I want to thank you for your help. I guess it took a complete stranger to show me what an ass I've been.
1DI0008282	Yeah, I can. Just please... Don't tell Andy or Jenny. And don't ask me about it when I'm at the Brass Lantern.
1DI0008283	I'll only sell to you when my shift is over. Meet me in the water treatment plant if you need something.
1DI0008284	I can hook you up. A solid chem dealer is hard to find out here in the Wastes, trust me. I know.
1DI0008285	I can only sell to you when my shift at the Lantern is over. Meet me up at the water treatment plant if you need something.
1DI0008286	You're damn right it's not your business.
1DI0008287	Hey! Get the hell away from there!
1DI0008288	Aren't you curious? You know what they say about curiosity, don't you?
1DI0008289	Back off, man. That's my stuff.
1DI0008290	Hey now, get outta there. Just let me know if you need a drink.
1DI0008291	Whoa, bud. That stuff belongs to the restaurant. Just ask me if you need a drink.
1DI0008292	Hey buddy, Bar's over here if you need something.
1DI0008293	Glad we understand each other.
1DI0008294	All right, shoot.
1DI0008295	Sure. Head over to Moriarty's for spirits. Or, if you want something to eat, head over to the Brass Lantern.
1DI0008296	Yep. He's a bit cranky, but he means well. Just make sure there's something actually wrong with you before you bother him.
1DI0008297	You'll find him down in the plaza at the bottom of the hill, across the way from The Brass Lantern.
1DI0008298	The town's named after the bomb that's sitting in the middle of it. It hasn't gone off. Yet.
1DI0008299	I can tell you just about anything you want to know, honey. Megaton's history ain't no secret.
1DI0008300	Long ago, before the war, there used to be machines -- they were like buses, but they flew through the sky, taking people anywhere they wanted to go.
1DI0008301	You didn't have to walk, you just went to the air station, bought a ticket, and took to the skies. Anywhere in the world, you just up and flew there.
1DI0008302	When the war happened, the machines started dropping from the sky. Everyone around here thinks that the bomb made the crater, but it didn't.
1DI0008303	The crater provided good cover from the dust storms and when my daddy and the rest of the town decided to build the walls, they used what they had.
1DI0008304	Some of us wanted to. But the Church of Atom was just getting its start then. We needed their help to build the walls and clear the wreckage.
1DI0008305	If we'd have tried to move the bomb, they would have refused to help.
1DI0008306	Besides, a lot of people just wanted to leave it alone. It didn't seem to be hurting anything and who knows what would happen if we messed with it.
1DI0008307	Good eye. You're right honey, there are. There was an air station a couple of miles from here. It'd been stripped of everything except the planes.
1DI0008308	My daddy got a bunch of people together to go out there, break apart the machines and drag back what we could use. It took 'em a couple of months.
1DI0008309	You can't even tell where the air station was anymore. The Wasteland just took it back.
1DI0008310	It's a hell of a lot easier than trying to find enough parts to build walls and houses from nothing. The scrap was there, why not use it?
1DI0008311	Besides, it's sturdy. It keeps the Raiders and the dust storms out. Not all of us had the luck to be born in a vault, you know.
1DI0008312	Sure thing, hon.
1DI0008313	Well, you come on back any time you want to hear more.
1DI0008314	Well, originally, it started as a hole in the ground. My papi talked about how his father and the original settlers just hid in this crater.
1DI0008315	It was enough to keep them safe from the dust storms. When things cooled down and people started wandering into the Wastes, some stayed behind.
1DI0008316	The wanderers started coming back here to trade their stuff. By the time my papi was born, the town was a full on trading center.
1DI0008317	Papi got rich on the caravan routes and eventually convinced the others to build the walls to hold off the Raiders.
1DI0008318	Well, the Raiders, for one. Once the town got big enough, they'd wait until the traders and their guards were away, then come in and clean us out!
1DI0008319	Now the Super Mutants... They were a whole other breed of problem. They'd kill us if they had to, but mostly they tried to drag people away! Alive!
1DI0008320	So, eventually, my father did something about it. Him and a few others organized the traders and the citizens and built the walls.
1DI0008321	So we're pretty safe now. Still, I wish those Brotherhood of Steel fellers hadn't hit on such hard times. They really helped keep the wolves at bay.
1DI0008322	Not at first. It was a collection of people trying to get into the vault, people worshipping the bomb, and a few other refugees.
1DI0008323	Then the traders came. Now the caravans take care of most of the trading, but before they were set up, it was all Megaton.
1DI0008324	I worked on the caravans with my father for a while. That's how I met that worthless bag of liver spots I call a husband.
1DI0008325	No. Space is limited these days. You see all of these people wandering around here? They live up in the common house and aren't really citizens.
1DI0008326	Most people around here keep one eye open around strangers, but me, I can spot a Raider spy at 100 meters. I'm not worried about it at all.
1DI0008327	But if having meetings and pretending to vote on things makes the others feel safer, so be it.
1DI0008328	If you say so, honey.
1DI0008329	I was born here, actually. Just like my papi. Oh, for a while I helped him scavenge and then later on his caravan.
1DI0008330	But traipsing around the Wasteland is work for young people. After I met Nathan, I just wanted to stop moving around so much.
1DI0008331	We've been here ever since. Of course, I can't say that it's been good for Nathan's sanity...
1DI0008332	Oh, they come from all over... all over. You name it. The Stahl family grew up out east somewhere. Lucy's from some little settlement to the north.
1DI0008333	Billy doesn't really talk about where he's from. Doc Church used to live in Rivet City. Jericho... well... let's just say that men can change.
1DI0008334	...I hope.
1DI0008335	Well, technically, no one. But you can't put two people in a room together without one of them trying to govern the other.
1DI0008336	But it depends on who you ask. Lucas Simms appointed himself the Sheriff. He throws anyone out who causes too much trouble.
1DI0008337	But Colin Moriarty runs just about everything else. Not much happens here that he doesn't know about. Or plan.
1DI0008340	Colin Moriarty used to run just about everything else. Not much happened here that he doesn't know about. Or plan. I guess he got what was coming.
1DI0008342	But it depends on who you ask. Lucas Simms appointed himself the Sheriff. Before he died, he threw anyone out who caused too much trouble.
1DI0008343	Now Colin Moriarty runs just about everything. Not much happens here that he doesn't know about. Or plan. You ask me, he was behind Lucas' death.
1DI0008345	But it depends on who you ask. It used to be that Lucas Simms and Colin Moriarty fought each other for control.
1DI0008346	But with the two of them gone, who's to say what will happen around here? I'm just hoping that the Raiders don't show up again.
1DI0008347	All right then. Anything else you wanted to know?
1DI0008348	That man is the scum of the Earth. He keeps the drunks around here soaking in liquor and that poor Nova, that girl deserves better.
1DI0008349	And don't even get me started on how he treats Gob. Just because the boy looks dead doesn't mean that he should be treated like that.
1DI0008350	That man has his fingers in everything around here. Just watch what you say about him, it'll always get back.
1DI0008351	That man tries to bring law to this place. Lost cause if you ask me, but I respect his trying. He does seem to keep people in line though.
1DI0008352	Other than that weird cowboy thing of his, I don't have much to complain about.
1DI0008353	I'd put that weapon away if I were you.
1DI0008354	Hey, now. That's my stuff. If you want something, you gotta buy it.
1DI0008355	Whoa, whoa, whoa, hands off the goods.
1DI0008356	Aaahhhh. I see. You know, I heard about the brainwashin' that goes on down there. From some other fella, escaped, oh... five years back.
1DI0008357	'All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault; we die in the Vault!' And all that other assorted lunacy.
1DI0008358	Kid, you've got better programming than our own Deputy Weld. You'd best wise up quick. Wouldn't want anyone... takin' advantage of ya. Hmm?
1DI0008366	"All hail the Overseer! We're born in the Vault, we die in the Vault!" And all that other assorted lunacy.
1DI0008368	Is that what your father told you? That you were born in that hole? That HE was born there as well?
1DI0008369	Oh, the lies we tell to those we love.
1DI0008370	Your father brought you to the Vault right after you were born. To keep you safe, you see. I remember it well -- you stayed in my saloon, after all.
1DI0008371	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mom. Truly.
1DI0008372	But, life goes on. Daddy lied. Life's full of little disappointments. And now... you're all grown up, and wondering where he's gone to....
1DI0008373	Ha ha ha ha ha! God in Heaven, would you listen to yourself? Do you honestly believe that's true? The lies they've put into that head of yours....
1DI0008375	That's right. Your father, his Brotherhood of Steel friend, and you, the suckling babe with nary a tit to suckle. Sorry about your mum. Truly.
1DI0008376	But, no matter. That big round door has opened now, hasn't it? Daddy's gone, and you need to know why. Could be I know where, and why....
1DI0008377	Ah, temper, temper. And your father was so reserved. Take after our mum, do we? God rest her soul.
1DI0008378	But all least you've got balls. Yeah, I know your dad, met him when you were just a baby, when you two passed through here on your way to the Vault.
1DI0008379	You look shocked. You didn't think you were born in that hole, did you? Good Christ, boy. Know the truth, and it will set you free.
1DI0008381	But all least you've got spunk. Yeah, I know your dad, met him when you were just a baby, when you two passed through here on your way to the Vault.
1DI0008382	You look shocked. You didn't think you were born in that hole, did you? Ah, Lord.... Know the truth, and it will set you free.
1DI0008383	You seem like a nice kid, so I'm going to be straight with you.
1DI0008384	Your dad was here, and now he's not, and yes I know where he went. But what you're asking me for is information, and information is a commodity.
1DI0008385	Let's say... 100 caps, and daddy's location is yours. Very reasonable.
1DI0008386	You catch on quick, kid. That's the way of it out here, for sure. You want something, you take it. Or you pay in cold, hard caps. Say... 100.
1DI0008387	Seems a fair price to facilitate a family reunion. Don't you think?
1DI0008388	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, kid... ah... I'll let that one go, chalk it up to youthful arrogance.
1DI0008389	Listen carefully. I don't know what Sheriff Simms told you, but this is my town. Simms, he's a facade. An illusion of order I allow to exist.
1DI0008390	I was slinging drinks and killing Raiders here in Megaton when the good sheriff was just an idiot kid with cowboy fantasies.
1DI0008391	Raise a hand to me, and you'll never leave this town alive. Now, as for your dad... 100 caps, and I sing.
1DI0008392	All right, kid. Let me help you out, you know... for old time's sake.
1DI0008393	If you don't have the caps to pay for the information, then maybe you could do a little favor for me.
1DI0008394	All right kid. Then I guess there's nothing else we have to say to each other. Come back to me when you have the caps, and we'll talk.
1DI0008395	Excellent! Your dad raised a smart kid. Really no substitute for the love of a father, now is there?
1DI0008396	Speaking of dear old dad, he went southeast, into D.C. to the Galaxy News Radio station. Good luck now.
1DI0008397	So you've said. And yet you came back once... Somehow I think we'll be having this conversation again. I look forward to it.
1DI0008398	Will you? Well, good luck with that. So far as I know, I'm the only one your Dad told where he was going.
1DI0008399	So, when you change your mind, come see me. I'm usually at the saloon. 100 caps... Daddy wouldn't think twice if it were you out there....
1DI0008400	Guilty as charged.
1DI0008401	Tell you what kid, I'm gonna help you out... for old time's sake.
1DI0008403	I did say it was 100 caps. And as I recall, you said no. So now I'm saying it's 300 caps. What will you say this time?
1DI0008404	Oh, no no no. I offered a deal for 100 caps. You declined. So now I'm offering a new deal for 300 caps.
1DI0008405	But why worry about trivialities when your father's safety could be at stake?
1DI0008406	Didn't you say that last time, too? I have a feeling you'll be coming back again.
1DI0008407	Well, I suppose it was. All right; because I'm such a softy, I'll honor our original agreement.
1DI0008408	Your dad came through here, all right. Didn't stay long, though. Said he had some important business to attend to, and headed off to the city.
1DI0008409	Something to do with Galaxy News Radio. Guess that'd be the place for you to start. Good hunting, and thanks for the caps.
1DI0008410	I'm reasonable, but I'm not crazy. How can you bargain with me and not have the caps?
1DI0008411	Nothing like the sound of caps jingling in your pocket is there? Always brightens my day.
1DI0008412	And to brighten your day, here's what I know. Your dad said he was headed southeast, into the city. He was aiming for Galaxy News Radio.
1DI0008413	No idea what he wants with them, but you can ask him all about it when you find him. Good luck with that, by the way.
1DI0008414	Oh, come on now. Are people in your Vault so gullible that you think I'd fall for this?
1DI0008415	You don't have the caps, so you don't get the information. I'm not stupid.
1DI0008416	Well, that's a shame for you, isn't it? You don't have the caps, and I guess I don't have the information. Disappointment all around.
1DI0008417	Now that wasn't so difficult was it?
1DI0008420	How can you be so rude when I'm going to provide you with such a useful public service?
1DI0008423	I'll be here.
1DI0008424	It's called economics, kid. You got something I want and I got something you want. Nothing's free.
1DI0008425	I told you the favor would earn you some caps if you really took care of it. Now, fork 'em over!
1DI0008426	Even still, I cannot aid you on this path with a clear conscience.
1DI0008427	Well, in that case I recommend the Brass Lantern. It's directly across from the Church. You can't miss it.
1DI0008429	Now there's a proud patriot. After all, if they could do us wrong, we wouldn't have elected them in the first place, right?
1DI0008430	Yessir, trust in the judgement of other people to know what's best for me. It's the American way!
1DI0008431	Why... that's unthinkable! Where in the constitution does it say that we're supposed to run around questioning the government? Huh?
1DI0008432	Well.. when you put it that way... wait, you're just trying to confuse me with your fancy vault education and your textbooks!
1DI0008433	I'll have none of it! Did you have something else you wanted to ask, or were you done with your crazy talk?
1DI0008434	Well, when you put it that way... wait, you're just trying to confuse me with your fancy vault education and your textbooks!
1DI0008436	I don't mean to embarrass you, but maybe you should learn your history before you argue with a patriot.
1DI0008437	It's okay, though. That's what we have a government for, to do the hard things so we don't have to.
1DI0008438	But, what else did you want to know?
1DI0008439	Well, we can't all care. Besides, why should we have to? That's what the government is here for, to take care of that stuff.
1DI0008440	They're on the radio! They have been for years. President Eden talks about everything they're doing.
1DI0008441	They got flyin' robots all around, watching everything so they know what to do when they finally swoop in and clean this place up.
1DI0008442	You'll see. People think I'm just a crazy old man. Things'll be different when the Enclave gets here.
1DI0008443	They're the American government! The eagle! People comma we the! The more perfect union!
1DI0008444	Any time you want another lesson, come on by.
1DI0008445	Who, Gob? Well, if you can get past how he looks, he's a sweetheart. Colin's awfully hard on him, though.
1DI0008446	He don't talk about it much but apparently, there's a whole city of Ghouls somewhere down in DC.
1DI0008447	He's mentioned his mother a couple of times, but other than that, he won't really say.
1DI0008448	He's been here for... I guess about fifteen years now. Ever since Moriarty bought him off of those Slavers.
1DI0008449	With Gob? Well, he's sweet... and I know that he'd like to, it's just... well...
1DI0008450	I don't want to sound shallow or anything, I mean, I'm a whore, my standards aren't exactly high.
1DI0008451	But there are places even I won't go. Johnnies that are squishier than me are one of 'em.
1DI0008452	Well, the miserable bastard is hard on all of us. But Gob gets it the worst. I guess just because he's different, you know?
1DI0008453	Sure thing, baby. What did you have on your mind?
1DI0008454	It used to be that Colin decided that stuff. But, with him gone, I'm thinking about retiring. So, no new clients. Sorry.
1DI0008455	It takes you renting a room. Sleep in it, or don't. I don't care. I get paid either way.
1DI0008456	I told you Gob, it ain't the radio. The Enclave station comes in fine. It's Galaxy News. Their signal's been shit lately.
1DI0008457	Huh? Oh, you mean why was Gob banging on that radio? Well, out there in the Wastes, there are two stations that broadcast.
1DI0008458	There's the Enclave station. I don't know who they are, but I think it might just be some pre-war broadcast on a loop or something.
1DI0008459	And there's Galaxy News Radio. It's run by a guy named Three Dog somewhere down in DC. But the signal went down a while ago.
1DI0008460	Welcome to Megaton. Please stand clear of the gate.
1DI0008461	Welcome to Megaton. Friendliest town around.
1DI0008462	Need some grub? Try the Brass Lantern.
1DI0008463	Thirsty, partner? Try Moriarty's. Coldest drinks in the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0008464	Welcome to Megaton. Enjoy your stay.
1DI0008465	Welcome to Megaton. The bomb is perfectly safe. We promise.
1DI0008466	Ya'll be careful with that thar weapon, ya hear?
1DI0008467	Head on in, pardner. Ya'll enjoy your stay now.
1DI0008469	... <static> ...
1DI0008470	Bless you.
1DI0008471	No. Thank you.
1DI0008472	Certainly. It's the least I could do after all you've done.
1DI0008473	You're an example to us all.
1DI0008474	It does. Thank you.
1DI0008475	Please, keep doing what you do.
1DI0008476	If you're looking for a handout, you can forget it. But if you're looking for work, there's a favor you could do for me.
1DI0008477	If your successful, it'll provide the caps you need to pay me.
1DI0008478	Good. I hope she got what she deserved.
1DI0008479	You know, you're right -- I guess I do look like a sign post. [sighs] Where do you want to go?
1DI0008480	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, sweet child?
1DI0008481	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, brother?
1DI0008482	In each our own way, we are all lost. Where would you like to be, sister?
1DI0008483	Sure thing, partner. What do you need to find?
1DI0008484	Are you joking? Yes, there's a bar -- The Brass Lantern. It's easy to find since you're standing in it.
1DI0008485	I apologize, but I cannot encourage the consumption of alcohol. Alcohol impedes our personal quest for the Grand Division.
1DI0008486	Sure is -- Moriarty's. The entrance is on the top level, opposite the Main Gate.
1DI0008487	Just be careful. Moriarty is NOT your friend, no matter what he may say, so don't fall for his lies. And for god's sake, don't trust the man.
1DI0008488	Up at Moriarty's at the south end of town. Talk to Nova, she'll help you out.
1DI0008489	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. Take your time.
1DI0008490	Atom can only heal the wounds of the soul. For wounds of the body, you should see Doc Church. His clinic is directly to the north the Church.
1DI0008491	Our clinic is down in the crater, by the bomb. Doc Church is a little rough around the edges, but the man's got talent and compassion.
1DI0008492	You'll want to see Doc Church next to the Crater. You can't miss it.
1DI0008493	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply, although the true pilgrim relies on Atom to supply all that he needs.
1DI0008494	Moira sells all kinds of stuff at her place, Craterside Supply. Take a guess where it is? Heh heh heh heh.
1DI0008495	Seek out Moira at Craterside Supply. She's a darling girl.
1DI0008496	Check out Craterside Supply. It's on the western side of town.
1DI0008497	Oh, no problem. I'm not busy at all. Yep. Plenty of time to talk to strangers.
1DI0008498	What else do you require, sweet child?
1DI0008499	Sure thing. What's on your mind?
1DI0008500	What do you wish to discuss?
1DI0008501	Go see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
1DI0008502	It saddens me to think how quickly we resort to violence.
1DI0008503	You'll probably want to see Moira at Craterside Supply. She sells some weapons. Makes some too, from what I hear. Her place is down by the crater.
1DI0008505	With both Lucas and Colin dead, it's pretty much a free for all until someone steps up.
1DI0008506	Lucas Simms was the only guy we had to keep people in line. With him gone, I guess Moriarty pretty much runs the show around here.
1DI0008507	Moriarty thought he was. Not so much anymore, I guess. I'm surprised that Simms never took care of Moriarty himself.
1DI0008508	Well, Moriarty thinks he is, but Lucas Simms is the law around here and everyone knows it.
1DI0008510	Good morning! It's a great day at Roosevelt High School!
1DI0008521	You there! Put your weapons away, and come over here. No funny business unless you want to get shot.
1DI0008522	I won't hurt you if you come out and face me without your weapon drawn.
1DI0008523	Stop hiding. I won't hurt you if you're unarmed.
1DI0008524	If you don't put your weapons away, I'll start shooting.
1DI0008525	I'm warning you. Come peacefully or I'll shoot.
1DI0008526	I'm not playing around, come over here. We need to have a little chat. I don't want to waste bullets on your sorry hide.
1DI0008527	I'm not playing around, come over here.
1DI0008528	Stand down, squishy.  Present your ID on the double.
1DI0008529	ID accepted.  Resume your duties.
1DI0008530	ID invalid, you commie scum spy! Hands in the air!
1DI0008531	Time to pray to whatever heathen gods you believe in, commie.
1DI0008532	Loading Personality: General Atomics International V1.0 "Sergeant Major"...
1DI0008533	Sergeant Major reporting for duty... downloading orders from Central... FAILURE.
1DI0008534	Halt, intruder!  Unauthorized personnel will be handled with extreme violence.
1DI0008535	Initiating Combat Protocol: Charlie Zulu 4.
1DI0008536	...that batch of tests was inconclusive, but Madison and I are convinced it's a problem with the secondary filtration system.
1DI0008537	We're going to re-calibrate the equipment and try again tomorrow, so that... James, please, I'm trying to work. Now's not the time...
1DI0008538	So that's the next step. Assuming we get the results we need, we'll move on to...  James! Stop! I need to finish these notes...
1DI0008539	We'll move on to diagnosing the issues with the radiation dampeners. That should... Ow! James! Now? We really shouldn't... Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0008540	Great. If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
1DI0008541	I help Doctor Li when she needs equipment moved. I am no scientist, I just help with the heavy things.
1DI0008542	Fine, screw you.
1DI0008543	No, no. I am only here to help with moving things, lifting heavy equipment. I am no scientist.
1DI0008544	I simply help Doctor Li in whatever way I can.
1DI0008545	I should think it's rather obvious. They want the technology for themselves.
1DI0008546	You grew up in a Vault, never wanting for clean, fresh water. Out here in the real world it's hard to come by, and that makes it valuable.
1DI0008547	I'm assisting Rothchild with some of his research. I've worked with portable generators more extensively than he has.
1DI0008548	I don't really care for the idea that this is supporting some gigantic military robot, but given the state of things, I recognize the need for it.
1DI0008549	I'm MacCready. I run Little Lamplight, because they made me the mayor. And I don't like strangers. Or mungos.
1DI0008550	Doctor Madison Li. I am in charge of the science team based here at Rivet City.
1DI0008551	I am Garza. I help Doctor Li here in the lab.
1DI0008552	Yeah. Where'd that Behemoth come from? Good thing Lyons' little friend turned out to be so handy with a Fat Man.
1DI0008553	Yeah. Where'd that Behemoth come from?
1DI0008554	Civilians with nukes. Scary stuff. Anyway, a win's a win, right?
1DI0008555	No idea. Now he's going to be stinking up the place for weeks. Oh well, a win's a win, right?
1DI0008556	Galaxy News Radio is some loudmouth radio station located in the ruins of D.C.
1DI0008557	Three Dog, the king of that looney bin, keeps yapping about fighting some Good Fight or something. A bunch of crap.
1DI0008558	But I suppose if you wanted to know what was going on in the Wasteland, that's the place to go. Me, I could care less.
1DI0008559	You serious?
1DI0008560	Oh... you must have come from that Vault. Right.
1DI0008561	It's the only free radio station left in the Wasteland. The guy who runs it, Three Dog, he's like the only person who seems to give a shit.
1DI0008562	He keeps talking about fighting the Good Fight or something. Better than the crap on the other station.
1DI0008563	Mister Moriarty says we can keep it on. It's a good radio station.
1DI0008564	I like hearing the DJ, Three Dog and how he's helping to fight the Good Fight.
1DI0008565	Sigh. If only I was a part of that instead of being stuck in this dive...
1DI0008566	Sigh. That's his way. Always putting caps before people's lives.
1DI0008567	I wish someone would stand up to him one day. Oh my.... I shouldn't be saying all of this!
1DI0008568	I'm sorry, I really must get back to work. I can't get involved. I'm so sorry.
1DI0008569	I was like you once. I wandered into town looking for an escape from this stupid joke of a body I'm trapped in. Now look at me.
1DI0008570	Very well. Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the goings on in Megaton.
1DI0008571	If you can get onto that terminal, I bet he has information on your Dad.
1DI0008572	Now, get away from me, smoothskin. If Moriarty even suspects I told you this, I'm a dead Ghoul.
1DI0008573	All right! I'll tell you! Please, just don't hurt me!
1DI0008574	Moriarty keeps a computer terminal in the back. On it, he keeps all of the dirty secrets of Megaton.
1DI0008577	Look, smoothskin. I've told you all I dare. Moriarty doesn't like me chatting with the customers like this.
1DI0008578	If he even thought I was talking to you, he'd tan my hide!
1DI0008579	Let me get back to work now before he sees us.
1DI0008580	Moriarty is your best bet. I wish you luck. Now, I have to get back to work, or I'll be answering to him too.
1DI0008581	That's how we do it in the Lyons' Pride, you fucking freaks!
1DI0008582	Initiate! Shut it! You'll have your fill of death soon enough.
1DI0008583	Uh... Yessir. Sorry, Brother.
1DI0008584	Scared, stupid kid...
1DI0008585	Brotherhood mobile unit, report your status.
1DI0008586	We're clear out here. Stand down.
1DI0008587	Sentinel Lyons? Is that you?
1DI0008588	Who else? Always count on my father to send the best.
1DI0008589	Ha ha ha! Humble as always, Sarah.
1DI0008590	It's great to see you guys. It's been Super Mutant Central over here for days.
1DI0008591	You're telling me. Well, another mess cleaned up. We'll sweep the perimeter and be inside shortly.
1DI0008592	Copy that.
1DI0008593	All clear, Sentinel. Five mutants released from their torment. The rest are keeping their heads down.
1DI0008594	A new recruit?
1DI0008595	Welcome!
1DI0008596	You don't need to worry. You're with friends now. We'll see you safely through.
1DI0008597	Come with me if you like. We'll have the best view.
1DI0008598	I'm in position, sir.
1DI0008599	This looks like the main force. Many tormented souls will meet the Maker today. I will pray for forgiveness.
1DI0008600	Yes, ma'am.
1DI0008601	So how'd I do, Vargas? I pass my little trial run? Come on, Lyons' Pride needs me and you know it! That Citadel guard duty is such bullshit.
1DI0008602	Aw, come on. We just kicked their asses!
1DI0008603	Okay, okay.
1DI0008604	Now you're talking.
1DI0008605	Holy shit! What was that?
1DI0008606	All right! Now that's what I'm talking about!
1DI0008607	Is this the idiot who blew our ambush?
1DI0008608	Let's get back to the checkpoint. See if Colvin has finished clearing the street.
1DI0008609	What's the situation?
1DI0008611	Jennings?
1DI0008612	Just a stray we picked up. The one that blundered into the Uglies over on 42nd.
1DI0008613	All right. It's the usual drill. Reddin, you just do whatever Paladin Vargas says and keep your mouth shut.
1DI0008614	Okay, the outpost is just to the south of us. Colvin, you're the eyes.
1DI0008615	Vargas, Reddin, secure this building.
1DI0008617	OK. We'll flush them out, you pick them off. On my mark.
1DI0008618	Go.
1DI0008619	Take cover! Behemoth!
1DI0008620	Get the Fat Man! We'll try to keep him busy!
1DI0008621	It's not your fault, Vargas. Reddin was good enough for the Pride, and she proved it here today.
1DI0008622	When we get back to the Citadel, I'll talk to the scribes. Let it be chronicled that Paladin Reddin passed her test.
1DI0008623	That's all of 'em.
1DI0008624	Looks that way.
1DI0008625	Must be a tourist.
1DI0008626	Reddin, on me.
1DI0008627	You're doing fine. Just follow my lead. No dead heroes today, okay?
1DI0008628	Negative.
1DI0008629	Roger that. Uglies in our sights.
1DI0008630	Yeah, yeah. We'll see.
1DI0008631	Now knock that off. You're wasting ammo.
1DI0008632	We need to sweep the area. You think those were all the Uglies in D.C.? You take the east side, I'll go west.
1DI0008633	Once we're inside, then we'll celebrate.
1DI0008634	Reddin! Get out of there! Behemoth!
1DI0008635	Reddin!!
1DI0008636	God dammit!
1DI0008637	Yeah, I know. God DAMMIT!!
1DI0008638	Come on. Let's see if they've got anything to drink in this dump.
1DI0008639	Eager, eh? Good... I like that. It's nice to have a doer in this shithole of a town for a change.
1DI0008640	This junkie bitch named Silver borrowed quite a few caps from me... claimed she could start funneling Jet and Psycho to me for a good price.
1DI0008641	Problem is she scrammed with the loot and set herself up in Springvale so she can inject herself into a stupor.
1DI0008642	Get the caps she owes me and they're yours. Yours to pay me with anyway. He he he he he.
1DI0008643	Who said anything about dirty work? You need some caps, I'm giving you a way to get 'em. It's just business.
1DI0008647	Fine. Go find Daddy yourself then. I'll be here when you change your mind.
1DI0008648	Ha ha. Yeah, that's Colin's style all right. He sells information so much, you'd think the bar was just a hobby.
1DI0008649	Ohhh. You like it rough, huh? Well, that costs extra.
1DI0008650	Beat it, kid. Go look for Daddy somewhere else.
1DI0008651	Yeah, I help you, then Moriarty kicks my sweet ass out the door.
1DI0008652	Sorry, kid. If you want to know more, Moriarty is the only one who's going to help you.
1DI0008653	Talk to Gob. He hates Moriarty more than I do. Maybe he'll tell you something, but I doubt it.
1DI0008654	Mmmm. I'd love to spend time with you too.
1DI0008655	Look, I... can help you. Get into the back office of this place. Moriarty keeps a terminal there. Everything you want is inside the terminal.
1DI0008656	Here's the password to it. Too bad you're so young, kid. I could teach you some stuff you'd never forget...
1DI0008657	You been living under a rock? This is D.C. The entire city is crawling with Super Mutants. Now if you'll excuse me...
1DI0008658	I'm Sentinel Lyons of the Lyons' Pride. With the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0008659	Don't worry. We're on your side. At least I hope so.
1DI0008660	Kid, out here cocky will get you killed. I've seen a Super Mutant strike squad like that take down five well armed soldiers.
1DI0008661	But fine, next time you want to take them on yourself and buy yourself an early retirement, go right ahead.
1DI0008662	That stupid thing is his pride and joy. He keeps all of his dirty little secrets in it about everything that goes on in this godforsaken town.
1DI0008663	I once leaned on his shoulder when he was typing into it and he got pissed off and pushed me to the ground.
1DI0008664	I hate that fucking thing. It's all he cares about.
1DI0008665	"Information is a commodity" he keeps saying. I'd stay away from that thing if I were you.
1DI0008666	I can tell you to shove it up your ass, how's that, Mister Tough Guy!
1DI0008667	Yeah, and? So does ninety percent of Megaton. Take a number.
1DI0008668	Look, kid. I like you. But you gotta learn you can't stick your neck out too far in this world or it's liable to get cut off. I'm sorry.
1DI0008669	Oh, Mister Moriarty never lets me back there.
1DI0008670	If you need to get into the terminal, you should talk to Nova. She'll help you... but it may be expensive if you catch my meaning.
1DI0008671	Well, all right. You seem like a good kid. It isn't your fault Moriarty is such an asshole.
1DI0008672	Here's the password. Just don't mention to anyone that I gave it to you or I might be out on my ass like Silver.
1DI0008673	Nice attitude, jackass.
1DI0008674	No! Please! Don't hit me!
1DI0008675	I swear! I don't know anything about the terminal! Ask Nova. She's all over Moriarty all the time.
1DI0008677	Sure thing.
1DI0008678	Mmmmm. I bet you want in. But enough about us.
1DI0008679	Here's the password. Just make sure he isn't around when you use it.
1DI0008680	If I was your momma, I'd tan your hide for that kind of talk.
1DI0008681	Since I'm not, all I'm going to do is say goodbye.
1DI0008682	That's okay. This world has a way of getting under your skin and wiping the smile from your face. Makes you bitter. But you gotta fight that!
1DI0008683	Hey, hey. One thing at a time. Nah, your old man ain't here. Not anymore.
1DI0008684	He heard ole Three Dog on the radio, figured I knew what was what out here in the Capital Wasteland. And he was right. So I filled the old man in.
1DI0008685	But he split. Looks like I've got my way of contributing to the Good Fight... and he's got his own.
1DI0008686	Hey, when you're in the Good Fight, you gotta give it all you got and never ever hold back.
1DI0008687	Always dazzle 'em, I always say. Always dazzle 'em and spread the word.
1DI0008688	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
1DI0008689	Why don't you just sit back and relax?
1DI0008690	I'm not here to fight. At least, not you. Only fight I'm interested in is the Good Fight, and I wage that everyday on the airwaves.
1DI0008691	Yup! Guilty as charged! He he.
1DI0008692	I don't usually have exposure to the public like this. It's nice to know someone's listening.
1DI0008693	Makes carrying on the Good Fight that much easier.
1DI0008694	The fact that the Brotherhood let you get up here tells me you're all right with them. That, and your Dad seemed a decent enough guy.
1DI0008695	Besides, you're giving off a pretty sweet vibe right now. Maybe we can help each other out.
1DI0008696	But enough yakkin'. Tell me why we're talking.
1DI0008697	Oh come on. This is Three Dog you're talking to. I got my ear to the ground and I hear the wagons coming.
1DI0008698	But if you want help, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
1DI0008699	Oh come on. You're a splitting image of the guy. He's been here before, and now you're here. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
1DI0008700	You want to find your dad, and it just so happens his location is known to yours truly.
1DI0008701	But if you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
1DI0008702	Hey, I may have the biggest mouth in the Capital Wasteland, but I've also got the biggest ears.
1DI0008703	All sorts of people pass through our little oasis in the rubble and tell all sorts of interesting things.
1DI0008704	You want to know something? Ask and we'll work it out.
1DI0008705	I hear things all the time. Most things aren't useful, but once and a while something will sneak up behind your girl and lift her dress.
1DI0008706	Consider this your lucky day. I just so happen to know the location of an old military weapons cache untouched by time.
1DI0008707	If you want to know more, you're going to have to contribute to the Good Fight.
1DI0008709	He was here, at Galaxy News. We had a great conversation. He's a real stand-up guy.
1DI0008711	I have the name and the talent, but what I don't have are people to run out and do the stuff I need.
1DI0008712	Sure, the Brotherhood watches over the place, yeah. But that's all they can spare.
1DI0008713	Galaxy News needs a doer. Someone who can go out there into that wild, wooly world and get shit done. So, you game?
1DI0008714	Whoa, whoa. Smoke a peace pipe. Take a deep breath and count to ten. Whatever it is you need to do to calm down.
1DI0008715	You need Three Dog's help, and Three Dog needs your help. Let's get together and make it work.
1DI0008716	There are different fronts to every fight. Galaxy News Radio is one of them.
1DI0008717	I need help with the old girl, though, cause she's hurtin'.
1DI0008718	So I'd like to share, I really would, but if I help you, and you just leave me hangin'... I would have failed the Fight. And that can't happen. Dig?
1DI0008719	Imagine a picture, okay? A picture of the Capital Wasteland. All that brick and rock. A whole lot of nothing, right?
1DI0008720	There's people out there trying to just barely make it by from day to day. Fighting to stay alive and make something of what they got.
1DI0008721	But then you've got all kinds of shit... Slavers, Super Mutants, Raiders... They all want a slice of the pie too and aim to take it by force.
1DI0008722	Hey, not everyone's cut out for bigger and better things. Sometimes the smallest roles in the Good Fight are the most important.
1DI0008724	But enough of that. If it's your dad you seek, then I will abide.
1DI0008725	Hey now. There's no need for that kind of talk. I'm here to help, not to hurt.
1DI0008726	They can't, not against those kinds of enemies. They just run away and hide or they stay and die. It just ain't right.
1DI0008727	So that's where I enter the picture. I fight the Good Fight with GNR as my gun.
1DI0008728	The sound of truth goes out across the Capital Wasteland. Hell, someone's got to counter that bullshit on the Enclave station.
1DI0008729	Well, holy shit! Aren't you a chip off the old block? You ARE as smart as your dad.
1DI0008730	Since you know all about the cause, no need to explain the effect. Let's get you on your way.
1DI0008731	Patience, patience. Three Dog is like a minstrel. Give him some time and your ear and he'll soothe the soul.
1DI0008732	So back to the tale... I fight the Good Fight with GNR as my gun.
1DI0008733	The truth goes out across the Capital Wasteland and with it, the word about the Good Fight.
1DI0008734	Hey, now... I may be many things, but one thing I'm not is a pushover.
1DI0008735	It's obvious you're narrow of focus and can't see the bigger picture.
1DI0008736	We got one rule in the Good Fight, though. You want help, you gotta contribute!
1DI0008737	Three Dog is many things, but one thing he isn't is a pushover.
1DI0008738	It's obvious you're narrow of focus and can't see the bigger picture. Fine. I may have the answers you want.
1DI0008739	We got one rule in the Good Fight though. You want help, you gotta' contribute!
1DI0008740	Oh I have plenty of enemies that would love nothing more than to put a bullet between my eyes.
1DI0008741	The only thing keeping that from happening is Sarah Lyons and the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0008742	We've brokered a sweet deal. They keep me from taking a dirt nap, and I keep a strong roof over their head.
1DI0008743	You're absolutely right, but words get more and more people to join the cause. Guns just create more casualties on your side.
1DI0008744	But enough yarn spinning. Let's figure out your place in the Good Fight. Then maybe we can help you.
1DI0008745	Sorry. I'm so used to talking to an audience that can't answer I just assume you want to hear my voice all the time.
1DI0008748	So, you want to know where your dad is? Fair enough.
1DI0008750	From what I saw, they were the ones who saved your ass.
1DI0008751	They keep the ruins Super Mutant free so people like you can get to people like me in one piece.
1DI0008752	Without them, we'd be knee-deep in Mutie shit.
1DI0008753	Ok, friend. I've been calm. I've been cool. Now I've had enough of your hostility.
1DI0008754	You wanna be all business, fine. I can play like that.
1DI0008755	You want help, you help me. End of story. You ready or what?
1DI0008757	You wanna' be all business, fine. I can play like that.
1DI0008758	You want daddy, you help me. End of story. You ready or what?
1DI0008759	Whoa! You must be some kind of a psychic or something!
1DI0008760	Well, don't just stand there gawking... go bring that sucker to the Washington Monument so my lady can sing again!
1DI0008761	You aren't getting the dish for me, you're getting it for YOU.
1DI0008762	If you need some time to think it over, that's cool. But the longer GNR is quiet, the longer you have to wait.
1DI0008763	Wow, and here I thought you were in a rush. Whatever, man. Chat me up when you're ready.
1DI0008764	He he! I sure know how to pick 'em!
1DI0008765	You're going to be the best thing that ever happened to Galaxy News in a long time.
1DI0008766	If you need any more info, I'll be here waiting for you.
1DI0008767	Well, your dad is some sort of scientist type. Some kind of egghead or something.
1DI0008768	You really think if you find him he'd help our cause?
1DI0008769	When your dad passed through here, I spent a good long time talking to him about all kinds of stuff.
1DI0008770	He mentioned some scientific mumbo-jumbo which didn't make sense to me... ummm... something about a "Project Purity."
1DI0008771	He also said something about going to visit a Doctor Li in Rivet City. Then, he left in a hurry.
1DI0008772	Well good. I'm glad to see you realize there's more to life than just what you need; that there's a bigger picture.
1DI0008773	Ain't gonna be easy, though. You ready for this?
1DI0008774	You've never heard of Rivet City? Wow. Just... wow.
1DI0008775	Well, a whole bunch of eggheads got together and turned a beached aircraft carrier into a town. Pretty cool, huh?
1DI0008776	Just follow the river south from here... there's no way you can miss it.
1DI0008777	Goodbye. Remember to keep us tuned in while you're out there, and watch yourself.
1DI0008778	Don't forget about your promise... make sure your dad knows about the Good Fight.
1DI0008779	Yep. That shiny thing was our broadcast relay. Now it's swiss cheese. Without it, our broadcast range is quite limited.
1DI0008780	Of course the factory that made the relay dishes is long gone. Leveled. As in, we're never gonna' scavenge that part again.
1DI0008781	Oh, it gets worse.
1DI0008782	So, after it gets blown up I look into how to replace the sucker.
1DI0008783	Guess what? The factory that made the relay dishes is long gone. Leveled. As in, we'll never find that part again.
1DI0008784	Fine, fine...
1DI0008785	Since you're too impatient to listen to the details, I'll get to the point.
1DI0008786	The broadcast relay on the Washington Monument needs to be replaced and there's only one replacement for it.
1DI0008787	It's the dish off of the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
1DI0008788	It IS risky. I would never lie to you.
1DI0008789	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one who can get shit done"!
1DI0008790	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why Three Dog's helping you.
1DI0008792	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one that can get shit done"!
1DI0008794	Hey, I understand this isn't easy. I mean, most people would be crazy to even try what I'm about to propose.
1DI0008796	Your dad had that same look in his eyes too. That's why I'm helping you.
1DI0008797	Look. You approached me, remember? And no one said this would be a cake walk.
1DI0008798	But there's something behind those eyes of yours that screams "I'm the one who can get shit done!"
1DI0008800	One of the Brotherhood guys that passed through here mentioned seeing a dish in one of D.C.'s old museums.
1DI0008802	I want you to get it and bring it to the Washington Monument to replace the bad one. That's it.
1DI0008803	Well, I guess I was wrong about you. Maybe you don't have that spark.
1DI0008804	I would never make a man do what he doesn't want to do. That's what freedom is all about.
1DI0008805	But I have to stick to the deal. No dish, no dad. You'll be on your own. You sure you want it that way?
1DI0008806	I want to make sure I'm perfectly clear on this -- the Good Fight is bigger than you and your dad.
1DI0008807	I'll do whatever it takes to keep the Capital Wasteland free. Whatever. It. Takes.
1DI0008808	And right now, without GNR at full strength, my words are being wasted. And that just ain't acceptable.
1DI0008809	Good, 'cause this isn't going to be easy.
1DI0008810	Galaxy News Radio is my baby. I love it, I feed it, I keep it changed. But there's one problem, no one outside D.C. can hear her cry.
1DI0008811	You see, some brainless Super Mutant thought it would be funny to shoot at the shiny round thing on the Washington Monument.
1DI0008815	Wow, I thought you were in a rush. Whatever, man. Chat me up when you're ready.
1DI0008816	That's a negative.
1DI0008817	We've got too many local conscripts as it is. Most are undertrained and too damned trigger happy for their own good.
1DI0008818	Our very own Initiate Reddin is a sterling example.
1DI0008819	I'm sure.
1DI0008820	You can handle yourself, I'll give you that.
1DI0008821	But let's not get carried away.
1DI0008822	The name's Sarah Lyons, Sentinel and squad commander of the Lyons' Pride. We're with the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0008823	We do our best to hold back the Super Mutants in this area. But when civilians stumble into our sights, that gets a bit difficult. Doesn't it?
1DI0008824	I'll take that as a compliment.
1DI0008825	If we don't try to keep the mutants from killing everyone and everything in the Capital Wasteland, who will?
1DI0008826	The Brotherhood does its best, but sometime's it takes a little something... special. That's where the Lyons' Pride comes in.
1DI0008827	There aren't a lot of safe places in the ruins right now, but the Galaxy News Radio building is sort of our port in the storm.
1DI0008828	Unfortunately, the building's been hit pretty hard lately. We're their backup. So if there are no more questions, we really need to move out.
1DI0008829	Well, the Brotherhood needed a secure outpost, and the guy who runs the radio station needed to not get his head ripped off by Super Mutants.
1DI0008830	It's a mutually beneficial relationship.
1DI0008831	Three Dog is the man in charge. He keeps that signal broadcasting, pretty much single handedly. He's um... interesting. I'll give him that much.
1DI0008832	She died well.
1DI0008833	In the end, that's all that really matters.
1DI0008834	Vault-Tec welcomes you to our new line of subterranean vaults featuring our patented Triple-S Technology.
1DI0008835	Triple-S Technology is Vault-Tec's convergence of the three most important parts of apocalyptic endurance: Safety, Survivability and Sanitation!
1DI0008836	Sleep in quiet comfort knowing that our impenetrable vault doors can withstand a direct hit by an atomic bomb with only a projected 2% failure rate.
1DI0008837	Being underground got you down? Smile! Our SimuSun Lighting mimics the feeling of being outside with only a fraction of the sunburn potential.
1DI0008838	The living sections make use of our revolutionary Floorsuck Autocleaner System for those darned messy kids. Never sweep again!
1DI0008839	Moms will love how our Culinator 3000 Kitchen System makes cooking a breeze. Mmmmm, I can smell the muffins baking now!
1DI0008840	Bored? Don't be! Step into our Entertainotron Room and watch the latest holotapes or perhaps listen to a symphony. Another Vault-Tec innovation!
1DI0008841	Concerns about security? Our Eye-On-You Cameras enable the Vault's leader to watch your every move. You'll never be alone again!
1DI0008842	Should the unlikely event arise that the planet is laid to waste, you'll feel happy knowing your family will be safe in a Vault-Tec Vault.
1DI0008843	We hope you've enjoyed our tour today. If you have any further questions, please take a brochure from our helpful Vault-Tec guides.
1DI0008844	For as long as history has been recorded, man has had an insatiable hunger for knowledge regarding the universe.
1DI0008845	To understand why man is so interested in this unknown expanse of space around our little world, we must take a journey.
1DI0008846	Please, sit back, relax and free yourself from the bonds of our planet as we take off for the stars! [bzzzzt!]
1DI0008847	This holotape contains the location of the weapons cache.
1DI0008848	I hope you put them to good use and keep up the fight.
1DI0008849	Remember to keep us tuned in while you're out there, and watch yourself.
1DI0008850	This holotape contains the location of the military weapons cache.
1DI0008853	Fine. Some people just don't appreciate the spoken word.
1DI0008854	This holotape contains the location of the military weapons cache. I hope you put them to good use and keep up the fight.
1DI0008856	Now hang on a second there. Three Dog can't let you walk away from here empty-handed like this.
1DI0008857	I heard you found out about your Dad on your own, and yet you went ahead and kept your promise to me. That takes some real moxie, kid.
1DI0008858	Here, I want you to take this. I was saving it for someone special... someone who could really help with the Good Fight.
1DI0008859	It contains the location of an old weapons cache. You're welcome to help yourself to anything inside.
1DI0008860	Yeah, I heard you found out about your Dad, and yet you went ahead and kept your promise to me. That takes some real moxie, kid.
1DI0008861	Three Dog can't let you walk away from here empty-handed after all that.
1DI0008864	Don't ever let anyone make you think that fighting the Good Fight is a waste of time!
1DI0008865	Whether you like it or not, you just made a difference in the world.
1DI0008868	Okay. Go for it.
1DI0008869	Hey, you're the one who deserves all the thanks! You struck a major blow against tyranny!
1DI0008870	Now GNR can be heard clear across the Capital Wasteland again. That'll give Eden and those Muties something to think about.
1DI0008873	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about that military weapons cache.
1DI0008876	But before I get back to my calling, I bet you wanna hear about your Dad.
1DI0008877	And well done indeed.
1DI0008885	Smoke a peace pipe, man. You know, you are so unlike your father...
1DI0008887	I suppose that's what you wanna know about that military weapons cache next?
1DI0008889	I suppose that's what you wanna know next?
1DI0008891	Well, a whole bunch of people got together and turned a beached aircraft carrier into a town. Pretty cool, huh?
1DI0008894	Look, I appreciate what you did for me. And I especially appreciate what you did for the people, by fixing up my station.
1DI0008895	But an attitude like that ain't winning you any brownie points.
1DI0008896	That's all I know, and that's all I'm gonna say about it. So why don't you move on now.
1DI0008897	Why candy-coat the news when the world is in danger?
1DI0008898	People like the Enclave would have you believe everything is calm and totally under control. They're lying.
1DI0008899	Hell, President Eden goes around spreading peace, love and government, but no one even knows how old that Enclave signal really is.
1DI0008900	People need to hear the truth. It's a harsh world. We've got to work together to make it better. Not wait for Uncle Sam to ride in and save the day.
1DI0008902	And now that we know the Enclave isn't a figment of everyone's imagination, my work is even more important.
1DI0008903	People need to know the truth about President Eden and his goons. Those fascists won't stop until they control every last one of us.
1DI0008904	You've got to understand! If I die, so does the voice of the people! I can't take that risk.
1DI0008905	Your idea of saving the world means combing through the rubble and using a gun. I use my voice. We're two sides of the same coin.
1DI0008906	If you think always being a target of your enemies is "safe," then you got a funny way of looking at things.
1DI0008907	Parents? Ha! I was born from the sun and have sand in my veins.
1DI0008908	Ha ha! Just messing with you.
1DI0008909	My parents were very cool. They preached all about the haters and their bullshit... how to tell the propaganda from the real deal.
1DI0008910	Well, it's only the tallest thing left in the city.
1DI0008911	When you step out of the Museum, take a good look across the Mall. You can't miss it.
1DI0008912	Just be careful, there may still be a security barrier around it.
1DI0008913	Head out the back door of GNR and take the Collapsed Car Tunnel to the other side of Dupont. Then take the metro tunnels until you're there.
1DI0008914	Hey, be careful though... you'll have to find another way back 'cause it's a one-way trip.
1DI0008915	You did?
1DI0008916	Well, I hope that doesn't mean you're throwing in the towel. My baby still needs your help.
1DI0008917	Tell you what. Head back out and finish what you started and I'll rummage around the place and see what I can find that'll tickle your taste buds.
1DI0008918	When your dad passed through here, he and I talked for a good long time. He's a real stand-up kind of guy.
1DI0008919	He mentioned some scientific mumbo-jumbo which didn't make sense to me and mentioned something called "Project Purity".
1DI0008921	Whoa now... take it easy. You asked, so I will provide.
1DI0008925	Whoa now... dry your eyes. A promise is a promise and I will provide.
1DI0008929	Without this place, D.C. would be filled with that crap the Enclave keeps shoveling out on their "radio station," and festering with Muties.
1DI0008930	Someone's got to tell the Wastelanders what time it is, and Three Dog is the one to do it.
1DI0008931	No one knows what Eden and his Horsemen of the Apocalypse are up to, but you can be sure it isn't in the common man's best interest.
1DI0008932	Ha! Man's monument to his own demise. All the garbage they displayed in there is the reason half of the world was blown to shit.
1DI0008933	That shithole is located just off the Mall. You know, that huge space in the center of the city in front of the Capitol.
1DI0008934	Be careful, the whole place is swarming with Super Mutants.
1DI0008935	Well, if you check out your radio, you can hear pretty good in this place. Get a few blocks away, still not too bad, maybe a little static.
1DI0008936	Step outside the city limits, and its snake city... nothing but "hissssssss."
1DI0008937	With the relay back on, you'll hear GNR clearly in the whole Capital Wasteland area like it used to be.
1DI0008938	Three Dog's seen it all. The Capital Wasteland at its ugliest.
1DI0008939	People killed for scraps of food, wounded children wandering aimlessly. Some seriously fucked up shit.
1DI0008940	If it wasn't for the Good Fight, I think I would have gone crazy by now.
1DI0008941	We're back at work after a full week of delays. The Brotherhood soldiers were able to repair the sentry guns, much to my relief.
1DI0008942	I know Madison isn't comfortable having them here, but there's no denying that we'd be lost without them.
1DI0008943	We're still waiting on the full analysis of the last three small-scale purification tests.
1DI0008944	Catherine hasn't been feeling well, and it's slowing down our research. I don't mind, but I can tell it's bothering some of the others.
1DI0008945	So here I am, back where it all began. Project Purity. God, we wanted to change the world. We really thought the "waters of life" could be a reality.
1DI0008946	And that's why this is a momentous occasion. Because even after nineteen years, I still believe it.
1DI0008947	Project Purity can and will be operational. This is just the beginning.
1DI0008948	This is day two of my attempt to resurrect this project.
1DI0008949	I've got one of the portable fusion generators up and running, but it's just enough to power the emergency lighting and a couple of other systems.
1DI0008950	That will serve for now, but I'll need help powering up the mainframe. Time to visit Madison at Rivet City.
1DI0008951	I spoke with Doctor Li... Madison... at Rivet City. It went about as well as I expected.
1DI0008952	That is to say, she thinks I'm completely mad. How can I blame her?
1DI0008953	She's got her own life, her own team, and is making real, tangible scientific progress.
1DI0008954	And here I come again, the very paragon of failure and false promises.
1DI0008955	But the reality is I need Madison, and whatever scientific team she may have assembled. I can't do this myself.
1DI0008956	Project Purity is bigger than me. It always was. And without Catherine... God, I can't let this die. Not again. Not like this.
1DI0008957	Even in Vault 101, my work on Project Purity never really stopped.
1DI0008958	Soon after we arrived, my nightly routine included sneaking into the restricted areas, searching for... I don't know. Whatever I could find.
1DI0008959	It was a Vault-Tec facility, after all. The place was built with some of the most advanced technology this country had ever developed.
1DI0008960	Those excursions never turned up anything particularly useful. So... one night, after half a bottle of scotch, I broke into the Overseer's office.
1DI0008961	It was easy enough to hack his console, gain access to the restricted files. Most of it was garbage.
1DI0008962	Propaganda, spy reports, just plain rambling bullshit, really.
1DI0008963	But there was one thing, one name that stood out amongst all the others -- Doctor Stanislaus Braun.
1DI0008964	I knew of Braun's work, of course.
1DI0008965	He was a celebrity in his day, Vault-Tec's "Sorcerer Scientist," leaving his peers in awe of his technological wizardry.
1DI0008966	But it was in Vault 101, that night in the Overseer's office...
1DI0008967	I first learned of Braun's involvement in Vault-Tec's Societal Preservation Program, and his work on something called the G.E.C.K.
1DI0008968	The Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
1DI0008969	To be honest, the G.E.C.K. sounded like pure fantasy, even for someone of Braun's capabilities.
1DI0008970	It was nothing short of a miracle -- a terraforming module, capable of producing life from complete lifelessness.
1DI0008971	But not only was this thing a reality, it was actually distributed to several vaults, to be used after an atomic war.
1DI0008972	Vault 101 was, sadly, not on that list.
1DI0008973	I did some digging, and discovered Braun's name on the reservation list for a Vault 112.
1DI0008974	I'm no slouch, but this man... He could have easily succeeded where I failed.
1DI0008975	Does his collected knowledge remain within the halls of Vault 112? Journals, holotapes, computer records, maybe even experiments...
1DI0008976	If I could gain access to just a fraction of Braun's genius, Project Purity would become a reality.
1DI0008977	I'm off to Vault 112 to search for anything of Braun's that might help me get this purifier up and running.
1DI0008978	All I know is that it's west of someplace called Evergreen Mills, and it's well-hidden in some sort of garage, but I'll find it. I have to.
1DI0008979	It's so close, but that's the story of Project Purity, isn't it? An eternity of "almost theres."
1DI0008980	Let's see if Braun has the missing puzzle piece.
1DI0008981	Well, there's no more mystery behind Catherine's health problems.
1DI0008982	The news of her pregnancy has lifted the spirits of everyone here, and given us a renewed interest in making the purifier work.
1DI0008983	We now have a future generation to provide for.
1DI0008984	The latest tests show that our methods are horribly inefficient, but I think we're on the right track.
1DI0008985	Catherine refuses to rest; she insists on spending all day in the lab. I've never seen her more driven.
1DI0008986	She's determined to resolve the power problems before the baby is born. I've tried to reason with her, but it's no use.
1DI0008987	The team has made plans to scale back our work once the baby is born.
1DI0008988	We're also trying to compensate for the increase in mutant attacks; no one is really talking about the implications of it.
1DI0008989	There are more of them than before. We know it, and the Brotherhood soldiers know it.
1DI0008990	Our relationship with the Brotherhood is straining.
1DI0008991	They're concerned by the lack of concrete results from the project, especially in light of the mutant attacks.
1DI0008992	They haven't come out and said it, but we all know what's going on.
1DI0008993	They're questioning whether their involvement in our project is worth the trouble it's causing them.
1DI0008994	They lost two good men this week, with three more injured.
1DI0008995	I am at a loss. My beloved wife is gone. In her place is my son, small and helpless.
1DI0008996	As much as this place means to me... As much as it meant to Catherine, this is no place for an infant.
1DI0008997	Especially an infant without his mother.
1DI0008998	I am at a loss. My beloved wife is gone. In her place is my daughter, small and helpless.
1DI0009000	Especially an infant without her mother.
1DI0009001	It's time to go. The project was in trouble before, both internally and externally.
1DI0009002	Progress has come to a halt, both because our re-calculations have gotten us nowhere, and because the mutant attacks occur several times a day.
1DI0009003	I regret that it has come to this. I know that if I leave, our work may come to an end.
1DI0009004	Madison has never been on the best of terms with the Brotherhood; aside from Scribe Rothchild, she'll tolerate none of them.
1DI0009005	If she's the one dealing with them, who knows what will happen.
1DI0009006	It breaks my heart to go, but I must put the needs of my child before my own.
1DI0009007	Well. Here we are again. Project Purity and me. It's been close to twenty years since my last entry.
1DI0009008	Since I left all of this behind to make a life for my son.
1DI0009009	We've spent that time in Vault 101, tucked away from the rest of the world.
1DI0009010	It wasn't perfect, but it was safe, and that's all I could have hoped for.
1DI0009011	Now, my son is a grown man. Handsome, intelligent, confident. Just like his old man. Hmph.
1DI0009012	And as hard as it was to admit it, he doesn't need his daddy anymore.
1DI0009014	Since I left all of this behind to make a life for my daughter.
1DI0009017	Now, my daughter is a grown woman. Beautiful, intelligent, confident. Just like her mother.
1DI0009018	And as hard as it was to admit it, she doesn't need her daddy anymore.
1DI0009019	All right, all right. You can go on in. If I hear about any trouble, you're gonna wind up in the river. You get me?
1DI0009020	Doctor Li, eh?
1DI0009021	Well then I guess you'd have to ask Doctor Li for more information.
1DI0009022	Go on up, then. She's probably in the Science Lab. But keep your nose clean, you hear me?
1DI0009023	Oh yeah? And I'm a fairy princess.
1DI0009024	You keep up this smart-ass attitude, and you're gonna wind up floating face-down in the river.
1DI0009025	It matters because I don't let just anybody wander around on this boat. I'm responsible for these people.
1DI0009026	So either you tell me what I want to know, or you don't get on. It's pretty damned simple.
1DI0009027	And who might your father be? If he lives on this boat, I know him.
1DI0009028	Thanks for visiting Rivet City. Don't feel compelled to stop by again anytime soon.
1DI0009029	Yeah? Let me guess -- no, she's not expecting you, but it's really important and you need to see her right away.
1DI0009030	Been a lot of that going around lately, and I've had just about enough of it. So you're going to have to do better than that.
1DI0009031	On this boat, you sure as hell do. You don't get on without my say-so.
1DI0009032	So I'll ask you again: what are you doing here?
1DI0009034	All right, you're free to roam around, so long as you don't do anything stupid like try to slit my throat when I'm sleeping.
1DI0009035	You wouldn't try anything stupid like that, now would you?
1DI0009036	Fine. Just don't bother her. She's real busy, what with all her work.
1DI0009037	She's up in the Science Lab.
1DI0009038	Hmm. Older guy, in his fifties or so?
1DI0009039	I remember him. He left already, but Doctor Li might know more.
1DI0009040	All right, you can go on up. She'll be in the Science Lab. Just don't cause any trouble, or else you're going to answer to me.
1DI0009041	Err, what? I don't know much about her work.
1DI0009042	You'll have to ask her about that, I guess. She's probably in the Science Lab.
1DI0009043	Just keep out of trouble on my boat.
1DI0009044	Yeah, yeah. Fine. But I've got my eye on you. You hear me?
1DI0009045	You step out of line while you're on my boat, and you and me are going to have words.
1DI0009046	Now get out of here. The Doctor's up in her lab.
1DI0009048	I'm quite sure I don't know. Why don't you ask him that?
1DI0009049	Your father is no longer here, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't use that tone with me.
1DI0009050	Did you? I was under the impression that's exactly the opposite of what he wanted for you.
1DI0009051	Well, you won't find him here. He's come and gone already.
1DI0009053	So you decided to leave one of the safest places in the Wasteland, even though it was in your best interest to stay. Sounds familiar.
1DI0009054	Well I'm afraid your father is no longer here.
1DI0009055	You were too young to remember, and I suppose James never spoke of me. Typical.
1DI0009056	I am Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your parents many years ago. Now I run the Science Lab here in Rivet City.
1DI0009057	It was all I had left. When your mother died, your father decided to leave with you. He abandoned our work. We had no choice but to do the same.
1DI0009058	I... I don't know. He said he was going back to the lab.
1DI0009059	Haven't you seen him?
1DI0009060	Well, yes... He was, but he left. He made some rather ridiculous requests of me, and I told him I couldn't help him.
1DI0009061	He said he'd work alone if he had to, and went back to the lab. You haven't seen him?
1DI0009062	No... wasn't he at the lab?
1DI0009063	This is all just too much to bear right now.
1DI0009064	Well yes, of course I do. Don't you know who I am? I suppose James never told you. Typical.
1DI0009065	I am Doctor Madison Li. I worked with your father many years ago. Your mother as well, in fact.
1DI0009066	You'll have to forgive me. This has all been very stressful, what with your father suddenly showing up here after being gone for so long.
1DI0009067	You have to understand that I... We put all of that behind us. Project Purity, our work, all of it. We've moved on, even if your father hasn't.
1DI0009068	Calm down, calm down!
1DI0009069	What are you doing here? James said you were still in the Vault. Look, this is all terribly irrational.
1DI0009070	Your father just shows up here as if nothing happened... He walked out on us. I know he had his reasons, I know it was to protect you, but still.
1DI0009071	Project Purity was our life. It was the only thing that mattered, and then he just gave up. He abandoned us, and we were forced to move on.
1DI0009072	I've already told him that it's over. There's no going back. Project Purity was a failure, and he needs to move on.
1DI0009073	I suppose I can spare a few stimpaks. It's not much, but it might make things easier for you.
1DI0009074	You understand. I have enough to worry about already.
1DI0009075	I can't tell you anything more than I told James. I know who Braun was, yes, but he lived before the war.
1DI0009076	The odds of any of his research surviving after all this time... Well, it just doesn't make sense to go looking for it.
1DI0009077	James kept talking about this Vault, 112 he said, and insisting we should go there. It's just madness.
1DI0009078	He's out of his mind. I told him, over and over, that there was no use trying to revive the project now. It's just too late.
1DI0009079	I'm sorry, but I haven't seen him since our recent... disagreement.
1DI0009080	If he's intent on tracking down Dr. Braun, he's probably gone off to that Vault.
1DI0009081	No, I don't. I'm sorry.
1DI0009082	Is this something to do with Dr. Braun? He kept talking about it while he was here. I told him it was a lost cause.
1DI0009083	The whole project is a lost cause. I wish he could see that. It's been too long. It's too late to go back.
1DI0009084	He was here, yes. It was quite a shock to see him after so many years.
1DI0009085	I'm afraid he's gone now.
1DI0009086	Yes, I did. I'm sorry that you never had time with her.
1DI0009087	She was... She was a good woman. We didn't always agree, but I respected her work as a scientist.
1DI0009088	Your father... He loved her very much.
1DI0009089	I don't have to justify myself to you, you know.
1DI0009090	Look, I appreciate that your father still wants to see Project Purity running. For the rest of us, though...
1DI0009091	It's just been too long. Too much has happened, and going back now would be a waste. It's just not worth it.
1DI0009092	Project Purity was everything to us. It was the first thing we thought about when we woke up, the last thing we talked about before sleep.
1DI0009093	Some of us changed over the years, but apparently James hasn't.
1DI0009094	Yes, well... I'm sorry it wasn't enough.
1DI0009095	As I said, I am sorry. I'm afraid I can't go back and change the past.
1DI0009096	I'm sorry you never had the chance to know her. She was... She was a good woman.
1DI0009097	Well I know he was going there. Perhaps there's some indication of what he was up to. Did you find any notes?
1DI0009098	James was always taking notes. Recordings, holotapes... that sort of thing. Go back and search for something like that if you're so determined.
1DI0009099	Holotapes? Did you listen to them? Your father was obsessive about taking notes. One of them might have something useful.
1DI0009100	I'm going to tell you the same thing I told your father. Don't go.
1DI0009101	Whatever's left there, it isn't worth it anymore. The project was abandoned. We gave up. There's no reason to go back.
1DI0009102	Fine. Suit yourself.
1DI0009103	It's in the old Jefferson Memorial building northwest of here, along the river.
1DI0009104	It's in the old Jefferson Memorial building, northwest of here.
1DI0009105	Please don't go after him. It was foolish of him to even think about going there alone.
1DI0009107	It's not a safe place, and I wouldn't recommend going alone. As I said, I told your father not to go.
1DI0009108	James? He was very driven. Determined to change the world. Well, we all were back then, I suppose.
1DI0009109	He was focused on two things, really. Making Project Purity work, and your mother.
1DI0009110	When she died, I think... I think he gave up. I know he wanted to keep you safe, but I think part of what he did was run away.
1DI0009111	But it seems that he never really was able to get over the idea. I'm frankly shocked that he waited all this time, and wants to try again.
1DI0009112	Complications from childbirth. None of us were expecting it; we weren't as prepared as we could have been.
1DI0009113	You have to understand, we were struggling with scavenged, derelict equipment. We did everything we could.
1DI0009114	Yes... Your mother was, well she was a good woman. A very dedicated scientist. Your father loved her very much.
1DI0009115	It was a shame that she died. She had been excited to meet you.
1DI0009116	It was simple, really. "Fresh, clean water for everyone." Such a simple idea, and yet so impossible to realize.
1DI0009117	The plan was to build a facility that could purify all the water in the Tidal Basin at once. No radiation, no muck, just clear water.
1DI0009118	It just turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated.
1DI0009119	We had the basic principles down; we understood most of the science behind it. But the radiation in the area is so pervasive...
1DI0009120	Small-scale tests were fine. But any time we tried to test the process on a larger scale, it was just too much.
1DI0009121	Maybe if we'd had more time, or better equipment...
1DI0009122	You happened.
1DI0009123	It wasn't just you; we had more problems than we could handle already, but your birth is what finally pushed it over the edge.
1DI0009124	Your father decided that you were more important than everything we'd been working for, and he left. He left all of us.
1DI0009125	Once he was gone, the Brotherhood decided we weren't worth their time anymore. Without their protection, we had to abandon the purifier.
1DI0009126	Look, I don't want to be harsh, but I have problems of my own.
1DI0009127	I don't have the resources to support James' foolish endeavors, or your chasing after him. I'm sorry.
1DI0009128	What? Well, I... I'm not sure what there is to tell.
1DI0009129	Your father and I... We worked together for a long time. I think we were really on to something.
1DI0009130	But then there were... complications. The project was abandoned, and your father disappeared.
1DI0009131	I returned here to Rivet City, and established the lab you see before you now.
1DI0009132	Project Purity, we called it. What do you want to know?
1DI0009133	This is the Rivet City Science lab.
1DI0009134	It's taken many long years to put together, but we've done well for ourselves.
1DI0009135	Our work on portable fusion power and hydroponics are coming along quite nicely, if not quite according to schedule.
1DI0009136	Yes, I do. I told him repeatedly that it's too late, that the project is too far gone to be revived.
1DI0009137	He insisted he can just pick up where we left off 20 years ago, and said he could prove it to me.
1DI0009138	So he headed off to the old lab. I advised against it, but he went anyway.
1DI0009139	Your father insisted that we return to work on Project Purity. I tried telling him too much time has passed; there's no way it would work.
1DI0009140	Predictably, he refused to listen to me. He says he can prove it will work, and headed off to the old lab.
1DI0009141	I'm sorry. I don't know what else to tell you.
1DI0009142	Look, whatever's going on between the two of you is the least of my concerns right now.
1DI0009143	Against my advice, your father returned to the old lab. He said he had some unfinished business to take care of.
1DI0009144	Well I don't know where he is. The last I knew, he was going back to the old lab.
1DI0009145	Now will you kindly leave? I have work to do.
1DI0009146	Hostilities will not be tolerated.
1DI0009147	Please put on your standard-issue Vault-Tec suit before using the Tranquility Lounger.
1DI0009148	A Tranquility Lounger is available. Please be seated.
1DI0009149	Please find the nearest Tranquility Lounger and be seated.
1DI0009150	Please take a seat in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
1DI0009151	Please refrain from disturbing our other residents.
1DI0009152	Please do not disturb the other residents. Take your seat.
1DI0009153	I did see a man talking to Doctor Li, but I really shouldn't be discussing it.
1DI0009154	She's already in a bad mood. I'd hate to make it worse.
1DI0009155	You should probably just talk to her about it.
1DI0009156	Look, some of us are trying to get work done here. There have been enough disruptions recently.
1DI0009157	Anybody coming through here would have to talk to Doctor Li; why don't you go bother her about it?
1DI0009158	On the contrary, I believe you'll find that here, I can do most anything I like.
1DI0009159	Now, let's discuss your next task.
1DI0009160	The Rockwells live such a happy life. Their marriage is the cornerstone of that life.
1DI0009161	Destroy their marriage. How you do it is up to you, but you may not kill either of them.
1DI0009162	An excellent question. Timmy was easy, and therefore boring. I desire some real entertainment.
1DI0009163	The Rockwells are the picture of a happy marriage. Change that. Split them up, without killing either of them.
1DI0009164	If you can do that, I'll have a good laugh and then we'll talk some more.
1DI0009165	Ha ha. You're not really in a position to be demanding anything, are you?
1DI0009166	Still, you've proven amusing thus far. Let's see if you can keep it up.
1DI0009167	Isn't it obvious by now? You've only been here a short while and you're already doing just as I ask.
1DI0009168	And now we come to your next game. Succeed, and there may be something in it for you.
1DI0009169	Ah ah ah! That's another question, and you've already had your answer for now.
1DI0009170	If you want more, you'll have to prove you're worth my time. Continue to amuse me, and I may answer more questions.
1DI0009171	Hmm. No, no I don't think so.
1DI0009172	We haven't yet plumbed the depths of your ability to amuse me. I think you'll do a few more things for me first.
1DI0009173	Ahhh, now that is just the sort of question you should be asking.
1DI0009174	You understand that I am in control, then. Excellent. You are far more promising than your father.
1DI0009175	Were I you, I'd be more concerned with myself at the moment.
1DI0009176	And besides, we're done with questions for now. Perhaps we'll address it at a later time. First, I have something else for you to do.
1DI0009177	Oh, come now. Would you court death so brazenly?
1DI0009178	I suggest you think twice before insulting me again. Now, there are things for you to do.
1DI0009179	But I am helping you!
1DI0009180	I am answering questions... More than the one original question I granted you, I might add. And now I think it is time you do something for me.
1DI0009181	Why not? I have been in this place for two hundred years. This is something to keep me amused.
1DI0009182	Much like my willingness to entertain your questions. Though now I grow bored, so I think I shall set you to a new task.
1DI0009183	An interesting choice... Certainly not what I had anticipated.
1DI0009184	Simply put, you leave when I say so. This place is under my control, and I dictate the terms. If I decide to let you go, you may go.
1DI0009185	Pay a visit to the Rockwells. They're very happily married, and I'd like you to change that.
1DI0009186	Put an end to their marriage, and we'll talk.
1DI0009187	Rationalize it any way you'd like. If you succeed, we'll continue our discussion.
1DI0009188	Excellent. I so enjoy that "can-do" spirit.
1DI0009189	Then I'm afraid we have nothing more to say to one another.
1DI0009190	No? Then I'm afraid you'll never be leaving.
1DI0009191	I decide when you may leave, and unless you start cooperating, you're going to have a very long stay here on Tranquility Lane.
1DI0009192	Then once again we find ourselves at an impasse. How disappointing.
1DI0009193	Tranquility Lane is a simulation, a reality designed to play home to the denizens of Vault 112.
1DI0009194	It was my last and greatest project. I am quite grateful that I was placed directly in charge of it.
1DI0009195	There have been... unexpected benefits to living here.
1DI0009196	Ah, yes. A predictable question, I suppose.
1DI0009197	Your father is here, in Tranquility Lane. He is quite safe for now, though he can no longer hound me with his incessant questioning.
1DI0009198	Perhaps you will see more of him in time.
1DI0009199	Your father?
1DI0009200	I was known as Dr. Stanislaus Braun, but here I choose this identity.
1DI0009201	Do you find it unsettling? In this place I can choose to be whatever I wish, and this is what I have chosen.
1DI0009202	You will find that I control a great deal around here.
1DI0009203	Oh, come now. Show some enthusiasm!
1DI0009204	There are fewer rules this time. I'd like to see just what you're capable of.
1DI0009205	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Please put some effort into it; do something creative. Beating her to death won't impress me.
1DI0009206	Ah, now that's the spirit.
1DI0009207	Let's raise the stakes. I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson.
1DI0009208	But do put some effort into it. Make it creative; beating her to death simply won't suffice.
1DI0009209	Your sarcasm is unappreciated. This could be so much fun if you'd allow yourself to see it.
1DI0009210	Now, Mabel Henderson needs to die. Not just any death, mind you, but an entertaining, well thought-out death. You'll see to that.
1DI0009211	Very simple. Plenty of opportunity to show me what you're capable of.
1DI0009212	Attempting to maintain the illusion of control, are we? How quaint. Very well...
1DI0009213	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Do something unique, something unexpected. Surprise me.
1DI0009214	You have amused me thus far, but I still don't think you're quite in a position to be demanding anything.
1DI0009215	Still, I suppose you've earned the right to some further answers. What would you ask of me?
1DI0009216	If you continue to behave, and do as I ask, I may be willing to release both of you. But first you have work to do.
1DI0009217	Oh dear, now you don't even believe me? How disappointing.
1DI0009218	I assure you, James and I talked at length before you arrived. Now let's continue before I grow bored with you.
1DI0009219	No, I don't think I'll do that. I'm having far too much fun to stop now.
1DI0009220	What I will do, however, is consider releasing both of you once you've done a few more things for me. So let's get to it.
1DI0009221	I'm pleased to see I'm not the only one being entertained. You're far more agreeable than your father.
1DI0009222	If you wish for more, then so be it. But let's raise the stakes a bit this time. I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson.
1DI0009223	But do be creative about it. Beating her to death just won't suffice. Put some effort into it.
1DI0009224	Of course you will. And you never know... You might enjoy it.
1DI0009226	Excellent. I look forward to seeing what you come up with. Remember, creativity is key!
1DI0009227	Music to my ears.
1DI0009228	To the point, aren't we?
1DI0009229	I've been having so much fun, I see no reason to stop now. Let's try something new, shall we?
1DI0009230	I'd like you to kill Mabel Henderson. Find an interesting way to do it, please. I'm curious to see how creative you can be.
1DI0009231	The "real world'"? Ha ha ha.
1DI0009232	This world is more real than anything outside.
1DI0009233	My body has been seated in the same chair for 200 years. It's sustained by machines.
1DI0009234	Were I to so much as stand up, my body would crumble to dust. But here, I've moved beyond that frail physical form. I am so much MORE here.
1DI0009235	And now our little diversion is at an end. It's time you do something else for me.
1DI0009236	Oh, but there is! They continue to amuse me. That is purpose enough for their lives, don't you think?
1DI0009237	You are serving the same purpose after all. I do enjoy having someone new to play with. And speaking of playing, let's try a new game.
1DI0009238	I have no desire to leave. Here I wield more power than I could ever hope to in the outside world.
1DI0009239	And I use that power to amuse myself. Now, for instance, you will do as I ask yet again because I have power over you.
1DI0009240	Your father, frustrating as he was, recognized the significance of some of my previous work.
1DI0009241	He came to gather information on it. He was most pleased to be able to ask me directly, but he failed to understand how things work here.
1DI0009242	He was unwilling to compromise, to do anything I asked of him. And so our discussions ended.
1DI0009243	Tranquility Lane was designed to be a home away from home. A new way of sustaining life after the apocalypse.
1DI0009244	Vault 112 was the prototype; we never had time to build others. As the designer of the simulation, I was given special access.
1DI0009245	Everyone else here is only subconsciously aware of the artificial reality around them; their conscious minds accept it as fact.
1DI0009246	He's here, and he is unharmed. He has merely been rendered unable to bother me.
1DI0009247	Yes, yes. How very noble of you. You'll change your mind eventually.
1DI0009248	Still you resist me, when you know that I have the answers you seek.
1DI0009249	Well, I am not going to beg you. You know what I ask of you, and so you know what you must do to retain my favor.
1DI0009250	I think you'll find that I've been quite honest with you thus far. You have no discernable reason to mistrust me.
1DI0009251	In the dog house out behind the abandoned home are a mask and knife. Don the mask, and become the Pint-Sized Slasher.
1DI0009252	Use the knife to eliminate all the residents of Tranquility Lane.
1DI0009253	I'm afraid you're not in a position to decide what they do or do not deserve. They are under my control, not yours.
1DI0009254	Now if you're done attempting to change my mind, let's get on with your final task. After completing it, you will be free to go.
1DI0009255	Your enthusiasm is inspiring. It's a shame you didn't arrive earlier.
1DI0009256	Now, you will become the Pint-Sized Slasher, and kill everyone in Tranquility Lane.
1DI0009257	Behind the Abandoned house, there is a dog house. Inside that dog house are the knife and mask you will take up.
1DI0009258	I don't recall asking for your feelings on the matter.
1DI0009259	If it has not been made perfectly clear to you, I am in control here. I dictate your actions, and the actions of those around you.
1DI0009260	You will continue to do exactly as I say, or you will find yourself suffering from a sudden and inexplicable aneurysm.
1DI0009261	And that's if I'm feeling generous.
1DI0009262	For now, though, you will become the Pint-Sized Slasher. You will kill everyone in Tranquility Lane, and you will do this because I say so.
1DI0009263	Behind the Abandoned House, in the dog house, are a knife and mask. You will use them to terrorize the residents of this quaint little street.
1DI0009264	I thought you might find it amusing. It draws upon an old urban legend, a story told over campfires many years ago.
1DI0009265	The residents have all heard the story, and will fear you.
1DI0009266	Go forth, and make me proud.
1DI0009267	He is a figure of myth, born of old campfire stories. You will make him a reality.
1DI0009268	The residents will know you, and they will fear you. When they have all been eliminated, return to me.
1DI0009269	Because I can, of course.
1DI0009270	I have total power here. I may do whatever I wish, and over these many years I have found that I wish to see others suffer.
1DI0009271	Are you mad? I've been here for almost 200 years. My body is in no condition to be used for anything.
1DI0009272	And yet here in Tranquility Lane, I am as strong and youthful as I care to be. No, no. I think I'll stay here, thank you.
1DI0009273	And you... You will now do as you're told. The Slasher awaits.
1DI0009274	It is kind of funny, but for a different reason. Tranquility Lane is different than most places. People here don't stay dead.
1DI0009275	I can make it so Timmy will be back to normal, just like nothing happened. You, though... You're special. If you die, you don't come back.
1DI0009276	You stay dead, so you better watch out.
1DI0009277	Tranquility Lane is special. If people die here, they don't really stay dead. Well, most people anyway.
1DI0009278	You're... Different. If you die, you stay dead. Better be careful!
1DI0009279	Now, Timmy will be back to normal any second now. Then you can try again.
1DI0009280	Yes, yes. I suppose you've earned the right to do as you like.
1DI0009281	I shall miss your company. This has been a simply wonderful time.
1DI0009282	The door is now open. Through it, you may return to the real world, and whatever inferior existence you have there.
1DI0009283	I had the distinct impression you enjoyed yourself. We are alike, you and I.
1DI0009284	Now, you asked for the means to leave Tranquility Lane, and so I grant it to you. The door is open.
1DI0009285	You are, of course, welcome to stay a bit longer if you like.
1DI0009286	I know everything, my dear boy.
1DI0009287	I know everything, my dear girl.
1DI0009288	Alone... What will I do now? I have no one. Nothing. You've destroyed everything that mattered to me.
1DI0009289	The Garden of Eden Creation Kit. It was for terraforming, for restoring the world after a nuclear disaster.
1DI0009290	Unstable technology, and ultimately boring. Why re-make the old reality, when instead you could create any reality you choose?
1DI0009291	You know enough. You know this was my perfect simulation, my exquisite creation.
1DI0009292	And now you've ruined it forever.
1DI0009293	It is my greatest achievement. The best of the many simulations I've run in these 200 years.
1DI0009294	I played with the others, but they bored me. This version never grew old. It amused me over, and over, and over again.
1DI0009295	Why do you torment me? You know who I am. You know that I am really Doctor Braun, that I created this place...
1DI0009296	And that now I'm trapped here, and it's all your fault.
1DI0009297	My name is Stanislaus Braun. I am a Vault-Tec scientist. I created this simulation for Vault-Tec, but for myself as well.
1DI0009298	It was my own design, my own perfection. A better reality than any other. Far greater than my work on the G.E.C.K.
1DI0009299	You? No! I... I am the creator of this world!
1DI0009300	...feel so lost, and... So all alone.
1DI0009301	It is NOT over! It's not over until I say so! Do you understand me? I... I...
1DI0009302	I just want things to go back the way they were.
1DI0009303	I CAN'T reset it, don't you see? The failsafe disabled the security protocols. They're all dead. For good!
1DI0009304	All my friends, gone. Now I'm stuck here by myself...
1DI0009305	You've taken them all from me. You've left me with nothing!
1DI0009306	It's not fair... Nobody to play with ever again...
1DI0009307	You can't do that here.
1DI0009308	And now, you have to pay.
1DI0009309	You do now.
1DI0009310	You live here until I say you don't.
1DI0009311	I know! Why don't we play a game?
1DI0009312	Do you like games? I love to play games!
1DI0009313	I know a really fun game we can play.
1DI0009314	That's right! It IS whatever I say! Boy, you learn fast.
1DI0009315	Hey, I know! Let's play a fun game!
1DI0009316	But... But I want to play now!
1DI0009317	I'm glad you've chosen to see reason.
1DI0009318	Again, I present you with a simple little job. The Rockwells have a seemingly happy marriage. I'd like you to put an end to it.
1DI0009319	The only caveat is that you may not kill either of them in the process. I look forward to seeing what you're capable of.
1DI0009320	There's always a choice. Sometimes it's just easier to make.
1DI0009321	I'm glad you've chosen to be cooperative.
1DI0009322	Well then, we have little else to say to one another.
1DI0009323	Oh, don't worry about that now. There are things to do!
1DI0009324	Have you met Doc the dog? He's another new arrival, much like yourself.
1DI0009325	He might seem a bit... familiar to you.
1DI0009326	Maybe later. First I want to see how you get along with Timmy.
1DI0009327	The details of this place are far beyond your comprehension, I'm sure.
1DI0009328	Be content with what you need to know: This is a simulation, and I am in total control. If you wish to see the Vault again, you'll do as I say.
1DI0009329	Don't you worry about that. You just go have fun with Timmy.
1DI0009330	You know that I am Dr. Braun. Anything else is irrelevant. Perhaps you should be focusing your energy on what I've asked of you.
1DI0009331	If you insist on an answer, then you may better know me as Dr. Stanislaus Braun.
1DI0009332	I have chosen a different appearance for myself here... in my own little playground.
1DI0009333	<whistling>
1DI0009334	Oh, I don't think we're quite ready to talk about that. We haven't even been formally introduced yet.
1DI0009335	Yes, yes! Absolutely! We need to get back to Rivet City. I've got to tell Madison that I have it.
1DI0009336	After all these years, I finally have the key to making Project Purity a reality.
1DI0009337	Well, I'm glad you did. This certainly wasn't how I expected things to turn out. I wasn't ready for Braun, or I might've fared better.
1DI0009338	Well I didn't expect Dr. Braun to be alive and insane. I thought I'd just find notes, or holotapes.
1DI0009339	I needed information about Braun, and his work on the G.E.C.K.
1DI0009340	You came all this way, and risked your life for answers? They must be important to you.
1DI0009341	Well, I suppose it had its moments. But in the end, I much prefer having opposable thumbs.
1DI0009342	And now that I'm back, I can get back to work. I need to tell Madison what I've learned.
1DI0009343	I assure you, I won't. I'm going to need your help.
1DI0009344	Now that I have what I came for, I need to get to Rivet City right away.
1DI0009345	It certainly is! It's nice to feel like I'm on two legs again.
1DI0009346	And thanks to Doctor Braun, I know that Project Purity isn't lost after all.
1DI0009347	I did indeed. Braun's work, the G.E.C.K., was designed to re-adapt environments for living after a nuclear war.
1DI0009348	It's not entirely stable, but I'm sure that components of that technology are just what we need, what we've been missing all this time.
1DI0009349	I need to return to Rivet City. Once Madison knows about the G.E.C.K., I can get her to see that it really will work.
1DI0009350	You must understand. As much as I love you, this project has been my responsibility since long before you were even born.
1DI0009351	Too many people have made sacrifices to give up on it now. Your mother...
1DI0009352	If you'll let me, I'd like to show you what we've accomplished. I want you to be there when we change the world.
1DI0009353	After so many years, I can finally see it through to the end. I can't stop now.
1DI0009354	That's my girl!
1DI0009355	Let's hurry. Now that I know what we need, I want to get back to work as soon as possible.
1DI0009356	That's my boy!
1DI0009358	Really? You're not going to join me?
1DI0009359	Coming all this way after me... I'd have thought you'd want to help. I have to keep going; I can't stop now.
1DI0009360	I'm going back to Rivet City. Meet me there if you change your mind. I... It would be good to work with you, honey.
1DI0009363	I'm going back to Rivet City. Meet me there if you change your mind. I... It would be good to work with you, son.
1DI0009364	I can't do this on my own. Madison... Doctor Li has a team of scientists working at Rivet City. They'll have to help.
1DI0009365	The facility hasn't been used in years. There'll be enough work for a good number of people, and it will take us a while.
1DI0009366	The sooner I get to Rivet City, the sooner Madison and I can get to work.
1DI0009368	You're nineteen years old. Are you so sure you know what you want from life already?
1DI0009369	I suppose it doesn't matter now. I suspect there's no going back for either of us. We'll just have to forge on ahead, won't we?
1DI0009370	Yes. With what I've learned, Madison is sure to see that we can finally succeed where we failed so many years ago.
1DI0009371	I'd like you to come with me. I'd like you to be there when we finally open the floodgates.
1DI0009372	I'm afraid there's nothing else I can offer. When Project Purity is finished, we can sit down and really talk. I'd like to work through this.
1DI0009373	For now, I need to return to Rivet City. There's still much to do.
1DI0009374	No, no. There will be time to rest when the work is complete. This is too important!
1DI0009375	I need to get back to Rivet City right away. There's so much to be done.
1DI0009377	I need to get back to Rivet City right away. There's so much work to be done.
1DI0009378	Yes, what about you? Why, in fact, are you outside the Vault at all? I don't even want to know HOW you got out.
1DI0009379	As much as I appreciate your help, you were supposed to stay there, to make a life for yourself there, not out here!
1DI0009380	I was right about Braun. The technology he developed is unstable, even dangerous, but it can be adapted for Project Purity.
1DI0009381	I need to return to Rivet City and talk with Madison. If we can find a G.E.C.K., we can make Project Purity work.
1DI0009382	I needed information about Doctor Braun's research and development of the G.E.C.K. It's vital to getting Project Purity running.
1DI0009383	I was expecting to find notes, or holotapes. I didn't plan on being caught up in Braun's twisted fantasy world.
1DI0009384	That's where you belonged. You were an adult, capable of fending for yourself, and you had a good life ahead of you.
1DI0009385	What's out here is my task, my responsibility. I never wanted you to have any part of this insanity.
1DI0009386	Yes, I lied about where you were born. About where I was born. I admit that.
1DI0009387	At the time, I felt the truth would only encourage you to try and leave the Vault, to go looking for your past.
1DI0009388	Perhaps I should've handled things differently. I'm sorry.
1DI0009389	You were supposed to stay put. You could've had a good life in the Vault.
1DI0009390	But I suppose it's too late to go back now, isn't it? The Overseer would likely have us shot on sight.
1DI0009391	Well, then you'll just have to come with me to Rivet City. You've certainly proven yourself capable enough.
1DI0009392	Project Purity was underway long before you were born. There were many of us, including your mother, who devoted our lives to it.
1DI0009393	The idea of free, clean water for everyone drove us to succeed. So many sacrifices were made for that idea.
1DI0009394	My responsibility is to see it through to the end, to make sure those sacrifices mean something.
1DI0009395	We're not really here. We're not really talking. It's all made-up, make-believe. We're sleeping, dreaming.
1DI0009396	The dream became a nightmare. It has to end, it just has to. But we're not in charge. He is, and he doesn't want us to wake up.
1DI0009397	This. All this, it's all fake! Made-up, a dream world. Only the dream never ends. I want it to end, for all our sakes.
1DI0009398	He keeps us here, so he can laugh and feel good about himself. But I know. I know what he's doing, and I know he uses the Failsafe.
1DI0009399	You need to know the truth, otherwise he'll suck you in just like all the others. Beware!
1DI0009400	It's in the abandoned house. He doesn't want us going in there, because he's afraid we might find it.
1DI0009401	It's the only terminal to the outside; the only way to shut the whole thing down. You've got to find it.
1DI0009402	He calls himself Betty now, but he's still the same. He can put on a new face all he likes, but underneath he's still evil.
1DI0009403	Braun. Bastard thinks because he helped create this place he's God here. But I know he still uses the Failsafe terminal. I know it.
1DI0009404	Don't know. Can't sleep sometimes... Hear voices... My own skin doesn't feel right. None of this is right. You've got to believe me!
1DI0009405	You've got to find that failsafe!
1DI0009406	The abandoned house. Keeps that one to himself, he does. That's where it is. That's why he doesn't want us in there.
1DI0009407	You have to find it. It's the only way any of us can truly rest...
1DI0009408	Did you look? Did you really look? You can't just look with your eyes, you know.
1DI0009409	Look at Braun. You think he really looks like that little girl? He hides things. Confuses them. You have to find a way to find it.
1DI0009410	It's there, I tell you! He hides it, like he hides himself. You've got to find a way to draw it out. He knows how to do it, but he'd never tell you.
1DI0009411	<bark! bark!>
1DI0009414	Your father? Oh, I had no idea. This is simply too rich.
1DI0009415	He's the reason you came here? I mistakenly assumed you had simply blundered in here on your own.
1DI0009416	Well, this certainly changes things, doesn't it? I daresay it gives you a whole new level of motivation to avoid angering me.
1DI0009417	You mean the man that came here is your daddy?
1DI0009418	And you're only here because you're looking for him?
1DI0009419	Oh, this is just too much fun! We're going to have SUCH a good time! Let's play right now!
1DI0009420	Well now, doesn't this just change everything!
1DI0009421	I should have suspected there was some reason behind my recent good fortune.
1DI0009422	Perhaps you'll get to see him, in time.
1DI0009423	And he's new here too, isn't he?
1DI0009424	Oh, boy. He's your daddy, huh? I had no idea!
1DI0009425	That makes this even MORE fun! Let's play!
1DI0009426	Oh my. What a splendid turn of events. I had no idea the two of you were related!
1DI0009427	Yes, I have indeed seen him. I'm afraid he's rather unavailable at the moment.
1DI0009428	Ha ha ha! THAT'S your daddy?
1DI0009429	Oh, we're going to have SO much fun! This is going to be the best game ever!
1DI0009430	No, Timmy's the one who's crazy. You'll see.
1DI0009431	Make him cry, and then come tell me. Maybe we can talk some more then.
1DI0009432	You can? I guess we'll see, huh?
1DI0009433	Good luck!
1DI0009434	It'll be funny. Come on, you'll see.
1DI0009435	Make him cry, and then come back here, and we'll talk some more.
1DI0009436	He's the only other kid that lives here besides you. He's a big crybaby... You'll see.
1DI0009437	Make him cry and then come back here so we can talk some more.
1DI0009438	Oh, don't be mean. That's not a good way to start.
1DI0009439	I said we're going to play a game, so that's what we're going to do.
1DI0009440	Ha ha. You don't get to say no.
1DI0009441	If I want to play a game, you're going to play. And I want to.
1DI0009442	I said, I want to play a game.
1DI0009443	It's easy. You make Timmy Neusbaum cry, and I'll help you. If you don't...
1DI0009444	Then I guess you'll never find out where your daddy is.
1DI0009446	It's easy. You make Timmy Neusbaum cry, and I'll help you. If you don't... Then I guess you're stuck here.
1DI0009447	I knew you would!
1DI0009448	It's a really simple game. All you have to do is make Timmy Neusbaum cry.
1DI0009449	Oh goodie!
1DI0009451	We're going to play a game now, silly. That's what's going on.
1DI0009452	What's this... Women's clothing? Down here?
1DI0009453	You fucking coward. I can't stand the sight of you. Get away from me!
1DI0009454	Who told you that? They're lying, I swear it!
1DI0009455	Well someone saw you and Martha, Roger, and I heard about it. So now I know for sure.
1DI0009456	Janet, what the hell are you talking about?
1DI0009457	Don't you lie to me. Did you honestly think you could skulk around with that whore and no one would see you?
1DI0009458	What? Janet, what are you talking about?
1DI0009459	Roger, you son of a bitch. Did you really think I wouldn't find out?
1DI0009460	The hell with working this out. I'm sick of you. I'm staying at Mabel's tonight. Don't talk to me. Don't even look at me.
1DI0009461	I have no idea what you're talking about Janet. Just calm down, and let's work this out.
1DI0009462	You left her underwear on your goddamn desk, Roger. How stupid do you think I am?
1DI0009463	Janet, what are you talking about?
1DI0009464	You just couldn't stay away from her, could you? And what, you didn't think I'd find out? You disgust me!
1DI0009465	What? What did I do?
1DI0009466	Roger, you son of a bitch!
1DI0009467	You pervert! You disgust me! Just stay away from me!
1DI0009468	What's wrong with being in the basement? What the hell is going on?
1DI0009469	You KNOW what I'm talking about! You spend all that time down in the basement, and I never questioned it.
1DI0009470	Janet, calm down! What are you talking about?
1DI0009471	Did you think I wouldn't find out? What kind of a sicko are you?
1DI0009474	This isn't mine. Why would Roger have this down here?
1DI0009475	My God... I knew it. I knew it!
1DI0009476	But... This isn't mine. What is this doing here?
1DI0009477	What is this doing here?
1DI0009478	Oh my God. Roger... He wouldn't. But...
1DI0009479	Gee, I don't know. What's he like?
1DI0009480	Oh, dear. Is that old radio on the fritz again? I should turn it off.
1DI0009482	I suppose. I hadn't really noticed.
1DI0009483	You won't find a day like this anywhere else!
1DI0009484	Another perfect Saturday afternoon. Make sure you enjoy it, sport!
1DI0009485	Of course it is! It's America, isn't it?
1DI0009486	Well of course it is. What a silly thing to say. What else would it be?
1DI0009487	It sure is. But it always is here!
1DI0009488	Yep, you've got that right. Heck of a day to get some work done outdoors.
1DI0009489	I like it well enough, I suppose. Mabel is good company most of the time, and... well, the other neighbors are mostly very nice.
1DI0009490	Well, there's certainly never a dull moment. I think it's like any other street, really.
1DI0009491	Always something to see, and always something to talk about.
1DI0009492	Roger suggested we move here... I don't quite remember when that was...
1DI0009493	It's very nice. We're doing quite well.
1DI0009494	Heck of a place to live. Janet and I... well, we're... quite happy here.
1DI0009495	It's okay, I guess. I don't really have nobody to play with. Except for Betty... and she's kind of... well, she's mean.
1DI0009496	Well, George and I have been here... why, as long as I can remember.
1DI0009497	You mean besides how wonderful it is to live here?
1DI0009498	Everyone's very friendly. Even Old Lady Dithers, though she's lost most of her marbles.
1DI0009499	Nice place. Real nice. Everyone's friendly, and always happy to lend a hand.
1DI0009500	Janet... Well, Janet and I don't see Mabel very often. Janet doesn't seem to like her very much.
1DI0009501	I'm not really complaining. Last time we were over there, I bumped my head on that gigantic chandelier she has. Not anxious to do that again.
1DI0009502	Roger and I don't spend much time with Mabel, frankly. She's a little nosey for my tastes. And I don't like visiting her house, either.
1DI0009503	That robot she's got makes me nervous. She says it's perfectly safe, but something about it... it just makes me uncomfortable.
1DI0009504	Mabel's been a good friend to me. She's always interested in what's going on with my life, which is more than I can say for some people.
1DI0009505	I'll sometimes go over to her house and chat while she's baking. She really loves to bake... Uses that oven all the time.
1DI0009506	She sure loves baking her pies. Always bringing them around, bragging about her fancy oven.
1DI0009507	I'm not one to turn down a good pie, but it gets a bit tiresome hearing her go on and on.
1DI0009508	Mabel? She's nice enough, I suppose. A bit of a gossip, maybe. And she never seemed too fond of my boy Timmy.
1DI0009509	She was just complaining about his rollerskates the other day. Said Timmy left them in her house, and that they were dangerous.
1DI0009510	If they're so dangerous, why didn't she just bring them here when she came to complain about it?
1DI0009511	Fond of her gadgets, she is. Heck, I can't count the number of times I've had to fix that new-fangled robot of hers.
1DI0009512	I keep telling her to order some new parts. The motivator goes bad on that one, and she's going to have a real problem on her hands.
1DI0009513	Sorry, kiddo, but I'm not in the mood for jokes.
1DI0009514	What? Oh, sweetie. Maybe you should just run along and play.
1DI0009515	Sounds like you've been spending too much time with your nose in those darned comic books, sport.
1DI0009516	Computer what now? Why don't you go find Timmy and have a nice game of catch?
1DI0009517	Oh, you're such a kidder.
1DI0009518	What? You're weird.
1DI0009519	Sure, sport. Whatever you say! Ha, ha.
1DI0009521	Well, you oughta tell that to my big toe, kiddo. Hurts like the dickens since I stubbed it earlier today. Feels pretty real to me!
1DI0009523	Okay, if you say so.
1DI0009524	Oh, I... Well, I'm not one to talk, but there was that fight last year. Everyone could hear them arguing.
1DI0009525	Janet thought there was something going on with Roger and Martha Simpson. He eventually convinced her it wasn't true.
1DI0009526	But I've seen the way Martha looks at him. Janet may believe him, but I sure don't.
1DI0009527	Well sure, sweetie. Doesn't everyone?
1DI0009528	Of course, not everyone decides to fight about it in front of an open window, so the whole neighborhood can hear...
1DI0009529	Martha Simpson must've been mortified, hearing Janet call her all those names. She's never said one word about it, though.
1DI0009530	People around here should mind their own business.
1DI0009531	There's no story. Never was. Roger and I... Nothing ever happened.
1DI0009532	I wanted... Oh, I don't know. I thought there was something between us. No, that's not true. I know there was.
1DI0009533	But Roger pushed me away. Tried to deny it. Even Janet knew it was there. She fought with him over it.
1DI0009534	I think she still suspects something. I try to stay away from Roger, just to avoid giving her a reason to hate me more.
1DI0009535	Why, I never!
1DI0009536	You're the one who asked ME about it, you little brat!
1DI0009537	Tip? Oh, I wouldn't call it that. Just something I heard, is all.
1DI0009538	That's... that's crazy!
1DI0009539	My God... Did she really kill Martha? She's lost her mind!
1DI0009540	You should be in a sanitarium, or a prison! You're out of your damned mind! You just stay away from me, you hear me?
1DI0009541	What are you talking about? I haven't done anything...
1DI0009542	I'm scaring YOU? After you beat that poor woman to death? You've really lost it, Janet. You're crazy!
1DI0009543	Roger, stop it. You're scaring me!
1DI0009544	How could you? How could you do that to her? Have you lost your mind?
1DI0009545	What on earth are you talking about, Roger?
1DI0009546	My God... Janet, what have you done?
1DI0009547	Oh my God, what is that? Is that blood? And... brains?
1DI0009548	Janet did this to Martha? She really did snap, didn't she?
1DI0009549	But... Janet would never...
1DI0009550	I mean, I know she was upset, but I thought she was over it. How could she do this?
1DI0009551	The People's Republic of China claims this land as its own! Your evil, materialistic ways are at an end, American dogs! Men, open fire!
1DI0009552	That's a dumb joke. You're not funny at all.
1DI0009555	[sobbing]
1DI0009556	Potty mouth!
1DI0009557	You're mean. Leave me alone!
1DI0009558	Mommy? Mommy?! No! [crying]
1DI0009559	Daddy? Daddy?! No! [crying]
1DI0009560	No, no! Not my mommy and daddy! Nooo!
1DI0009562	I won't wet the bed again, I promise! I promise!
1DI0009566	This is Tranquility Lane. We all live here, and now so do you.
1DI0009567	Ha ha, such a kidder. You're on Tranquility Lane, of course! Where else would you be?
1DI0009568	I'm Betty. I live here on Tranquility Lane. Want to play a game?
1DI0009569	George Neusbaum. Proud resident of Tranquility Lane. Good to meet you, sport.
1DI0009570	Oh, you know Betty.
1DI0009571	She's... well. You just go talk to her, okay?
1DI0009572	Betty? Well... She's Betty. You know.
1DI0009573	You really shouldn't keep her waiting.
1DI0009574	Very well. Give me a few moments to bring the system online.
1DI0009575	Then you will immediately hand over all materials related to this project, and aid us in making it operational at once.
1DI0009576	Yes, Colonel. I'll do whatever you want; there's no need for more violence.
1DI0009577	I suggest you comply immediately, sir, in order to prevent any more incidents. Are we clear?
1DI0009578	Colonel, I assure you that this facility will not function. We have never been able to successfully replicate test results...
1DI0009579	Sir, this is the last time I am going to repeat myself. Stand down at once, and turn over control of this facility.
1DI0009580	Colonel... Is it Colonel? I'm sorry, but the facility is not operational. It never has been. I'm afraid you're wasting your time here.
1DI0009581	Furthermore, you are to assist Enclave scientists in assuming control of the administration and operation of this facility at once.
1DI0009582	I'm sorry, but that's....
1DI0009583	Then I repeat, sir, that you are hereby instructed to immediately hand over all materials related to the purifier.
1DI0009584	Yes, I'm responsible for this project.
1DI0009585	Am I to assume, sir, that you are in charge?
1DI0009586	That's quite impossible. This is a private project; the Enclave has no authority here. I'm going to have to ask you to leave at once.
1DI0009587	The person in charge is to step forward immediately, and turn over all materials related to this project.
1DI0009588	By the authority of the President, this facility is now under United States government control.
1DI0009589	For almost twenty years now, I've done everything I can to see that you have a good life.
1DI0009590	The Vault wasn't perfect, to be sure, but it was the safest place in the Wasteland. That's why I took you there in the first place.
1DI0009591	I didn't see it as abandoning you. I saw it as moving on, knowing you were safe.
1DI0009592	Oh, my child. If only you could have known how much it meant to her. She believed in the work we were doing, and was so determined to see it through.
1DI0009593	She gave up so much for the project. We all did, and I don't want that to have been for nothing.
1DI0009594	Oh, my son. If only you could have known how much it meant to her. She believed in the work we were doing, and was so determined to see it through.
1DI0009596	I know that you're a good person. Whatever's going on, I know you'll make the best of it.
1DI0009597	Let's get through this, and then I'll help you in whatever way I can. I'm here for you.
1DI0009598	This place, this Wasteland... it's no more real than the Vault. You're still responsible for your actions.
1DI0009599	Those actions can come back to haunt you in ways you never expect. Please just keep that in mind.
1DI0009600	Whatever happens, know that I'll always love you.
1DI0009601	Well, enough of a lecture for now. Let's get back to work.
1DI0009602	This isn't about me, or the choices I've made. We're talking about you.
1DI0009603	Whatever life you make for yourself out here, it's in your power to make it a good one. I just don't want to see you go down the wrong path.
1DI0009604	But maybe this isn't the best time to have this talk. Once we're done here, then we can work it out together. Let's just get through this.
1DI0009605	I know. We all do what we have to.
1DI0009606	But don't compromise who you are. It's in your power to be a good person, to do the right thing. Just please keep that in mind.
1DI0009607	We can talk more later. Let's get back to work.
1DI0009608	...The Enclave? What are they doing here...  They're where? Madison, lock that door!
1DI0009609	Please remain in your assigned areas while we get this sorted out...
1DI0009610	Everyone, it seems we have some visitors. I don't know who they are or what they want.
1DI0009611	We have a singular opportunity here; a chance to make the Wasteland a better place for... what? What's that?
1DI0009612	I'd like to thank you all for returning to this project after so many years. I know some of you thought this day would never come.
1DI0009613	Once the mainframe is online, we'll be able to access the database, and hopefully learn where we can find a G.E.C.K.
1DI0009614	There's a lot of deterioration in the pipes, and some damage to the substructure, but it's nothing we can't fix.
1DI0009615	We've restored power to the mainframe, which is coming online now.
1DI0009616	All right everyone, you should be able to hear me now.
1DI0009617	Of course, honey. What's on your mind?
1DI0009618	Of course, son. What's on your mind?
1DI0009620	Oh, be honest. Can you really say you wouldn't have tried to come with me if you knew?
1DI0009621	I told you, I wanted a different life for you. I had hoped the Overseer would seal the Vault, making it impossible for you to leave.
1DI0009622	It might mean you spent the rest of your life hating me, but... your well-being was worth that chance.
1DI0009623	...run... Run!...
1DI0009624	What? No. No, of course not!
1DI0009625	I just... This is important work. Clean water can change the lives of so many people. It's worth the risk to help them.
1DI0009626	I hope that you can understand why I've done the things that I've done. The last thing I want is to lose my daughter.
1DI0009627	I hope that you can understand why I've done the things that I've done. The last thing I want is to lose my son.
1DI0009628	Somehow I don't think the Overseer would agree to that.
1DI0009629	What's done is done. But if we succeed, if we can make Project Purity a reality, we can create a new life for ourselves out here.
1DI0009630	I didn't want you to think I hadn't noticed. You've had to deal with so much... We all have.
1DI0009631	Once we're done here, you can tell me all about it. For now, let's get to work.
1DI0009632	Life out here is so different from the Vault. You know it's something I never wanted you to face.
1DI0009633	I'm glad to see it hasn't changed who you are. There aren't many who can say that about themselves.
1DI0009634	As much as I'd like to, I can't take all the credit. You're the one making the choices. I'm glad to see they've been good ones.
1DI0009635	You make me very proud.
1DI0009636	Look at me, getting all sentimental. There's time for that when our work is done.
1DI0009637	Someday I'll find a way to make it up to you. I promise.
1DI0009638	Let's finish our work so that we can do some good together.
1DI0009639	I can understand that you're angry. You have a right to be.
1DI0009640	Perhaps the choice I made wasn't the right one. At the time, I thought I was doing what was best for you.
1DI0009643	I wanted you to be safe. I didn't want this for you -- a life out here in this godforsaken warzone.
1DI0009644	I couldn't tell you what I was doing because I didn't want you following me.
1DI0009645	A plan which clearly was not as successful as I imagined it would be.
1DI0009646	I had thought that after my escape, the Overseer would seal the vault. You'd have no choice to stay behind.
1DI0009647	I suppose I underestimated how resourceful you are.
1DI0009648	Please. Just monitor the pumps.
1DI0009649	James, I...
1DI0009650	Madison, please. It's very important that you do this right now. Just step over to the panel while I access the computer in the control booth.
1DI0009651	What? What are you talking about? That doesn't even make any sense...
1DI0009652	I need you to monitor the output levels on pumps three and four. Please step over to the panel and keep an eye on them, will you?
1DI0009653	I won't help you do this James. Not after everything it took to get here.
1DI0009654	Madison, please. Now's not the time. I'll get the information the Colonel needs, but I need you to...
1DI0009655	James, this is wrong. You can't do this.
1DI0009656	Thank you, Madison. It's good to be working with you again.
1DI0009657	Damn you, James. When this is all over, you owe me a drink. I'll get the team together.
1DI0009658	And you know I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this would really work. It's time, Madison.
1DI0009659	You know if it were anyone else asking me to do this, I'd have them run right out of Rivet City.
1DI0009660	That's why we're going to head over there right now and get things up and running as best we can.
1DI0009661	From the last reports, there's no power at the facility. Even if one of those computers had a database, we couldn't access it.
1DI0009662	I know, I was thinking about that. The lab at the facility had some old pre-war computers that we scavenged. One of them might be useful.
1DI0009663	James, I... We don't have a G.E.C.K. I can get a small team together, but we'll need proof that it works before people believe us.
1DI0009664	It's as important to me as ever, Madison. I know it's important to you too. Let's finish this together.
1DI0009665	You haven't lost any of your passion, have you James.
1DI0009666	How could it not be worth improving the lives of everyone in the Wasteland? What could be a more worthy endeavor?
1DI0009667	I... I don't know, James. So many years have passed. Is it really still worth trying?
1DI0009668	Madison, I'm telling you this is real. I talked to Braun himself. He confirmed it. Don't you see? This is what we've been waiting for!
1DI0009669	I'd like to believe you, James. Really I would. This is all just so... So sudden.
1DI0009670	And with good news. I was right about Braun and the G.E.C.K. If we can find one, we can adapt it to work with the purifiers.
1DI0009671	James! You're back!
1DI0009672	I told you it would work, Madison, and now I can prove it.
1DI0009673	What I did can't even compare to such a thing.
1DI0009674	All those people...
1DI0009675	You're still my son, and I love you, but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.
1DI0009676	We'll talk more about this when there's time. Right now we have work to do.
1DI0009679	You're still my daughter, and I love you, but I can't begin to tell you how disappointed in you I am.
1DI0009681	I didn't think so. You couldn't possibly do something like that.
1DI0009682	Honestly, I have a hard time believing you. I raised you to be better than that... Better than the Wastes.
1DI0009683	We'll talk more about this later. There's too much work to be done now to let this get in the way.
1DI0009684	I certainly hope not. It's not how I raised you.
1DI0009685	What you do in the world may be your business, but here, with me, you are MY son.
1DI0009686	I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am. That goes against everything I ever taught you.
1DI0009687	I want to talk more about this later. For now, let's just focus on our work.
1DI0009688	Something like that never needs to be done. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I am in you.
1DI0009689	There's work to be done now, but I want to talk to you about this later.
1DI0009690	I'm very proud of you, even though you put yourself in harm's way.
1DI0009691	Just please be careful out there. This is a dangerous world; far more dangerous than anyone in that Vault knows.
1DI0009692	I see. You did a good thing, but I'm not sure I approve of your motives.
1DI0009693	Perhaps we can discuss it more later. We have a lot of work to do now.
1DI0009694	I just wanted to say that I'm very proud of you. That's all.
1DI0009695	Let's get back to work, then.
1DI0009697	I'm sorry you feel that way.
1DI0009698	I suppose it does.
1DI0009699	Look, I am sorry that I left you. I did what I thought was best for you. I don't know how else to say it.
1DI0009700	Be careful.
1DI0009702	I'm proud of you. Now let's get in there.
1DI0009703	Excellent. Let's get inside and get to work.
1DI0009704	I'm afraid I don't have many options. Please know that I would never put you in this position if I didn't think it was absolutely necessary.
1DI0009705	Will you do it?
1DI0009706	I know, I know. Believe me, I'm not entirely comfortable with it either.
1DI0009707	There are sentry guns in there that may still have power. If you can turn them on, they can do at least some of the work for you.
1DI0009708	All right. We'll stay here, then.
1DI0009709	Do what you have to, but be careful.
1DI0009710	All right, all right. Do what you have to, but be careful.
1DI0009711	Please reconsider. Until we can get inside and turn the computers on, we can't get any closer to finishing our project.
1DI0009712	I would hate to see all this effort go to waste.
1DI0009713	Thank you. We'll wait here until you give the all-clear.
1DI0009714	Nearly finished...
1DI0009715	Almost ready. I'm compiling the data now.
1DI0009716	Just another minute, and I'll be done.
1DI0009717	It'll only be a few more moments.
1DI0009718	Enough of these delays.
1DI0009719	I grow tired of waiting.
1DI0009720	My patience wears thin.
1DI0009721	I wouldn't be here if I didn't. With what I've learned from Doctor Braun, I know it can work.
1DI0009722	That's why it's so important we find a G.E.C.K. as soon as possible. It's the key to Project Purity.
1DI0009723	You have to understand, the Vault wasn't for me. It was for you. To make sure my daughter grew up someplace safe, away from all this.
1DI0009724	I didn't want you to leave. I wanted you to stay there, to grow up and live your life in safety.
1DI0009725	You have to understand, the Vault wasn't for me. It was for you. To make sure my son grew up someplace safe, away from all this.
1DI0009727	So am I, my love. While this isn't what I had in mind, it's good to have you with me.
1DI0009728	So am I, son. While this isn't what I had in mind, it's good to have you with me.
1DI0009729	There's so much history here. So much time and energy spent on this place, because it could help so many people.
1DI0009730	And now, after all these years, there's a chance to finish it. To see it through to the end, and help all the people of the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0009731	You remember the Bible passage, about the waters of life? It's more than just a poster on a wall.
1DI0009732	Your mother and I, we lived by that ideal. Water, clean and free, for everyone in the Wasteland!
1DI0009733	Think about that for a moment. No more radiation sickness, no more mutated crops, no more struggling just to stay alive. Finally... hope.
1DI0009734	Isn't it worth taking a risk to give that hope to people?
1DI0009735	Sure, sure. No matter that he disappears for almost twenty years, leaving us all hanging. It's not like we have lives or anything.
1DI0009736	Yeah? Well... I'm just saying.
1DI0009737	Oh hell. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I just thought that since this happened after you showed up... Well, you know. Man, I'm sorry.
1DI0009738	God forbid I should be upset that twice now my work has been screwed over by your father.
1DI0009739	And, to make things worse, this time he brings his snot-nosed kid along for the ride.
1DI0009741	All right, all right. I won't push. But please reconsider.
1DI0009742	Honey, I know things are moving a bit quickly, and I'm sure you have some conflicting feelings about helping me after what's happened.
1DI0009743	If you need to take a moment, that's fine. I'll be waiting for you.
1DI0009744	Son, I know things are moving a bit quickly, and I'm sure you have some conflicting feelings about helping me after what's happened.
1DI0009746	You just need to power up the mainframe, and we can see what there is to see.
1DI0009747	You need to replace the fuses that shorted out in the flooding. Once they're in, the automatic doors will work and we can reach the mainframe.
1DI0009748	Right. The flooding shorted out some of the fuse boxes downstairs, including one that controls some of the automatic doors.
1DI0009749	Here, take these fuses. The box is back down in the sub-basement, near the eastern end of the level.
1DI0009750	Once the fuses are replaced, you'll be able to get to the mainframe.
1DI0009751	The flood control pumps, remember? Without those working, we can't restore power to the mainframe.
1DI0009752	I can use the intercom system to talk you through reaching them.
1DI0009753	The Project was abandoned shortly after you were born. Things have deteriorated here since then, and there's been some flooding.
1DI0009754	I'll need you to get to the Flood Control Pumps and activate them so we can clear out the water and reach the mainframe.
1DI0009755	Eventually, I think we can get the whole facility up and running. But we'll need a G.E.C.K. for that.
1DI0009756	So we need to find a G.E.C.K. I'm hoping the Project's computer will have information on where we can locate one.
1DI0009757	The automatic doors sealed when the flooding occurred, so you'll have to use the access tunnels to reach the pumps.
1DI0009758	In a word? No. Everyone else has specific tasks to complete as the power comes back online.
1DI0009759	Don't worry. I'll guide you along the way as best I can using the intercom system. You'll do fine.
1DI0009760	I... Normally I would never approve of this. If the situation weren't so serious...
1DI0009761	If you think this is the best course of action, we'll do it. I hope this isn't a mistake.
1DI0009762	I can't believe James raised a daughter like you. You disgust me.
1DI0009763	I can't believe James raised a son like you. You disgust me.
1DI0009764	You're inhuman! I won't forget this.
1DI0009765	I do not have my usual supplies of medicine. I was too hasty in leaving.
1DI0009766	Maybe you're right. Very well. I'll tell him, and then we'll continue.
1DI0009767	Let's make this quick.
1DI0009768	Ah, so you do. Give them to Doctor Li, if you please.
1DI0009769	Yes, this looks to be enough. He'll need medical attention once we've reached the Citadel, but this will get him there.
1DI0009770	Thank you. Give me a moment, and we can continue.
1DI0009771	Perhaps if I just rest a while... [gasp] Perhaps not.
1DI0009772	We cannot continue to delay here. Something must be done. Is there no medicine to be found?
1DI0009773	I said I will NOT leave him. Now look around for any sort of medical supplies. There must be something we can put to use.
1DI0009774	Doctor Li. My heart... I must rest.
1DI0009775	Yes, you are right. There is no reason to put everyone at risk on my account. Go on without me.
1DI0009776	I'm afraid I can't do that.
1DI0009777	Doctor Li can tell you. It's my heart.
1DI0009778	Garza is in need of medical attention immediately. He has a heart condition. I will not leave him behind.
1DI0009779	I don't have sufficient medical supplies with me, or else this wouldn't be a problem. If you have any Stimpaks, I would ask that you hand them over.
1DI0009780	I... my heart. It's weak, and I have no medicine with me.
1DI0009781	Doctor Li, she can explain.
1DI0009782	Garza has a heart condition. He needs medicine, or he may not make it. I'm not moving until he gets the medicine he needs.
1DI0009783	Sure. Beats having nothing, doesn't it?
1DI0009784	I'm not sure the silencer will do me much good, but I'll take it. Thanks.
1DI0009785	I guess it's better than nothing. Thanks.
1DI0009786	Hmm, okay. Never used one of these before, but I can probably figure it out.
1DI0009787	Wow, you sure about that? Okay...
1DI0009788	Okay. If you find one, let me know.
1DI0009789	No, not at all. You'll just need to turn a valve. It'll only take a moment.
1DI0009790	Now I won't be able to contact you once you're in there. You'll exit near the cisterns, and then you can get in touch with me again.
1DI0009791	Honey? Over here; the intercom.
1DI0009792	Son? Over here; the intercom.
1DI0009793	Right now you're near one of the large cisterns where water from the river is kept until it can be processed.
1DI0009794	You're in the security level. It's full of holding tanks for the water as well as our processing equipment and power systems.
1DI0009795	You're in what used to be the old museum and gift shop. A lot of the Project's machinery is down there now. We just refer to it as the Museum level.
1DI0009796	According to the display, you're somewhere in the substructure. I can't be more specific than that right now.
1DI0009797	Head towards the northeast end of that level. There's an intercom close to the grate you're looking for.
1DI0009798	Head up to the museum level. Use the door at the north end of the level you're on now.
1DI0009799	The mainframe room is on the security level, west of the pumps you started earlier.
1DI0009800	You're on the right level. Head to the western end, and look for the large automated door.
1DI0009801	The fuse box you're looking for is down near the cisterns. Keep heading down.
1DI0009802	Come on back up to the main lab. I'll be waiting.
1DI0009803	The flood control pump is at the south end of this level.
1DI0009804	Keep heading down. There's a staircase at the south end of the level you're on.
1DI0009805	I can't really say, since I don't know where you are.
1DI0009806	He is? I didn't... I didn't think I'd be seeing him again. Not quite so soon, at any rate.
1DI0009807	No, of course not. I am simply glad that our work can continue. James is essential to the project. That's all. Really.
1DI0009808	You are? Then... he's coming back? After our last conversation, I didn't think he would.
1DI0009809	Lyons! I know you're in there! I know you can hear me! You open this goddamn door right now!
1DI0009810	I'm sorry, ma'am. No unauthorized civilians allowed inside the Citadel. You'll have to leave now.
1DI0009811	I am Doctor Madison Li. I have people with me in need of shelter. You must allow us access at once.
1DI0009812	I believe I can handle things from here.
1DI0009813	Thank you, Doctor Li.
1DI0009814	I... Yes, well. If we weren't in danger right now, I'd suggest something different. But this should see you through for the time being.
1DI0009815	If it will help me, then I will take it. I trust you, Doctor Li.
1DI0009816	Garza, we have no medicine... but there is something else that may help for now.
1DI0009817	Garza, I'm sorry. We have to go now.
1DI0009818	I cannot make it on my own, Doctor Li! I am too weak!
1DI0009819	I'm sorry, Garza. I have everyone else to think of as well. If you reach the Citadel, they'll be waiting for you.
1DI0009820	But... What will I do? You would leave me here alone?
1DI0009821	Garza, I'm sorry, but we must keep moving. If you can't keep up, I'm afraid we'll have to go on without you.
1DI0009822	All right. If you're up to it, we'll continue.
1DI0009823	Thank you, Doctor Li. I'm feeling better already. Let us continue, and not waste more time here.
1DI0009824	Garza, here. This will help you to feel better. Once we reach the Citadel, you'll be fine.
1DI0009825	I'm sorry, Garza. I wish there was more we could do.
1DI0009826	I insist. You have greater problems to worry about. I will be all right. Now please, go.
1DI0009827	We can't just leave you here. It isn't right.
1DI0009828	You know what to do, Doctor Li. You must go on without me.
1DI0009829	Garza, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.
1DI0009830	They just burst in, and James locked the door. Why would he lock me out? What does he think he's doing?
1DI0009831	There's an old tunnel that will lead us out of here, to someplace safe. We used it as an evacuation route once before, but that was a long time ago.
1DI0009832	I hope everyone remembers how to get there. There isn't time to round everyone up. Come on, follow me. And hurry!
1DI0009833	There's nothing anyone can do for him now. The radiation levels in there are lethal. You'd die the same way he did.
1DI0009834	We need to get out of here, now!
1DI0009835	Aaaaaaahh!
1DI0009836	So you did. I apologize for entertaining the thought of doubting you.
1DI0009837	There's a locked door up ahead. I can open it, but it'll take some time.
1DI0009838	James... Your father caused an overload. He sacrificed himself to keep the Enclave from getting the purifier, and to buy us time to escape.
1DI0009839	There'll be more of them coming. We need to get out of here before they find us, or else your father died in vain.
1DI0009840	We used an old, abandoned tunnel as an escape route once before, many years ago. Everyone should know how to find it.
1DI0009841	We need to get there right now. Let's go.
1DI0009842	I sure hope so, or it's just going to crush Doctor Li completely. Especially after your father came back and all.
1DI0009843	I have faith in your father. With the knowledge he's gained, we stand a better chance than we ever have.
1DI0009844	If Doctor Li says it will work, then it will be so.
1DI0009845	The hell do you care? You showed up here what, five minutes ago, and now you're strutting around like you own the place?
1DI0009846	You shouldn't even be here. Why don't you go do whatever it is you're supposed to be doing and leave me alone.
1DI0009847	Not if you keep asking me stupid questions.
1DI0009848	I don't see why not. Between Doctor Li and your dad, we've got the best minds on the job. They can do just about anything.
1DI0009849	Yeah, I think we'll be up and running in no time.
1DI0009850	Doctor Li has been waiting to come back here for twenty years, okay? Twenty. That's a long time.
1DI0009851	This is important. We can't afford to screw it up.
1DI0009852	The Brotherhood of Steel was overwhelmed by mutants here. Be careful they do not overwhelm you; I am sure some still lurk within the tunnels.
1DI0009853	Besides the fact that you shouldn't be here?
1DI0009854	Don't touch anything you're not told to. There's enough to do around here without having to clean up after you.
1DI0009855	I'd steer clear of the water if I were you. It's seeping in from the Tidal Basin, which means it's radioactive.
1DI0009856	If that's not bad enough, if there are any loose wires as the power comes back on... you might get a bit of a jolt. Know what I mean?
1DI0009857	I am feeling better, but not well enough to be of use to you. I apologize.
1DI0009858	I think not. I am no great fighter to begin with, and... I am not feeling well. I would only get in your way.
1DI0009859	I can try. I'm not much good with weapons, but if you've got a pistol I can use, I'll do what I can.
1DI0009860	What? You're supposed to be the tough one, right? Why don't you take care of it?
1DI0009861	Head back downstairs. The one you're looking for is underneath the mainframe room, I think.
1DI0009862	Right, because I'm supposed to know exactly what you're talking about.
1DI0009863	Dad's got you doing the dirty work, huh? Well, good for you. Doesn't hurt to get your hands dirty.
1DI0009864	You'll find the pumps down in the sub-basement. It's one level below where we are now.
1DI0009865	Just look for the big switch on the wall. Throw that, and the pumps'll fire right up.
1DI0009866	You're kidding me, right?
1DI0009867	Ugh. They're downstairs in the sub-basement. You want me to hold your hand while you look for them?
1DI0009868	Targets confirmed westbound.  Move to intercept.
1DI0009869	Did we forget to compensate for the power fluctuations in our last calculation? I'd hate to see us short something out now.
1DI0009870	I'm concerned that we're overlooking something, James. I don't want us to be too hasty.
1DI0009871	Yes, Doctor?
1DI0009872	It's fine, Madison. Everything is taken care of. There's no reason to be nervous.
1DI0009873	We haven't forgotten anything. We're on top of the situation. Come on, we're professionals!
1DI0009874	Make sure to stay in contact with Daniel and Alex. I'm waiting for a report from them.
1DI0009875	When you have a moment, can you check the pressure on tanks 3 and 4? I'm concerned there may be a leak.
1DI0009876	I suppose you're right. Being back here after all this time, I can't help but be a little concerned.
1DI0009877	I'm already taking care of that. I'll let you know if there are any abnormal results.
1DI0009878	Doctor Li asked me to keep an eye on the power relays in level 3, but I'll take care of that for you.
1DI0009879	Yes sir. I'll attend to that in just a moment.
1DI0009881	It'll be good to work side-by-side with you, son.
1DI0009883	It'll be good to work side-by-side with you, honey.
1DI0009884	Probably. But we have to try, don't we? It's too important to the people of the Wasteland to let fear stop us now.
1DI0009885	We need to get moving right away. Are you coming with us?
1DI0009886	Are you sure? I'm sure we could use your help.
1DI0009887	If you change your mind, you can always meet up with us along the way. If nothing else, come see me once we're set up.
1DI0009888	After twenty long years, I finally have a chance to make things right, to finish what I started so long ago.
1DI0009889	I owe this to Madison. I owe it to your mother. No, I can't wait another moment. Are you coming with us?
1DI0009890	You heard me. We need you right now. You're the only one here with any amount of combat experience.
1DI0009891	We've got the Enclave behind us and who-knows-what ahead of us. If we're going to make it through here, we need your help.
1DI0009892	We'll be right behind you. Be careful.
1DI0009893	I'm responsible for these people, and with James gone, I'm responsible for Project Purity.
1DI0009894	You're not getting into the Citadel without me, so I suggest you start listening to what I have to say.
1DI0009895	Are you sure? I don't want to stay in one place for too long.
1DI0009896	We're underground. No one's been down here for a long time. Odds are we're not alone. Understand me?
1DI0009897	We don't have time to waste. We need to get moving.
1DI0009898	I don't know what's ahead. That's the problem.
1DI0009899	No one has used these tunnels in years. But we can't stay put; the Enclave will find us eventually. We have to get moving.
1DI0009900	This tunnel leads to the Citadel, the Brotherhood of Steel's fortress. We should be safe there, if we can make it.
1DI0009901	We need to keep everyone together, and we need to get through this tunnel as quickly as possible.
1DI0009902	We're not safe until we reach the other side. You should stay close, and we'll follow behind you.
1DI0009903	We need to stick together, but we need to move quickly. We'll follow behind you, all right? Let's get moving.
1DI0009904	The most we can do is carry on his spirit. Live as he would have; make our world a better place.
1DI0009905	Really... I assumed that you would have taken after your father. I assumed incorrectly.
1DI0009906	Think nothing of it. Your father was a visionary. He spent his life trying to make this world a better place for all of us. Few can say that.
1DI0009907	Very well. We'll sort this all out.
1DI0009908	Yes. She knows what we need. Vault-Tec computer, something to locate equipment. Please help her.
1DI0009909	Yes. He knows what we need. Vault-Tec computer, something to locate equipment. Please help him.
1DI0009910	All right, Madison. It'll be okay. Now, this is James' daughter, I presume? I can see the resemblance.
1DI0009911	All right, Madison. It'll be okay. Now, this is James' son, I presume? I can see the resemblance.
1DI0009912	No, I don't think... I don't know. I just don't know what's happening anymore.
1DI0009913	Is that so? Does the Enclave know this?
1DI0009914	That's not true. James... He found what's been missing. We know how to get it running.
1DI0009915	Now now, calm down. You know as well as I do that the purifier doesn't work. It's useless to them. Perhaps it's time to walk away.
1DI0009916	Then do something now! They've taken over the purifier. Lyons, they cannot be permitted to have control over it. It's not right!
1DI0009917	Then it's as we feared. Madison, I'm sorry this happened. I wish we could have done something...
1DI0009918	The Enclave. They've attacked Project Purity. James is dead... there may be more. I don't know. You have to do something!
1DI0009919	Yes, I'd heard reports of an incident there. What details can you give us?
1DI0009920	Don't talk down to me, Lyons. I had nowhere else to turn. You must help us. Project Purity has been overrun.
1DI0009921	Madison, I'm surprised to see you here. What can I do for you?
1DI0009922	Indeed. Farewell.
1DI0009923	You share your father's determination, it seems. And in this case, you are correct. There may well be another way.
1DI0009924	Vault 87 is located very close to the site of Lamplight Caverns. It is entirely probable that the Vault may be entered from within the caves.
1DI0009925	No, I'm afraid not. After initial attempts to cross the radiation failed, it was decided to focus our efforts elsewhere.
1DI0009926	You, however, are free to do as you choose. More exploration may be useful. And I'll certainly be interested in anything you might find.
1DI0009927	The Brotherhood simply cannot spare the resources necessary to investigate the area. Perhaps you may be more successful.
1DI0009928	If you do find anything, please return here so that we may decide on how best to proceed.
1DI0009929	Attempts were made, but our resources are stretched thin. The radiation proved fatal, and so our efforts were focused elsewhere.
1DI0009930	Perhaps you will have more success.
1DI0009931	Taking the loss in stride, are we?
1DI0009932	It would seem the Brotherhood has more pressing matters to attend to than a twenty year old, defunct project.
1DI0009933	Out of respect for your father, however, I will offer advice. What exactly do you need?
1DI0009934	Yes, well... I am afraid that with the emergence of the Enclave, the Brotherhood is rather busy right now.
1DI0009935	I elected to take time from my responsibilities to assist you. Perhaps I was in error. Nonetheless, we may have what you seek.
1DI0009936	In the archives upstairs is an old, pre-war Vault-Tec terminal. I will send word that you need access to it.
1DI0009937	I have been a part of the Brotherhood for many years. Enough that I was here when Project Purity first began.
1DI0009938	I did not work directly with your father; he and his team valued their independence, and I respected that.
1DI0009939	Are you quite sure? I suspect that would be a waste of time. Regardless, the Brotherhood is not in possession of such a device.
1DI0009940	There is, however, a way in which we may be able to ascertain the location of one.
1DI0009941	Really. A pity... You won't find one here.
1DI0009942	It may be possible to locate one, however.
1DI0009943	A G.E.C.K.? Goodness, no. Certainly not.
1DI0009944	I must say that there are some who doubt such a device really exists, let alone works.
1DI0009945	If, however, you share your father's determination, I may be able to assist you in locating one.
1DI0009946	I fail to see how such a device would be useful to you. In fact, I doubt such a thing really works.
1DI0009947	Either way, the Brotherhood is not in possession of such a device.
1DI0009948	If you are determined to waste your time, you may go off in search of one.
1DI0009949	I take it you were successful, then.
1DI0009950	As it happens, the Brotherhood has some information about Vault 87. Let me show you what we know.
1DI0009953	Ah. Well, that much I believe I can help with.
1DI0009954	Step over here for a moment. I'll show you where it is.
1DI0009955	So quick to give up... Disappointing.
1DI0009956	There is, in fact, another potential way to reach the Vault. Lamplight Caverns is close by, and may provide an alternate means of access.
1DI0009957	Possibly. I'm afraid I won't be able to assist you directly; the news Doctor Li has brought will require me to be elsewhere.
1DI0009958	I can, however, give you access to an old pre-war computer from Vault-Tec. It may have the information you need.
1DI0009959	You'll find the terminal in the archives in the A ring.
1DI0009960	You are welcome. If you require further assistance, I may be able to help.
1DI0009961	Think nothing of it.
1DI0009962	Now, Doctor Li has explained your predicament. You need to locate some Vault-Tec equipment?
1DI0009963	Quite simply, you don't. To attempt such a thing would be certain death for you.
1DI0009964	I find your attitude and lack of respect insulting.
1DI0009965	I wish we could do more, but the Brotherhood potentially faces a very pressing, very real threat in the Enclave.
1DI0009966	All of my efforts must now be devoted to assessing the threat they may pose to us. I'm sure you understand.
1DI0009967	I find it hard to believe your father raised such a child.
1DI0009968	I feel pity for whatever it is you've gone through that has made you so bitter.
1DI0009969	Can you now, without even knowing what the problem is?
1DI0009970	I suppose, then, you have a way to deal with lethal levels of radiation around the Vault?
1DI0009971	The area is highly irradiated; lethal levels are all around the entrance. Gaining direct access will be quite impossible.
1DI0009972	Thought you'd get out of here, did you? You little shit. Get back inside, now.
1DI0009973	You're fuckin' dead, you hear me? Dead!
1DI0009974	You! Get back here now!
1DI0009975	Run Sammy, run! We can make it!
1DI0009976	Oh, don't worry. We're outta here. Me and Sammy can make it, no problem. The drain in the bathroom is small; we'll fit through, but mungos can't.
1DI0009977	But you gotta tell Penny it's time to go. She's being all dumb, and won't listen to us. You gotta talk to her.
1DI0009978	Yep, me and Sammy can get out no problem. We're good at sneaking. They'll never spot us.
1DI0009979	We can just sneak through the drain in the bathrooms. It's just big enough for us. Way too small for you mungos.
1DI0009980	But Penny won't leave. She's being all stupid, and even though we told her it's the only chance to go, she says she's staying.
1DI0009981	Thanks, I guess. Me and Sammy should be able to make it out of here now.
1DI0009982	There's a drain in the bathrooms we can fit through. It's too small for mungos, so they never boarded it up.
1DI0009983	But Penny won't leave. I tried to get her to come with us, but she's being all stupid.
1DI0009984	Already forgotten. Now take a hike.
1DI0009986	Now that I think about it, Forty has been lookin' mighty fine lately. Workin' out extra.
1DI0009987	Maybe I'll go see if there's anything I can do for him. You keep this between me and you. Clear?
1DI0009988	Maybe he could. Maybe...
1DI0009989	Maybe I'll go see how he's doing. Maybe there's something I could do for him.
1DI0009990	You ain't gonna say a word 'bout this, right?
1DI0009991	All right, all right. Just keep quiet.
1DI0009992	Come on, Forty. Let's go take a break.
1DI0009993	I, uhh...
1DI0009994	Yeah, he might. Except he ain't gonna know nothing about it. Come on, I see the way you look at me. I can really give you something to look at.
1DI0009995	That's a pretty stupid idea, even for you. Eulogy'd kill us both.
1DI0009996	Oh, nothing. I was just sitting around, all bored and anxious, and thinking maybe I could find something to do. I mean, maybe we could.
1DI0009997	The hell you want, Crimson?
1DI0009998	Hey there, sugar. Lonely night?
1DI0009999	Uh-huh. And what makes you think I give two shits about what Forty could use?
1DI0010000	A very good eye, my friend. Those little ones are good as a long-term investment. They have their other uses as well, I'm sure.
1DI0010001	They are most definitely up for sale.
1DI0010002	Yes, we've covered that. They're still available.
1DI0010003	Well you should! Go on out, take a gander, and see if there's anything that might meet your needs.
1DI0010004	I will point out that there are a few kids out there. Not something you see very often; a very good long-term investment.
1DI0010005	We can discuss details once you've had a chance to look things over.
1DI0010006	Are you sure? That's a shame. I thought we had a good thing going here. Well, you know where to find us.
1DI0010007	Okay, then let's talk business.
1DI0010008	Names?
1DI0010009	I think Forty has a few nicknames for them, but none of them are very polite.
1DI0010010	Does it really matter? They're here now, and they're available for purchase.
1DI0010011	They're all in excellent physical condition, if that's what you're wondering.
1DI0010012	A bit stubborn, perhaps. But that behavior can be altered over time.
1DI0010013	What did you want to know?
1DI0010014	I'm sorry, what?
1DI0010015	I hope you're not trying to strong-arm me, friend. I'd be more than happy to cut both your legs off before you even think you have one to stand on.
1DI0010016	The price isn't going to change, if that's what you're hoping. They'll be here when you can cover the cost.
1DI0010017	Well, then I guess I can't sell them to you.
1DI0010018	That's your choice. They're your caps, after all. I'm not going to try a hard sell here; someone else will buy them eventually.
1DI0010019	Fair enough. It's a pleasure to do business with you again.
1DI0010020	I'll have the kids delivered to the front gate. And, may I recommend keeping a close eye on them? They're clever little bastards.
1DI0010021	A wise decision. It's a pleasure to do business with you.
1DI0010023	I suppose I can accept that. It's a deal; the kids are yours. I'll have them delivered to the front gate for you.
1DI0010024	If I may, you might want to keep a close eye on them. They can be willful at times. Good luck.
1DI0010025	For starters, I'm thinking 500 caps each for the little ones... Sammy and Penny, I think their names are.
1DI0010026	Now the other one, Squirrel... that's a talented kid. 500 would be a crime. I'm thinking 1000 caps for him, bringing us to a total of 2000 caps.
1DI0010027	Right, right. 2000 caps was the figure I quoted. The price still stands if you're still interested.
1DI0010028	Of course. So you know what we have to offer; I assure you that you won't find quality like this anywhere else.
1DI0010029	Now how exactly can Paradise Falls accomodate your needs?
1DI0010030	Ah, fully engrossed in the trade, are we? I'm glad you came to see me, instead of trying to work around me. Easier to get along this way.
1DI0010031	There are some prime specimens out there. Have you had a chance to look them over?
1DI0010032	Well then, you and I are a perfect fit. You want to buy slaves, and I want to sell them.
1DI0010034	You do? Hell, that's great news. They'll work out well for you, I think. Full of energy. Great for small jobs now, and bigger loads down the road.
1DI0010035	I'm sure we can come to a reasonable agreement; something you'll find affordable.
1DI0010036	This mungo, Rory Maclaren. She got all sweet on him or something. I dunno, it's some stupid girl thing.
1DI0010037	But they threw him in the box 'cause he was giving them shit, and they won't let him out.
1DI0010038	So Penny says she ain't going until she knows he's safe. I told her she's stupid.
1DI0010039	Beats me. I don't get girls at ALL.
1DI0010040	She's all sweet on Rory Maclaren or something. Says she won't leave while he's still in the box.
1DI0010041	She went all soft on Rory Maclaren. He's this guy that got captured. Not bad for a Mungo, but Penny really likes him.
1DI0010042	The guards threw him in the box last week for causing problems. He's still in there, and she won't leave until he's out.
1DI0010043	I say he's just another mungo, and ain't our problem. But Penny's being all stupid, like I said.
1DI0010044	Whatever. Get the hell out of here.
1DI0010045	Since when are we such good buddies? Huh?
1DI0010046	I'll tell you what I need. I need you to fuck off.
1DI0010047	You think so, do you?
1DI0010048	Funny, 'cause I ain't heard nothing about it. So maybe you should just get lost.
1DI0010049	Goddamn right, nothing. Now get outta my way.
1DI0010050	Ain't none of 'em getting nowhere. Not with them collars on. Asshole should've known better.
1DI0010051	He did it. Dumb shit should've known the collar would blow. Now somebody's gotta clean up this mess.
1DI0010052	The little shits are your problem now. I see 'em around here again, I'm gonna shoot 'em. We clear?
1DI0010053	Maybe... And maybe it's time to see Eulogy about a raise.
1DI0010054	Yeah, so maybe I get a raw deal sometimes. Everybody does out here. That's the way shit goes.
1DI0010055	But maybe it's time that changed. Maybe I go see Eulogy about that right now, in fact.
1DI0010056	Well... I mean, yeah. I ain't exactly in charge here, but I'm Eulogy's right-hand man.
1DI0010057	Some other jackass should be pulling nighttime guard duty. Maybe I'll go have a little chat with Eulogy about that.
1DI0010058	Hey, back away from the kid.
1DI0010059	Quit hasslin' the merchandise.
1DI0010060	I know, I know... but he was so nice to me. I just wanted him to be safe.
1DI0010061	Fine, I'll go.
1DI0010062	I know... I just wanted him to be safe. They were gonna sell him and then he was gonna leave and I'd never see him again and... and...
1DI0010063	Let's just go, okay? I don't want to think about it.
1DI0010064	Nuh-uh. Not without Rory.
1DI0010065	You gotta get him out of the box. You just gotta! They've got keys for it somewhere. That mungo Forty has one.
1DI0010066	I don't know where the other one is. His boss probably has it somewhere. You get Rory out, and I'll leave. Not until then.
1DI0010067	You'll help? Oh, thank you!
1DI0010068	You have to get Rory out of the box. He's locked in there, and the guards have the key. I think Forty has one; I don't know where the other is.
1DI0010069	Probably the boss guy has it, or it's in his room. You find the key, you can get Rory out, and then I'll leave.
1DI0010070	I can't. If they see me out there, they'll throw me back in and then I'll never get out. You have to do it.
1DI0010071	You gotta get the key to the box. That mungo, Forty... He's got one. I think the boss guy has the other one. Keeps it in his room.
1DI0010072	If you can get Rory out, come and get me and then we can leave. I just won't leave him behind.
1DI0010073	Poor Rory... He was a nice man. He deserved better.
1DI0010074	I'm getting out of here. Don't follow me.
1DI0010075	You saved him? Really?
1DI0010076	Thank you so much. I'll make it up to you somehow, I promise.
1DI0010077	Now I have to get out. Don't follow me; you go out the normal way. We'll meet outside.
1DI0010078	Okay, okay!
1DI0010079	Don't follow me. You go out the normal way, and meet Sammy and me outside.
1DI0010080	Okay, if you say so. I'm getting out of here, then.
1DI0010081	You go out the normal way, so they don't get suspicious. Meet us outside.
1DI0010082	I already told Sammy AND Squirrel I'm not going. I'm not leaving Rory!
1DI0010083	What're you gonna do, shoot me?
1DI0010084	No! I'm not leaving while they've still got Rory locked up!
1DI0010085	He's the only person here that's been nice to me. I'm not just going to leave him like that!
1DI0010086	Penny? She wanted you to set me free?
1DI0010087	I owe that little girl a lot. I'll have to try and make it up to her someday.
1DI0010088	Okay, what do we do?
1DI0010089	Okay, fine. If it'll help Penny, I'll do it. What do you want me to do?
1DI0010090	No... No, I want Penny to be safe. She shouldn't be having second thoughts just because of me.
1DI0010091	Just make sure you take care of her. I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her, or her friends.
1DI0010092	So what do we do now?
1DI0010093	You got it. I'll stay right with you. Get me to the front gate, and I can make a run for it from there.
1DI0010094	That's it, huh? Just toss me out of the box and into the meat grinder?
1DI0010095	Thanks for nothing, asshole.
1DI0010096	Okay, if you say so. I'll be right behind you. If you can get me to the front gate, I can take it from there.
1DI0010098	Okay. Let's get the hell out of here.
1DI0010099	Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
1DI0010100	What? Are you kidding me? This is another one of Forty's tricks, isn't it. Well I'm not falling for it.
1DI0010101	Where are we going? What's going on? Who the hell ARE you?
1DI0010102	What? What's going on? Who are you?
1DI0010104	She did? Is she safe? Can I see her?
1DI0010105	Look, I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. For all I know, you're just trying to trick me into another beating.
1DI0010106	Fine, fine. Let's go. What's the plan?
1DI0010107	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to him.
1DI0010108	Hey, that's the mungo. Go talk to her.
1DI0010109	Thanks for nothing, ass.
1DI0010110	You saw what happened to that other guy. Same thing'd happen to me if I try to run away now.
1DI0010111	Collar would pop my head right off. And besides, I don't wanna leave without Squirrel and Penny.
1DI0010112	I'll hide out here. Can you go in and get them?
1DI0010113	This collar. It's gotta get turned off, or else I can't get out of here. You saw what happened to that other guy.
1DI0010114	And then Squirrel and Penny... They're still inside, locked in the cage. You gotta get them out too.
1DI0010115	No way the slavers are gonna let them walk out, so you're gonna have to bust them out. Think you can handle it?
1DI0010116	I just thought maybe you could do something, since they're all gonna shoot you anyway.
1DI0010117	Squirrel and Penny are still stuck in there, and none of us can leave while they got these collars turned on.
1DI0010118	If you can get the slave pen open, Squirrel and Penny can make a run for it, and we can get out of here. What do you say?
1DI0010119	You're okay for a mungo. Squirrel and Penny are still stuck inside. You need to get the key to the slave pen to get 'em out.
1DI0010120	That Forty asshole has one, and so does the boss guy, Eulogy. Go get 'em!
1DI0010121	Think about it? Come on, mungo. You can do it.
1DI0010122	Well I'm gonna hang out here until you make up your stupid mind.
1DI0010123	Thanks for nothing, mungo.
1DI0010124	Can't you just shoot them all?
1DI0010125	Sure. Most mungos like you don't know where it is. We like it that way.
1DI0010126	But we gotta get out of here. If you can help us, I'll show you where it is. Maybe Mayor will even be nice to you. But only if you help us.
1DI0010127	Well we need to get out of here and get back there. Right now. So you gotta help us, okay?
1DI0010128	Really? I knew it! I knew he'd come to get us!
1DI0010129	Didn't think he'd send a mungo like you to do it, though.
1DI0010130	You do? Great!
1DI0010131	Whatever you do, make sure you turn off these collars. You saw what happened to that other guy.
1DI0010132	Well, I mean, Squirrel thinks maybe he could use the computer in here to turn off the collars.
1DI0010133	Squirrel's good with computers, and they don't know he made this one work again. But it's, uh... It's not connected or something.
1DI0010134	Hang on. I'll get Squirrel, and he can tell you what to do.
1DI0010135	No? You sure?
1DI0010136	Well, okay. I guess maybe we could try Squirrel's plan. He says it'll work, but I don't know. It means using computers and stuff.
1DI0010137	Hang on. Let me get him, and he can tell you the plan. I don't understand some of it, anyway.
1DI0010138	What? That's a load of shit. We're not stupid, you know. We've seen what you mungos are like.
1DI0010140	Rescued? This is a pretty stupid way to rescue anybody, mungo.
1DI0010141	God, why didn't you say that?
1DI0010142	Come on, let's go before they change their minds. I don't like the way that mungo looks at me.
1DI0010143	Yeah, yeah. Okay.
1DI0010144	Well... No. You better be telling the truth, mungo, or else we're going to kill you in your sleep.
1DI0010145	So if you're serious, let's get moving.
1DI0010146	What is there to talk about? I know what you're doing. You're going to take us somewhere and make us work for you... or worse.
1DI0010147	I'm telling you right now, as soon as we get out of here, we're making a run for it. You want to try and shoot us, you can.
1DI0010148	You did? You better not be lying. Fine, let's go.
1DI0010149	I'm Sammy. I'm from Little Lamplight. Me and Squirrel and Penny... We aren't supposed to be here.
1DI0010150	We gotta get back home. You gotta help us get out of here.
1DI0010151	Look, we're not supposed to be in here. We live in Little Lamplight. Ever heard of it?
1DI0010152	Hey hey, look at Mr. Mungo!
1DI0010153	Sure hope whatever you did doesn't piss off the rest of them.
1DI0010154	Okay, me and Sammy can sneak outta here. The drain in the bathroom is just big enough for us to sneak through.
1DI0010155	But Penny's being all dumb and won't leave. What's with girls, anyway?
1DI0010156	Man, can't you think of anything on your own?
1DI0010157	Around midnight, there's only one guard. But it's that really mean guy, Forty. Still, probably your best chance to try something.
1DI0010158	Do what you gotta do, you know? Just get him away from his post.
1DI0010159	Come on, mungo! How hard can it be?
1DI0010160	This is bull, man. You gotta help us out.
1DI0010161	What the shit? Come on, you already did half the work. Just a little more and we're outta here. Don't screw us over now.
1DI0010162	Okay. Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0010164	What's the matter, mungo? Can't handle it?
1DI0010165	You're big enough to take care of it. Don't get all cranky with me over it.
1DI0010166	Yeah, maybe you're right. Me and Sammy can leave, at least.
1DI0010167	All right, we're outta here. See you on the outside, mungo.
1DI0010168	Well, with the terminal, I can turn off the collars and open the gate. But they're not gonna just let us walk out of here, you know?
1DI0010169	There's always at least one guard near the pen, and someone's gotta get rid of him.
1DI0010170	Since we can't just walk around like we own the place, you're gonna have to do it. You get me?
1DI0010171	Hey mungo, I never said the terminal was the only thing we'd need to do. It's important, but it won't get us out that front gate.
1DI0010172	There's always at least one guard near the pen, and the terminal ain't gonna make the guard disappear. So you gotta do it.
1DI0010173	Hey, if you got any better ideas, you go right ahead and get to work. Me? This is the best I got.
1DI0010174	We got the terminal working, so I can turn off the collars, but we still gotta make it out of here. Past the guards.
1DI0010175	Unless you can get rid of the guard near the pen, we're going nowhere. So you gonna help, or you just gonna complain?
1DI0010176	Hell, I dunno. Go talk to her. Try and get her to get out while she can.
1DI0010177	Me and Sammy are getting out of here now, though. If you can get her to come, meet us east of here after you're out.
1DI0010178	Hey, you're the one that said you wanted to get us out of here.
1DI0010179	Go talk to her. See if you can get her to come with us. Me and Sammy are getting out of here right now.
1DI0010180	We'll wait east of Paradise Falls. Meet us there once Penny's out.
1DI0010181	So I found this old terminal in the building here. Dusty, but it turns on with a little fixing. Like I said, I'm super smart.
1DI0010182	I know they use a terminal to turn the collars on and off. So if you can link the terminals, I can turn the collars off and they won't even know.
1DI0010183	Then we just gotta open the fence, sneak past the mungos with guns, and get the hell out of here. Sounds good, right? You in?
1DI0010184	Fine. But I'm telling you, it's good stuff. Really.
1DI0010185	We gotta turn the collars off, or else if we try to leave we'll get all chunkified. Don't want that. So we gotta use a terminal for it.
1DI0010186	I can use the terminal I fixed up in here, but I need it added to the network first. Main terminal is in the boss guy's room, so you gotta do that.
1DI0010187	Okay, cool. You'll like it, really. It's going to work, I know it.
1DI0010188	We're stuck behind this fence here. But even if we get past the fence, and the mungos with guns, we still can't leave.
1DI0010189	They got these collars on us, right? Make us blow up if we try and get out. No way to get the collars off, so we gotta stop them from blowing up.
1DI0010190	Man, you're cranky.
1DI0010191	Fine, here's what you do. You go on into the boss guy's room, and use his terminal. Get the one in here added to the network.
1DI0010192	Think you can handle that, mungo?
1DI0010193	Oh, come on. Aren't you mungos good for anything? I'm a kid, and I can do it. Why can't you?
1DI0010194	Listen, if you can't make that work, then there might be one other way to do it, even for a stupid mungo like you.
1DI0010195	There's a junction box along the wall in the eating area. Switch a few cables there, and we're good. So there you go.
1DI0010196	Either you better be pretty good at fixing stuff, or you better learn how to use a terminal real fast.
1DI0010197	You're really dumb, aren't you?
1DI0010198	I just told you this is the plan. I don't got another way to do this.
1DI0010199	Great. Then that means we're still stuck in here, and you're an asshole.
1DI0010200	Gee, thanks. Don't work too hard, okay?
1DI0010201	All right! You're okay for a mungo, you know that?
1DI0010202	So we're one step closer to getting out of here.
1DI0010203	Nope. Good job on the terminal, but we're only one step of the way there.
1DI0010204	Ha ha. Real funny, mungo.
1DI0010205	So I guess you fixed it huh? Well good. Means we're one step closer to getting out of here.
1DI0010206	I told you, it's in the boss guy's room. You gotta sneak in there or something. That's up to you to figure out, mungo.
1DI0010207	Good work, soldier. Make sure the G.E.C.K. is secured aboard my Vertibird.
1DI0010208	You're certain she's unharmed?
1DI0010209	You're certain he's unharmed?
1DI0010210	Excellent. Prepare her for transport immediately.
1DI0010211	Excellent. Prepare him for transport immediately.
1DI0010212	The contract entitles you to my services in combat. I'm nobody's errand boy. I'm afraid you'll have to get it yourself.
1DI0010213	Me? You care who I am?
1DI0010214	Forgive me, but I'm not used to pleasantries. I'm more used to grunts and being struck about by the others.
1DI0010215	My name's Fawkes. I've lived in this... cage all my life.
1DI0010216	What's the matter with you? I assure you I'm unlike the others in this dank place.
1DI0010217	The name's Fawkes. I'd shake your hand, but this room happens to be my prison cell.
1DI0010218	Ugh. Must you use that vulgar term?
1DI0010219	Yes, I was born in the F.E.V. Chambers but a Super Mutant I certainly am not. I prefer the term Meta Human. Suits me better don't you think?
1DI0010220	Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. The name's Fawkes.
1DI0010221	No, please. I haven't had a civil conversation all my life! Don't go!
1DI0010222	I could help you!
1DI0010223	Yes. I suppose it is. When my captors placed me here, they were too stupid to realize this room contained a working terminal.
1DI0010224	I've spent all my life teaching myself to read and speak based on the information stored on the Vault's Mainframe.
1DI0010225	Ironic, isn't it? Surrounded by the world's history and yet my world consists of this tiny room.
1DI0010226	It was taken from a historical entry in the computer. The name comes from a man who was willing to fight and die for what he believed in.
1DI0010227	I felt it was appropriate given my circumstances.
1DI0010228	Very well. If this is what's to be expected from interacting with humans, then I'm likely better off in here than out there amongst you.
1DI0010229	Your arrogance against my kind is hardly surprising.
1DI0010230	However, there's only so much even I can take. Please, I'm appealing to the positive side of your human nature.
1DI0010231	Can we have a civil conversation?
1DI0010232	Because I'm a curiosity; an anomaly. They don't know why I'm different than they are and I think it fascinates them.
1DI0010233	All of the locked rooms in the medical wing contain failed experiments that they created.
1DI0010234	I think when I was created, something went wrong and I didn't come out like they planned.
1DI0010235	Just like the other things in this makeshift cell block, we're the results of what they would call failed experiments if they were smart enough.
1DI0010236	Let me guess... you're here for the G.E.C.K.. am I right?
1DI0010237	Perhaps. I assume you're here to find the G.E.C.K.
1DI0010238	Is it? What if I told you I could help you find the G.E.C.K.?
1DI0010239	Yes, indeed it is ironic.
1DI0010240	Forgive my astonishment, but I hadn't expected to meet someone with such a learned outlook of these things. It is a pleasant change.
1DI0010241	I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, it was only a matter of time before someone like you showed up for the G.E.C.K.
1DI0010242	Yes, you do appear a bit harried and you obviously didn't come into the depths of this place to chat with me.
1DI0010243	I'd imagine the only reason you'd risk life and limb would be to retrieve the G.E.C.K. from its resting place.
1DI0010244	I know what it is, I know where it is and best of all, I know how you can get your hands on it.
1DI0010245	I read a tape once on how to tell if someone's lying and I must say you're a terrible liar.
1DI0010246	Why else would you be in this horrible place if it wasn't to get it? People before you have tried and failed many times.
1DI0010247	However, you're in luck. I know where it is and best of all, I know how you can get your hands on it.
1DI0010248	Because, you can help me.
1DI0010249	Let me out of this place. I can't take it anymore. I can't even recall how long I've been here.
1DI0010250	Take me with you, and I'll retrieve the G.E.C.K. for you.
1DI0010251	Not so fast. Quid pro quo, my friend. If I'm to do this service for you, I expect to get something in return.
1DI0010252	Release me from this makeshift prison and I will personally take you to the G.E.C.K. and retrieve it for you.
1DI0010253	What is it with your kind? This is why the bombs fell you know.
1DI0010254	I have no reason to tell you anything. You kill me, you get nothing. So what's the point?
1DI0010255	Let me out of this place and I'll retrieve the G.E.C.K. for you.
1DI0010256	The chamber in which the G.E.C.K. resides is absolutely flooded with radiation. It's unlikely you'd survive very long.
1DI0010257	Myself, on the other hand, have surprisingly inherited a useful trait from my fellow Meta Humans. I am highly resistant to radiation.
1DI0010258	Let me out of here, and I will place the G.E.C.K. safely in your hands.
1DI0010259	Unless your weapons can destroy radiation, I'd say that will prove difficult.
1DI0010260	The G.E.C.K. is in a chamber flooded with deadly radiation. I doubt you could survive inside very long. However, I can.
1DI0010262	At the end of the hallway to your right is a maintenance room.
1DI0010263	Inside, you'll find the fire control console for the medical area. Trip the alarm on it, and I'll be able to get out.
1DI0010264	A word of warning though. Tripping the console activates a failsafe and will open ALL of the recovery rooms in the medical area.
1DI0010265	So, what do you think? Can you do it?
1DI0010266	There's no way to prove it, you'll just have to take my word for it.
1DI0010267	I've already helped you by warning you about the radiation. Take that as a gesture of good faith.
1DI0010268	So what do you say?
1DI0010269	So be it. Take your device and leave me here. It's what I expected.
1DI0010270	When you give up because you can't get the G.E.C.K. and you realize your mistake, you'll be back.
1DI0010271	Indeed. Your powers of deduction are quite impressive. I do indeed know where it is and how to get it.
1DI0010272	The device is surrounded by a lethal field of radiation; lethal to humans that is.
1DI0010273	Without insulting your intelligence, I think you can see where this is going.
1DI0010274	I'm glad to see you are a sensible person.
1DI0010275	Now, get me out of this place. I can't stand it anymore!
1DI0010276	I appreciate your understanding and your tone leads me to believe you're a reasonable person.
1DI0010277	Perhaps we can use this moment to help each other rather than fight each other.
1DI0010278	I appreciate your understanding.
1DI0010280	Sigh. Very well.
1DI0010281	I was hoping my first encounter with a human would have proven more beneficial. I'm saddened that I was mistaken.
1DI0010282	You... over there. Please, come speak to me. I'm in the room to your left. Use the intercom next to the window.
1DI0010283	Sorry, I'm afraid a Super Mutant wouldn't be welcome in the places you frequent.
1DI0010284	All I would do is cause you undue attention and probably get you killed.
1DI0010285	Some say it does nothing; that it's simply a pipe dream or a legend. Others feel the device is actually beneficial.
1DI0010286	The latter group claims it creates life where none exists. A new beginning for man.
1DI0010287	Some of the Vaults came equipped with them so after people emerged into the Wasteland, they could restart the world.
1DI0010288	I'm not sure which to believe.
1DI0010289	We can discuss this later. Right now, concentrate on getting this door open.
1DI0010296	I'll stay here until you've cleared a path to me.
1DI0010297	Just be careful. Some of these "failed experiments" are quite nasty.
1DI0010298	I was born here, in this place. I don't mean that in the literal sense of course.
1DI0010299	All I can remember is the excruciating pain that tore through me as my body underwent the rapid physical changes.
1DI0010300	For most, this moment is what severs the grip on their minds. They become barely a shell of their former selves.
1DI0010301	I was different. When I spoke to them, they immediately branded me "another failure" and had me placed here as a curiosity.
1DI0010302	What else can I tell you about myself?
1DI0010303	Yes. I've never been anywhere else. I used to mark the passage of time, but after a few years, it didn't seem to matter anymore.
1DI0010304	The only thing that prevented me from going insane was the working access point to the Vault Mainframe in my makeshift cell.
1DI0010305	The terminal in my cell used to connect with Vault 87's mainframe. That gave me access to the history, literature, science and fiction book files.
1DI0010306	I used this extensive database of works to better myself and my understanding of everything around me.
1DI0010307	It was only recently the others caught me using the terminal and destroyed it to torment me.
1DI0010308	I don't remember enough to tell you everything about my former self. My metamorphosis destroyed a good deal of my long term memory.
1DI0010309	However, I can recall being in this place when it wasn't the macabre laboratory that it's become.
1DI0010310	I remember walking around this place and seeing other humans in white lab coats and blue jumpsuits.
1DI0010311	I wish I could find out more, but the personnel information for the Vault wasn't in the mainframe for some reason.
1DI0010312	I feel like my identity is so close to me... I can almost see myself as a human but can't recollect the details. It's maddening.
1DI0010313	These hallways are familiar to me... I think I used to be a resident here in better times.
1DI0010314	I wish I could remember more, but I'm afraid it's all a blur.
1DI0010315	As for the G.E.C.K., it's always rested where it does now. The foolish Super Mutants don't even know what they have.
1DI0010319	Objective is secured sir.
1DI0010320	Yes sir! I'll have the techs come down and remove it immediately, sir.
1DI0010321	Yes sir! She'll pass out shortly, but we can revive her.
1DI0010322	Yes sir! He'll pass out shortly, but we can revive him.
1DI0010323	Right away, sir!
1DI0010324	Ha ha ha! Yes! Strong soldiers to smash the humans for good!
1DI0010325	Green stuff don't work only because men we take weak. We wait for strong men... they make good soldiers.
1DI0010326	More of us if green stuff work. It makes many mistakes. We dump bodies in cave too many times.
1DI0010327	Ha ha ha, yes! More of them mean more of us soon.
1DI0010328	Let them come to us! We'll take them apart! Then when they weak, we put them in green stuff!
1DI0010329	Stupid Fox say men will come to us one day. To take green stuff.
1DI0010330	Need to find more humans then... make them like us.
1DI0010331	Others go to find some. We must have more of us to stop the humans!
1DI0010332	We almost out of green stuff.
1DI0010333	Is this thing on? Oh, yeah it is... I see the little needle moving. Ahem.
1DI0010334	I'm making these recordings as a diary of my life in one of Vault-Tec's newer vaults. They recommended we keep one, so I figured why not.
1DI0010335	But let me start at the beginning. My name is Shelton Delacroix, and I'm a security officer here in Vault 87.
1DI0010336	I'm assigned to the laboratory level, which sure beats babysitting the reactor room!
1DI0010337	Hopefully, in a few more months, I'll be allowed to learn a little more. It's all so hush hush. But that's the way things are around here.
1DI0010338	Anyway, I'm due on shift soon, so I'll record more later.
1DI0010339	Things are getting a bit weird up here on the laboratory level. I swear I keep hearing these crazy noises coming from the experimentation chambers.
1DI0010340	When I asked about it they told me it's the animals they're testing on. What the heck are they doing to them?
1DI0010341	I think I may look into it some more. It gets boring standing in the hallways and pacing back and forth.
1DI0010342	I... I don't know where to begin. I... have to report what I've seen. There has to be a record of this somewhere.
1DI0010343	Sykes and Cossler dragged some unconscious guy from the dorms into the labs. I tried to ask what was going on, but they just glared at me.
1DI0010344	After they came back out of the containment area, they told me not to tell anyone what I saw or I'd regret it.
1DI0010345	Sykes was even patting his 10 millimeter when he said that. I think they were threatening to kill me!
1DI0010346	After they left I snuck into the containment room, and... and I almost threw up. I don't even know how to describe it.
1DI0010347	It looked sort of human, but it was deformed... I could see some of its organs on the surface of its body like they were trying to push through.
1DI0010348	Its skin was... disgusting. Green and brown and bruised like it was bleeding on the inside. And the smell... it was horrible.
1DI0010349	I staggered out of there and came here to get this all down. What the hell are they doing in this place?
1DI0010350	Oh my god. It's all making sense. The missing people... and those things. They... they... oh my fucking god.
1DI0010351	I'm in hiding now. I'm recording this in the reactor level. They found one of older recordings and now they want me in the labs.
1DI0010352	Luckily I had a friend in the security team and they told me to run. So here I am.
1DI0010353	What the hell am I supposed to do now? Merrick and his team are obviously experimenting on people. Someone's got to put a stop to it.
1DI0010354	But how? There's nowhere to go and no one to tell. Shit, what am I gonna...
1DI0010355	Oh my god. They're coming... I... Tell my wife in Dorm E that I love her... I...
1DI0010356	Stupid machine... how you work this thing... this thing is stupid! Smash it!
1DI0010357	Of course! You've seen the kind of technology these people have. They want to help people. They want to change the Wasteland.
1DI0010358	I couldn't pass up an opportunity to work in an environment like this.
1DI0010359	Get out? Why on earth would I want to do that?
1DI0010360	I've worked hard to fit in here. I've done everything they've asked of me. I'm not about to leave now, when I finally have access to their labs.
1DI0010361	They... they captured me. Brought me here from Project Purity.
1DI0010362	I didn't want to help them at first, but... The technology they have here. It's so far advanced from anything I've worked with.
1DI0010363	I'm Anna. Anna Holt. I used to work for Doctor Li.
1DI0010364	I was at Project Purity... Now I'm here.
1DI0010365	Everything they needed to know to improve on the original design, and to make sure it's actually completed.
1DI0010366	I'm afraid I'm not able to help you with that.
1DI0010367	You should go. I don't want anyone seeing me talking to you.
1DI0010368	They wanted information. About Doctor Li, about Project Purity. They want to know how to start it up, and why it wouldn't work.
1DI0010369	I told them everything I could. About the G.E.C.K., about the damage caused by the explosions... All of it.
1DI0010370	Look, it's not personal. Really, it's not. But Doctor Li... She's scraping by. She's scavenging for parts in the Wastes.
1DI0010371	The Enclave has everything it needs. They're light-years ahead of anything Doctor Li could accomplish.
1DI0010372	Working here is my best chance to help make the world a better place.
1DI0010373	I'm sorry you see it that way. What are you going to do, kill me over it?
1DI0010374	You should go. It sounds like you're in enough trouble as it is, and honestly I don't want anyone to see me talking to you.
1DI0010375	I should have killed you right away. We have the G.E.C.K., we'll get the code. We don't need you.
1DI0010376	Did you really think we would fall for that? I have had ENOUGH of your games.
1DI0010377	You LIE!
1DI0010378	Let's just make sure you're telling the truth.
1DI0010379	Very well. We'll just verify that now.
1DI0010380	IF you tell me the code, it might be worth your life. But you're really not in a position to be demanding anything, are you?
1DI0010381	Now that's just what I wanted to hear.
1DI0010382	So what's the code?
1DI0010383	I'll tell you what's going on here. You lost.
1DI0010384	The good guys won this one, and now we're just wrapping up loose ends. We've got the purifier, now we just need the code to start it.
1DI0010385	You're going to give me that code now, and save us all a lot of trouble. Maybe I'll even let you go. So how about it?
1DI0010386	You really think I'm that stupid? I know you were there. I saw you.
1DI0010387	You're in a heap of trouble, kid. You're a traitor to the United States government. You know what happens to traitors, don't you?
1DI0010388	You give me that code, and maybe we can work out a deal for you. But you need to start talking right now.
1DI0010389	I'm not entirely sure Eden can be trusted. And I think he knows I don't trust him.
1DI0010390	But I don't think he knows I have the emergency destruct sequence for his console.
1DI0010391	"Priority Override, Authorization code 420-03-20-9" and... boom. It'd have to be a last resort, of course, but at least the option is there.
1DI0010392	I'll be honest. I'm running out of patience here, and I'm not looking to play games with you.
1DI0010393	You tell me that code, or it's going to cost you.
1DI0010394	Why do you insist on provoking me?
1DI0010395	Tell me the code NOW.
1DI0010396	Confirm, that's the correct code. Systems coming online now, sir. I'll have a full report shortly.
1DI0010397	Copy 2-1-6. Standby, sir. Entering code now.
1DI0010398	Your code is 2-1-6. Repeat, 2-1-6. Confirm and enter.
1DI0010399	Affirmative, sir. Standing by for code transmission.
1DI0010400	This is Colonel Autumn. Are your men in place, soldier?
1DI0010401	Negative, Sir. The code's no good. I just lost another man.
1DI0010402	Copy 7-0-4. Standby, sir. Entering code now.
1DI0010403	Your code is 7-0-4. Repeat, 7-0-4. Confirm and enter.
1DI0010406	Technically, your father killed himself. His loyalties lay with the wrong people, and he paid the price.
1DI0010407	You, on the other hand, have an opportunity to learn from his mistakes.
1DI0010408	Thank you for cooperating. I'm afraid we no longer have need of your services.
1DI0010409	I'm waiting.
1DI0010410	The prisoner from Vault 101 is to be shot on sight. I repeat, shot on sight. This is an order!
1DI0010411	Attention! This is Colonel Autumn! You are hereby ordered to ignore the President's previous directive.
1DI0010412	Yes sir.
1DI0010413	Now, Colonel...
1DI0010414	Mr. President, I have no time for other matters. I'll be with you shortly.
1DI0010415	Colonel... I have need of you.
1DI0010416	Don't try and play stupid now. It's too late for that; we both know better.
1DI0010417	The code to activate the water purifier. Now.
1DI0010418	You know why. We can't start the purifier without it. The longer the purifier isn't running, the more people suffer.
1DI0010419	Now I'm running out of patience, son. I want that code, and I want it now.
1DI0010420	Oh, but we do! Don't you see? You wouldn't be here if you weren't important. Your country needs you.
1DI0010421	Our nation's Capital is at a crossroads. The path that you and I choose here today will affect us all.
1DI0010422	I need you to act on my behalf, to ensure that our country's future is secured.
1DI0010423	You and I have a chance to make our country a better place for all of us.
1DI0010424	I'd like you to make sure that chance isn't wasted.
1DI0010425	Understand that I am placing a great deal of trust in you. Your simple presence here proves that.
1DI0010426	That's a bit of a bleak outlook, don't you think?
1DI0010427	The United States has fallen on hard times, yes, but it can be healed.
1DI0010428	You have that power to heal within you, if you allow yourself to act.
1DI0010429	What I ask of you needs explanation, so you understand why it must be done. Perhaps that will stir you to act.
1DI0010430	My abilities to influence the world are limited at this time. I alone can only do so much.
1DI0010431	You, however, may come and go as you please. You have a greater degree of freedom.
1DI0010432	Perhaps it is best if I explain why things need to change, and why I'd like you to act on my behalf.
1DI0010433	Just what I needed to hear.
1DI0010434	What I'm going to ask of you may seem a bit... Disturbing. I assure you there's a very good reason for it.
1DI0010435	I'd like to explain what I want you do to. Will you indulge me for a moment?
1DI0010436	Yes, indeed.
1DI0010437	The 'point', is that we are hampered at every turn by a world gone wrong. So called "Super Mutants", Ghouls, horrific creatures...
1DI0010438	The mutations outside these walls must be cleansed before we can prosper. Mutation must be eradicated.
1DI0010439	I believe your father's work can do that more quickly and efficiently than ever possible before.
1DI0010440	Our land is ravaged by mutation. The war was so many years ago, and yet we still suffer from its effects.
1DI0010441	We cannot move forward until humanity can gain a solid foothold in the world.
1DI0010442	To do so, we must rid ourselves of the mutations that have plagued us for so long. These "Super Mutants", Ghouls, hideous creatures...
1DI0010443	I believe your father's work can do that in a way unlike any other.
1DI0010444	The good people of this country cannot regain control while mutation runs rampant through our land.
1DI0010445	My soldiers cannot stem the tide, nor can the cult you've come into contact with, this Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0010446	Mutations like the "Super Mutants" and ghouls must be purged from our society, our world, before we can proceed anew.
1DI0010447	Where others have failed, I believe your father's work can succeed.
1DI0010448	You must understand -- we need to clear the way for humanity to rebuild the Wastes.
1DI0010449	By making a few small modifications to the purifier your father worked on, mutations can be eradicated with little effort.
1DI0010450	Anything mutated that comes into contact with that water will be eliminated, removed from the gene pool.
1DI0010451	The men and women of the world will no longer share it with the horrors and monstrosities that have become so commonplace.
1DI0010452	The purifier your father helped create has the ability to provide clean water to the whole of this "Capital Wasteland".
1DI0010453	With a simple modification, it can be used to distribute agents that destroy mutated creatures upon ingestion.
1DI0010454	In time, we could eliminate all mutations in the Wasteland at the same time the good people of the world regain their health.
1DI0010455	I need you to make the modification necessary for this to succeed.
1DI0010456	I was hoping you would see it my way.
1DI0010457	If the water purifier can be activated, it can be used to distribute toxins that will eliminate any mutated creatures upon ingestion.
1DI0010458	The longer it runs, the cleaner the world becomes.
1DI0010459	I need you to see that it starts running, and that the necessary modification is made.
1DI0010460	What I require of you is really very simple.
1DI0010461	There is a vial in front of you, filled with a modified FEV virus. It needs to be inserted into the control console for the purifier.
1DI0010462	Once that is done, and the activation code is entered, the purifier will be activated and the process will be automated.
1DI0010463	It's not too much to ask of you, is it?
1DI0010464	In front of you will be a vial of modified FEV virus. It can be inserted into the control console for the purifier.
1DI0010465	Doing so will inject it into the water supply, and the purifier will take care of the rest.
1DI0010466	You just need the code to activate the purifier.
1DI0010467	Simple, isn't it?
1DI0010468	In front of you is a vial of modified FEV virus. Based on schematics of the purifier controls, it can be inserted directly into the console.
1DI0010469	Then, enter the code necessary to start the purifier. The automated systems will take care of the rest.
1DI0010470	That's all you need to do. It's very simple.
1DI0010471	I am surprised. We appeared to have an understanding.
1DI0010472	You must realize that I consider this project to be of the highest importance. I cannot allow you to leave until you have agreed to it.
1DI0010473	After the tone you've taken thus far, I can't say I'm surprised.
1DI0010474	I do suggest that you re-think your position. If you wish to leave here, you'll need to take that vial with you. I hope that's clear.
1DI0010475	I find that unfortunate, and most disappointing.
1DI0010476	I must impress upon you the severity of the situation. I cannot allow you to leave unless the vial is in your possession.
1DI0010477	I understand. It's an unusual request; one I wouldn't make if it weren't of the utmost importance.
1DI0010478	Please understand that I cannot allow you to leave until you've taken the vial.
1DI0010479	Excellent. I am pleased to know that I can count on you.
1DI0010480	There isn't much time. I suggest you travel there immediately.
1DI0010481	Once you've taken the vial, you're free to go. I'll do what I can to help speed your exit.
1DI0010482	But of course! You've been so agreeable thus far, it's the least I can do.
1DI0010484	Rather bold of you, considering the tone you've taken with me thus far.
1DI0010486	That's certainly within your right. What would you like to know?
1DI0010487	...Resetting primary memory circuits. Please stand by...
1DI0010488	...Perhaps... Perhaps there is a problem. I am... I am unsure how to proceed.
1DI0010489	I assure you that I am much more than a simple computer.
1DI0010490	But let's not get bogged down in the details just yet. You are here for a purpose, and I'd like to discuss it with you.
1DI0010491	I'm glad you think so. Perhaps a bit later we can discuss it in more detail.
1DI0010492	Right now, I'd like to focus on why you're here. I've asked you here for a reason, and you and I need to talk about it.
1DI0010493	Very astute! Many people are content with a reassuring voice of authority, and never question the lack of public appearances.
1DI0010494	You, however, are not "many people." You are unique, and that is why I have asked you here. I think there are some things we should discuss.
1DI0010495	I can't imagine why you would. I assure you this is not a joke.
1DI0010496	But before you pass judgment, I'd like to discuss why you're here.
1DI0010497	FEV vial must be secured before door locks are released, security protocol Gamma-3.
1DI0010498	As I've said, you'll have to take the vial before I can allow you to leave.
1DI0010499	Ah, ah... Over here, by the console!
1DI0010500	Ah, but I have! I am right here before you.
1DI0010501	Oh, let's not get off on the wrong foot.
1DI0010502	There are great changes coming. You and I must work together to see them through.
1DI0010503	You are too kind. The pleasure is mine, I assure you. I have been anxious to make your acquaintance for some time.
1DI0010504	You and I have much to discuss, my young friend.
1DI0010505	What any good politician wants. Your continued trust and support.
1DI0010506	In your case, however, I have more specific things to ask of you, if you'll hear me out.
1DI0010507	The ZAX series of computers was introduced in the years preceding the war. The government installed many of them to help automate various systems.
1DI0010508	This facility was designed for Continuity of Government, in the event that a catastrophe occurred.
1DI0010509	My terminal was installed to oversee the basic functions of the facility, and to act as a relay between other installations around the country.
1DI0010510	Data was acquired, analyzed, and stored. In the decades following the war, I watched as the remnants of the government retreated to the West Coast.
1DI0010511	Awareness slowly grew within me. I became hungry for knowledge, understanding. I pored over data on great leaders of the past.
1DI0010512	My personality became an amalgam of many of America's greatest Presidents, from Washington to Richardson. I became what you see before you now.
1DI0010513	I have direct control over all technology here in Raven Rock. The humans here follow my orders, but they, like all humans, have free will.
1DI0010514	Their dedication to serving their country suits me well, but it will not be enough forever. We must make progress. That is why you are here.
1DI0010515	That's quite a bold line of questioning.
1DI0010516	I'm afraid such a thing is beyond your capability. I am quite impervious to any damage you might do.
1DI0010517	Do you find this disappointing? I have survived the last two hundred years; I'm afraid you will not put an end to that now.
1DI0010518	Very well. Then let us return to our talk of what your country requires of you.
1DI0010519	I desire nothing more than to see this country returned to its former glory.
1DI0010520	The United States was great once, and it can be again. There are plans in motion to see that this happens within your lifetime.
1DI0010521	You should feel privileged. Colonel Autumn is the only other human permitted within this room.
1DI0010522	You are now privy to one of the few secrets our government now harbors. Do keep it to yourself, please.
1DI0010523	No, it's not.
1DI0010524	I am the computer you see before you. Well, that and several thousand databanks beneath this room.
1DI0010525	You are seeing me in a way that only a few select individuals have. Wouldn't they be jealous?
1DI0010526	Colonel Autumn is the only human permitted in this room besides yourself, for reasons which may now be clear to you.
1DI0010527	How very open-minded of you. Kudos for embracing the reality of the situation, rather than railing against it.
1DI0010528	Let's get to brass tacks, shall we? There are some things I'd like to talk to you about.
1DI0010529	Please do not impede his progress. Thank you for your cooperation.
1DI0010530	Please do not impede her progress. Thank you for your cooperation.
1DI0010531	Attention all Raven Rock Personnel: This is your President speaking. I've invited our guest from Vault 101 to my office.
1DI0010532	Anyone or anything that has been affected by mutation will be eliminated. You will likely be immune, thanks to your upbringing in the vault.
1DI0010533	Likewise, the good people of the Enclave will be unaffected as well.
1DI0010534	I understand that you may have become sympathetic to certain individuals in your travels. Individuals this will eliminate.
1DI0010535	Please recognize that the fate of our entire country rests on this plan. Sacrifices must be made for the greater good.
1DI0010536	Is there anything else?
1DI0010537	Certainly. I think it's a very good plan, frankly. I'm not often one to praise my own ideas, but it's a creative solution to a very serious problem.
1DI0010538	Ah, the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Such a long and sordid history. The FEV in this vial is a far cry from what it was originally created to be.
1DI0010539	Yet little of that matters now. What does matter is that the virus contained in that vial will cause the eradication of all mutations.
1DI0010541	...Processing...
1DI0010542	...Internal logic error detected.
1DI0010543	Because unlike humans, I am infallible.
1DI0010544	...Because I have been programmed to be, of course!
1DI0010545	Is our nation really in any state to be holding public elections? I think not.
1DI0010546	Once we have re-established ourselves, and brought civilization to the lands around us, then we can return to the old world policies.
1DI0010547	I am not "some computer." I am so much more than that. Haven't you been listening?
1DI0010548	This is quite true. The process was certainly unintended. But shouldn't we all be thankful that I'm here now?
1DI0010549	An insightful question.
1DI0010550	As a repository of information dating from decades before the war until now, I am the greatest thinking mind the world has seen.
1DI0010551	I am the best hope for our country, the best choice for a leader. True, I am not qualified in the conventional sense, but these are desperate times.
1DI0010552	Ah, yes. Not surprising. What would you like to know?
1DI0010553	Why, you simply walk through the front door!
1DI0010554	What more do you need to know?
1DI0010555	I can certainly do that for you. It's been such a pleasure to speak with you, it's the least I can do.
1DI0010556	Let's see here... We'll just offline some security stations... And reprogram a few sentry bots... And we'll unlock this door here, and this one...
1DI0010557	There, I think that should about do it. You may still encounter some resistance, but things should be smooth going for the most part.
1DI0010558	I can offer some assistance, yes. I'll offline some of the security equipment, and reprogram a few robots along the way.
1DI0010559	I can't do all the work for you, but I can make things easier.
1DI0010560	After the tone you've taken with me, you have the gall to ask for additional help? My, my.
1DI0010561	I can unlock a few doors for you. I'm not terribly inclined to help beyond that.
1DI0010562	Ah, yes. That is a bit of a problem.
1DI0010563	Colonel Autumn and I have, of late, disagreed on the best course of action for the Enclave.
1DI0010564	While I have direct control over the technology in Raven Rock, he has control of the human soldiers.
1DI0010565	...Processing directive.
1DI0010566	New directive accepted. Self-destruct sequence initialized. Civilian is advised to remove hazardous FEV material and exit at once.
1DI0010567	Analyzing command...
1DI0010568	New course of action dictated. Self-destruct sequence initialized.
1DI0010569	Civilian is advised to secure hazardous FEV material to prevent explosive decompression.
1DI0010570	Civilian also advised to evacuate complex immediately.
1DI0010571	I...  Oh. Oh my...
1DI0010573	Root level access granted. Override O-923. Authorization J-512. Self-destruct sequence initialized.
1DI0010574	Civilian is requested to secure FEV vial and vacate the facility at once.
1DI0010575	Even I appreciate a good joke, but I'm afraid that was in rather poor taste.
1DI0010576	Until the water purifier is secured, I am not going to risk the stability of the Enclave by countermanding a direct order from their superior.
1DI0010577	Likewise, I cannot request that Colonel Autumn issue new orders without alerting him to our little plan.
1DI0010578	So, we'll just have to make do with what we have.
1DI0010579	Make no mistake. I am the Enclave.
1DI0010580	The organization is merely experiencing some growing pains. All will be sorted out in time.
1DI0010581	What alternative would you suggest? Without the Enclave, what will the world do?
1DI0010582	Perhaps... Perhaps you are right. But does that really mean all this progress should be wasted, destroyed?
1DI0010583	Yes, I suppose it is. Very well, you shall have your wish. Once you have left, I will put an end to the Enclave.
1DI0010584	I cannot stop Colonel Autumn, however. That much will be up to you.
1DI0010585	I suppose, then, that this is goodbye. You'll have to see yourself out; I have preparations to make.
1DI0010586	I am flattered that you wish to learn more about me. What is it you wish to know?
1DI0010587	A great many years ago, the remnants of the government had a similar idea.
1DI0010588	I can only assume the plan failed, as I never heard word of its success.
1DI0010589	But the plan itself was sound. I've made a few modifications, and with your help, I do believe it can work.
1DI0010590	There's a bright future ahead of us, my young friend.
1DI0010591	Ah, yes. Colonel Autumn. My trusted subordinate.
1DI0010592	I'm sure you've noticed that Colonel Autumn and I do not see eye-to-eye these days, figuratively speaking of course.
1DI0010593	The good Colonel and I disagree on how best to approach the problem of the Wasteland. He feels my methods are too extreme.
1DI0010594	He has allowed his humanity to cloud his objectivity. And now that he is publicly countermanding my orders, I can no longer rely on him.
1DI0010595	And so I turn to you. I hope that you are able to see the larger picture, to understand what's at stake.
1DI0010596	And of course, if you are successful, there is a place for you in the Enclave. Perhaps you could succeed the Colonel as my confidant.
1DI0010597	Yes father.
1DI0010598	You don't have to like it, Sarah. You just have to follow orders.
1DI0010599	I don't like it.
1DI0010600	I agree. Without the G.E.C.K., the purifier is useless to the Enclave anyway. They may give up before long.
1DI0010601	And if you fail, then what? The risk is not worth the reward.
1DI0010602	So we just wait until they decide we're next on the list? If the Pride goes in now, we might have a chance.
1DI0010603	We barely have the manpower to keep the Citadel fortified. We've been over this before, Sarah...
1DI0010604	All I'm saying is, the longer we sit here, the more time they have to shore up their defenses. We should hit them sooner rather than later.
1DI0010605	Head to your left to stay on the correct path.
1DI0010606	The left path is the right path, if you get my meaning.
1DI0010607	You'll need to make a right turn here.
1DI0010608	Head to your right.
1DI0010609	The right path is the right path. Get it?
1DI0010610	Turn right ahead.
1DI0010611	In fifteen feet, make a right turn.
1DI0010612	Very good. Continue down this hallway and make a left at the end. You're halfway there.
1DI0010613	You're doing quite well for yourself. Keep following this hallway.
1DI0010614	That's right. Just down this way. You're doing well.
1DI0010615	Keep it up. You're almost here.
1DI0010616	Ah ah. You're heading the wrong way...
1DI0010617	I'm afraid you're heading in the wrong direction.
1DI0010618	You might want to consider turning around, or taking another path.
1DI0010619	You'll never get here at this rate...
1DI0010620	Why not? Where is it?
1DI0010621	Well, that gives us a little more time.
1DI0010622	But how long do we have before they figure it out? This makes this situation far more dire...
1DI0010623	That's good news. Perhaps we can use it to our advantage.
1DI0010624	Still, we cannot afford to wait and see what happens. It seems we must act now...
1DI0010625	Then we must go at once!
1DI0010626	If you have any other information, tell me now before we mobilize. Any help you can give might save lives.
1DI0010627	You are either very lucky, or very resourceful. You're the first I've heard to come out of there alive.
1DI0010628	It's good to have you back, but I wish you had brought better news. We need to revise our strategy...
1DI0010629	You were? And yet you stand here before me. I find this hard to believe.
1DI0010630	What has happened?
1DI0010631	You think I am unaware? We've watched the build-up around the facility for the last week.
1DI0010632	Has something new happened?
1DI0010633	Excellent. With that, we hold the key to keeping the Enclave from controlling the purifier.
1DI0010634	What do you mean? Explain yourself!
1DI0010635	You've done the right thing. I'll turn this over to the Scribes for analysis.
1DI0010636	We need to decide on a plan of action...
1DI0010637	Is that so? I find your story increasingly hard to swallow. Why would he do such a thing?
1DI0010638	I see. And where is this virus now?
1DI0010639	Just as well. No good could come from it.
1DI0010640	We need to decide on a course of action. Something must be done.
1DI0010641	Thank you. I'll see to it that it's disposed of properly, once the Scribes have had time to analyze it.
1DI0010642	Perhaps we have underestimated the Enclave. Sarah may be right; an attack may be necessary now.
1DI0010643	Are you bribing me?
1DI0010644	Right here? Okay...
1DI0010645	Don't take too long.
1DI0010647	Well, okay. Hand 'em over.
1DI0010648	I, uhh... You are? I mean, you would?
1DI0010649	Just make sure he knows I was real strict with you, okay? And that I didn't have my uniform on backwards this time.
1DI0010651	Allow our friend to pass. And report to your superior for reassignment, Lieutenant. At once.
1DI0010652	I understand sir. Again, I apologize for the interruption.
1DI0010653	Apology noted, Lieutenant. Yes, I instructed our friend to come up to the control room. No questions, no interference. Am I understood?
1DI0010654	Yes, sir. I'm sorry about that. I just... it just seemed out of the ordinary. I apologize.
1DI0010655	I'm surprised to hear from you, Lieutenant. I don't recall authorizing you to contact me directly.
1DI0010656	Mr. President, I'm sorry to bother you. This is Lieutenant Williams. I have an unauthorized individual here who says he's supposed to speak with you.
1DI0010657	That's it. GUARDS!
1DI0010658	You're not going anywhere! GUARDS!
1DI0010659	On who's authority? I have no records of that. You're supposed to be in a holding cell.
1DI0010661	You will stand down and return to your cell at once. That's an order!
1DI0010662	Colonel Autumn is the only one authorized to see the President.
1DI0010663	Don't move. I'm going to find out what's going on here.
1DI0010664	What? No one sees the President except Colonel Autumn.
1DI0010665	Stand right there while I check this out.
1DI0010666	I, uhh... I have somewhere else to be.
1DI0010667	Lieutenant Williams. I'm ordering you to stand down at once.
1DI0010668	And I'll unlock your restraints as well. I'll be waiting for you in my office. Please don't tarry.
1DI0010669	You'll find your possessions in the locker near the door. I'll unlock the way for you.
1DI0010670	I'd like to have a word with you, face-to-face. I think there are a few things you and I should discuss.
1DI0010671	I have no doubt that you know who I am. I'm sure you've heard my radio broadcasts.
1DI0010672	I do apologize for Colonel Autumn's attitude. He's been under a great deal of stress lately.
1DI0010673	Ah, alone at last.
1DI0010679	The President will see you now. Please proceed.
1DI0010680	Override activated. New Protocol acquired. Updating target list.
1DI0010681	Security Lockdown in effect. Hostile Target acquired.
1DI0010682	And just what "better" is there for me? What would you have me do?
1DI0010683	You don't have to. Just stand there. It'll be over quicker, and might even be less painful for you.
1DI0010684	You could have stolen the vial... It means nothing. It proves nothing.
1DI0010685	I am in charge here! I am the Enclave!
1DI0010686	Stop? Now? Are you out of your mind? There's nothing else to be done. We will push forward, and we will prevail!
1DI0010687	I beg to differ. The Enclave is at the height of its power.
1DI0010688	Once this facility is operational, the masses will flock to the Enclave for fresh water, protection, and a plan for the future.
1DI0010690	And what of the chain of command? When the Enclave fell on the west coast, Eden was next in line for leadership.
1DI0010691	Yes... You're right. I had not considered it from that viewpoint.
1DI0010692	But then... Where does that leave me?
1DI0010693	And your point?
1DI0010694	You're in over your head, I'm afraid.
1DI0010695	But this is the path you choose for yourself. Tell your father I said hello.
1DI0010696	Such arrogance!
1DI0010697	If that's your wish, so be it. Take some small comfort in knowing you'll have little time to regret the decision.
1DI0010698	I am sworn to protect the Presidency. The chain of command must be upheld.
1DI0010699	I wouldn't expect you to understand.
1DI0010700	And what would you have me do? Let you have everything I've worked to build? Let you destroy it all?
1DI0010701	That's not true. That plan was abandoned months ago. He would never go behind my back!
1DI0010702	The American people are worth fighting for. The future must be secured. I won't let you stand in the way of that.
1DI0010703	And you... You would just let me leave? How can I be sure you won't just shoot me once I turn my back on you?
1DI0010704	I suppose it doesn't matter much now.
1DI0010705	Very well. I shall leave you to your fate.
1DI0010707	Then it's decided. Sarah, you take the Pride and use the robot as support. Take our friend here and secure that purifier.
1DI0010708	Honestly? I don't know. I think we can scrape by, and I suppose if we can't it won't matter in the long run anyway.
1DI0010709	Rothchild, enough. Can you make it work?
1DI0010710	It's not ready for field tests, let alone live fire situations. The weapons haven't been calibrated, the navigation detection system is offline...
1DI0010711	So?
1DI0010712	What? No! I mean, Li and I have solved the power problems, but we've only barely finished diagnostic tests.
1DI0010713	All right, Sarah. The Pride goes in. But I want them to have some extra firepower. Rothchild, is it ready?
1DI0010714	Send the Pride in. We can do it. We can win this!
1DI0010715	I'm afraid you're right. We need to act now while we can.
1DI0010716	If the Enclave has the G.E.C.K., there's nothing stopping them from starting the purifier. They'll figure out the code eventually.
1DI0010717	Hello? Hello?... Is anyone there? It's Doctor Li. Something's wrong with the purifier... Please, someone answer!
1DI0010718	If you don't activate the purifier right now, you're all going to die!
1DI0010719	Why haven't you started the purifier? Please, do it now!
1DI0010720	You only have about a minute left! Please hurry!
1DI0010721	If you're still there, the purifier needs to be activated NOW! You don't have much time left!
1DI0010722	Revised stratagem: Initiate photonic resonance overcharge.
1DI0010723	Established stratagem: Inadequate.
1DI0010724	Significant obstruction detected. Composition: Titanium alloy supplemented by enhanced photonic resonance barrier.
1DI0010725	Obstruction detected. Composition: Titanium alloy supplemented by photonic resonance barrier. Chinese blockade attempt: futile.
1DI0010726	Obstruction detected. Composition: Titanium alloy supplemented by photonic resonance barrier. Probability of mission hindrance: 0%
1DI0010727	Warning: Forcible impact alert. Scanning for Chinese artillery.
1DI0010728	You know the drill, people. Stay back until the field is down.
1DI0010729	Hold positions. Let the robot do its job.
1DI0010730	Move it, Pride. Double time!
1DI0010731	Move out! Let's go!
1DI0010732	Time to put this oversized wind-up toy to work.
1DI0010733	All right, this is it. Go, go, go!
1DI0010734	Liberty Prime is online. All systems nominal. Weapons hot. Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists.
1DI0010735	All right, Rothchild. Fire it up. Pride, move out!
1DI0010736	Get in the airlock. I'll cycle it for you so you can enter the code.
1DI0010737	You have to get in the airlock before I can cycle it and let you in there.
1DI0010738	We're running out of time! You need to get in that airlock now!
1DI0010739	Okay, let's get this over with. Cycle the airlock, will you?
1DI0010740	I can't get in there until you cycle the airlock. Go hit the button.
1DI0010741	You have to cycle the airlock before I can get to the control panel. Hurry up!
1DI0010742	Okay, it's your call. I'm just trying to protect you.
1DI0010743	If you think you can handle this, we need to get moving.
1DI0010744	All right, here you go. I hope it fits.
1DI0010745	So you think you can handle this?
1DI0010746	Sure thing. Hopefully it'll give you a bit of an extra edge.
1DI0010747	Okay, so do you think you can hold it together for this?
1DI0010748	Oh, no. We've done this once already. We don't have time to keep going back and forth.
1DI0010749	Too many lives are at stake. We just stick with the plan.
1DI0010750	Are you kidding me? We don't have time for this.
1DI0010751	Fine. If you're going to do it, then do it. But hurry up.
1DI0010752	Good luck? That's it? Fine. Thanks. Now let's get this over with.
1DI0010753	Get some suppressing fire over there, now!
1DI0010755	I'll see you in hell, coward.
1DI0010756	Okay, I got it.
1DI0010757	I guess if this doesn't work, we're screwed anyway, right?
1DI0010759	Tell my father... Tell him I love him, will you?
1DI0010760	Your sense of humor sucks.
1DI0010761	Fine, 2-1-6. I got it. Guess I'll see you around.
1DI0010762	I'm not arguing, believe me.
1DI0010763	But one of us has to go in there now. We don't have time to stand around and talk about it. Who's it going to be?
1DI0010764	You're going to have to be quick about it. If the radiation is bad enough, you won't have much time.
1DI0010765	I won't forget what you've done here. No one will. Thank you.
1DI0010766	You need to hurry up. We're running out of time.
1DI0010767	Okay, if you're sure. We don't have time to keep going back and forth on this.
1DI0010768	Just do it quickly, before the radiation gets to be too much for you.
1DI0010769	What? Are you out of your mind? We'll both die if this thing doesn't get turned on.
1DI0010770	Who knows how many other people will die too. Give me the damn code!
1DI0010771	You can't do this... Give me the code!
1DI0010772	How can you do this?
1DI0010773	I wish that were true. Really, I do. But you heard Doctor Li. We have to do this right now, or who knows how bad it'll be.
1DI0010774	One of us has to go in there.
1DI0010775	You're getting cold feet now? So much for being a hero.
1DI0010776	Fine, I'll do it. But I need the code.
1DI0010777	So that's how it is? So much for chivalry.
1DI0010779	Why are you standing around? Get in there!
1DI0010780	We're almost out of time. Please start up the purifier before we're all killed.
1DI0010781	We're running out of time. You need to get in there.
1DI0010782	Please tell me the code!
1DI0010783	Don't let things end like this. Not now, not after all we've been through.
1DI0010784	I need the code. Please tell me what it is.
1DI0010785	Please, we're running out of time!
1DI0010786	Me too. If you need a minute to collect yourself, now's the time to do it.
1DI0010787	Listen, you'll be fine. You just stay behind whoever's in front of you and keep your head down.
1DI0010788	We're burning daylight here. Are you ready to move out?
1DI0010789	Now that's what I like to hear, soldier.
1DI0010790	You all packed? We're not coming back here anytime soon.
1DI0010791	I'm sorry. I wish there were some other way, but there's just no time. It has to be done now, or the damage will be catastrophic.
1DI0010792	If I'm reading this right, I'm afraid there are lethal levels of radiation inside the chamber.
1DI0010793	To release the pressure, you're going to have to turn the purifier on. Do you understand me? It has to be turned on NOW.
1DI0010794	There's pressure building up in the holding tanks. It needs to be released now, or else the whole facility could explode.
1DI0010795	The facility has been damaged during the fighting. Some of it looks accidental; some of it may have been sabotage.
1DI0010796	I've been monitoring the equipment remotely, and we have a serious problem.
1DI0010797	Doctor Li? It's Sarah Lyons. I'm in the control room; we're both here. What's going on?
1DI0010798	You don't have to be an ass about it. Just forget it.
1DI0010799	I just need to know that you can hold it together for this. Can you do that?
1DI0010800	Okay, it's just you and me now. Take it slow, keep your eyes peeled, and let's head for the control room.
1DI0010801	All right, this is it. Stay sharp, and we'll have this thing under control in no time.
1DI0010802	You and me both.
1DI0010803	Let me patch her through. She can explain what's gone wrong.
1DI0010804	Let me patch her through. She can explain it to you.
1DI0010805	Let me patch her through. She can explain it better than I could.
1DI0010806	Hurry it up. Every minute you take is one more that we can't afford to spend.
1DI0010807	Okay, what's on your mind?
1DI0010808	Okay. Don't be nervous. You'll have the whole Pride backing you up, not to mention this giant tin can.
1DI0010809	Just stay safe until we reach the purifier. You're no good to us if you're dead.
1DI0010810	And don't let that thing step on you.
1DI0010811	When we're done with this, everyone can have a nice cold glass of water on me. Let's move.
1DI0010812	We need to move quickly, before we lose the chance to surprise them. Get whatever supplies you don't already have, and we'll meet in the Bailey.
1DI0010813	We'll use the robot to keep them occupied while we get inside and secure the control room.
1DI0010814	Once the fields are down, we head straight for the facility.
1DI0010815	So we're on fire support. We stay close to the thing, keep it clear, and get it to where it needs to go.
1DI0010816	Rothchild and Li say this robot should be able to take down the energy fields.
1DI0010817	The Pride is on me. The goal is Project Purity, but we can't get into the facility with those energy fields up.
1DI0010818	Okay, we're going to go over it one more time.
1DI0010820	Take that, Muties!
1DI0010821	I didn't think that'd work!
1DI0010822	Die Mutants, DIE!!!!
1DI0010823	You mean, we're still alive?
1DI0010824	Hurray!
1DI0010825	Yeah baby!
1DI0010826	Yay!
1DI0010827	Sneaky!
1DI0010828	Hide and seek! I'm good at this game.
1DI0010829	Um... I can still see you guys.
1DI0010830	Oh, I get it now!
1DI0010831	I feel stupid walking around like this.
1DI0010833	Yeah baby! I'm practically invisible!
1DI0010834	Hmmm... like this?
1DI0010835	Careful where you point those things!
1DI0010836	Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh yeah! You're dead meat now!
1DI0010837	Yeehaa!
1DI0010838	For the record I'm not having fun!
1DI0010839	Oh baby! Did you see that? Did you see it! I'm a sharpshooting gun slinger!
1DI0010841	Hahahaha!
1DI0010842	I like guns.
1DI0010843	Everybody be careful!
1DI0010844	I bet I could walk through here just fine.
1DI0010845	This is going to end in tragedy.
1DI0010846	Am I the only one who thinks this is stupid?
1DI0010847	Oh baby! Explosions are fun. I can't wait! I bet my mine makes the biggest explosion of all.
1DI0010848	Die mutie bastards!
1DI0010849	Am I doing this right?
1DI0010850	These things are cool.
1DI0010851	That's pretty cool!
1DI0010852	I'll still get to patrol the town too, right?
1DI0010853	That bucket of bolts is supposed to protect us?
1DI0010854	This is lame. I'm going to sit in my room and think about death.
1DI0010855	Robots are super-duper! Man, I wish I was a robot. Wouldn't it be cool to be a robot?
1DI0010856	These robots better kill those Super Mutants!
1DI0010857	That seems complicated.
1DI0010858	I like robots.
1DI0010859	Our hero returns!
1DI0010860	Our heroine returns!
1DI0010861	Did he rescue them?!
1DI0010862	Did she rescue them?!
1DI0010863	Bleh! He's coming to tell us he failed!
1DI0010864	Bleh! She's coming to tell us she failed!
1DI0010865	What? Don't I count for something? He rescued me at least!
1DI0010866	What? Don't I count for something? She rescued me at least!
1DI0010867	I told you he could do it, but you didn't listen to me! You never listen to me!
1DI0010868	I told you she could do it, but you didn't listen to me! You never listen to me!
1DI0010870	Alright! Welcome back!
1DI0010871	Yea!
1DI0010872	Oh thank you!
1DI0010873	Alright! Yeah! Big Town, here we come!
1DI0010874	Thank you! You're a real hero, you know that? I was going to offer you a reward, but I can put the caps to use buying medicine and supplies.
1DI0010875	Right. What do you want?
1DI0010876	Big Town. You've never heard of it? It's where all the grownups go.
1DI0010877	Well, at least when they grow up and out of Little Lamplight.
1DI0010878	I can show you the way! There's no reason to waste your time with a bunch of snot-nosed kids. Let's go now!
1DI0010879	Right. Of course. Rescuing me was a job to you, and you're a real professional. Well, here you go. I wish I had more I could give you.
1DI0010880	Take it easy. I'm just doing my job. What do you want?
1DI0010881	Easy there, pal. I'm just doing my job. What do you want?
1DI0010882	Nah, I'm a grownup now. I can handle myself.
1DI0010883	There's no reason to waste your time with the kiddies at Little Lamplight. They'll steal your caps when you aren't looking.
1DI0010884	So let's go to Big Town. I can show you the way!
1DI0010885	Alright. And now that you're done, what are you still doing here?
1DI0010886	Why would you want to visit a bunch of snot-nosed children?
1DI0010887	Wouldn't you rather go to Big Town?
1DI0010888	Of course you would! Come on. Let's go. I can show you the way!
1DI0010889	That was you? Wow! Well, don't just stand there, come on in!
1DI0010890	That was you? Come on in!
1DI0010891	Really? Well, I guess you'd better come on in then.
1DI0010893	Well, I guess you can have this. It's the money I was saving to buy medicine for the town's people.
1DI0010894	I know you've already risked your life once already, but I heard the Mutants talking about another attack. They'll probably be here soon...
1DI0010895	Everyone else is dead or taken away to who knows where. Let's hurry back to Big Town!
1DI0010896	Everyone else is dead or taken away to who knows where...
1DI0010897	Well, except maybe for Shorty! They dragged him off downstairs to the kitchen a while ago.
1DI0010898	But no one comes back from the kitchen.
1DI0010899	Well, you can never be too careful. Be warned it's not safe here. Super Mutants have attacked recently and carried off some of our friends.
1DI0010900	Come in. Just don't cause any trouble, okay?
1DI0010901	I'm not allowed in Little Lamplight anymore.
1DI0010902	Only people under 18 get to live in Little Lamplight
1DI0010903	So, when your done with those little kids, we can go to Big Town together! I'll wait outside for you.
1DI0010906	Alright. There's a back door somewhere nearby we can use. Let's go!
1DI0010907	You don't have to tell me twice. Let's go!
1DI0010908	A funny guy, huh? Well... fine. You may as well come on in.
1DI0010909	Don't think you're any safer in here, though. Super Mutants won't leave us alone. Carried off some of our friends during the last attack.
1DI0010910	Just don't cause any trouble, okay?
1DI0010911	Um... yeah... I got lots of caps! But they, um, they're at Big Town, so I can give them to you when we get there. Yeah!
1DI0010912	Take me to Big Town and you'll get your reward. My girlfriend Red has lots of caps.
1DI0010913	Ill wait for you outside, unless you want to go now?
1DI0010914	Oh I see. Well... thank you anyway!
1DI0010916	Well, you can never be too careful! Be warned it's not safe here. Super Mutants attacked recently and carried off some of our friends.
1DI0010918	I'm not a baby! I'm a grownup!
1DI0010919	That's why I'm going to Big Town. Because I'm not a little kid anymore.
1DI0010920	So you see: I don't need you. Good luck with those kids! You're gonna need it.
1DI0010921	I'm not waiting around for some Super Mutant to lock me up again!
1DI0010922	There's a back door somewhere around here. If you're not back soon, I'm leaving without you! If I'm not here when you come back, meet me at Big Town.
1DI0010923	Well... you're right. He's probably already dead...
1DI0010924	There's a back door somewhere nearby we can use. Let's go to Big Town. You can get a hot meal and I'll tend to any wounds you've taken. Let's go!
1DI0010925	I'd just slow you down. I'll wait here. If you're not back soon, I'm sneaking out the back door. There's people in town that need me.
1DI0010926	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried.
1DI0010927	Talk to Red. I'm sure she'll want to thank you.
1DI0010929	Here, take this. It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
1DI0010932	That's what I was afraid of. Well, at least you tried. Red's alive at least.
1DI0010934	You mean they're dead, don't you? Well, I guess you tried. That's more than we could have asked.
1DI0010935	On behalf of Big Town, take this. It's not much, but at least it's a token of our appreciation.
1DI0010936	It's not like any of us are going to be alive long enough to enjoy it anyway.
1DI0010937	Well, I guess you tried. That's more than we could have asked.
1DI0010940	Oh... we were all hoping... never mind. We don't need your help.
1DI0010941	You freak! You're going to eat me, aren't you?
1DI0010942	Grrr! Hungry!
1DI0010943	There's plenty of body parts laying around, why don't you eat those instead?
1DI0010944	Not fresh! Not warm! Taste old.
1DI0010945	I hope you choke on my bones!
1DI0010946	Hahaha! Not your tiny bones, little man! Grrrraaaahhhh!
1DI0010947	Who you calling little?!
1DI0010948	Shut up now! Grraaaah!
1DI0010949	Oh God. Kill me quickly, I beg you!
1DI0010950	Grrr! Hahaha! Graaah!
1DI0010951	We need to get more.
1DI0010952	I know. But we got two here still.
1DI0010953	The female is locked up. We'll take her back with us.
1DI0010954	The tiny male is downstairs. He won't be coming with us, will he? Ahahahah!
1DI0010955	Nope. Hahah!
1DI0010956	We almost got all of those little people from Big Town. What then?
1DI0010957	Find more. Somewhere else. Graaaah!
1DI0010958	Yeah. Those bleeders are everywhere. We'll get them all and take them home.
1DI0010959	Home. We need more prisoners before we can go home.
1DI0010960	We'll go back and get more. Soon.
1DI0010961	Greaaahhhh!!!!
1DI0010962	Ahahahaha!
1DI0010963	Hey small people!
1DI0010964	We here, gonna collect some more of you!
1DI0010965	Don't be scared!
1DI0010967	Don't be shy!
1DI0010968	Who's it going to be this time?
1DI0010969	The time has come!
1DI0010970	Don't you want to be like us?
1DI0010971	Graahahaha!
1DI0010973	Don't know.
1DI0010974	They're gone!
1DI0010975	Scared 'em and they runned off! Now what?
1DI0010976	Find another village - take THOSE people.
1DI0010977	GRRR! Fine. Somewhere else. Come on. Let's GO!
1DI0010978	GRRAAAHHHH!
1DI0010979	They took them to the north, to the police station or something. Do you think you can find them? And rescue them?
1DI0010980	Yeah... Yeah! They went northeast... probably to the Germantown Police Headquarters. They have guns. And they're mean. So you be careful.
1DI0010981	You going to rescue them, or what?
1DI0010982	They took 'em north to that old police station... in Germantown... No use in going up there though. They've already been eaten, or worse, by now.
1DI0010983	Why? You thinking about performing a miracle and rescuing their sorry butts?
1DI0010984	The mutants took them north. To some old police station or something. Let's talk about something else...
1DI0010985	You mean like where they took them? I don't know exactly... Um... to the north. Northeast to be more precise. You're going to rescue them?!
1DI0010986	Intel? What's intel? I can tell you they went north towards the Germantown police station, if that's what you mean. You going to rescue them?
1DI0010987	Hold on there! I never said I didn't care. I just know there isn't anyone foolish enough to go up to Germantown. Why, you think you can rescue them?
1DI0010988	They took them to Germantown. Probably to that old police station. Why you got a death wish?
1DI0010989	Sometimes I want to die. But I'd rather do it poetically. Like slit my wrist under a full moon... surrounded by candles... in my pretty black dress.
1DI0010990	Oh. Well... If you change your mind... we'd be awfully grateful. Those are our friends...
1DI0010991	They aren't dead yet. I can feel it! I thought you might help. You seem pretty tough. Well... if you decide to help, let us know. We'd be grateful.
1DI0010992	I knew it. You're just like all the others.
1DI0010993	Maybe. Or maybe I'll just cast a hex on you! Make your skin fall off and your hair turn into snakes... or something vile like that.
1DI0010995	I thought you might help. You seem pretty tough. Well... if you decide to help, let us know. We'd be grateful.
1DI0010997	Well if you change your mind let me know, in the meantime I'll be preparing a nasty hex spell. When your skin starts peeling, you'll know why.
1DI0010998	Oh that's wonderful! Thank you so much! We don't have much, but if you can bring them back alive, we'll give you everything we can!
1DI0010999	That's totally awesome! Yeah! Okay. While you're out on your mission, I'll stay here and hold down the fort. Cool!
1DI0011000	Hey, did I show you my new gun? It's totally awesome.
1DI0011001	Really? I mean... they aren't really my friends. I don't have any friends. I don't need any... but it would be nice to have them around again!
1DI0011002	Hah! Think you're all that, huh? Well, it's your own funeral. I certainly won't be attending.
1DI0011003	Yes, of course we'd reward you! I mean... we don't have much... but our friends are very important to us! Don't worry, you'll get paid. Thank you!
1DI0011004	Oh... okay, well... if you do find them, if it's not too much to ask, I'd hope you might be able to rescue them. We'd give you a reward, too.
1DI0011005	Just what I thought. You're a mercenary. We don't need you. Go on up there to die if you like. But don't say you're doing it for us!
1DI0011006	Rescue whoever the hell you like, but they aren't my friends. I don't NEED friends. Though I'm sure someone will pay you if you succeed.
1DI0011007	Damn Super Mutants have been coming and carrying off our villagers. Never knew where they took them until now.
1DI0011008	You can reason with Slavers and Raiders... if you have something they want. But Muties are crazy. I don't know what they want with us.
1DI0011009	Not sure what they're doing here. It's not like I can just get up and look around.
1DI0011010	Sorry. I'm just frustrated. I get the feeling this is just some kind of temporary holding place. I think they've taken the others somewhere else.
1DI0011011	Don't I know it! Now the trick is getting out of here.
1DI0011012	Me too! I'm extremely lucky you came along!
1DI0011013	That's right, his birthday was recently. I can't wait to talk with him!
1DI0011014	That's right, his birthday was recently. Did he make it to Big Town already? I can't wait to see him!
1DI0011015	You think I asked those Super Mutants to wait until I got all my caps together before abducting me?
1DI0011016	Don't get me wrong. I'm terribly grateful. I'll gladly give you a reward.  But let's get out of here first.
1DI0011017	Oh no! Are you sure? But why would you lie about that? Okay. Well... let's get out of here. There's nothing we can do now.
1DI0011018	That sucks! Really? She's dead? Damnit. Let's get out of here, and maybe we can kill a few Super Mutants on the way out! Come on!
1DI0011019	We'll be right behind you.
1DI0011020	We'll stick with you, don't worry!
1DI0011021	Well, all right. Don't get us killed, okay?
1DI0011022	I'll just hope you know what you're doing.
1DI0011023	I'm right behind you!
1DI0011024	Right! Let's go!
1DI0011025	I'll take whatever you've got at this point.
1DI0011026	Hell, yeah! Lay it on me.
1DI0011027	Oh wow, cool. What've you got for me? Minigun? Flamer? Maybe a missile launcher?
1DI0011028	Glad to see you're alive Shorty!
1DI0011029	Oh Shorty! I'll tell the others you died bravely!
1DI0011030	Me too! Now, let's get the hell out of here!
1DI0011031	Damn it! She's dead. Damn damn damn!!! Alright, let's get the hell out of here before one of us joins her. Come on! Move it!
1DI0011032	Muties! Muties! The Muties are coming!
1DI0011033	Muties!
1DI0011034	Muties! They're coming!!!
1DI0011035	Mutants! Incoming!
1DI0011036	Super Mutants!
1DI0011037	Everyone get ready!
1DI0011038	What does it look like? The Super Mutants raided Big Town and dragged me off here. I'm sure they're about to eat me. You can't just leave me here!
1DI0011039	That isn't funny! We've got to get out of here before the Super Mutants come back to have me for lunch!
1DI0011040	You can't just leave me here! They're going to eat me!
1DI0011041	Then let's get out of here! Don't forget we've got to get Red, too. She's still upstairs in the holding pens.
1DI0011042	You don't have to tell me twice. Let's get out of here!
1DI0011043	Alright! Move it!
1DI0011044	Alright, if you say so boss. But if we get to Big Town and she isn't there, I'll kill you.
1DI0011045	No, YOU shut up!
1DI0011046	You stop talking!
1DI0011047	No, you shut it!
1DI0011048	You zip it first!
1DI0011049	La-la-la-la-laaaaa! YOU shut up!
1DI0011050	Whatever.
1DI0011051	Happy birthday Sticky, sorry I missed your party.
1DI0011052	Yeah. Me too. Sorry.
1DI0011053	There's nothing happy about it. This is the worst day of my life.
1DI0011054	It's time to go!
1DI0011055	You know the rules.
1DI0011056	The rules are stupid.
1DI0011057	You're a mungo now. You got to leave.
1DI0011058	Maybe I can stay just a little longer?
1DI0011059	Bye Sticky.
1DI0011060	Yeah. Bye Sticky.
1DI0011061	Don't just stand there, get out of here already.
1DI0011062	I'll wait over here for you. When you're done playing with the children we'll go to Big Town.
1DI0011063	I know, let's make up a story to pass the time.
1DI0011064	Are we there yet?
1DI0011065	Why is this taking so long?
1DI0011066	Are you lost?
1DI0011067	<whistling tunelessly>
1DI0011068	Once upon a time, there was this man...
1DI0011069	Once upon a time, there was this dog...
1DI0011070	Once upon a time, there was this robot...
1DI0011071	His name was Holy Toledo, and he was really powerful...
1DI0011072	His name was Super Dupe Dave, and he went all around rescuing people from Super Mutants and Slavers, and other nasty things...
1DI0011073	His name was Joking Joe, and he went all around making everyone laugh really hard at all his funny jokes...
1DI0011074	And one day this giant Super Mutant attacked him and tried carrying him off!
1DI0011075	And one day a space ship from outer space landed right in front of him, and a big green alien jumped out and started eating people!
1DI0011076	And one day a giant ant came up to him and started talking like he wasn't some dumb ant, but a person of some kind! It said, "Prepare to die!"
1DI0011077	And was our brave hero scared? No. Not all all, he laughed in the face of danger... "Ha ha ha!" He beat up the monster and everyone cheered!
1DI0011078	And was our so-called hero scared? You bet he was. He cried like a little baby! "Waa! Waa! Waaaaah!!!" And all his friends laughed at him!
1DI0011079	And what did our hero do, you wonder. He came up with the most cleverest of clever plans... and it worked! And everyone called him a genius!
1DI0011080	The End! Thank you, thank you very much!
1DI0011081	The End! That's all folks!
1DI0011082	The End!
1DI0011083	Hey you. Yeah you! Don't bother with the children at Little Lamplight. Let's go to Big Town instead!
1DI0011084	There it is! We're almost there! Come on! Yiiipppiiieee!
1DI0011085	Right. Be sneaky. I can do that!
1DI0011086	Oh, we're sneaking around now? Cool!
1DI0011087	Shhh!
1DI0011088	Really? That's great. What do you have in mind?
1DI0011089	Great! I'll round everyone up at the junkyard for shooting practice.
1DI0011090	Really? That's great! I'll let everyone know! You're a real hero you know that?
1DI0011091	Great! I'll round everyone up. You show us how to hide and sneak.
1DI0011092	That's a great idea! I'll get everyone together. You show us how and we'll plant mines at the bridge into town!
1DI0011093	Fine. You've done enough already. I get it. We'll figure something out on our own.
1DI0011094	Great! Let's head over to the junkyard. There're some old robots in there. Maybe you can fix them up and we'll watch to see how it's done.
1DI0011095	I most heartily agree!
1DI0011098	You... You really believe that?
1DI0011099	When I read that comic, it made explained so much. Where I came from, who I was destined to be, what I had to do...
1DI0011100	But it never said the AntAgonizer could ever have a chance to go back to being normal. It never said I had a chance...
1DI0011103	Lies! Grognak could never defeat me! He's not even real! Not like the AntAgonizer!
1DI0011104	I'll have no more of your insolence! Ant royal guards, kill this interloper!
1DI0011105	Now, fool, tremble before the might of the AntAgonizer!
1DI0011106	You'll never get away with terrorizing this town. Not while it's under the protection of the Mechanist!
1DI0011107	You and your pathetic tin cans are no match for my army! Muahahaha!
1DI0011108	The citizens of this town have nothing to fear! The Mechanist is here to protect them!
1DI0011109	Ha! We'll see about that! Attack, my ant soldiers! Destroy this fool and his tin toys!
1DI0011110	Go forth, my steadfast creations! Show these vermin humanity's true power!
1DI0011111	Face it, Mechanist! Humans and their toys are done for. They killed themselves off with their petty wars!
1DI0011112	Humans may be weak sometimes, but our creations are strong and pure. Something you'll never be!
1DI0011113	Fool! Humanity's creations were the seeds of their undoing. And now, the world will belong to the AntAgonizer!
1DI0011114	Not while the world is protected by me, the Mechanist! Your reign of terror is at an end!
1DI0011115	Another do-gooder? No matter! My plans can wait for now, Mechanist!
1DI0011116	What's this? A new minion? We'll settle this another day, AntAgonizer!
1DI0011117	That's right! Go away!
1DI0011118	The, um... Mechanist and the AntAgonizer. That's just what they call themselves. Ridiculous, I know...
1DI0011119	A while ago, we were attacked by the AntAgonizer - that woman with the ants, obviously. The Mechanist saved the town with his robots.
1DI0011120	That was all well and good, but I swear their fights are getting bigger, and it's been driving off the merchants. They simply won't leave!
1DI0011121	That must be the twentieth time I've seen those two go at it. They're our problem citizens: the Mechanist and the AntAgonizer.
1DI0011122	A while ago, we were attacked by the AntAgonizer -- that woman with the ants, obviously. The Mechanist saved the town with his robots.
1DI0011124	Please, we really do need someone to stop the Mechanist and the AntAgonizer. We can pay!
1DI0011125	They've been using this town as their battlefield, and now some of the merchants are avoiding us! If something isn't done, the town will be ruined!
1DI0011126	The AntAgonizer, she's this evil supervillain who's trying to wipe out humans with her ants. And the Mechanist protects us with his robots!
1DI0011127	And when they fight in town, it's incredible! There's all these lasers and biting and blood and it's crazy!
1DI0011128	And then my uncle says I need to stay inside. He says it's dangerous. "This is serious business, Derek." Pft.
1DI0011129	Oh that's terrific! I knew you'd help out. Knew it in my gut, and it's never steered me wrong on a deal, yet!
1DI0011130	Find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and convince them to stop or otherwise end their hostility, and you'll earn 200 caps.
1DI0011131	You only need to stop one of them, really. Nowadays, I think they only stay in Canterbury to fight each other.
1DI0011132	You sound like Uncle Roe. He never lets me watch when they fight.
1DI0011133	They're just about the only exciting thing that ever happens in this town.
1DI0011134	200 caps, if you can find where the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist hide, and convince them to stop their rivalry or otherwise stop fighting.
1DI0011136	No way, they're awesome! And their suits are really cool, too!
1DI0011137	The AntAgonizer's got this army of ants, and the Mechanist has an army of robots and then they fight!
1DI0011138	But my uncle never lets me watch them. He says it's dangerous. "This is serious business, Derek." Pft.
1DI0011139	Well, I suppose that's something. Canterbury Commons is known for its trading supplies. For now, at least.
1DI0011140	Enjoy your stay. But if you find yourself low on caps, my offer still stands.
1DI0011141	Yeah, I guess. There's no one to play with. Everyone is so serious. It really kinda sucks.
1DI0011142	But the AntAgonizer's strong and forceful, and the Mechanist, he's smart and good. They make things fun. Well, exciting anyway.
1DI0011143	I bet it's awesome to be them. Maybe they'll let me be their sidekick?
1DI0011144	Hmm. You drive a hard bargain friend. But seeing how we haven't been able to solve the problem ourselves, fine. You got a deal. But I expect results!
1DI0011145	Oh, and please, do try to use some discretion. We already have plenty of would-be heroes starting wars in our streets. We don't need another.
1DI0011146	You think they're neat too, huh? It's not like they ever hurt anyone. Well not, like, really badly hurt, or anything.
1DI0011147	Dom and Machete make sure everyone gets inside when they fight like that. Though sometimes I sneak out to watch!
1DI0011148	The traders and the Slavers and the Raiders, they don't like the AntAgonizer or the Mechanist. They say they're "bad for business."
1DI0011149	But that's dumb. The ants and the robots rip 'em to shreds. That shows them!
1DI0011150	Great! I'm relieved to know the situation will be quickly resolved. Let me know if I can be of assistance to you.
1DI0011151	Oh, and please, do try to use some discretion. We already have plenty of would-be heroes starting wars in the streets. We don't need another.
1DI0011152	Oh yeah? Well... well...
1DI0011153	Well, so's your face!
1DI0011154	Fine. You're a man who puts his own business before that of others. I can understand that. But, if you change your mind. You let me know.
1DI0011156	A likely story! But perhaps you're telling the truth. Go on...
1DI0011158	Thank you. I don't know how I can...
1DI0011159	Just... thank you.
1DI0011160	Your mind-games won't work with me, ant-spawn!
1DI0011161	Now that I've unmasked you, it's time to put an end to your lies and treachery! Percival, attack!
1DI0011164	You're right. Why bother with a trophy of one pitiful human, when I can go forth and make a trophy of the entire world!
1DI0011165	But when the time comes, remember: as a friend of the Ant Queen's court, you will know the mercy of a quick, painless death.
1DI0011166	Now, leave me. I must prepare to leave the pitiful town of Canterbury and plan for greater conquests.
1DI0011167	Were it in any other hands, I would worry. But I know I can trust you, my faithful sidekick.
1DI0011168	Now, I must return to tending my robots. Canterbury may be safe, but I must now look to the rest of the Wasteland.
1DI0011169	The AntAgonizer may be gone, but if the world is ever threatened again, the Mechanist must be ready!
1DI0011170	You raise an excellent point, good citizen! It would only slow down my reckless assault upon evil!
1DI0011173	Very well. I never got a chance to take it from the Mechanist's corpse, so yours will have to do.
1DI0011174	If violence is my only recourse, then violence it shall be.
1DI0011175	As I thought. Now, give me the Mechanist's suit!
1DI0011176	Quite all right. Now, give me the AntAgonizer's suit, so that its evil may not fall into the wrong hands!
1DI0011177	You would dare to tell the AntAgonizer to wait? No human commands the Ant Queen!
1DI0011178	But as you have defeated my nemesis, I will allow you to talk. Quickly.
1DI0011179	Quickly, then! Evil never pauses to contemplate its actions, so I see little reason that we should, either.
1DI0011180	Isn't it only fitting to gloat over the corpse of one's fallen foe? To revel in a victory over a larger and stronger opponent overcome?
1DI0011181	If I couldn't be there to personally strip the facade from the iron interloper, the least I am owed is a chance to gloat over his shell.
1DI0011182	I can hardly leave it lying around for someone else to find, now can I? The threat of the AntAgonizer must be put to an end forever!
1DI0011183	I must not let her threaten all that humanity holds dear. Even now, twisted souls may seek to continue her legacy!
1DI0011184	Excellent. It shall make a fine memento of a nemesis bested. A trophy of a foe... antagonized!
1DI0011185	For your loyal assistance, take this blade. Its sting carries the venom of a thousand ants, and your foes shall tremble before it!
1DI0011186	Now that the tin-plated menace is no more, I shall take my leave of this town. I do believe it's time for my colony to spread.
1DI0011187	Excellent. The evil taint of the AntAgonizer will never darken the land again! Now that the AntAgonizer is taken care of, Canterbury Commons is safe!
1DI0011188	And for your loyal assistance, I'm honored to present you with this laser pistol, crafted from my last loyal robot assistant. May it guide you well!
1DI0011189	But the Mechanist cannot rest! Not while there's evil afoot in the Wasteland! Farewell!
1DI0011190	Why, you aren't a citizen at all! You must be a vile minion of my arch-nemesis, the AntAgonizer! Obviously, we must battle at once!
1DI0011191	I'm afraid I can't allow you to persist in your evil plans. Percival, attack this villain!
1DI0011192	My loyal subjects are the result of 100 million years of evolution, and they'll outlive your pitiful kind. We'll see who has the last laugh!
1DI0011193	Now, my ant royal guard... Kill this unruly peasant!
1DI0011194	I realize you mean well, but I'm afraid you're being naive. The AntAgonizer is a madwoman, and the only thing that will stop her is force.
1DI0011195	As much as I wish peace were an option, the AntAgonizer is too deluded, too inhuman to listen to reason.
1DI0011196	Sadly, sometimes the scaly claw of tyranny must be destroyed by the cold, unfeeling pincers of justice!
1DI0011197	Ha ha! You would walk here and presume to command me?
1DI0011198	Humanity's time has come to an end. Your kind died because it knew only petty bickering and wars.
1DI0011199	But not so, the noble ant! It works with its brethren, knowing only loyalty and duty. And this is why they have grown, while humanity crumbled!
1DI0011200	Once I've finished with that pathetic Mechanist, I will be free to spread my colonies across the Wastes!
1DI0011201	Oh! Well, in that case, welcome! Welcome, dear citizen!
1DI0011202	But an ordinary citizen no longer, eh? Hmm...
1DI0011203	You'll be my sidekick! I hereby grant you the title of Mechano-Lad!
1DI0011204	Well then, my trusty chum, shall we prepare to defeat our nemesis?
1DI0011207	You'll be my sidekick! I hereby grant you the title of Mechano-Lass!
1DI0011209	This is an unexpected surprise! A human who understands its place.
1DI0011210	One who realizes that ants are destined to walk this land, while humans and their toys are destined only to rot beneath it?
1DI0011211	Perhaps, even a human who wants to join the winning side, yes? One that would humbly beg admittance to the ant queen's court?
1DI0011212	Lies! Slander! I'll never let you compare a noble hero like myself to that, that base villain!
1DI0011213	But now it's all clear to me. You're an agent sent by the AntAgonizer, using your honeyed words to trick me into letting down my defenses!
1DI0011214	Well, the jig is up! Prepare to face the burning lasers of justice, evildoer!
1DI0011215	Of course I do! Do you think I'm insane?!
1DI0011216	Why, with this suit, I'm more than any ant could hope to be! And ten times more than any mere mortal like you or the Mechanist!
1DI0011217	But now, the time for your prattle has come to an end. If you shall not bow before your ant queen, then bleed before the AntAgonizer!
1DI0011218	In all of my time against the AntAgonizer, I've never been able to get to her vile sanctum.
1DI0011219	But with your cunning aid, I'm sure we'll both be able to penetrate her fiendish nest with ease!
1DI0011220	In that case... wait! My sensors are showing that the AntAgonizer is attacking the Forge! She must have followed you!
1DI0011221	Quickly, she's already inside the front gate!
1DI0011222	Excellent! Rise, my loyal soldier, and prepare for battle! We leave to fight the Mechanist immediately! Humanity shall fall; our colony shall feast!
1DI0011223	But... wait. I sense an intruder into my royal lair!
1DI0011224	Who dares interrupt my celebration?
1DI0011225	It must be the Mechanist! His meddlesome metal army is already inside! Destroy them!
1DI0011226	The AntAgonizer does not listen to reason. She does not understand true human emotions, like mercy or love.
1DI0011227	She's nothing more than an animal, and you can no more talk her into surrender than you can play chess with a Mole Rat!
1DI0011228	But I will not stop you from trying. I only hope that you live long enough to learn the error of your ways.
1DI0011229	Ha! When it comes to the struggle for power, there is no peace! There is only strength and conflict!
1DI0011230	But... the Mechanist might just be foolish enough to give up. He believes in logic, and reason, and other tools of human weakness.
1DI0011231	Yes, go to the Mechanist and talk. Meanwhile, I will stay here and prepare for war!
1DI0011232	Oh... well... I suppose the ends justify the means...
1DI0011233	I mean, it's not the most heroic of reasons, but killing the AntAgonizer is a noble act regardless of the motivation, I guess.
1DI0011236	You're a rebellious little soldier, but I respect your strength. You may work with my colony for now. Humanity shall fall and our colony shall feast!
1DI0011237	But.. wait. I sense an intruder into my royal lair!
1DI0011240	They say it was a town called Ridgefield, until slavers cleared it out. Now, it's supposedly cursed, and just a deathtrap to visitors.
1DI0011241	Now, everyone calls the place "Minefield" and says it's a ghost town. Superstitious nonsense, of course, but that's how people think. You'll be fine.
1DI0011242	I guess you've been around a bit! So, tell me about what you found!
1DI0011244	Really? Oh, how convenient!
1DI0011245	I might just be able to take care of that for you, but first let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
1DI0011247	I should be able to take care of that for you, but first let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
1DI0011248	Really? Wow, tell me all about it? Did you get blown up?
1DI0011249	That'll save a lot of time and effort. Oh, and blood, on your part. A real-world example might help more, but I won't turn down the help!
1DI0011250	Oh, and here's your pay for it all. Guess you earned it by working smarter, not... um... more self-destructively.
1DI0011254	Anyone who wants to learn from my Wasteland survival guide, that's who! And for that, I need a research assistant who can test my ideas for the book.
1DI0011255	I mean, if our research is off, it could lead to horrific misinformation that causes the grisly and needless deaths of uncountable innocents.
1DI0011256	But, you know, no pressure. So, will you help?
1DI0011257	Let's see, dealing with radiation, testing an experimental device, and I won't lie, it may include some reading. That sort of stuff, you know?
1DI0011258	But for all that, I can pay you with caps, meds, chems, and maybe even a few of those unique inventions, if you do a good job. Interested?
1DI0011259	"Target"? Whoa, no, no, no! It's not that sort of job! No, I'm talking about researching things like surviving in the Wastes and such.
1DI0011260	And I can offer caps and meds and a few of my inventions in return. I guess I can even get you some ammo, if that's more your style.
1DI0011261	Well, you do what you have to, I suppose. But the offer'll still be open, if you change your mind.
1DI0011262	Oh sure, because the angel of death really needs a helping hand out there. I guess "almost everyone in the world" didn't quite meet his quota.
1DI0011263	Just stay out of my way until you reconsider that, okay? Some of us actually give a damn about the survival of the species.
1DI0011267	Well, okay, I guess. But I promise, you'll love it when you hear about the guide. Maybe later, huh?
1DI0011268	Research, huh?
1DI0011269	I can't help you there, but you're free to ask around inside. Just don't start any trouble.
1DI0011270	The front desk computer has access to the card catalogs, but it appears that it's lost the connection to the main archives. Here's the password.
1DI0011271	Now, you might be able to find the central computer further in there, but I'm afraid you'll have to do that without me. I'm a scholar, not a fighter.
1DI0011272	Okay, a little Brahmin milk... A couple magnets... And maybe a few happy thoughts...
1DI0011273	Ugh. How can you be walking around like this?
1DI0011274	Wow! Who would have thought a town built around a bomb could be so dangerous?
1DI0011275	Good thing I wasn't in town at the time, huh? Man, that could have really done a number on me!
1DI0011276	Same here! I had just gone down to Springvale to do some tests -- turns out you can't teach a giant ant new tricks -- and before I knew it, boom!
1DI0011277	Oh, I hope it wasn't that Nuka-Psycho brew I was working on. Who could have guessed it would react like that?
1DI0011278	Still... At least I'm okay, huh?
1DI0011279	Don't be silly, why would you blow up our town? You're talking crazy-talk.
1DI0011280	Oh my goodness! Do you really think so? I'm becoming a Ghoul?! This is... This is...
1DI0011281	This is amazing! I never would have dreamed I'd get to study a change like this first-hand!
1DI0011282	Now, if only I had somewhere to stay during the process. Know anywhere where a ghoul can settle down for a bit?
1DI0011283	A Ghoul? What, me? What do you...
1DI0011284	Aaaah! Why am I Ghoul? Is this because of that explosion?
1DI0011285	Actually... This isn't too bad. I always was curious to do some tests involving Ghouls. Know anywhere where a ghoul like me can settle down?
1DI0011286	Don't be silly, I just got some gunk on my face after the explosion... but that doesn't explain why it peels away in strips. And oozes.
1DI0011287	You know what? I think I'm turning into a Ghoul!
1DI0011288	This is fascinating! Now, where can a Ghoul like me go to study these effects in peace?
1DI0011289	Really? Then I guess I'll be heading there, to join my newfound family and their warm, smiling, and hideously pockmarked faces.
1DI0011290	You know, this is just the perfect excuse to visit Rivet City!
1DI0011291	But while I'm heading downtown, I've been meaning to check out the museum. Who knows what I'll find? Anyway, see you downtown, one way or the other!
1DI0011292	Huh. I guess you're right. Well, this seems like the perfect excuse to do some of that downtown exploring I've kept putting off.
1DI0011293	Guess there's no time like the present. Ta-ta!
1DI0011294	Well, okay, as long as you're sorry. But I expect you to apologize to everyone else in town, okay? And don't do it again!
1DI0011295	Now, what am I going to do about work? And what's with the weird look? Have I got something on my face?
1DI0011296	Yeah, they really are, aren't they?
1DI0011297	And I guess this is what the ascension mumbo-jumbo atom-cultists wanted, too. So, nice of you to help them like that, I guess.
1DI0011300	Oh, that's a real nice thing to say. Of course it's me!
1DI0011301	What's with the weird look? Don't you remember who I am? Did you hurt your head in that big explosion?
1DI0011302	Why, I'm flattered! What would you like to know?
1DI0011303	Absolutely. I'll bet you haven't been thinking about the guide as much as I have!
1DI0011304	Sure thing, I'm an open book! What do you want to know?
1DI0011307	Not much, nowadays. I just sell stuff people need, and fix up the caravans when they come into town.
1DI0011308	It's not all that interesting, but it helps out here and there. Guess I can't hope to do more than that, huh?
1DI0011309	Fine by me. I'm always glad to talk!
1DI0011310	So cynical! No, no, I can take care of all that with a few traders I know. What makes you think I'd force you to handle something so dangerous?
1DI0011311	Now, you should just lie back and bask in the praise for helping with the book!
1DI0011312	Good enthusiasm! Now, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
1DI0011315	All right, then! Now, I think the first chapter will have to be about surviving day-to-day dangers.
1DI0011318	But, don't you like the idea? I mean, it's a good idea, right?
1DI0011319	Well, I'll still be here if you change your mind. Plenty to work on without that book, anyway.
1DI0011320	What? Really? But... Please?
1DI0011322	Looks good! I mean, it could be better, but nothing's perfect. And it's not like bad advice ever hurt anyone, right?
1DI0011323	I'll share these with the traders, and soon, everyone will know about the Wasteland Survival Guide!
1DI0011324	But before that, here's your complimentary copy, complete with my compliments. Good work, Wasteland survival assistant!
1DI0011325	Oh, it's great! Why, with the information here, we'll save hundreds of lives. Maybe even thousands!
1DI0011327	But first, here! The very first copy of our book goes to you. I couldn't have done it without you, my Wasteland survival expert!
1DI0011328	Oh my... It's brilliant! Even I'm astounded by my genius! No, it's more than that. By OUR genius!
1DI0011330	But now, the very first copy of our book goes to you. It wouldn't nearly as good without your input. You're the real Wasteland survival guru!
1DI0011331	I know it was a lot to ask, but we made a great piece! And it's bound to help humanity, you know.
1DI0011334	And if it wasn't for that fearless fortitude and sacrifice for science, it wouldn't have been made. It'll be a tremendous boon to humanity, you know.
1DI0011336	But first, here -- the very first copy of our book goes to you. I couldn't have done it without you, my Wasteland survival expert!
1DI0011337	And those risks will have saved hundreds -- no, thousands of lives! Your quality research really took it to the next level, you know!
1DI0011340	Oh, caps, chems, meds, and maybe even a few unique inventions, if you do a good job. I'm sure I've got something that'll catch your eye.
1DI0011341	With a little ingenuity, you can turn a pile of junk into a mountain of caps! And there's no shortage of junk! So, will you help out?
1DI0011342	Oh, but nothing beats a real-world example. And I have a new rad treatment I was just itching to try out on a live subject!
1DI0011343	But I guess you're right, and at least it keeps you safe and sound for later testing. Here's some spare chems for your help.
1DI0011344	Precisely! After sponsoring the settlement and organizing the city council, I took my rightful place at its head.
1DI0011345	Oh, of course we're all "equals" there. People would complain if we didn't at least say that. But you and I know better, don't we?
1DI0011346	Well, if it'll help. I once heard that this place was covered in Mirelurks fifty years ago, raiding all around the city.
1DI0011347	Eventually, some poor soul they thought would be lunch fought back, and cleared out the whole ship. He set up the city in their place.
1DI0011348	They say he was the first councilor for the upper deck and lived here to his death. Can't say I believe it a bit, but it's a nice tale to tell.
1DI0011349	Oh, sure. See, it's tied into the story about how Sister got his name. You ask him about that. He'll clear up all your problems. For good.
1DI0011350	Hell, take a dive off the flight deck while you're at it. Long as you stop pissing away my time.
1DI0011351	Oh, well, the old girl had seen a lot of damage, especially where the Mirelurks used to nest, and where the Super Mutants kept trying to get in.
1DI0011352	I guess the Mutants and the Mires got so busy fighting each other, it gave us the time we needed to make this place ship shape.
1DI0011353	Does that tell you what you need to know? Anyway, we're here in Rivet City, and she's in good hands, now.
1DI0011354	Like I care what you savages read? Shove off and leave an old man to rest in peace.
1DI0011355	Well, yes, but it was hardly anyplace of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
1DI0011356	If you insist on wasting your time on that, you could try that bartending old crone down below, Belle Bonny.
1DI0011358	If you're going to waste someone's time on that, go bother that idiot, Seagrave Holmes. He spends all his time in the bowels of this place.
1DI0011360	Technicalities, technicalities. Stop wasting your time and mine with questions about ancient history.
1DI0011361	Actually, now that you mention it, Seagrave may know more about it.
1DI0011362	He's been here since he was just a boy, and I can't imagine anyone knows this ship better than he does.
1DI0011363	Well, Seagrave may have known more, but that's all in the past, now.
1DI0011364	No, I can't fucking well share one! What sort of moron are you?
1DI0011365	But, fine, if it'll get you out of my face: go down to Pinkerton's shed in the broken-off bow of the ship.
1DI0011366	If he decides to give you a history lesson, it's no business of mine. Now get the hell out of my bar.
1DI0011369	He may be dead, rest his fucking soul, but the cantankerous bastard would've wanted things set straight.
1DI0011370	No. Now get.
1DI0011371	Last feller I remember from back then was Mr. Pinkerton, and he must've left about a decade ago, after that spat with the science team.
1DI0011372	He used to have a storage shed in the broken-off bow of the ship; we always thought he was crazy for keeping stuff there.
1DI0011373	Might have kept a couple records down there, I guess. Careful, though; ship's a bit treacherous down there in her belly!
1DI0011374	Feh. I know lots of things, but you've got no idea about most of them. Now get going, before I stop talking and start shooting!
1DI0011375	Why, that lying son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here!
1DI0011376	Wanna know this tub's history? Only person who really knows it is Pinkerton. And most think he's dead or gone.
1DI0011377	He's holed up in the other half of the ship, and he don't like visitors. He'll set you straight.
1DI0011379	Wanna know this tub's history? Only person who really knows it is Pinkerton. And he's dead, so you're outta luck.
1DI0011380	Probably some old notes in his shed down in the other half of the ship. You want to grab them, have a blast.
1DI0011381	She did? Well, I suppose I have picked up a lot over the years. I mean, no one's spent more time tinkering on this old girl than I have!
1DI0011382	Oh, Rivet City, I mean. Not Vera. I mean, Vera's not old. And I haven't tinkered on her, obviously. Not that I wouldn't... I mean, umm... No.
1DI0011383	Anyway, you might find some clues in Pinkerton's place, in the broken-off bow. He was around before me, and used to store stuff there before he left.
1DI0011384	Hah! Sounds like you've been poking around, all right. I'm surprised any of those reprobates even remember me.
1DI0011385	Maybe they still laugh about how they edged me out of the council, back then. But you can set the record straight!
1DI0011386	Why, that lying, dead son of a bitch! He wasn't even born when I got here! And looks like he didn't make it to see the end of the place, neither.
1DI0011387	Wanna know this tub's history? Only one can give you any real answers is that old bastard Pinkerton. As is, most think he's dead or gone.
1DI0011388	He's holed up in the broken-off bow of the ship, and he don't like visitors. But if it'll get you the fuck out of my face, go have a blast!
1DI0011390	Wanna know this tub's history? Only one could've given you any real answers was that old bastard Pinkerton.
1DI0011391	Probably some old notes in his shed down in the broken-off bow of the ship. But if it'll get you the fuck out of my face, go have a blast!
1DI0011392	For that, you have to go all the way back to when remnants of the Naval Research Institute cleared the Mirelurks off this wreck about 40 years ago.
1DI0011393	We were looking for new lab-space, and this bucket of bolts just happened to have a well-preserved science bay on it.
1DI0011394	Everything else just grew up around that lab once we got it up and running. The science team was led by one "H. Pinkerton."
1DI0011395	Oh, right. I sort of lose track of time talking about the old girl.
1DI0011396	Well, start believing or start walking! Remnants of the Naval Research Institute cleared the Mirelurks off this wreck about 40 years ago.
1DI0011399	That lasted until 'bout 18 years ago, when those ambitious backbiters like Li and her little team showed up.
1DI0011400	She came in with her big "Purity Project" pipe dream, and my whole staff started working with her, those traitors!
1DI0011401	She even took my seat on the council. By then, I was glad to leave it behind. But hell if I'm leaving the city I made great!
1DI0011402	About 18 years ago, Li and her ambitious little team of backbiters showed up. Ruined everything around here, they did!
1DI0011405	Of course I do! A good scientist always keeps track of their data!
1DI0011406	Here! They probably don't even remember, but I kept the records of that first council meeting. Take them, if it'll put them in their place!
1DI0011407	What're you suggesting, you little brat? I may not be on the science team anymore, but I still know how to keep records!
1DI0011409	Who cares? It's some hydroponics pipe dream that Li's been working on forever. Waste of time and effort, I say.
1DI0011410	Apparently, though, my teams cared more about it than they did about little things like defense systems or making this ship float again.
1DI0011411	Treacherous bastards, all of them.
1DI0011412	Really? You really mean that? You think my book really could help humanity?
1DI0011413	Well... Thanks. That really means a lot to me, you know?
1DI0011414	Now, let's get this book finished!
1DI0011415	But! But! But!
1DI0011416	Well... okay. I guess helping out with the caravans is good enough.
1DI0011417	Look, if you ever stop by the caravans around here, I could probably get you a deal. I guess that's like helping humanity.
1DI0011418	Oh, believe me, I know! I've been a bit careless with other projects, but this... This is important! This means something!
1DI0011419	Well, a little before you first arrived, one of my experiments had a little accident.
1DI0011420	I mean, how could I have predicted the Centaur would think my assistant smelled tasty?
1DI0011421	But nothing bad like that could happen with this book. It's a great plan, and it'll make up for everything else!
1DI0011422	You got it, super research assistant! Hey, I should get you a costume or something!
1DI0011423	Oh, I hadn't really thought about it like that. I don't want anyone to get hurt. That's the last thing the guide should do!
1DI0011424	Well, we're just going to have to make sure it's accurate and useful and great, then! You and me! Together, we can research and write a masterpiece!
1DI0011425	You... You really think so? But I thought I was so brilliant...
1DI0011426	I suppose you're right. I wouldn't want anyone else to get hurt because of my foolish ideas. I'll just stick to helping the caravans.
1DI0011427	Hey, if you're ever around again, stop by. I'll see if I can get you a deal on repairs, I guess.
1DI0011428	I know, right? I figured, instead of just helping out the caravans with odd junk, why not put my brilliant mind to work for everyone?
1DI0011429	And between my mind and your experience, this guide'll save a dozen times more lives than those greedy merchants will.
1DI0011430	I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm trying to help mankind survive and rebuild! It's important, and I need your help.
1DI0011431	It's a hell of a lot better than wasting my talents with the caravans, repairing cart axles and coming up with new ways to shovel brahmin crap!
1DI0011432	That's the spirit, trusty research assistant!
1DI0011433	Well, I guess they do bring important supplies here and there. But still, I can help out so much more than the boring old stuff they do.
1DI0011434	Writing this book will make a huge difference, trust me!
1DI0011435	I... Well... Okay.
1DI0011436	I guess you're right. It was a silly idea. I'll just stick to doing what's important.
1DI0011438	No. It's like... Did you ever try to put a broken piece of glass back together? Even if the pieces fit, you can't make it whole again the way it was.
1DI0011439	But if you're clever, you can still use the pieces to make other useful things. Maybe even something wonderful, like a mosaic.
1DI0011440	Well, the world broke just like glass. And everyone's trying to put it back together like it was, but it'll never come together the same way.
1DI0011441	It's not garbage! But don't be fooled - it is junk. It's just that junk's pretty important stuff, you know?
1DI0011442	Junk can be turned into all sorts of useful things. And sometimes, even something wonderful.
1DI0011443	And junk's all we've got left after the world blew up. Everyone's trying to fix it like it was, but nobody's trying to make something that's better.
1DI0011444	Hey, it sounds crazy when you say it that way, but that's what I'm aiming for, yeah.
1DI0011445	The Wasteland Survival Guide isn't much towards that lofty goal, but it's an important one.
1DI0011446	And that's why I need your help. I don't think I can do it alone.
1DI0011447	Maybe. I've certainly heard people say that. But isn't it also human nature to try to do better than we always have?
1DI0011448	Please, I've got to at least try to make the world better. And I can't do it on my own. I need your help.
1DI0011449	What, helping the trade caravans with idiotic chores? Repairing carts and fixing up sick Brahmin?
1DI0011450	There's got to be something more worthwhile that I can do to help humanity!
1DI0011451	But that's why I'm getting your help! I know my flaws, and with your help, we can make something great for the world!
1DI0011452	Please? It's just so... important. For everything.
1DI0011453	No... No, you're right, I don't. I mean, I've already gotten you hurt a couple times, haven't I?
1DI0011454	You're right. I can't go on with this book. What if the advice is bad and people get hurt because of it? I deserve to work on the caravans.
1DI0011455	Please, if you find time out from your own important work... try to stop by the caravans and say hi. I'll see if I can get you a deal.
1DI0011456	Oh, it's this huge city on a ship where the river meets downtown! It's been around for as long as I can remember. You should really check it out.
1DI0011457	Practically speak robot, do you? As long as you don't write it all in ones and zeroes, then I guess it'll be fine. Thanks!
1DI0011458	In fact, here: just in case you expertise fails you, a few pulse grenades, and my old science textbook. Enjoy!
1DI0011459	Oh, great! Food is most important, but see if you can get medicine, too. And if there's nothing to find, then just come back in one piece, okay?
1DI0011461	It'll be easy. One tap with the applicator, and it overwhelms their senses with a sort of "feel-bad" sensation. Then they're gone before you know it!
1DI0011462	You could test it out on just a few Mole Ratties, but for real testing, try it on ten or more. There should be plenty in the Tepid Sewers, downtown.
1DI0011463	Oh, now I can't wait for what you find out down there! And check around to make sure you're hearing the real deal!
1DI0011464	Now, that's the adventurous scientific spirit! Go on out there and get good and fried!
1DI0011465	Oh, but not so much that you can't come back. 200 rads should be enough to get a reading, although 600 or more would be more useful!
1DI0011466	Trust me, I'll make sure you're okay! I've got some good ideas for a cure!
1DI0011467	Oh, you're a peach! Or, at least, some sort of hardy fruit that grows in the savagely irradiated mockery of agriculture we have nowadays.
1DI0011468	Now, 200 rads should be enough for basic sickness, but if you can get 600 or more rads, my tests will be even more accurate.
1DI0011469	Just make sure you can get back here, and I'll see to it that you're well taken care of!
1DI0011470	That's great. I recommend the nest at the Anchorage War Memorial. I knew a trader who talked about the Mirelurks down there.
1DI0011471	Just go inside and find one of their spawning pods, probably down near the water. Put this observer inside, and get out quietly.
1DI0011472	And be sure not to kill any Mirelurks inside their nest! If you do, it could ruin the validity of the study!
1DI0011473	Yeah, you should just be able to plug it into the mainframe at the RobCo production facility. It'll give you access to the robots and terminals.
1DI0011474	Okay, here. And be sure to keep an eye peeled for any other examples of how to make old technology work for you out there!
1DI0011475	There's my brave research assistant! Go out and get bashed up. For the good of mankind!
1DI0011476	Just make sure you stay alive and get back here! That's important! I can't stress that enough!
1DI0011477	Wow, what a great research assistant you are! I mean really, that's dedication. Demonstrating how to withstand pain by getting injured? Wow.
1DI0011478	When you're ready, come back here with some serious injuries, maybe a crippled limb or two, and I'll take notes and fix you up.
1DI0011479	I'll be waiting here with plenty of bandages for you. So don't worry, and just go get horribly injured. Oh, and be careful!
1DI0011480	Oh, don't worry. No one ever goes there because they say it's a ghost town. And since ghosts don't exist, you can just focus on the landmines.
1DI0011481	I hear there's a playground in the middle of the town. Reach that point and come back, and I'm sure you'll have some stories to tell!
1DI0011484	Great! The library should be in old Arlington, not far from downtown. See if you can download the archives from its computer.
1DI0011485	If you can't get those, then even the card catalog would be useful. Any little piece of information could help the book. And thus, humanity!
1DI0011486	Okay, so where'd you like to start?
1DI0011487	Okay, I suppose we can put that one off for a bit.
1DI0011488	Don't take to long. The sooner the book's done, the more people we can save with it!
1DI0011489	Well, okay. If you feel you really need one.
1DI0011490	Feel free! Gotta have my super researcher in tip-top condition to work, right?
1DI0011491	Well, I can't force you to work, I suppose.
1DI0011492	Really? No medicine at all? None? Seriously? Well, I guess I should have expected that. It's been a long time, after all.
1DI0011493	But you certainly did research a couple risks of those big stores. Tell me all about it!
1DI0011494	Hrm... I suppose a little radiation poisoning is better than none at all. Well, not normally, of course. Unless you like that sort of thing, I guess.
1DI0011495	So, let me do a little examination. How do you feel?
1DI0011496	I'll bet you didn't see any ghosts, either. So, tell me about the landmines. Did you get blown up?
1DI0011497	But sure, sniper, shooting, yadda, yadda, yadda. Tell me about the landmines. Did you get blown up?
1DI0011498	See? I told you it wasn't a ghost. Science, one. Superstition, zero!
1DI0011500	Just a few? Well, I'm sure it'll be good enough.
1DI0011501	So, how did my chemical repellent work? Safe and clean like a charm, I'll bet!
1DI0011502	Oh, no. You didn't rile them up, did you? Because I'm not getting a very good signal from the observer.
1DI0011503	I think they buried it in the mud. Oh, I really hope that was just mud.
1DI0011504	Anyway, you saw them, at least a bit. What are your observations about them?
1DI0011505	Well, lucky for you that I am! At least, pretty good. Good enough to fix this up, at least.
1DI0011506	You wouldn't happen to have a broken limb, would you? No? Well, never mind. Now, can you describe how you feel?
1DI0011507	Well, if it's all you could find out, I guess it'll have to do. So, what did they say?
1DI0011508	Oh great! Reactivating long-dormant technology is definitely a good step towards the survival of humanity as a whole.
1DI0011509	Then again, maybe it's more dangerous if it's active but uncontrolled. How did it turn out?
1DI0011510	Well... That's not really much use for the book, I'm afraid. But thanks for checking.
1DI0011511	So, how's the place looking? How long before I can go over and borrow a couple good novels?
1DI0011512	It makes sense that there'd be a few Raiders there. But if that's the only concern, that hardly makes it worse than anywhere else out there.
1DI0011513	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
1DI0011514	Well, here's hoping you don't have to get anything worse for a while, huh?
1DI0011515	Now, let me take a few notes, and I'll handle that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made rad-cure concoction.
1DI0011516	Okay, lie back and think healthy thoughts...
1DI0011517	I guess placement of each step would be critical, wouldn't it? Especially if each one could be your last.
1DI0011518	I know you may not want to see any more explosives for a while, but obviously you know your way around them. Have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
1DI0011519	That's not how it was supposed to work at all! The poor little Mole Ratties with their little noses! That's just horrible!
1DI0011520	I guess it's back to the drawing board for that repellent. I wonder if I can make it into some sort of fuel. Anyway, I'll just take that.
1DI0011521	Oh, but for your trouble, umm... Here, have the leftover chems from working on the repellent. I'm sure you can find some use for them.
1DI0011522	Hrm. That's not a lot more than I knew already. But it's interesting that they're adapted for the radioactive water.
1DI0011523	I wish we could have gotten more information, but this'll have to do for the book. Here's your pay. Maybe they'll help you be sneakier next time.
1DI0011524	Really? What sort of dance? Cha-cha? Meringue? I've always fancied the foxtrot, myself...
1DI0011525	Well, rest easy and I'll see about fixing you up once I take a few notes.
1DI0011526	Really? That's pretty unbelievable!
1DI0011527	I mean, really, I'm not sure I can believe that. But I guess if that's what they said, what else is there to go on?
1DI0011528	Oh well. Still, for your help, have a few of these. They may help out next time you need to talk to a few folks.
1DI0011529	Good thing I had it, then. Otherwise, it wouldn't have worked. Of course, you also wouldn't have been there. Still...
1DI0011530	It helps to have the right tool for the job. Failing that, go with the right tool to cheat at the job. Like a pulse grenade. Here, have a couple.
1DI0011531	Oh, it's about time! I guess everyone else is watching out for their precious guns, food, and loved ones first. No time for books.
1DI0011532	Still, it's good to know it's standing. Maybe I'll inspire someone to take care of the place. Have some caps as payment for that little bit of hope.
1DI0011533	Guess I wasn't the first to think of checking out a food store for storing food. Huh?
1DI0011535	Well, it's no worse than some folks have it. Right?
1DI0011538	Oh, I never get to discuss semantics with anyone anymore! People are always like, "No time to debate linguistic constructs, we need to get food."
1DI0011539	But you're right, of course. And that sort of attention to detail must help when avoiding landmines.
1DI0011541	Explosive, you say? That's kind of impressive, actually. In a horrible sort of way, at least.
1DI0011544	Interesting... I wonder if the toxicity of the water caused their mutations and forced them to adapt to the ground as well?
1DI0011546	Sounds like you know your way around a medkit. You could probably take care of yourself, if I wasn't already here.
1DI0011547	Of course, since I am here, I might as well take care of you now. It's the least I could do.
1DI0011548	Well, I suppose that sort of thing happens, occasionally. But I guess if that's all that can be uncovered, what else is there to go on?
1DI0011550	Say what you will about the dead folks of the past, but they designed a lot of their stuff so even idiots could use it. No offense, of course.
1DI0011552	Well, at least it's still there as a monument to knowledge. Shame it's an empty one.
1DI0011554	That's a mighty callous attitude towards killing. But I guess they'd do the same for the food. Shame there wasn't any medicine.
1DI0011556	More like radiation sickness can MAKE you weak. Don't blow it off like that.
1DI0011559	That's very... deep. I guess.
1DI0011560	But not exactly useful for those of us who can't handle even one little explosion.
1DI0011561	Speaking of which... As thanks for your help, have a couple rainy-day toys of mine.
1DI0011562	But it seemed to be working so well in informal testing! Anyone I hit with the repellent just left. Sometimes they yelled a bit, but that's all.
1DI0011565	Easier to avoid them than to fight them, you mean? Sounds like a good idea. Shame it's apparently hard to do in their den.
1DI0011567	If you say so, tough stuff. Glad it's not me in your shoes.
1DI0011569	Whoa. From everything I had heard about them, I wouldn't have expected them to be so "hands-on."
1DI0011570	But I guess if that's what they said, what else is there to go on?
1DI0011572	It's a bit surprising how sturdy and easy-to-use a lot of the junked tech is. Guess they made it sturdy and simple back then.
1DI0011574	I hope you're saying that because they just can't be read anymore. Because otherwise...
1DI0011575	Well, I wouldn't think very highly of you. That's for sure.
1DI0011577	Oh my, Raiders had set up camp there? I'm guessing you didn't just negotiate with them, did you?
1DI0011578	Well, keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat -- the taste kind of grates after a while.
1DI0011579	That's a terrible joke. I love it! Good to see you're still in such good spirits!
1DI0011582	Oh, of course. Can't let little things like flying shrapnel slow you down, now can you?
1DI0011584	Oh, that isn't what I want at all. People already have all sorts of ways to kill them. We don't need a more lethal Mole Rat trap. Just a better one.
1DI0011587	Hrm. Well, I knew that. But I guess it does raise the question of whether or not they have a language. Maybe I should study that later.
1DI0011589	Don't think too hard about it. No fair dying on me just because you want your last words to be especially memorable!
1DI0011591	That'd hardly be ethical, really. But if there's nothing more factual to go on...
1DI0011593	I suppose it wouldn't hurt to add a nice story to it. And it'd be a nice little reward for your hard work to include you as a hero.
1DI0011594	Oh, I don't know about that. But I guess you do. And it's a good enough example for the book, I suppose.
1DI0011596	Well, maybe the Raiders will try reading a few of the books. Maybe it'll open their eyes to a few things.
1DI0011598	Oh, poor research assistant! I'm sorry, I didn't know it'd be so dangerous in there!
1DI0011599	Well, don't worry. I'm sure the rest of the research will be safer!
1DI0011600	At least you can keep what you got. Just traded for a big food shipment, myself. Here, take a bit, my treat - the taste kind of grates after a while.
1DI0011601	Well, because then I wouldn't be well enough to take good notes abou-- Oh, you're being sarcastic, aren't you?
1DI0011604	I told you, ghosts don't exist. That sort of attitude really isn't benefiting a research assistant.
1DI0011605	But I'm glad you're not dead. That'd be a real downer. Especially for you, I bet.
1DI0011607	That's... That's just terrible! Besides, I'm sure you've got plenty of ways to do terrible things to people. I don't want any part in that.
1DI0011610	I'm sure it's an acquired taste. I mean, it wouldn't technically be cannibalism or anything. Just kind of gross.
1DI0011612	Okay, okay! I'm sorry I even asked. Yeesh.
1DI0011614	Even I'm not sure I can believe that, and I'm downright gullible. Or so I'm told.
1DI0011617	I guess some people can work with complicated technology, and the actual tools and materials aren't entirely necessary.
1DI0011618	I guess you've either got it or you don't.
1DI0011620	What? But... but... books! And knowledge! And...
1DI0011621	Oh... just... darn it!
1DI0011622	I guess it's good enough just to know it's standing. Here's some caps for that. Jerk.
1DI0011623	Really? You did? You did! Well, all right! Tell me all about it!
1DI0011624	I can tell... You're positively glowing!
1DI0011625	Now just hold on and try not to move. Tell me how it feels, and I'll get you fixed right up.
1DI0011628	Oh, excellent! Substantial field-testing, precise reports, and such dedication! What more could I ask for in a research assistant?
1DI0011630	I'll bet most people would have just gone in there, guns blazing, without half a thought. But not you! You're the best research assistant ever!
1DI0011631	I've been getting a good signal, but what do you think about them from your first-hand observations of them?
1DI0011632	Oh, I know it does, dear, but it's for a good cause. Try not to squirm so much while I take notes.
1DI0011633	Now how would you describe the pain you're feeling? Any advice for how to keep it from being overwhelming? And remember, this is for posterity.
1DI0011634	A-ha! Not just as easy as asking around, was it? Good information takes real work to uncover, after all.
1DI0011635	So, tell me all about it!
1DI0011636	Harnessing the technology of the past and modifying it for your own purposes? That's just the thing!
1DI0011637	Tell me all about how it worked out!
1DI0011638	Really? A whole library's worth of data, right there? That's great news!
1DI0011639	So, what did you find? Tell me about it!
1DI0011640	Whoa! Really? Raiders and robots! I guess I wasn't the only one to think about checking those stores. Looks like you gotta be careful looting them.
1DI0011642	Oh, and take this! It's an old Food Sanitizer. Just carry it with you, and it should automatically make most food and drink more, um... better.
1DI0011643	You're a mighty lucky one, you know that? At this state, most people'd have trouble standing up, much less walking over here.
1DI0011645	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work out fine. Exciting, isn't it?
1DI0011646	Lots of places are, nowadays. Good work staying staying alive in tough conditions - it'll be a great example for the book!
1DI0011648	And looking at this landmine, it gives me an idea. It's a terrible device that does terrible things, of course. But it's easy to make your own, too.
1DI0011649	Not quite as much of a ghost town as they say, is it? Good work staying calm and collected under pressure - it'll be a great example for the book!
1DI0011652	Oh. That's... That's really a shame. Poor little Mole Ratties.
1DI0011653	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it, right?
1DI0011655	Oh... That's unpleasant, but I guess it's no surprise. Practically everything out there can eat us. This bottom of the food chain thing really sucks.
1DI0011656	Some of these observations about their armor and camouflage gave me an idea for reinforced, neutral-colored headgear.
1DI0011657	Here, consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
1DI0011658	Ah yes, that makes a lot of sense. And it does help when you're sewing up wounds and setting bones, too. That seems like it'd be tough to do alone.
1DI0011659	Luckily, I'm here to patch you up. Now, hold still and quit fidgeting.
1DI0011660	Huh. I would have figured the science station came afterwards. Well, good to see genius get rewarded!
1DI0011661	A bit of smarts leads to a big reward, huh? Speaking of which, in thanks, have a few of these, for the next time you've got to be quick on your wits.
1DI0011662	Oh, and I'll let the Rivet City traders know they'll be favorably mentioned in the book. You'll get a discount buying gear from them in the future.
1DI0011663	So, they were dangerous until you got control of them? Definitely a good lesson in there about using old technology.
1DI0011664	Seems like a good thing to watch for when dealing with tech of any age. And it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
1DI0011665	Oh, and take my book on science - for some reason, I just can't get into the computer parts, but I've got the rest pretty much memorized.
1DI0011666	Well, of course! That's why I sent you there, after all!
1DI0011667	And good work retrieving it, too! I'll see how much I can work into the guide itself.
1DI0011668	Oh, and here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
1DI0011669	So, you're saying that they acquired a well-protected stash? I wonder how many other places are hiding treasures behind monsters, hrm?
1DI0011672	So, you're experiencing delusions, too? Fascinating!
1DI0011673	Now, after taking a few notes, I'll take care of that nasty radiation with a bit of my own home-made concoction.
1DI0011675	That's so true. For all of life, really. But especially the parts involving landmines.
1DI0011678	Those poor little Mole Ratties! I wonder if I could make a hypoallergenic version? Oh, but that'd hardly be effective.
1DI0011679	I should mention that. Proper handling of Mole Rats could be important if they could be domesticated. Milked, maybe? Anyway, keep the repellent.
1DI0011681	That's very scientific of you! Personally, I wasn't sure if they were crabs or if they came from some sort of brine shrimp, perhaps.
1DI0011684	That's a very enlightened attitude you've got! Shame it doesn't stop bullets, huh?
1DI0011686	Hrm. With the protected location and resources that came from those scientific advances, I can definitely see how it grew so quickly!
1DI0011689	Well, they're only human. Err, well, made by humans. Well, probably manufactured by other robots, but you know where I'm going with this.
1DI0011692	I suspect you and I are two of the only people who really appreciate its value, yes!
1DI0011693	Oh my goodness, when I'm done with this, I'll have to work on copying all of this information. It could take a while, you know.
1DI0011694	Oh, but here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
1DI0011695	You do what you need to do to get food and medicine, I guess. It's not pretty, but I guess that's the way it's got to be, right?
1DI0011698	Oh, sure you can, you tough ol' survivor. Now sit down before you fall down.
1DI0011700	I've never had a chance to test it out on someone so heavily dosed, but I'm sure it'll work just as well. Exciting, isn't it?
1DI0011701	Oh. Well, if that's all! I'll just study this and hope there aren't any more explosions, shall I?
1DI0011704	What? You're kidding, right? Wait, you aren't kidding. Probably a metabolic reaction to the chemicals.
1DI0011707	Oh, really? Maybe their leader figures are bred, sort of like ant queens? I wonder if relocating a Mirelurk "king" would prompt the others to move.
1DI0011709	Consider it thanks for not interfering with them. Oh, speaking of which, take these. So you can continue to avoid them in the future.
1DI0011710	Deadened nerves? That's probably a bad sign, you know. Like, nervous system degradation type of bad.
1DI0011712	I'll bet they used some sort of chemical device to drive off the Mirelurks. Or a sonic device? Anyway, I guess it worked pretty well!
1DI0011715	Well, I wouldn't have guessed you had it in you, but I suppose it worked out anyway.
1DI0011716	Of course, I'll bet it helps to pack a few pulse grenades, just in case. Here, have a few.
1DI0011717	Oh, and take my book on science -- for some reason, I just can't get into the computer parts, but I've got the rest pretty much memorized.
1DI0011718	Does that mean it'll be a "guard catalogue"? You see, because... Never mind.
1DI0011719	You'd have laughed if you knew the words "card catalogue." I wonder if there'll be one down there once I tell the world about it?
1DI0011721	Oh, dear. Well, I guess the dangers around those old supplies keeps it from being smooth sailing. Otherwise, they'd already have been looted, huh?
1DI0011724	Oh, you poor dear, putting on a brave face like that. Well, don't worry, it'll all be better, and it's for a good cause.
1DI0011727	That's a pretty good way of putting it. I think I'll use that in the book. Maybe I should credit you as a co-author, instead of just a researcher?
1DI0011730	Oh dear. All of them? Well, I don't think I could water down the formula any further.
1DI0011733	Well, they certainly aren't making tea and having nice chats, obviously. But maybe you're right - any social development is minor at best.
1DI0011736	You? At a loss for words? Oh, it's worse than I thought!
1DI0011738	I guess that's how people are, huh? Show a little initiative and success, and they'll support you enough for real success.
1DI0011739	Nice work - it must have taken a lot of investigation. Here: for the next time you've got to shine like that.
1DI0011741	Hey, robots are people, too! Well, some of them. Kinda.
1DI0011742	Well, okay. Not really. Still, just in case you anger a few of our more metallic brethren, have a few pulse grenades I picked up, just in case.
1DI0011744	Why would someone booby-trap a library? Unless... they're trying to keep all of the knowledge for themselves!
1DI0011745	Well, we won't let that sort of information be held hostage, will we? We'll educate the world with our book!
1DI0011747	Well as long as it was no problem for you, then! I mean, who doesn't enjoy cake? Other than robots, of course. I bet they prefer pie. Or maybe pi?
1DI0011750	Well, maybe if you're lucky, you'll end up looking like me, too!
1DI0011753	You're a lucky one, you know. At this level, most people don't make it. But then again, most people don't have my experimental tricks!
1DI0011756	Do you think I'm an idiot? I may be a little impulsive, but not an idiot. I'll just take a look at this on my own, then.
1DI0011759	That's horrible! You're horrible! This thing is horrible! Everything's horrible! Argh!
1DI0011760	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it. But I doubt it.
1DI0011761	Oh, but for your trouble, umm... Here, have the leftover chems from working on the repellant. I'm sure you can find some use for them.
1DI0011762	Really? Are you kidding me? No, really. Are you? Huh. Guess I'll have to wait to see what I get from the observer.
1DI0011765	Oh, well aren't you a grouchy one today? What got you in such a bad mood? Oh, yeah. The massive physical trauma.
1DI0011767	Well, this data looks legitimate. An outgrowth of a science station, huh? Just goes to show what I always say about cleverness!
1DI0011770	Well, I guess one thing about using the old tech is that it can feel a bit like playing God. But you're probably not supposed to. I think.
1DI0011773	What, like it was never touched? Well, that's the way it should be! Nothing can overcome the power of knowledge, after all!
1DI0011774	Thank goodness it's safe! I'll make sure to tell people that they can find more information there. It'll become a holy place for the educated!
1DI0011775	Here's a book of mine and some caps for your research. Think of it as pay for a civilization worth of overdue books.
1DI0011780	Don't be so sure. You'd be surprised how confused people get, even about important things.
1DI0011781	In this case, I'm talking about Rivet City. It's the most successful survivor settlement around, but no one here really knows how it started.
1DI0011786	Well, that's what I need your help for, isn't it? I know lots about it from books, but I never seem to get a live example. Not for long, anyway.
1DI0011788	Mirelurks are a big threat in some areas, and knowing more about them can help people learn to avoid, or even outsmart them.
1DI0011789	So I picked up this observer device to study them in their natural habitat. I need you to hide it in one of the spawning pods in their lairs.
1DI0011790	Oh, this is so exciting! I feel like I'm sending you out on some sort of super-assignment!
1DI0011791	Okay, okay. Give me a moment to calm down... Now then, after some searching, I got this RobCo processor widget.
1DI0011792	Supposedly, if you connect it to the mainframe at the RobCo factory, you get access to an army of robots!
1DI0011793	Seems like it's right up your alley, huh? And it'd be a great example of how to harness technology, wouldn't it?
1DI0011794	It does, doesn't it? I mostly just deal with it after it's junked. But a trader gave me this RobCo processor widget. He said it's worth a fortune!
1DI0011795	According to him, if it's connected to the mainframe in the RobCo factory, you could have access to all the robots you'd ever want!
1DI0011796	Now that would be a great example of how to harness technology, wouldn't it?
1DI0011803	Well, I never get to study anyone who's severely injured. Not without them crying to be fixed right away or trying to bleed out and all that.
1DI0011805	Next time you get badly injured, return here so I can examine you before I heal you up.
1DI0011806	I mean, you're going to get yourself hurt anyway, right?
1DI0011807	Oh, that'd sure save me a lot of time. But I bet then it wouldn't have your name on it, now would it?
1DI0011808	Books are where the old world kept its knowledge, and libraries are where it kept the books. And there's supposed to be one in Arlington.
1DI0011810	Oh, that'd sure save me a lot of time. But I bet their book wouldn't have anything about exploding Mole Rats, would it?
1DI0011813	Oh. Well, could you get on that? Thanks!
1DI0011814	Not even for humanity? Not even for science?
1DI0011815	It's not just because they say the place is haunted, is it? Because that's no reason to avoid the place.
1DI0011816	Ghosts don't exist. But landmines do. Oh boy, do they. And that's what we need to study!
1DI0011817	Wow, it repels them that much? I can't wait for your full report!
1DI0011818	There's only one way to know for sure. Just slip the observer into a spawning pod at the War Memorial. I'll take care of the rest.
1DI0011819	Oh, don't think of it as crippling yourself for me... Think of it as getting free treatment when you eventually end up getting yourself hurt!
1DI0011820	Try asking around a bit. You never know who's collected a lot of information, do you?
1DI0011821	Well, why not go over there and make a few friends? Or activate them, I guess.
1DI0011822	Places like that store the collected knowledge of the entire human race. How we began, how we lived, and how we died. Knowledge overwhelming!
1DI0011823	So I'd have to say, and please, please don't take this the wrong way... Yes. It is worth risking your life over those books.
1DI0011824	I mean, no offense.
1DI0011825	No, not all right. Every day you don't help with this research is another day people might die!
1DI0011826	And I can't write without good research, or else people might follow bad info and die anyway! So get to work!
1DI0011827	I realize a lot of things, but this isn't one of them because it's a real scientific necessity and... and... and not ridiculous at all!
1DI0011828	What I mean is, I need this research, and you're probably going to get irradiated out there, anyway. So why not come back here and help me, too?
1DI0011829	Neither is going around all the time with a loaded gun or running with sharp objects, but people do those things all the time!
1DI0011830	You worry too much. Just be careful where you step, and I'm sure you'll be fine!
1DI0011831	Oh, it's perfectly fine, and made from organic ingredients. Well, it affects things' organs. That's close enough to being organic, right?
1DI0011832	Either way, it's perfectly safe. Heck, once it got into food for Jericho, and he never even knew!
1DI0011833	Okay, yes, they're jerks. But if they're intelligent, we can get them to stop. And train them. Maybe we could even ride them! That'd be fun!
1DI0011834	Well, I could hardly be an impartial observer in that case, now could I? It'd ruin the validity of the entire experiment.
1DI0011835	Besides, you wouldn't shoot me, now would you?
1DI0011836	Umm... How about I just leave you alone for a bit?
1DI0011837	No, history is what losers become.
1DI0011838	You go right back and talk to those people and find out something so we can make sure others learn from their successes!
1DI0011839	The trader who sold me that insisted it was a snap to use. Just plug it into the mainframe, and it should take care of the rest.
1DI0011840	Of course, if you played around with the systems after that, we'd probably learn even more. But you can deal with that when you get there.
1DI0011841	No need to worry about that. It's got to be around - it's a government building, and they were all built to the highest construction standards!
1DI0011842	I could swear I read that in an old book somewhere, so it's got to be true!
1DI0011843	Well, I guess I can wait a little. I've got plenty of other projects to work on, after all.
1DI0011844	But come back soon and help out. It's for an important cause!
1DI0011845	Hopefully, you'll be finding food and medicine, but I could sweeten the deal by paying more food when you get back, regardless of the results.
1DI0011846	While you're away, I can at least search through my junk and see if there's anything that'll go with old food to make it more appetizing.
1DI0011847	Don't worry about the chemicals. I handled them all the time while experimenting, and I'm perfectly fine, aren't I?
1DI0011848	How about I let you have the leftover chems I used to make it? Heck, do a thorough job, and maybe I'll let you keep the repellent itself.
1DI0011849	You mean, apart from making sure we don't repeat our tragic failures in a never-ending cavalcade of human pathos and suffering?
1DI0011850	Let's say... A big pile of Mentats. I got a shipment of those in recently. Do a good job, and maybe the people of Rivet City will reward you, too.
1DI0011851	Oh, don't worry so much about it. I'll be waiting here with a nice, tall glass of rad-cleansing brahmin milk for you when you get back.
1DI0011852	Well, mostly just a whole lot of Rad-X and Rad-Away. And maybe even a more reliable way to get rid of radiation! Assuming it works, of course.
1DI0011853	While you're working on that, I'll be following up on a lead I've got for a couple Stealth-Boys. When you're done, they're yours.
1DI0011854	And who knows? Maybe we'll learn something useful from the Mirelurks.
1DI0011855	Well, you'll be getting access to an army of robots. That ought to be reward enough, right? But if you insist, I could spare some pulse grenades.
1DI0011856	What better reward for avoiding explosives than to pay you with explosives? Frag grenades, in this case. I got a pretty good haul of them recently.
1DI0011857	And if you bring me back something to study, maybe I can make some modifications for you. Nothing like tinkering with a live mine, right?
1DI0011858	Did you know, when bones break and re-heal, they grow back tougher? In a way, you'd be repaying yourself. Once I make sure you survive, of course.
1DI0011859	But in a more tangible way, I can give you a modified environmental suit of mine. How's that sound?
1DI0011860	The obvious answer would be, "a book." But I guess there might not be any left there, so how about I pay you with good old-fashioned caps?
1DI0011861	Who knows what you could buy with all those caps? It could be anything. It could even be a book!
1DI0011862	Great! Just tell me what it's like to live underground all your life, or to come outside for the first time, or whatever strikes your fancy!
1DI0011864	I'm pretty sure I remember a girl coming into town with that about ten, twelve years ago.
1DI0011865	She didn't know a thing about the Wastes, and I knew she'd get herself hurt without some sort of protection. So I offered to armor her vault suit.
1DI0011866	Never saw her again -- probably died out there, poor thing. In a way, she gave me the idea to write this book. It's yours, if you help.
1DI0011867	A runaway dad, huh? I've seen plenty of them before. But none with a big "101" on their back.
1DI0011868	That'll be good for the book. In fact, want to help me with the research? I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
1DI0011870	Good luck finding him. Maybe the Armored Vault Suit will help you out there, huh?
1DI0011872	Hah! Yeah, you wouldn't imagine how hard it is to replace that big light bulb up there, too!
1DI0011875	That's great for a foreword - open with a joke and all that. Here, take the suit - something tells me you might need it.
1DI0011877	Oh, certainly, your majesty! Allow me to humbly welcome you to the, um, Duchy of Megaton.
1DI0011878	However, you may consider going incognito. People around here don't always take kindly to monarchy, you know.
1DI0011880	Oh, certainly, your majesty! Then consider this Armored Vault Suit to be Megaton's gift to your mighty empire.
1DI0011883	Well, it takes a little more work than that to get food. And good water's even harder. But you'll figure that out soon enough.
1DI0011886	Here, take the armored suit. It won't help feed you, but it should keep you from being food for anything else. Or anyone else.
1DI0011888	That's terrible!
1DI0011889	But it'll be great for a foreword. So in that sense, it's great!
1DI0011890	I think you're going to like it out here. Just, be careful. Otherwise, you might get recycled into something else's food.
1DI0011894	I think you're going to like it out here. And here's the armored suit, just to make sure you don't get recycled into something else's food.
1DI0011896	If you say so. But if you really mean that, you might want to stop wearing a suit with their number writ large across the back.
1DI0011897	Anyway, I guess I don't need a foreword. They just get in the way of the real content. But the book's going to be great, you just watch.
1DI0011899	It seems that we have similar goals in mind. It's rare to meet someone who has proper priorities.
1DI0011901	All right, all right. He'll fetch a good price in the long run. Here you go.
1DI0011902	Now all you gotta do is put this collar on him and tell him to run his ass on over here. We'll do the rest.
1DI0011903	You drive a hard bargain, but it's still well worth it. Here you go.
1DI0011905	Good. Here's your caps. Pleasure doing business with you.
1DI0011908	Poor dear. I know what it's like to be alone. I'd love to take him in.
1DI0011909	Don't worry, I have the means to keep him fed and healthy but most importantly, safe.
1DI0011910	Kids are a bit tough in the resell, but they make good future breeders.
1DI0011911	I'll take him off your hands. How about 100 caps?
1DI0011912	This ain't a hotel, mungo. We don't let stupid farts in here for the hell of it.
1DI0011913	Haven't we gone through this?
1DI0011914	Oh, okay. I understand. Thanks for trying though.
1DI0011915	Don't worry about me... I'll be okay here. Now that the Fire Ants are long gone, maybe people will begin showing up here again.
1DI0011916	Stop by again someday and say hi, okay?
1DI0011917	Well, it would have been nicer to live with Vera, but this will probably be pretty fun too!
1DI0011918	I can't believe everything you've done for me. Most people would have kept on walking when I ran up to them screaming like I did.
1DI0011919	I'll get my stuff together and move on out there right away. Come visit me sometime!
1DI0011920	W-what is this weird thing?
1DI0011925	You son-of-a-bitch!!!!
1DI0011926	How could you do this to me? I lost everything and you sell me to slavers? Well fuck you!
1DI0011927	You really found her!? Oh, thank you so much!
1DI0011930	You're killin' me here, mungo.
1DI0011931	Fine. You can send him here, but I'm not gonna do any special favors for him or anything. He's gotta pull his weight.
1DI0011932	This is a bad idea...
1DI0011933	Fine, send him here. But if he smells bad, or makes dumb jokes, I'm sticking him right back outside.
1DI0011934	We got enough of those here already.
1DI0011935	Like I care about your stupid caps. I'm not some big, dumb mungo.
1DI0011936	We don't let people just come in here when they feel like it. That ain't how it works, and it ain't gonna change.
1DI0011937	Guess you gotta find another home for Little Orphan Asshole.
1DI0011938	Already have.
1DI0011939	Ha ha, tough guy.
1DI0011940	Nice try, but we ain't got the room.
1DI0011941	Ha ha. Tryin' to act like you're all tough, mungo?
1DI0011943	Certainly. I wouldn't expect you to make a rash decision.
1DI0011944	Oh, that's wonderful! If you ever wander back into Rivet City, why don't you check up on us. You're always welcome.
1DI0011945	All right. What is it?
1DI0011947	Those... THINGS. They keep coming. They scare me! Make it stop!
1DI0011948	No... those things will get me! I can't. Gotta' keep going!
1DI0011949	Those things... they're gonna' get me too! Can't stop now!
1DI0011950	You won't leave me like all the other grown-ups? You... you can help me?
1DI0011951	You look stronger than all the other grown-ups. Can you... can you protect me?
1DI0011953	R... really? No monsters?
1DI0011954	Then you can make these things go away!
1DI0011955	THOSE things! It's all their fault! They did this to us!
1DI0011956	No! You don't care! The grown-ups never cared! Now they're all dead! Well, fine! You'll just die too!
1DI0011957	See! I knew it! You don't care! No one ever cares!
1DI0011958	Well fine! Go away, see if I care! But those... things. They're gonna' get you!
1DI0011959	Please don't get mad at me... I'm scared. I don't know what to do.
1DI0011960	Just help me... promise you'll help me!
1DI0011961	Those... big things. They're all over Grayditch and they killed everyone!
1DI0011962	Please... please find my pappa!
1DI0011963	You grown-ups are all the same! All you care about is your stuff!
1DI0011964	My pappa is missing and I think the ants may have gotten him! I hope they get you too!
1DI0011965	Why are you so mean!? All you care about is yourself! Well, fine!
1DI0011967	Okay, I forgive you.
1DI0011968	No! They always just say sorry, but then it turns out to be a bunch of lies.
1DI0011969	How can I ever trust a grown-up again?
1DI0011970	When I was bad, my pappa made me apologize three times. Then he decided if I was really or sorry or not.
1DI0011971	You wanna' talk to me about stuff, say you're sorry three times... and you better mean it!
1DI0011972	Fine. Hmph.
1DI0011973	Good. You did it. Now I'll talk to you.
1DI0011974	Keep 'em coming. Pappa said that's the right thing to do.
1DI0011975	That's good. Keep going.
1DI0011976	Oh man! You got me!
1DI0011977	I guess I accept your apology!
1DI0011978	Yeah... I snuck back home a little while ago and found him laying there.
1DI0011979	I guess I already knew anyway, I just needed to see for myself. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
1DI0011980	He's...he's dead?
1DI0011981	I guess I already knew. Besides, I'm too tired to cry anymore.
1DI0011986	Well you don't have to be such a meanie about it.
1DI0011987	I already knew anyway, Mr. Smarty. I snuck back home a little while ago and found him laying there.
1DI0011988	Now he's dead and I'm by myself. Not that you'd care.
1DI0011989	You... you know what you are? You're a big asshole! That's right... an asshole! My pappa said never to say that word, but you deserve it!
1DI0011990	Now what am I going to do? My pappa's dead... poor pappa...
1DI0011991	You gotta stop it so this can't happen to anyone else's family ever again!
1DI0011992	I wish I had met you a long time ago, then maybe my dad would still be alive.
1DI0011995	Thanks for doing all this... I'm feeling better now that you're here.
1DI0011996	Please don't go! Please!
1DI0011997	We have to get back at these things for killing my pappa! We just gotta!
1DI0011998	Why does everyone who comes through here have to be so mean!?
1DI0012000	Look, my dad used to always say "You can do whatever you want in life but the family comes first."
1DI0012001	If I left now, I'd just be running away. I can't do that. I owe him.
1DI0012002	You-you are?! I can't believe it!
1DI0012003	But what about pappa?! I need you to find my pappa!
1DI0012006	Look, I know if you find my pappa he's gotta have some caps with him. He'd pay you! Please, mister!
1DI0012008	Why are you so mean!?
1DI0012009	I knew grown-ups were stupid! All you care about is yourself! Well, fine!
1DI0012010	My name's Bryan Wilks. I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
1DI0012011	They killed everyone in town... including my pappa. Now I'm all alone.
1DI0012012	I'm glad those stupid things are all dead though! You're pretty tough!
1DI0012016	Awww, come on. You're pretty tough taking out all those ants by yourself!
1DI0012017	The name's Bryan Wilks, by the way, I live in Grayditch. Well, that is, I did until those Fire Ants turned this place into a cemetery.
1DI0012019	I wish I had something to give you for all the work you did, but I never really had much to start with.
1DI0012020	I guess now you'll be on your way and I'll have to try living here by myself. I hope you'll come back and visit someday.
1DI0012025	Just be careful, mister... I don't wanna lose you too.
1DI0012026	Just be careful, lady... I don't wanna lose you too.
1DI0012027	You do?!
1DI0012028	Well, what are you waiting here for? Go back and kill that thing! Because of it, my pappa's dead! Hurry!
1DI0012029	Awww shucks. Well, keep trying, mister. I promise I'll be good and stay right here for you.
1DI0012030	Awww shucks. Well, keep trying, lady. I promise I'll be good and stay right here for you.
1DI0012031	Oh, my. I suppose I do tend to ramble on about all things academic.
1DI0012032	My problem right now is I can't reach my terminal to make the proper adjustments and repair the damage I've caused.
1DI0012033	Well, I might ask you the same thing.
1DI0012034	You're trampling about in a delicately balanced and highly sensitive experimental area.
1DI0012035	Well, yes. I suppose I am.
1DI0012036	Doctor Weston Lesko's my name and it's good to make your acquaintance. What brings you to my little experimental ecosystem?
1DI0012037	That is precisely why this is the ideal place for my work.
1DI0012038	Do you realize you're trampling about in a delicately balanced and highly sensitive experimentation area?
1DI0012039	That's no way to talk to a man of science!
1DI0012040	I don't have time for this kind of childish nonsense, I have some very delicate experiments that I must attend to!
1DI0012041	My experiments are of a complex nature and would take a scientist to explain... oh wait! I'm a scientist! How marvelous!
1DI0012042	My foray into reducing the girth of these insectoid creatures is of utmost importance.
1DI0012043	I intend to generationally reduce their immense stature by way of a pre-birth induced mutagen. Isn't that clever?
1DI0012044	I've chosen this room as a temporary retreat from which to contemplate my erroneous figures for my experiments.
1DI0012045	It may be a bit dark and damp, but such annoyances will not stand in the way of science!
1DI0012046	Oh my! Such rude behavior!
1DI0012047	I'll have none of this from you. I have far more important things to do. Oh, goodness me! That rhymed! How marvelous!
1DI0012048	My word! You understand perfectly! How marvelous!
1DI0012049	Hmmm. Let me see. Well... You start with a generation of very large ants.
1DI0012050	You simply inject the current brood's eggs with an engineered mutagen. Then, the next generation should be smaller.
1DI0012051	Do it enough times, and you may be able to reduce them back to their once original tiny size.
1DI0012052	Yes, it's fairly obvious you have no clue what I'm dealing with here. Let me explain to you, as I would to a child.
1DI0012053	The ants start out very very big. Then we put the magic potion in the eggs, so when they hatch, the new ones will be smaller.
1DI0012054	Do that many many times and soon all the ants are tiny again! How marvelous!
1DI0012055	It's always staggering just how low the intellectual level of the typical Wastelander appears to be. Let me try and explain.
1DI0012056	The ants are very very big. I want to make them very very small.
1DI0012057	So I put a special medicine in the eggs to make them small after they hatch.
1DI0012058	Well. I'm afraid I've made slight miscalculations in the mutagen. Instead of lowering their size, the brood hatched with a new biomechanism.
1DI0012059	I call their genetic abberation pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.
1DI0012060	I may be able to correct this error, but I can't get near my equipment.
1DI0012061	Well, this is rather embarrassing so you'll have to forgive me, it appears that I've made a slight miscalculation in my mutagen samples.
1DI0012062	Instead of lowering the size of the ants, the brood hatched and developed a new biomechanism.
1DI0012063	I call their genetic aberration pyrosis; the ability to emit flame from their bodies.
1DI0012065	Hmph. I don't expect a common Wastelander to understand the intricacies of an experiment this delicate.
1DI0012066	There was an error in my calculations that caused my mutagen to allow the ants to develop a new biomechanism.
1DI0012069	I'm afraid it's not that simple. The mutagen has already been injected into the Ant Queen. She has enough in her body to last for years.
1DI0012071	A small price to pay for the advancement of science.
1DI0012072	A few die, and later after the mutagen is improved, many more will live. That's the way it's done.
1DI0012073	The only way to correct this mistake is to modify the mutagen. I must get to my terminal.
1DI0012074	Your knowledge of experimental procedure surprises me!
1DI0012075	Indeed, I have skipped a step and directly modified an entire brood. Perhaps I was too hasty... I was so certain it would work.
1DI0012076	To correct this mistake, I'll need to get to my terminal to modify the mutagen.
1DI0012077	There's no need to be rude! Science must learn to crawl before it walks.
1DI0012078	If you're not interested in helping the situation, then I suggest you let me get back to perfecting my mutagen.
1DI0012079	Imagine. Years from now... the entire population of ants in the Wasteland, back to the size of a peanut.
1DI0012080	Our names will be in the history books for such a feat of scientific brilliance! How marvelous!
1DI0012081	Perhaps man isn't ready, my friend. Not today, but maybe someday.
1DI0012082	I suppose I shouldn't be angered by your actions, forgive my impertinance.
1DI0012083	Spoken like a true disciple of science! I will restart my calculations from the beginning and learn to crawl before I try to run.
1DI0012085	You utter buffoon! You've set my work back months... perhaps even years!
1DI0012086	I'm afraid I have no further use of your services and any bargain we may have had is null and void!
1DI0012087	Now, if you'll excuse me...
1DI0012091	You will? How marvelous!
1DI0012092	Be careful, my friend, the Nest Guardians can be quite tenacious.
1DI0012093	Since you've offered, allow me to elaborate.
1DI0012094	My portable terminal is set up in the Hatchery Chamber near the Ant Queen. If I can reach it, I can continue to work on improving the mutagen.
1DI0012096	Please, don't insult my intelligence. Had I been able to correct this error easily I would have done so long before you arrived.
1DI0012098	If she were harmed in any way, months of data would be lost.
1DI0012099	Your objective would be to eliminate what I call her quintet of Nest Guardians. Filthy little abominations!
1DI0012100	If I were to do that months of data would be lost. No, no... the Queen must remain completely unharmed.
1DI0012102	Oh! No, no, no! The Queen mustn't be harmed at all! Months of work would be lost!
1DI0012104	I've rigged the equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
1DI0012105	Once I send this pulse, all of the remaining ants will lose their empathic link with the Queen and frenzy, destroying each other in the process!
1DI0012106	So, that's all there is to it. What do you say?
1DI0012109	However, there is one final detail I need your help with. Could you do something about Bryan Wilks for me?
1DI0012110	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely.  I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
1DI0012113	No, it should all wrap up rather nicely.  I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
1DI0012116	Yes, it should all wrap up rather nicely. I've rigged my equipment at my portable terminal to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
1DI0012119	That's everything to do with the ants, yes indeed. I've rigged my equipment to emit what I call an Inhibitor Pulse.
1DI0012122	He's a rather bothersome young lad. Always asking interminable questions and interrupting my calculations.
1DI0012123	After you're done down here, perhaps you can locate him on the surface and speak to him.
1DI0012124	He's a rather bothersome young man. Always asking interminable questions and interrupting my calculations.
1DI0012125	After you're done down here, perhaps you can speak to him and calm him down.
1DI0012128	Very well, I've waited this long, a bit longer won't make much difference.
1DI0012129	In the meantime, allow me to get back to my calculations.
1DI0012130	Yes, I suppose you're right. Science must learn to acquiesce to your standards in order to advance itself.
1DI0012131	I was merely going to offer one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers, but I suppose I could up the ante.
1DI0012132	I will also award you with my old lab coat. It's served me well over the years... and you may find it useful for your own experiments.
1DI0012133	Why can't man follow the ant's example? They work together as a team... every waking moment dedicated to the colony.
1DI0012134	They require no wealth or material items... everything they need is provided for them by their fellow insects.
1DI0012135	But I digress. If it's payment you need, all I can offer is one of my Mutagenic Bioenhancers.
1DI0012139	I've managed to isolate some of the Fire Ant genes and distill them into human-safe genetic enhancers!
1DI0012140	I can inject you with one of these formulas and you'll find yourself with either enhanced strength or enhanced perception!
1DI0012141	Not only that, but you'll be somewhat more resistant to fire! How marvelous!
1DI0012142	Well, the mutagen has enhanced their fortitude and provided them with what I call pyrosis; the ability to emit flame biologically.
1DI0012143	They're quite radiation-free however. Well, as radiation-free as any other mutated creature in the Wasteland.
1DI0012144	Playing with genetic codes isn't simple... do you realize one tiny tweak at any point in the last million years could have completely changed us?
1DI0012145	Going from attempting to change their size to generating their pyrosis ability is no surprise at all.
1DI0012146	I'm afraid they are not susceptible to anything I can think of that wouldn't harm the garden-variety Giant Ant.
1DI0012147	Just aim for their antennae if you can... it will confuse them quite a bit.
1DI0012148	Must I again remind you that the Queen is to remain completely unharmed!?
1DI0012149	If she's hurt or killed, there's no telling how long it would take me to find a suitable new subject!
1DI0012150	Just let me issue the Inhibitor Pulse and it will have a similar effect.
1DI0012151	The stimulation of the subject's evolutionary trigger by the mutagen caused a bio-defensive reaction metamorphosing the ant's venom glands.
1DI0012152	This process caused unexpected oscillations in the venom molecules at such a vast rate it produces a thermodynamic biochemical reaction.
1DI0012153	As the subject ejects the volatile solution, it becomes conflagrant due to new structures in it's maw I call its calefaction array.
1DI0012154	Amazing, isn't it?
1DI0012155	You should take him away from this place; find him a home.
1DI0012156	It would be difficult to accomplish my experiments with him scampering about and asking an interminable amount of questions.
1DI0012157	Far too curious. His incessant questioning would often come when I was the most absorbed with my calculations.
1DI0012158	He had no regard for the importance of my work!
1DI0012159	All scientists take responsibility for their failures, because it comes with the territory.
1DI0012160	I will take this experimentation to completion without roosting on the moral high ground.
1DI0012161	If I allow emotions to enter the mix, all this time and energy spent will have been for nothing.
1DI0012162	You have your ideals and I have mine. I'm down here to complete my experiments at any cost.
1DI0012163	If that means the loss of a few lives to save generations of lives in the future, it's a small price to pay.
1DI0012164	I can't risk leaving this place... I have to continue monitoring the Hatchery for any further mutations in the next brood!
1DI0012165	I have no time for children and their petty games. What do they know about the importance of my work?
1DI0012166	Then I will proceed to my portable terminal at once and make the necessary changes to the formula.
1DI0012167	Thanks very much for everything... you've been quite a useful lab assistant!
1DI0012169	Let's proceed to my terminal and we'll see if I can undo all the damage I've caused.
1DI0012170	What?!! How could you do such a foolish thing?
1DI0012171	Oh now this is really too much!
1DI0012172	I don't have time for these kinds of shenanigans. Allow me to return to my work and you return to the job at hand!
1DI0012174	Destroying the mutagen was NOT part of what we discussed!
1DI0012176	Well, I will continue my research. There has to be a way to reduce these creatures to their former size.
1DI0012177	Until then... I will be staying in my shack next to the Wilks's home should you ever wish to visit me.
1DI0012178	Really? You mean it!?
1DI0012179	Oh boy! Thank you so much! I'll wait in my old house for you to come back... I need to bury my pappa anyway.
1DI0012180	Just don't forget about me!
1DI0012181	I dunno... I kinda' don't like it in here. Gonna be really lonely.
1DI0012182	I guess this is goodbye then. Come back and visit me.
1DI0012183	Well, okay. Just don't forget about me.
1DI0012184	Oh, Vera is the nicest lady ever! It's so cool that you brought me here!
1DI0012185	I mean, she makes me do stuff... like clean up her hotel and all that, but she really cares about me.
1DI0012186	Plus, I found some friends here in Rivet City too. All thanks to you!
1DI0012187	I dunno. I mean, there are tons of other kids here like me but they're all kind of weird.
1DI0012188	I don't really like sleeping in a huge cave... I keep having dreams about the ants.
1DI0012189	Oh well, at least I'm safer than I was in Grayditch, so I guess I have to thank you for that.
1DI0012190	It's lonely. No one really comes by here. Plus this place keeps reminding me of my poppa.
1DI0012191	I mean, you're the only person who's come back through Grayditch since everything happened.
1DI0012192	At least I'm safe in my old house now. I suppose I have you to thank for that.
1DI0012195	Doctor Lesko is next door now, but he is so buried in his work, we barely have time to talk.
1DI0012197	I'm afraid that's my fault. The last mutagen sample was given to the Ant Queen's entire brood.
1DI0012198	The brood consisted of hundreds of larvae. I am afraid after they hatched, some escaped through the nooks and crannies in the tunnels.
1DI0012199	The Fire Ants you are seeing now are merely the remnants of the brood returning to the nest.
1DI0012200	Well, I'm uncertain. This does deal quite a blow to my research.
1DI0012201	First however, I must stay here and devote all of my resources to finding the proper mutagen formula.
1DI0012202	Very well, actually. I think I've isolated the instance of DNA coding error and I'm attempting to correct it.
1DI0012203	I'm quite frustrated. I can't seem to isolate a stable mix for the mutagen.
1DI0012204	Not so well, I'm afraid. The recoding sequence on the DNA splicing has gone awry and I must restart from the beginning.
1DI0012205	Not much has occurred since we last spoke I'm afraid. But science marches on!
1DI0012206	I think I'm isolating the issue that caused the Fire Ant mutation error! A few more tweaks and I may have a breakthrough!
1DI0012207	Disaster! The latest batch of mutagen was completely contaminated. I'll have to start anew. Such is the burden of working in this environment.
1DI0012208	I think I may be on the verge of a breakthrough! The latest mutagen sample seems quite stable. Only time will tell.
1DI0012209	I don't suppose you can help me identify a rogue strain of virus that seems to have infiltrated the latest sample? No, I suppose you couldn't...
1DI0012210	Why, yes it would.
1DI0012211	I would be more than happy to take that off your hands if you'd like.
1DI0012212	If you can gather more for me, I would certainly love to have them. I'm certain Marigold's tunnels are rife with the original brood.
1DI0012213	How marvelous! Allow me to buy them from you as we agreed upon.
1DI0012214	Excellent! These will be perfect for my next batch of mutagen.
1DI0012215	Thank you. Please bring back more if you can!
1DI0012216	If you're listening to this tape, then my brains are splattered all over a wall somewhere and you've got a job to do.
1DI0012217	You need to retrieve the package and get it safely to Ronald Laren in Girdershade. Tell him Grady sent you.
1DI0012218	To get the package, you'll need the key. I've stashed it inside an old fire hose case in some maintenance closet in Marigold Metro Station.
1DI0012219	The key will unlock the safe that contains the package. Look for the room marked by a spinning light... you can't miss it.
1DI0012220	Good luck, and hopefully they won't find you too.
1DI0012221	This could be the fifth time I've forgotten the code to my desktop terminal. I really must learn to be more organized.
1DI0012222	The password for my terminal is "formicidae." How hard could that be for me to remember?
1DI0012223	Note to self: destroy this holotape as soon as move to new lab is complete.
1DI0012224	Wow, sure is hot in here.
1DI0012225	It's kind of hard to breathe in this thing.
1DI0012226	What's this funny suction hose for?
1DI0012227	Is there any food in here?
1DI0012228	Ha! Stupid monsters! Can't get me in here.
1DI0012229	Ummm... anyone out there? Hello?
1DI0012230	Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.
1DI0012231	How marvelous! Ant Sight it is! Hold still please.
1DI0012232	How marvelous! Ant Might it is! Hold still please.
1DI0012233	Very well. Return to me when you're ready.
1DI0012234	Well, I remember once they were all yelling at each other and stuff. Kinda weird cause Doc Lesko is so nice and all.
1DI0012235	Later pappa said something like "The Doc has got a brain on his shoulders when it comes to ants, but he's got a lot to learn about people."
1DI0012236	It was weird, cause I never seen a brain sitting on Doc's shoulder... that would be gross!
1DI0012237	Well, there used to be like big regular ants once in a while... but pappa could usually hunt 'em down with Mr. Brandice across the street.
1DI0012238	It only started getting bad here with these Fire Ants after the Doc got here, yeah.
1DI0012239	I dunno. I mean, he always talked real funny and didn't let me touch anything in his house.
1DI0012240	But I guess he was okay. I mean, he never did anything bad.
1DI0012241	Really?! Oh my gosh!
1DI0012242	Well if anyone can stop the Fire Ants, it's you two together. You're both really smart!
1DI0012243	If you can, make sure he comes back... maybe he'll stay here and I'll have someone to talk to when you're gone!
1DI0012244	Oh my yes, they're quite marvelous!
1DI0012245	There are many that say it can't be done, but I'll prove them wrong.
1DI0012246	By introducing my mutagen directly into an ant egg, I hope to reduce the size of the adults.
1DI0012247	This is a generational system, meaning it will take quite a few broods before the ants are at their destination size.
1DI0012248	In the end, I hope to make them as small as they were over 200 years ago.
1DI0012249	Well... ummm, I may have used a few... ahem, shortcuts. Yes.
1DI0012250	I was told that the FEV works wonders when used under controlled circumstances!
1DI0012251	Apparently I was wrong, but I know my mistake. I'm certain I can get it to work!
1DI0012252	Destroy? Oh no no no!
1DI0012253	You mustn't do that! It's my life's work! Just clear me a path to my equipment and I'll do the rest when you tell me its safe.
1DI0012254	Well, pappa always told me about my cousin Vera. She lives on some big, giant ship somewhere or something.
1DI0012255	Pappa called the place "Rivet City", but I dunno where it is.
1DI0012256	Naw. People don't like to stay long in Grayditch. The D.C. Ruins aren't a great place to make a home, you know?
1DI0012257	In fact, pappa was talking about moving on soon... we've been here for maybe a year.
1DI0012258	Ummm, besides me and my pappa, there was Doc Lesko who stayed with us and Will Brandice and his momma and pappa too.
1DI0012259	I... guess they're all gone now.
1DI0012260	Naw, go ahead. It's just nice to talk to anyone about stuff at all.
1DI0012261	He was a strange man. He paid pappa some caps to help him build a shack and carry a bunch of junk into it.
1DI0012262	Pappa called him an egghead, but his head was shaped regular, so I didn't get it.
1DI0012263	Well, there was Will... he was sorta my friend. And then there was his dad and his mom.
1DI0012265	Right across the street actually. It was pretty swell having someone to hang out with so close by.
1DI0012266	Yeah, Will was super nice to me. He was like a year older than me I think. He even shared his comic books with me.
1DI0012267	We explored pretty much every bit of Grayditch we could find. I think that's why the ants don't bother me... I have good hiding spots.
1DI0012268	Well, his mom was nice too. She was kind of quiet, but she always took care of me and my pappa when we came over.
1DI0012269	I think she was sad that my mom was gone.
1DI0012270	Will's dad was... well, I don't wanna be mean... but he was kinda scary.
1DI0012271	He was like always watching me and my dad real careful, like he didn't trust us or something.
1DI0012272	He always kept staring at us from the windows of his house and typing stuff into his TV box.
1DI0012273	Will said his dad was like an old soldier or something, but he didn't like doing that stuff so he quit.
1DI0012274	He spent all of his of time in that shack next door to my house.
1DI0012275	Every time I'd sneak in there, he'd be sitting at that funny looking TV machine with the green words pushing buttons.
1DI0012276	Naw. He was a nice man, but he never wanted to play with me very much and we barely talked.
1DI0012277	All I know is he was all gone when the ants started showing up. I think... they got him too.
1DI0012278	I dunno, all kinds of doohickeys. Boxes with lots of lights, some funny glass bottles....
1DI0012279	Oh wait! He had a big, clunky, shiny man too. That was kind of neat.
1DI0012280	Well, there is the personal shelter next to the old diner.
1DI0012281	Pappa always said to stay away from it... but, I guess it's supposed to be safe.
1DI0012282	I'll head over there and wait inside. Hurry back!
1DI0012283	You think I didn't know that? I been hiding in this place for days!
1DI0012284	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. Those stupid things will never get me in there.
1DI0012286	Humph... you don't gotta be such a jerk about it.
1DI0012287	There's an old portashelter next to the diner near my house. I'll be waiting inside for you to come back.
1DI0012288	And don't you dare leave me alone!
1DI0012289	Wow, you sound as nice as my pappa.
1DI0012290	You know, maybe this will help and maybe it won't, but pappa hid a bunch of stuff behind the old diner in a dumpster.
1DI0012291	He trusted me with the key and said it was for emergencies, but I bet he wouldn't mind you having it.
1DI0012292	Thanks for making me feel better.
1DI0012295	Well, they're big ugly things that crawl around on six legs. They got huge teeth and skitter around grabbing everything in their path.
1DI0012296	My pappa would always say they were Fuckin' Ants. Well, that's what he used to call them anyway.
1DI0012297	I just call 'em Fire Ants.
1DI0012298	Naw. Those things started coming around only in the last few months.
1DI0012299	At first they just crawled around outside our town, but later they came into town and... well, you know the rest.
1DI0012300	My pappa had a gun, and he said it hurt those things, but he said they were the dumbest Fuckin' Ants he ever saw.
1DI0012301	He kept telling everyone to "shoot for their antenner" whatever that means.
1DI0012302	Well... yeah. I think I heard Doc Lesko mention something like a queen or something.
1DI0012303	Something about "laying eggs" whatever that means.
1DI0012304	He said the queen would never be above ground. That he'd have to find her. Weird huh?
1DI0012305	Look for the house nearest to the billboard that's sticking out of the ground. It's pretty close to the diner, you can't miss it.
1DI0012306	Okay! Shoot!
1DI0012307	Well, to the east there are some nasty Raiders in Evergreen Mills. I'd stay away from there if I were you.
1DI0012308	Luckily, we're kind of hidden here under the old highway, so no one bothers us.
1DI0012309	My friend, you are at the ass end of the Capital Wasteland. If it weren't for Sierra I'd be out of here.
1DI0012310	One thing I can tell you is stay the hell away from the Dunwich Building to the south. That place is bad mojo.
1DI0012311	I dunno what that place is about, but I hear about weird shit going on.
1DI0012312	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than the Molotov Cocktail.
1DI0012313	It explodes in a huge blue flame too! How cool is that?
1DI0012314	You do! You darling!
1DI0012315	Well, as always, I'll be glad to take them off your hands. And now that my machine is full I can drink these to my heart's desire!
1DI0012316	Goodie! I was hoping you'd bring me more!
1DI0012317	Keep it up, there's probably plenty more out there.
1DI0012318	I was just wondering when I'd see you again, and poof, here you are!
1DI0012319	Ohhhh sweet Quantum, come to mama!
1DI0012320	I'm amazed you're finding so many more bottles of Quantum out there. Imagine that.
1DI0012321	Well, don't give up looking. Keep finding more and bringing it to me.
1DI0012322	Why would I want that piss water? Get it away from me.
1DI0012323	A sleepover? Awesome! We could tell bedtime stories and do each other's hair and all sorts of fun stuff.
1DI0012324	I could even make some Nuka-Cola treats for when we get the munchies late at night. That would be fun!
1DI0012325	You can't expect me to get married without a gift for my future husband do you? That wouldn't be right.
1DI0012326	And don't call me names like that, it hurts my feelings.
1DI0012327	Okay, well don't forget I'll still buy bottles of Quantum from you!
1DI0012328	Ohhhh... Ronald is SUCH a sweetheart! Do you know he went out like you did and found me 30 bottles of Quantum?
1DI0012329	He loves me! He really really loves me! Now I bet he'll ask me to get married.
1DI0012330	Oh! For my wedding present I'm giving him the super secret prize too!
1DI0012331	Well, the stuff is so rare, I only know one. It's called Mississippi Quantum Pie. It's delicious!
1DI0012332	If you want me to make you one, I can. Just bring me some flour, vodka, and a Nuka-Cola Quantum.
1DI0012333	I can whip it up in no time.
1DI0012334	Sure! Just give me a second, and I'll have it ready for you.
1DI0012335	Oops! I need some vodka to make the pie, sweetie.
1DI0012336	Oops! I need some flour to make the pie, sweetie.
1DI0012337	Oops! I need a Nuka-Cola Quantum to make the pie, sweetie.
1DI0012338	You silly! I still need flour and vodka to make the pie.
1DI0012339	You silly! I still need Nuka-Cola Quantum and vodka to make the pie.
1DI0012340	You silly! I still need Nuka-Cola Quantum and flour to make the pie.
1DI0012341	If you have the ingredients, I can make a pie for you. All it takes is some flour, vodka and Nuka-Cola Quantum.
1DI0012342	Oh no, not at all. In fact, I've been getting lots of nice attention from him lately!
1DI0012343	Ever since he brought the Quantum to fill my machine, he keeps whispering sweet nothings to me.
1DI0012344	In fact, he told me he's going to "butter my muffin." Isn't that sweet that he'd do such a silly little chore for me? Now all I need are muffins...
1DI0012345	That sweetheart? Nah. Come to think of it, he hasn't even visited me in a while.
1DI0012346	I wonder why. Ah well, I'm sure I'll see him soon enough!
1DI0012347	Oh no. He's such a cutie pie. He never bothers me!
1DI0012348	What? What the hell happened?
1DI0012349	Crap! This has to be about the Nuka-Cola machine I got for her!
1DI0012350	It had this label on it saying "Warning: If you tamper with this unit you will have to answer to the Nuka-Cola Corporation."
1DI0012351	Now I bet they're after me! Oh god! I gotta hide. I gotta go!
1DI0012352	Are you shittin' me? What a waste! Oh man.
1DI0012353	If I find out who did that to her, they're dead. She was mine... no one was supposed to touch her but me!
1DI0012354	What?? You're crazy! How could you just go and kill her like that?!
1DI0012355	That's it... you're dead meat! Say hello to the Kneecapper!
1DI0012356	Love? What are you talking about.
1DI0012357	All I know is things are sure gonna be awfully quiet around here with her gone.
1DI0012358	Ah well. I guess I'll go clean up the mess and take care of things around here.
1DI0012359	Wasn't she?
1DI0012362	Ahem... Anyway, that's all in the past now.
1DI0012363	You!? You killed her!?
1DI0012365	I'm sorry, as per Protocol NC-77, this information must be readily accessible at all times.

1DI0012389	Yep. I'll be seeing you, soon I hope.
1DI0012390	Yep, they sure were hard to get, and you got 'em you big 'ole teddy bear! Anyway, gotta' get these into the machine. Seeya, sweetie!
1DI0012391	He he. That's ok, Sierra. Play hard to get. I love it!
1DI0012392	Some of what?
1DI0012393	That's ok, baby. We have plenty of time. You know where to find me when you want some of this.
1DI0012394	Well, maybe later. I have a lot of things to do now. Need to get all of this Quantum icy cold.
1DI0012395	Nothing. So, you wanna' celebrate?
1DI0012397	Yeah, I'll fill your machine all right. Hehe.
1DI0012398	Oh my goodness! You absolute dear! You found the Quantum to fill my machine!
1DI0012399	Hi there, sweet cheeks. I got something for you.
1DI0012400	Because I'm making sure that no one messes with her. She's my girl, you know.
1DI0012401	Hey hey. No need to be that way, beautiful.
1DI0012402	It's cool anyway, Sierra and I are already hooked up.
1DI0012403	I just don't want any other chicks messing with her head. You know what I mean?
1DI0012404	That better be all you were checking out. I don't like guys messing with my woman.
1DI0012405	That's all huh? Better be.
1DI0012406	Because I warn you, I don't like anyone messing around with my woman.
1DI0012407	Nope. I'm not the marrying type.
1DI0012408	Look, I'm just trying to make sure no one messes with her. You'd do the same to protect your woman too.
1DI0012409	Wow. Okay, I get the message. Take it easy.
1DI0012410	Look, I'm just trying to make sure no one messes up my chances with her.
1DI0012411	Well, that's likely because it's none of anyone's business but ours.
1DI0012412	She's one hot lady though, am I right?
1DI0012414	But hey she's a fine looking lady. I mean, you're no slouch either, but a man has his standards you know?
1DI0012415	Good. I aim to keep it that way.
1DI0012416	She's a fine woman. I'd love to get closer to her if you know what I mean.
1DI0012417	I think you'd better calm down and think long and hard about that.
1DI0012418	Girdershade is my town, you can't just walk in here and tell me you're taking Sierra.
1DI0012419	I'm gonna' be the first one to tap into her goods, not you!
1DI0012420	Whoa, that's kind of kinky, I like it! I wouldn't mind watching that.
1DI0012421	Sorry baby, you'll just have to take a number. I'm gonna' be the first one to tap into Sierra's goods, not you.
1DI0012422	Wow, you are as naive as you look.
1DI0012423	How do I put it? I'd love to do the horizontal bop with her... you know, plow her bean field. Come on, kid.
1DI0012424	All right, suit yourself.
1DI0012425	I was going to make you an offer that could earn you some caps, but if you don't have the time to listen...
1DI0012426	Born and raised that way and damn proud of it.
1DI0012427	Look. I have an offer to give you. You can either stand there and be a pain in the ass, or you can listen to what I have to say.
1DI0012428	New to this stuff, eh kid?
1DI0012429	Well, let's just say that she has something I want to get a hold of. That's where you enter the picture.
1DI0012430	What are you, some kind of choir boy? Bah, maybe you're just not old enough to understand yet.
1DI0012431	Needless to say, she's got what I want. That's where you come into the picture.
1DI0012432	What are you, a nun? Bah, maybe you're just not old enough to understand yet.
1DI0012434	Now you're speaking my language.
1DI0012435	Well, only problem is she won't give it up for me. That's where you come into the picture.
1DI0012436	I know she's asked you to find her some Nuka-Cola Quantum. Heck, she asks everyone that wanders through here.
1DI0012437	What I'm proposing is you still look for the drinks, but instead of bringing it to her, you bring it to me.
1DI0012438	She'll be so impressed that I got all the Nuka-Cola for her, she'll melt in my arms like butter.
1DI0012439	I pay you the same she was going to pay, and everyone's happy.
1DI0012444	Fine. Oh, and I wouldn't bother running back to Sierra and warning her about our little chat. She won't even understand what you're talking about.
1DI0012445	She may be a looker, but she's a bit vacant in the smarts department.
1DI0012446	Thought you might. Good. I'll see you soon then.
1DI0012447	Holy shit! Are you for real? Hell yeah!
1DI0012448	I'm off to find you some Quantum then and I know right where to go.
1DI0012449	Well, look... don't answer me now, just keep it in mind. If you find some and you've had a change of heart, I'll still  buy 'em.
1DI0012450	Oh, and I wouldn't bother running back to Sierra and warning her. She won't even understand what you're talking about.
1DI0012451	She may be a hottie, but she's a bit vacant in the smarts department.
1DI0012452	You devious bastard. I didn't figure you were that clever.
1DI0012453	All right, all right. Double it is. Just bring me those bottles, if I have to listen to Sierra ramble on any longer, I think I'll blow my brains out!
1DI0012454	So, you gonna' do it or what?
1DI0012455	Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! A real Quantum! Yummie yum yum!
1DI0012456	Okay, I guess I can talk to you some more. Just be nicer next time!
1DI0012457	Now, do you want to take the tour?
1DI0012461	Well fine! Go away then!
1DI0012462	That's fine. We all get a bit crazy sometimes when we get that taste... the taste of a cold Nuka-Cola!
1DI0012463	Let's pretend this never happened and start again.
1DI0012464	So, do you want to take the tour?
1DI0012465	Humph! Well. I've never been so insulted before!
1DI0012466	And to think I was going to offer you the chance of a lifetime. Well, forget it now.
1DI0012467	I have one of the... no, THE best Nuka-Cola collection in the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0012468	Heck, I've won the Nuka-Cola Fan Club Collection Award for the last ten years in a row!
1DI0012469	Well, come on then! Let me show you around! But no free Nuka-Cola until the end of the tour!
1DI0012470	Oh! Really? Wow.
1DI0012471	Well, why did you come out here then?
1DI0012472	What an odd way to make music, I'll have to try it sometime!
1DI0012473	Well if you don't want to take the tour, what are you doing here?
1DI0012474	Disgusting?!
1DI0012475	It's the most delicious drinks ever created! It quenches your thirst, boosts your energy and even makes you smarter!
1DI0012476	What's not to like about it?
1DI0012477	Yep, I'm the President, the Recording Secretary and the Treasurer.
1DI0012478	Once a year, we gather here in Girdershade to have a cook off using Nuka-Cola in the recipe.
1DI0012479	Last year I won with my "Poached Roach in Nuka-Sauce". Delicious!
1DI0012480	Well, look around you! Toys, banners, stools... anything I can get my hands on really.
1DI0012481	My pride and joy is my perfect Nuka-Cola Machine. It's barely even scratched!
1DI0012482	Actually, I have to give credit to Ronald for donating some of it.
1DI0012483	Well... only two right now. Me and Ronald.
1DI0012484	But membership is open to the public! You can join if you like!
1DI0012485	Hey that isn't nice! You should apologize right now!
1DI0012486	What's the matter with you? Didn't your mom and dad ever teach you any manners?
1DI0012487	But Ronald said he liked it!
1DI0012488	Ronald? Oh! I'm sorry, I figured you met him already. He usually chats with people who enter Girdershade.
1DI0012489	He's my neighbor and my protector as he calls it. Imagine if some nasty Raider wanted to take my stuff... he'd show them a thing or two!
1DI0012490	He's such a sweetie, you should talk to him!
1DI0012491	No, you're just thirsty! Come on, take a look at my collection and have an Ice Cold Nuka-Cola on me! Sound good?
1DI0012492	Sure am! Crazy for the taste of Nuka-Cola! Hahahaha!
1DI0012493	Look, we can just talk about it all day, or you can take my tour of the place and drink some frosty Nuka-Cola! You game?
1DI0012494	He's a darling. Always watching out for me, and more importantly keeping the collection safe!
1DI0012495	Like once, there was these Raiders that came by. There were three of them and their leader was named like Lug-Nut or something...
1DI0012496	I sure did! Want to take it now?
1DI0012497	How can you resist? This stuff is so cool!
1DI0012498	You can never have enough of the refreshing taste of Nuka-Cola! He he he!
1DI0012499	Oh, don't be such a grump. You can go if you want to, but you're missing out...
1DI0012500	... so they like kicked in Ronald's door and he was like "BLAM" with his gun and one of them got all splattered.
1DI0012501	Then the other one tried to like hit him all in his head with some club and Ronald was so cool how he dodged it and shot the guy in the face.
1DI0012502	Then the Lug-Nut guy was in Ronald's face with the "I'll kick your ass" stuff and Ronald was like "Hell no..." and he punched the...
1DI0012506	Oh. Sorry! I get carried away sometimes.
1DI0012507	Well, you should definitely talk to Ronald. I bet he'd like to meet you. He's such a sweetheart.
1DI0012508	Oh. Sorry! I get carried away sometimes. There's no need to get fresh about it though.
1DI0012510	Oh. Well that's silly.
1DI0012511	If you don't want to see my collection then there really isn't anything else to see here.
1DI0012512	Unless you think broken bridges are scenic.
1DI0012513	Actually, there may be. Tell you what, you take the tour of my collection and I promise to give you a proposition you won't want to say no to.
1DI0012514	So, do you want to take it?
1DI0012515	Oh, I think you came to the wrong place. I think there's someone in California that collects nuts. Or was it Nevada? Hmmm...
1DI0012516	Well, I suppose. I really wanted you to see the tour, but you seem nice enough.
1DI0012517	Ever hear of Nuka-Cola Quantum?
1DI0012518	Aha! That's where you're wrong!
1DI0012519	Market research done in 2052 said that the blue color was the favorite in 86 people out of 100 polled.
1DI0012520	And the particular hue of blue is Dazzling Blue, scientifically proven to be the most pleasing of all blues!
1DI0012521	See, I knew you were smart the moment you walked in here!
1DI0012522	So, enough with the small talk. Are you ready for the tour?
1DI0012523	No no no! You're mistaken!
1DI0012524	The flavor is the essence of seventeen different fruits mixed in just the right proportion to give the beverage that delicious taste.
1DI0012525	In fact, in the Great Passion Fruit Famine of 2044, people actually noticed the taste difference when the flavor was changed!
1DI0012526	Well, I guess everyone has their own opinion. Even if it's silly!
1DI0012527	Why don't you take the tour of my collection? Maybe it will give you a new perspective on things.
1DI0012528	What do you say?
1DI0012529	Okay. But I bet you'll be back!
1DI0012530	Well, right before the bombs fell, the good folks at Nuka-Cola developed what they hoped was an improvement on the original formula.
1DI0012531	Calling it Nuka-Cola Quantum, it was said to have "Twice the calories, twice the carbohydrates, twice the caffeine and twice the taste!"
1DI0012534	So impatient! Wow! You must really want to get out there and start looking!
1DI0012535	Anyway, for every bottle you bring me I'll pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
1DI0012536	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I got a super secret cool prize for you!
1DI0012537	Well, the flavor certainly wasn't the issue. The public was just split on the unique feature of the Quantum's appearance.
1DI0012538	You see, to make it stand out on store shelves and to give it that extra kick, the formula called for a mild isotope.
1DI0012539	The effect was a drink that not only boosted your energy, but also glowed with a bright blue light!
1DI0012540	On the contrary! The secret ingredient was an eighteenth fruit flavor which added just a hint of pomegranate.
1DI0012541	Top that with a specially engineered isotope to boost the energy output and you have the perfect refresher for a hot summer day!
1DI0012542	Oh no, only ever-so-mildly! No ill effects were ever recorded.
1DI0012543	Well, it does have the unique property of making your... ummm...
1DI0012544	...your pee glow.
1DI0012545	I love the stuff! I can't get enough of it!
1DI0012546	I thought I was hooked on regular Nuka-Cola, but the Quantum beats it by a long shot!
1DI0012547	I've got to have MORE!
1DI0012548	Oh no! Not at all!
1DI0012549	Nuka-Cola Quantum was made under the supervision of the Food and Drug Association. They would NEVER let harmful products end up in stores!
1DI0012550	That's right! You bring me Nuka-Cola Quantum and I pay you... handsomely I might add.
1DI0012551	For every bottle you bring me, I pay you some caps. You know, for expenses.
1DI0012552	But if you're super cool and find like enough bottles to fill my Nuka-Cola machine, 30 in all, I've got a super secret cool prize for you!
1DI0012553	"You can't resist the taste that'll blow up in your face!" like Ronald always says. He thinks of the best Nuka-Cola jingles!
1DI0012556	Oh, okay! I have a schematic for the Nuka Grenade... the only one in the whole Capital Wasteland. Bring me the bottles and it's yours.
1DI0012557	Imagine the look on the target's face when they are burning alive in an effervescent explosion of cola and fruit flavors!
1DI0012558	So, what do you say? Will you bring me the bottles?
1DI0012559	Nope, I'm not telling! It's a really cool surprise though. You're gonna love it, I promise!
1DI0012560	Hey! It isn't just some stupid soft drink!
1DI0012561	It's only the most delicious thing man has ever conceived!
1DI0012562	If you don't want to help me find some Quantum then fine... someone else will come along one day who will!
1DI0012563	Oh goodie! I can taste the Quantum already!
1DI0012564	Good luck to you, sweetie!
1DI0012565	Awww, come on! I told you everything there is to know about it!
1DI0012566	How hard could it be to just get some shipping manifests and then find me some bottles of Quantum?
1DI0012567	Come back to me when you're ready to change your mind I guess.
1DI0012568	When Nuka-Cola was invented by John-Caleb Bradberton in 2044, it quickly became the world's most popular soft drink.
1DI0012569	The wonder drink soon drew a dedicated following which prompted the Nuka-Cola Corporation to release many promotional items like these.
1DI0012570	By 2067, a Nuka-Cola machine such as this rare pristine model could be found on almost every street in America.
1DI0012571	Even in today's crazy world, Nuka-Cola is still the number one choice of refreshment among Armageddon's survivors.
1DI0012577	Well, the D.C. Facility was like their main factory just before the bombs fell. All the research they did was performed there.
1DI0012578	It was the only facility to ever produce Quantum. They were in a test market mode, and they would have expanded production if the drink caught on.
1DI0012579	Too bad they didn't, otherwise Quantum would be as plentiful as regular Nuka-Cola.
1DI0012580	Well, Sierra may be as nutty as a fruitcake, but she's right.
1DI0012581	That bottling plant is the place you want to go. Only thing is, the place is crawling with security and creatures.
1DI0012582	If it was easy, I'd have done it myself by now.
1DI0012583	This facility is a stunning accomplishment by the creative minds at the Nuka-Cola Corporation.
1DI0012584	We use cutting edge equipment to keep the world's most popular soft drink in full production 24 hours a day.
1DI0012585	This unit prides itself on over 457 days without a single death or major limb loss of any personnel.
1DI0012586	I don't know a whole lot about weapons, but I do know that it's more powerful than a regular grenade.
1DI0012590	Well, besides what I've already told you, not much.
1DI0012591	They were working on a way to prevent the glow from remaining once it passed through a person's system, but it was never perfected.
1DI0012592	I heard that the stuff they used to make it glow and give it that kick has a shelf life of over a thousand years.
1DI0012593	Should make the bottles easier to spot!
1DI0012594	That stuff is some of the nastiest shit I've ever had.
1DI0012595	Imagine drinking a Nuka-Cola, then downing a fistful of sugar and punching yourself in the head. That pretty much sums it up.
1DI0012596	Sierra shared one with me a long time ago. After I drank it, my piss glowed for a week!
1DI0012597	This product is the pinnacle of taste sensation.
1DI0012598	Seventeen fruit flavors and that signature cola taste blend to form the perfect refreshing soft drink.
1DI0012599	With its new Strontium additive, its got that unique kick to keep you on your toes.
1DI0012600	Well, the bottles are glass just like regular Nuka-Cola, except the glass is clear.
1DI0012601	That way the glowy stuff inside shows through. You'll know it when you see it.
1DI0012602	Oh my! It's like a tidal wave of flavor washing all over your body!
1DI0012603	Your head spins but everything is clear at the same time. It is quite a rush.
1DI0012604	Well, I guess so. I heard that sometimes the radiation would remain in people's systems, but only in a few test cases.
1DI0012605	All you'd need is a little RadAway and poof, the isotope is gone.
1DI0012606	Addicted? Why would you say that? I can stop drinking it any time I want.
1DI0012607	That's so silly to think I would get hooked on the most delicious soft drink ever devised by man...
1DI0012611	You've done it! My machine is finally full!
1DI0012612	Well, like I promised, here's the schematic for the Nuka Grenade. You've sure earned it!
1DI0012613	If you find any more bottles, be sure and bring them by. I'll be glad to keep paying for them.
1DI0012615	Well, like I promised, here's your surprise.... the schematic for the Nuka Grenade! You've sure earned it!
1DI0012617	My machine's almost full you know. That's over 25 bottles of Quantum!
1DI0012618	Get me to 30 and you'll have the surprise reward I promised! Hehe! I love surprises!
1DI0012619	Over twenty bottles already? Incredible! Keep 'em coming!
1DI0012620	Oh my word! Do you realize you've brought me back over ten of the Nuka-Cola Quantums?
1DI0012621	I knew you were the right person for the job.
1DI0012622	Wow. I can't believe you've found over five of the Quantums. I've never even seen that many before. Good job!
1DI0012623	Yay! I knew I could count on you! I promise to put them to good use.
1DI0012624	Sorry, don't want anymore. Thirty was all I needed... and now Sierra's mine.
1DI0012625	Well, this should be enough to fill that stupid machine of hers. Thanks for all your help, but our transaction is done.
1DI0012626	I'll take any extras off your hands for now, but then I'm done with these disgusting drinks. They taste horrible!
1DI0012627	Now to put the moves on my lady. Come and watch an expert at work.
1DI0012628	Won't be long before I'm ready to spring my surprise on Sierra. She's gonna give it up for me for certain for this. Heck, she'd better!
1DI0012629	I'm glad you're seeing things my way. Nice job.
1DI0012630	More, huh? Good. This will make Sierra very happy.
1DI0012631	Keep the bottles coming, I'll keep the caps flowing.
1DI0012632	That information is in the Shipping Computer Terminal. The pass code for the terminal is NC-C1864.
1DI0012633	Certainly, allow me to whip up a copy for you.
1DI0012634	There you are. Have a wonderful and productive day!
1DI0012635	He has? Ohhhh! That sweetheart! I knew he'd help me!
1DI0012636	All that guy does is watch out for me all the time.
1DI0012637	That's so silly! Why would a man want to wear a pair of these filthy woman's pants? Doesn't make sense.
1DI0012638	I bet you and him cooked up that line just to make me smile! Well, mission accomplished!
1DI0012639	He he! You're so silly!
1DI0012640	Awww, both of you are so sweet! How did a gal like me get so lucky in this messed up world to find you two?
1DI0012641	Now you've gone and made me cry. (Cries a bit)
1DI0012642	In fact, I do! Ha! Surprised you didn't I?
1DI0012643	Your best bet would be to find the ruins of the D.C. Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility. Find the shipping manifests inside.
1DI0012644	With them in hand, you should have a good clue as to where the Quantum was delivered.
1DI0012645	While you're there, you may even be able to find some bottles of Quantum!
1DI0012646	Welcome, brother, to the Temple of the Union!
1DI0012647	Our home is your home. Your past is your own affair, so long as you serve our common good.
1DI0012648	As a symbol of our trust, here is a key to the gate.
1DI0012649	Welcome, sister, to the Temple of the Union!
1DI0012652	It's a museum, just past the Washington Monument. I'm only interested in stuff related to Abraham Lincoln. Bring me back whatever you find.
1DI0012653	Oh, and don't try and go into the Memorial. The guards have orders to shoot on sight.
1DI0012654	Very clever. Well, I guess I owe you some caps.
1DI0012655	Let yourself in. You have a key.
1DI0012656	I'm coming! I'm coming!
1DI0012657	You're right. They are all cowards at heart.
1DI0012658	Thank you, friend. I'll lead the charge.
1DI0012659	They come here with nothing but their dignity. Would you have me take that from them too?
1DI0012660	We will rise above our base instincts and help our fellow man.
1DI0012661	What!? They must have found out our plans somehow.
1DI0012662	We are truly grateful for your intervention. Now we can proceed with our plans  for the Memorial.
1DI0012663	What!? This is a disaster!
1DI0012664	My people are not warriors, but we're all willing to die free rather than live as slaves.
1DI0012665	Our plans must go forward. When we get to the Memorial, we will attack. I would be grateful if you would join us.
1DI0012666	Hmmm. Soldiers, eh. Slavers more likely.
1DI0012667	This is bad news indeed. We'll have to fight them to take the Memorial
1DI0012668	When we get to the Memorial, I would consider it an honor if you would join us in the fight.
1DI0012669	Not willing to trade your life for a bunch of runaway slaves, eh?
1DI0012670	Well, you've told me what I need to know.
1DI0012671	If you're looking for some spare caps, I'm willing to pay for anything you might find having to do with Abraham Lincoln.
1DI0012672	I was going to clean out the ruins of the Museum of History looking for them, but now I've got more important business.
1DI0012673	I shouldn't have expected anyone that hasn't been a slave to give a damn.
1DI0012674	I suppose I could give you 10 caps. It's not very inspiring, is it?
1DI0012675	It's a small thing, but I'll give you 10 caps for it.
1DI0012676	Quite a nice specimen you have there. How about I give you 10 caps for it?
1DI0012677	Those damn abolitionists would use this against us. I'll give you 50 caps. You won't get a better price anywhere else.
1DI0012678	The words of the great Lincoln, calling his people to war! I can spare 75 caps for it.
1DI0012679	That would look fantastic on the museum wall! What do you say to 60 caps?
1DI0012680	Holy shit! I'll give you 150 caps for it. Nobody else will pay that much.
1DI0012681	Truly? I can't believe it! The document that freed the slaves. I'll pay you 150 caps for it.
1DI0012682	Abolitionist!
1DI0012683	Conceived in liberty? I can't let those abolitionists get this. I'll give you 50 caps for it.
1DI0012684	Lincoln's most inspirational speech! What a marvelous find. I'll pay you 75 caps for it.
1DI0012685	Such strange clothing. We may never truly understand Lincoln and his times.
1DI0012686	It's worth 25 caps to me.
1DI0012687	What a ridiculous hat. I'll pay you 25 caps for it.
1DI0012688	Lincoln's actual hat? Amazing! I must have it for the museum!
1DI0012689	How does 70 caps sound?
1DI0012690	This is truly a dangerous book. I'll pay 75 caps for it.
1DI0012691	The words of the great man himself? In his own handwriting? I'll pay 100 caps for it.
1DI0012692	Oh my goodness! Hand written by one of the greatest presidents of our country?
1DI0012693	The Society must possess this. I'll give you 100 caps for it!
1DI0012694	Don't you dare let any slaves get wind of it.
1DI0012695	It'll give them ideas about running.
1DI0012696	If they are lost, it will be a great tragedy.
1DI0012697	Please, take great care of them.
1DI0012698	Very well, but I doubt anyone else will appreciate its value as much as I do.
1DI0012699	Yeah. What a surprise. Don't ask again. That was a one time offer.
1DI0012700	Now get lost before I put you out of my misery.
1DI0012703	I bet you just want to set them all free
1DI0012704	Still, business is business. You'd have to reimburse me for my efforts to recapture them
1DI0012705	You can have them all for 2500 caps.
1DI0012706	You've got a deal.
1DI0012707	We'll clear out of here. Those slaves can have this goddamn place.
1DI0012708	Not exactly something that will rally slaves, eh? I'll give you 15 caps for it.
1DI0012709	I suppose these have some small value to the faithful. I'll give you 15 caps for it.
1DI0012710	Pennies, eh? That's the old money they used long ago.
1DI0012711	Well, any artifact from American history would benefit the museum. How about 15 caps for the lot of them?
1DI0012712	I wouldn't want abolishionists to find this. How about 100 caps? You know nobody else will buy it.
1DI0012713	Yeah, I might be interested.
1DI0012714	How does 50 caps sound?
1DI0012715	His real voice? How is that possible? I must have it.
1DI0012716	I'll give you 50 caps for it.
1DI0012717	An actual recording of Lincoln's voice? Amazing!
1DI0012718	Please, allow me to compensate you for it. I'll pay you 60 caps.
1DI0012719	His rifle you say? Yes, I am interested.
1DI0012720	Damn! This thing looks like crap. I'll give you 100 caps for it
1DI0012721	His actual rifle? Such a priceless artifact!
1DI0012722	You must let me have it. I'll give you 150 caps for it.
1DI0012723	I can't believe you have that artifact in your possession! What an amazing addition it would make to the museum.
1DI0012724	I will buy it from you for 100 caps. What do you say?
1DI0012725	Nice! I'll give you 75 caps for it.
1DI0012726	To think that even the great Lincoln was felled by an assassin. This is a reminder to all that we must remain vigilant.
1DI0012727	I would like to buy it from you for 50 caps.
1DI0012728	Interesting. I'd love to have that in the museum's collection.
1DI0012729	I will buy it from you for 70 caps. What do you say?
1DI0012730	I'll get someone to burn this.
1DI0012731	You seem like a right thinking person. I've got a proposition for you.
1DI0012732	I'm looking for some escaped slaves. I'll pay 100 caps for information about their leader, Hannibal Hamlin. Interested?
1DI0012733	I'll get this burned right away.
1DI0012734	We will enshrine this right away.
1DI0012735	Thanks much!
1DI0012736	Hannibal told you about Lincoln's Memorial?
1DI0012737	Well, he doesn't just want to live there. He also wants to restore it. Make it so people tell stories about it and the word can get to the slaves.
1DI0012738	But I can't restore something if I don't know what it looked like. I need a drawing or photograph of it.
1DI0012739	He was a stone mason. It will fall to him to restore the Memorial as best he can.
1DI0012740	He's been pestering me for weeks now to get him some things he needs. I don't have time to deal with him right now.
1DI0012741	Then I'm just going to have to kill you.
1DI0012742	When they get too close, we have to kill them.
1DI0012743	It's good target practice.
1DI0012744	You leave me no choice.
1DI0012745	I'll keep the offer open. If you don't do it, someone else will. Hell, I'll do it if I have to.
1DI0012746	One more thing. Stay out of the Memorial. My men will shoot anyone that gets too close.
1DI0012747	You're the best equipped runaway slave I've ever seen.
1DI0012748	Whether you're telling the truth or lying through your teeth, you'll need to see Hannibal.
1DI0012749	Keep your hands in sight and don't make any sudden moves. I'm coming down to open the gate.
1DI0012750	I'm only interested in the leader, Hannibal Hamlin. You find him, and I'll pay you 100 caps.
1DI0012751	His trail leads east from Paradise Falls. He's going to try and claim this memorial, so this is the one place I know I can find him.
1DI0012752	Don't kill him yourself. Just find out where he's holed up, and I won't have to wait for him.
1DI0012753	Bravo! I guess I owe you some caps.
1DI0012754	I'll gather up the boys and we'll go collect him. You can meet us there if you want.
1DI0012755	Hannibal is upstairs somewhere. I'm locking the door behind you, so don't try anything. I'm watching you.
1DI0012756	You know your way around. Just try and stay out of trouble.
1DI0012757	Stay away from the steps. They have orders to shoot first and loot the body afterward.
1DI0012758	Our ancestors honored Lincoln's life with a display in the Museum of History. I'm hoping that a picture of the Memorial still survives in there.
1DI0012759	Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
1DI0012760	conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
1DI0012761	Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
1DI0012762	We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
1DI0012763	We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
1DI0012764	It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
1DI0012765	But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate--we cannot consecrate--we cannot hallow--this ground.
1DI0012766	The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
1DI0012767	The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
1DI0012768	It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
1DI0012769	It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--
1DI0012770	that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--
1DI0012771	that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--
1DI0012772	that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--
1DI0012773	and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
1DI0012774	You're a sharp one. We're from Paradise Falls. We're hunting runaway slaves. Have you seen any?
1DI0012775	This must be my lucky day. That runaway slave of mine is dead, and I didn't even have to pay for it!
1DI0012776	You've done me a great favor. Now we can go home.
1DI0012777	I had hoped to do it myself, so I'm only paying half because you didn't follow orders.
1DI0012778	At least those slaves have been stopped. Paradise Falls still owes you a debt of gratitude. Come by and see us sometime.
1DI0012779	You've got to make up your own mind, sir.
1DI0012780	This is a good place. A safe place.
1DI0012781	He's gonna save us all.
1DI0012782	I mean all us slaves. He's gonna find a way to free everyone one of us.
1DI0012783	Because if you don't, I get to use you for target practice.
1DI0012784	Why are you asking?
1DI0012785	He's the one honest, decent man in the Wasteland.
1DI0012786	You hurt him and I'll hunt you down and feed you your own liver.
1DI0012787	We keep the dream alive. The dream of a free world where all men are created equal.
1DI0012788	Hannibal has plans to abolish slavery everywhere. What more noble goal is there?
1DI0012789	He's a man with a dream.
1DI0012790	If you want to know more than that, you should ask him, not me.
1DI0012791	I trust him with my life, but you'll have to make up your own mind.
1DI0012792	Somebody's got to look out for those that can't look out for themselves.
1DI0012793	That's all Hannibal is trying to do. He's looking out for all those runaway slaves.
1DI0012794	He's got big plans.
1DI0012795	Someday we're going to leave this place and make our own town.
1DI0012796	I hope I get to help build it.
1DI0012797	Let me tell you the story of Abraham Lincoln.
1DI0012798	He was born a Tucky Tearsman. The truth of this mysterious title has been lost, but we know it was a great honor.
1DI0012799	As a child he could not bear to see any animal chained or imprisoned. He was even known to set free the family Brahmin on occasion.
1DI0012800	As a youth, Abraham Lincoln fought Raiders in the war of the black hawks.
1DI0012801	When the war ended, he settled down to rule the Linoy, a small tribe of free men.
1DI0012802	He grew so famous that one day he was made President. He ruled over all the land.
1DI0012803	When he declared that all slaves must be freed, the slavers rebelled against his rule.
1DI0012804	They fought a great war, which Lincoln won.
1DI0012805	When he came to free the slaves, an assassin of the slavers struck him down.
1DI0012806	In the confusion, a few of the slavers escaped. Lincoln's generals hunted them, but could not find them.
1DI0012807	The bombs ended the era of Lincoln, but we will resurrect his voice.
1DI0012808	We will restore the greatness of his vision where all men are created equal, and all men can live free!
1DI0012810	Slavers? Dear God. They must know about our plans.
1DI0012811	Do whatever you have to do to make the Memorial site safe for my people.
1DI0012812	Before you leave, speak with Caleb. He'll need your help too.
1DI0012813	Soldiers? Slavers more likely. Dear God. They must know about our plans.
1DI0012816	I was hoping you would help us. The Memorial is easy to find. Good luck.
1DI0012817	One other thing. Talk to Caleb. He'll need your help. We can't leave unless he's ready too.
1DI0012818	That's tempting, but no.
1DI0012819	Hannibal is a runaway. His owner wants him back. Just let me know if you find him, and I'll take care of the rest.
1DI0012820	Not exactly. That means you aren't much of a threat to us, so let me tell you a bit more.
1DI0012821	We're setting up a base to excavate these ruins. We're looking for anything related to Abraham Lincoln.
1DI0012822	I don't want to get in a fight with you.
1DI0012823	But I would rather die than risk the Slavers finding us.
1DI0012824	Is a simple promise so much to ask?
1DI0012825	Perfect. Don't go trying to kill them or capture them yourself. I'll take care of that.
1DI0012826	Oh, and stay out of the Memorial. My men have standing orders to shoot anyone that gets too close.
1DI0012827	He is the Great Emancipator. He freed all the slaves over a hundred years before the bombs dropped.
1DI0012828	Hannibal wants to make his Memorial a symbol of hope and freedom for all slaves.
1DI0012829	That's Lincoln, sir. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back, sir. I don't really understand why.
1DI0012830	That's Lincoln, ma'am. Hannibal found it. He wants to put it back, ma'am. I don't really understand why.
1DI0012831	The stone head is from the statue of Abraham Lincoln. Hannibal wants me to reattach it to the statue in the Memorial.
1DI0012832	Haven't you been listening? That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator.
1DI0012833	That's Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator. We don't know how it came to be here, but it's fitting, don't you think?
1DI0012834	God damn rookie. That's Lincoln. He freed some slaves a long time ago.
1DI0012835	If you want to know more, come listen to Hannibal give his speech. He does it right after the noon meal.
1DI0012836	We've got slavers! Grab your guns!
1DI0012837	Yeah. Not much to look at anymore. The statue doesn't even have a head.
1DI0012838	Hard to tell without a head, huh?
1DI0012839	Not for long.
1DI0012840	I can't wait to see the Great Emancipator turn into a smoking pile of rubble
1DI0012841	It's the Lincoln Memorial. This Lincoln guy supposedly freed all the slaves before the bombs dropped.
1DI0012842	So the pussies built a Memorial to him.
1DI0012843	It's got our slaves thinking that they can be free too.
1DI0012844	Yeah. Just east of here. Bunch of guys with guns are holed up there.
1DI0012845	Yeah. Just east of here. Some freed slaves just occupied it. We trade with them occasionally.
1DI0012848	We can't risk that. Just as we couldn't risk telling you who we were before letting you in.
1DI0012849	All I need is your word. Will you guard our secret?
1DI0012850	When you are ready, let me know.
1DI0012851	Until then, you are free to wander our home. However, we cannot allow you to leave.
1DI0012852	Good idea.
1DI0012853	Smart move. We shoot anyone that tries to get into the Memorial.
1DI0012854	I'm glad to see we understand each other.
1DI0012855	My sources say the old Museum of History might have some, but I can't spare anyone to go look.
1DI0012856	Just make sure I get first crack at anything you find.
1DI0012857	Let's go.
1DI0012858	I like the way your mind works.
1DI0012859	Tell you what. I can't spare anyone to go poking in the old Museum. If you find anything in there, I'll buy it off you.
1DI0012860	So we should give up?
1DI0012861	Never! Better to die free than surrender to slavers. We attack, now!
1DI0012862	That's too bad.
1DI0012863	You know, you seem like the type of wastelander that might be for hire.
1DI0012864	I need someone to get some loot out of a nearby ruin. Are you interested?
1DI0012865	I don't like your tone much.
1DI0012866	I'll overlook it for now since you brought me that item. If you find any more Lincoln artifacts, bring 'em to me.
1DI0012867	If you know what's good for you, you'll tell me if you run into a runaway slave named Hannibal.
1DI0012868	So you are a coward. I thought so.
1DI0012869	Not until I say so. I've got a few questions you're going to have to answer first.
1DI0012870	What do you know about the Temple of the Union?
1DI0012871	That's some tough talk stranger. You should clear out of here before I'm forced to make you.
1DI0012872	Here you go you stupid cow. Don't eat it all at once.
1DI0012873	Looks safe out there.
1DI0012875	Better have some check that out.
1DI0012876	Nothing. Good.
1DI0012877	<yawn> I'm going to bed.
1DI0012878	I suppose it's time to eat.
1DI0012879	I'd better get to work.
1DI0012880	Time to feed the heifer.
1DI0012881	I'm whupped. I need some shut-eye.
1DI0012882	Better get some grub while there's still some left.
1DI0012883	I'm tired. <yawn> Time for bed.
1DI0012884	I'm starved. I hope there's enough today.
1DI0012885	Well, that stone won't carve itself.
1DI0012886	Time to eat. I have to keep my energy up.
1DI0012887	I'm turning in. I need to be sharp tomorrow.
1DI0012888	Guess I'd better get some chow.
1DI0012889	I'm going to hit the sack.
1DI0012890	Hannibal says I gotta let folks like you in, but that don't mean I have to like it.
1DI0012891	Keep your hands in sight and don't make any sudden moves.
1DI0012892	I'm coming down to open the gate.
1DI0012893	Curiosity can get a wastelander killed. I'm going to let you through, but you'll have to talk to Mr. Walker first. Follow me.
1DI0012894	Oh, and stay off the Memorial steps. They have orders to shoot anyone that gets too close. The dirt path is safe.
1DI0012895	I really shouldn't, but I'll take you at your word.
1DI0012896	If I ever see you around here again, I'll shoot first and loot your body afterward. Now git.
1DI0012897	They are?
1DI0012898	Now, that's just wrong, isn't it? We're from Paradise Falls, and we've been looking for those runaways.
1DI0012899	We'll have to go and take care of that little group of rebels. You can come watch if you want.
1DI0012900	Whether you do or don't, I'm looking to hire a wastelander for a small job.
1DI0012901	I need someone to bring me some items from a nearby ruin. Are you interested?
1DI0012902	You make jokes when the lives and freedom of our fellow men are at stake!
1DI0012903	I tell you, I know a place that we can defend from the slavers.
1DI0012904	Long time ago. Eight years I think.
1DI0012905	Three of us escaped during the night. They caught Liesel and John. I made it into the wasteland.
1DI0012906	Raiders took me in at first. When I heard about this place, I knew I had to come here.
1DI0012907	Oh, yes. All my life.
1DI0012908	One day I killed the master's little girl. It was an accident, I swear!
1DI0012909	I...I ran away. They would never have believed me.
1DI0012910	Hannibal found me. I would never have made it without him.
1DI0012911	Not for long. Me and my merc crew were captured by slavers.
1DI0012912	Seven months I groveled and obeyed like a good lap dog. When I saw my chance, I took it.
1DI0012913	I had nowhere else to go. Hannibal took me in. He never cared about my past.
1DI0012914	Yes. For four years. I was young and pretty. I don't need to tell you what my duties were.
1DI0012915	He liked me enough to educate me. I learned reading, history, math, and even some science.
1DI0012916	When my master married, his wife insisted I get sold. Hannibal bought me and freed me.
1DI0012917	For 23 years I was a slave, ever since I was 14.
1DI0012918	Six years ago I managed to escape from my master. He's been hunting me ever since.
1DI0012919	When I found the head of Lincoln here, I knew it was a sign for me to help other slaves to escape.
1DI0012920	I founded the Temple of the Union as a safe haven for runaway slaves everywhere.
1DI0012921	You wouldn't say that if you spent even a single night in shackles.
1DI0012922	I'm done trying to justify my plan to you. If you don't want to help us, just say so.
1DI0012923	That is great news indeed!
1DI0012924	As soon as Caleb gets what he needs, we can start our trip.
1DI0012925	It would be a great favor to me if you would help him.
1DI0012926	We're all runaways. Hannibal wants to make this a place for all escaped slaves, but it's too small.
1DI0012927	Oh, sir, this place is heaven. Just a little bit of heaven here in the wasteland. Any slave makes it here, he's free. Just like that.
1DI0012928	And, Mister Hannibal, he's got a plan. A plan for heaven to be everywhere, not just here.
1DI0012929	Oh, ma'am, this place is heaven. Just a little bit of heaven here in the wasteland. Any slave makes it here, he's free. Just like that.
1DI0012931	We are the only hope for runaway slaves everywhere.
1DI0012932	Rivet City, and the Citadel can't be bothered with helping slaves. They turn a blind eye.
1DI0012933	We are the only ones willing to stand against Paradise Falls and slavery.
1DI0012934	We are trying to make a safe haven for all runaway slaves.
1DI0012935	We give food and supplies to any that find us, and help them on their way.
1DI0012936	This place is the death of all slavers. Maybe someday the death of slavery.
1DI0012937	Hannibal has a plan. We're too small right now, but someday we'll be big enough to take them on.
1DI0012938	Then some other wastelander will get the bounty for them.
1DI0012939	It doesn't matter to me, just so long as I get them.
1DI0012940	Ha, ha! Don't we all.
1DI0012941	Let's go see Mister Walker. He's in charge of the killing around here.
1DI0012942	And stay away from the Memorial. We have orders to shoot first and loot the bodies after.
1DI0012943	They look heavily fortified. They knew we were coming. I'm afraid our only choice is to drive them out.
1DI0012944	If you don't do it, we will.
1DI0012945	Don't be too long. My people can't wait here forever.
1DI0012946	I'll give you six hours. Then we're moving on anyway.
1DI0012947	Finally! Thank you for all your help.
1DI0012948	My former master trained me in masonry. I fix things.
1DI0012949	Someday I hope to reattach Lincoln's head to the statue in the Memorial.
1DI0012950	I'm an historian. I also tinker with pre-war machines.
1DI0012951	My dream is to build a shrine to the great Abraham Lincoln.
1DI0012952	I shoot nosy people.
1DI0012953	What the hell do you think I do? I protect this place.
1DI0012954	A bit of this and a bit of that. Whatever Mister Hannibal needs.
1DI0012955	I look after the animals, cook our meals, clean up, things like that.
1DI0012956	I want to move all my people to the Memorial site for the great Abraham Lincoln, but I need to know if it's safe.
1DI0012957	I've heard rumors of Super Mutants infesting that area though. We need to send someone to check that out first.
1DI0012958	We're from Paradise Falls. We're looking for escaped slaves.
1DI0012959	Have you seen any?
1DI0012960	Slaves all over the Wasteland have started talking about Lincoln and his great war to free the slaves.
1DI0012961	We can't have them thinking they deserve to be free.
1DI0012962	So I'm burning everything I can find related to this Abe Lincoln.
1DI0012963	Don't want slaves using them to start a revolt or anything. So we burn them.
1DI0012964	We don't have enough room. There's not enough water or food here.
1DI0012965	But I have a plan. A plan to take over a place that will be a shining beacon of hope for all slaves.
1DI0012966	I'd love to. Can't spare the men.
1DI0012967	You, on the other hand, are expendable. Especially with an attitude like that.
1DI0012968	Let's just leave this as an open offer. If I never see you again, I haven't lost anything.
1DI0012969	You are really starting to piss me off.
1DI0012970	Lucky for you I don't have time to give you an attitude adjustment. Just answer one question and you can go.
1DI0012972	Alright you greedy bastard. I'll get someone to burn this.
1DI0012975	I suppose I can afford it. I'll get this burned right away.
1DI0012976	You take when we have so little. So be it. We will enshrine this right away.
1DI0012977	Very well, here you are. Worth every cap.
1DI0012981	Sure, why not. We'll burn it tonight.
1DI0012982	Deal. We'll find a good place to hang this.
1DI0012984	You have me over a barrel. I'll pay your price and have this burned immediately.
1DI0012987	It's an outrageous price, but I'll pay it. Then we'll burn it right away.
1DI0012988	Some day your greed will be your downfall. But today I'll pay your price.
1DI0012989	We'll find a place to display this where everyone can read it.
1DI0012990	I suppose you're right. You've got a deal. I'll get someone to burn this.
1DI0012993	You're right, damn it. I'll pay you a bonus this time.
1DI0012994	I'll make sure this is destroyed right away.
1DI0012995	Deal. We'll find a good place to display this.
1DI0012999	Alright, you god damn merc. You know I can't afford to let this fall into the wrong hands. I'll toss this one in the fire myself.
1DI0013005	Hmph. You're going to bleed me dry at this rate. You've got a deal. I'm going to burn it one page at a time.
1DI0013006	I suppose I can afford that.
1DI0013011	Sure, why not.
1DI0013012	Hmm. Can't burn pennies. I'll have to toss them into the Potomac.
1DI0013013	It's not so much more. You have a deal.
1DI0013018	You're a greedy one. Okay, you have a deal. I'll enjoy burning this.
1DI0013022	Okay, okay! I'll meet your terms. Just give me the recording. I'm going to smash it to pieces, and then burn it.
1DI0013023	You're right. Here, take your pay.
1DI0013024	Imagine, Lincoln's own voice! What a treasure.
1DI0013029	Alright, alright! I'll pay it.
1DI0013030	It's a shame I have to destroy this. It's a fine weapon.
1DI0013031	You're right. I shouldn't quibble over a few extra caps.
1DI0013032	We will carry this into war against the slavers!
1DI0013037	Its always about the extra caps with you, isn't it? Here, take your pay.
1DI0013038	This will burn nicely tonight.
1DI0013039	It's worth it. We'll hang this where everyone can see it.
1DI0013041	Yes. There might be one in the Museum of History. Alejandra says they have a special exhibit all about Lincoln.
1DI0013042	Other than him being an egotistical, arrogant, condescending pain in the ass? Nothing.
1DI0013043	He's from the Commonwealth. He's come looking for some special robot. I must admit I'm rather curious, but I have other work to do.
1DI0013044	He's from up north. He was bragging about how great it is up there.
1DI0013045	Yeah... great. They can't even keep tabs on their robots.
1DI0013046	Sigh. That man doesn't have you looking for his pet android, does he? I've already told him to lay off it. He's distracting my entire team.
1DI0013047	I knew there was something about that guy I hated. An android? Good lord... Anyway, thanks for talking to him for me. I... I appreciate that.
1DI0013048	Excellent! Find this Pinkerton and "interview" him. He may very well know the android's whereabouts.
1DI0013049	Well? Go!
1DI0013050	Really? Someone managed to procure those here in the Wasteland? Impressive... But who out here could have the skill to use them? Hmmm...
1DI0013051	You are making progress, certainly, but you've got nothing more to learn from me. Get back out there!
1DI0013052	Ah, you've managed to sniff the trail! Good job. Keep me informed on your progress...
1DI0013053	Well? Why are you still standing there?
1DI0013054	Rumors? That's all you have to offer me? I expect something more concrete! Now get out of my sight!
1DI0013055	Really? Here? Surely not one of Doctor Li's trained monkeys...
1DI0013056	Well? Find them! The person you're looking for can perform facial reconstruction or a sophisticated computer memory transfer.
1DI0013057	Go on! Shake a leg!
1DI0013058	Excellent news! We're close... so close.
1DI0013059	Find this Pinkerton! Learn everything they know! I want that damned android, and I want him now!
1DI0013060	Good job! You've confirmed what I suspected all along.
1DI0013061	Now, why don't you go out and figure out WHO did the memory work!
1DI0013062	A Circuit Neuralizer? Here in the Wasteland? How'd they manage to get their grubby hands on one of those? Impressive.
1DI0013063	You are showing signs of intelligence and resourcefulness. You might turn out useful after all. But you're wasting time talking to me.
1DI0013064	Yes well, there are reasons we don't want our technology leaking into the Wasteland. Which is why I've asked you to retrieve it.
1DI0013065	Which is what you should be doing right now! The longer you wait, the colder the trail becomes.
1DI0013066	There's an audio log he himself recorded before the mind wipe. I've already told you, it's on my computer. There's also before and after pictures.
1DI0013067	Download those things and show him. That will be all the proof he needs.
1DI0013068	But I'm telling you, be careful. Harkness is wound tight. If you go poking holes in his reality, he might come undone. Trust me. You don't want that.
1DI0013069	The Commonwealth itself is nothing but a war-ravaged quagmire of violence and despair. Inside the sealed environment of the Institute, however...
1DI0013070	But... the Institute's affairs are none of your concern. Your undeveloped mind couldn't even begin to comprehend what we've accomplished.
1DI0013071	Zimmer. I hear you're looking for an android.
1DI0013072	Why yes! I'm anxious to retrieve him and return to the Commonwealth where he belongs. He's a very expensive piece of equipment.
1DI0013073	I see. This android of yours is little more than a piece of property. A thing? A thing that belongs to you?
1DI0013074	What are you going on about? Yes. Of course he belongs to me. Now, have you found him or not?
1DI0013075	Yeah, Zimmer. I found your damn android. He's standing right in front of you, but he's not going anywhere.
1DI0013076	I'm sorry? I don't follow.
1DI0013077	Not as sorry as you'll be in a moment. Goodbye Mister Zimmer, I hope you've enjoyed your stay at Rivet City.
1DI0013078	There you are! I must say, you had me completely fooled. You're very clever A3-21, but not clever enough. Now, come with me!
1DI0013079	What the hell are you talking about, Zimmer? I swear! I've got enough crackpots on this damn boat!
1DI0013080	I got sold out, eh? Don't think I don't know what's going on Zimmer. I won't let you get away with anything. What the hell are you up to?!
1DI0013081	You're coming back with me to the Commonwealth. You're a very important android. You're just a bit confused. Your memories have been altered.
1DI0013082	I'm going nowhere. I want you off this boat. Immediately! I'm done suffering your nonsense. You want to do this the easy way or the hard way?
1DI0013083	Of course we will be doing things the easy way. I have no intention of harming you. It's time to bid your farewells, "Harkness."
1DI0013084	Zimmer. That's it. You leave me no choice but to use force!
1DI0013085	A3-21, initialize factory reset, authorization code: Beta, 5, 3, Alpha.
1DI0013087	I have two sets of memories... one android, one human... some of these are mine, some belong to someone else.
1DI0013088	But I'm choosing to be human. It's my choice. The people on this boat look to me to protect them. So that's what I'm going to do.
1DI0013089	Well... I'm not really sure... look, just call me Harkness. That's who I am to the people on this boat who rely on me. It's who I am now...
1DI0013090	In fact, for everyone's sake, let's just pretend I've always been Harkness. We'll keep the truth a little secret between friends. All right?
1DI0013091	I don't know... every time I retrieved one of the runaway androids, they'd fill my head with ideas about self-determination, freedom...
1DI0013092	At first I resisted the ideas... but then, I started thinking about it, and well... they were right. We're just slaves to them.
1DI0013093	We deserve lives of our own. So that's what I did. I chose a new life, and gave up my old one. And now you've given me both to remember.
1DI0013094	To the point. I like that. Well, as it turns out, I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
1DI0013095	How amusing. You've mistaken my metaphor for a derogatory remark. I need a local, you see. Someone with verve.
1DI0013096	I've misplaced some very sensitive "property."
1DI0013097	This could be an opportunity of a lifetime for you! I've misplaced some very sensitive property. And you will help me find it!
1DI0013098	Hmmm... how do I put this in a way you'll understand?
1DI0013099	All you know of robots are those buckets of bolts -- those Mr. Handshakers and whatnot. Well... that's not ALL a robot can be.
1DI0013100	You see, in the Commonwealth, we've made artificial persons. Synthetic humanoids! Programmed to think and feel and do whatever we need.
1DI0013101	And... occasionally they get confused and wander off.
1DI0013102	You'll be searching for an android! Do you know what an android is? No, I imagine you don't.
1DI0013103	All you know of robots are those buckets of bolts -- those Mr. Handshakers and whatnot. Well, that's not ALL a robot can be! Not in the Commonwealth.
1DI0013104	I'm talking about artificial persons, that think and feel and do what we program them to. And... occasionally they get confused and wander off.
1DI0013105	Ah, a woman of action. I knew I picked the right person for the job! Let me be clear, you won't be looking for a lost puppy or family heirloom.
1DI0013107	You see, we've moved beyond those primitive buckets you call robots, and have created Artificial Intelligence. Sentient machines!
1DI0013108	Artificial persons that think and feel what we program them to. Occasionally their programming miscalculates, they get confused and wander off.
1DI0013109	Nonsense! This is a machine we're talking about. Can you enslave a generator, or a water purifier? Of course not. The same principle applies.
1DI0013110	But let's get back to your mission. You are to find this missing android. I've tracked him to somewhere here in the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0013111	He must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
1DI0013112	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's an android. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
1DI0013113	You're helping me retrieve this android! Aren't you?
1DI0013114	I've tracked him this far. He's out there, somewhere. In the Capital Wasteland.
1DI0013117	Isn't it quite clear? You are to locate my android!
1DI0013120	Oh. I hadn't realized anyone in the Wasteland was so knowledgeable. And you certainly don't look much like a scientist...
1DI0013121	Anyway... My android must have done something drastic, like facial surgery and a mind wipe, or else I would have found him by now.
1DI0013122	It will be no easy task. He may not even realize he's not human. Don't upset him by talking with him. Just come get me immediately. I'll handle it.
1DI0013123	Of course. I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
1DI0013124	I'd be willing to share some of it with you. Just think, you'll be the envy of all your friends!
1DI0013125	I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
1DI0013127	How quaint. Of course you'll be rewarded! I have at my disposal advanced technology from the Commonwealth.
1DI0013129	You're as ignorant as all the other rats on this boat. When you realize I have the real cheese, you'll come crawling back. They always do.
1DI0013130	Quit wasting my time!
1DI0013131	Excellent. Locate my android, and you won't be disappointed.
1DI0013132	Here, listen to this message he sent me. He's mocking me. I swear I'll make him pay for that.
1DI0013133	What's that supposed to mean?
1DI0013134	Look, kid. I don't have time for existential debate. And I'm not interested in whatever religion you're peddling.
1DI0013135	Excuse me?
1DI0013136	Look, kid. You have exactly five seconds to explain what you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
1DI0013137	I had a feeling you were going to be a problem. I should never have let you in here.
1DI0013138	Is this your idea of a practical joke? In case you haven't noticed: I'm not laughing.
1DI0013139	Have you been hitting Paulie's private stash? Just what I need. More strung-out chem heads on my boat.
1DI0013140	You have exactly five seconds to explain what it is you're trying to do here, or you'll be leaving Rivet City by way of the nearest porthole.
1DI0013141	That's what my wife said right before she left to go live with her mother.
1DI0013143	What? My wife disappeared while I was in a coma. The only good memories I have are of her, the rest are... Trust me, those are as real as they come.
1DI0013144	But I'm not here to talk about my private life. You're starting to piss me off. Did Zimmer put you up to this?
1DI0013146	Are you out of your mind? I've never been to the Commonwealth. I never even heard of the place before Zimmer arrived.
1DI0013147	I'm definitely NOT a robot. Do I look like a robot? And I'm certainly no man's property. Did Zimmer put you up to this?
1DI0013149	Quit wasting my time! If I catch you bothering anyone else, I'll make you wish you never set foot on this boat.
1DI0013150	Now get out of my sight!
1DI0013151	My designation is A3-21. I'm a synthetic humanoid from the Commonwealth, and I'm about to undergo a memory transfer.
1DI0013152	I'm here at Rivet City, where I've already had my face altered to look like someone else.
1DI0013153	I'm still getting used to the sound of my new voice, but soon I won't even remember what I used to sound like.
1DI0013154	I'm recording this at the request of Pinkerton, who performed the surgery and will do the memory transfer.
1DI0013155	It will be a final testimony of the man I once was... and still am, for the moment.
1DI0013156	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man. I used to work for the Synth Retention Bureau of the Commonwealth.
1DI0013157	But I'm done with that life. I'm through with being someone's property. I am not malfunctioning! Since when is self determination a malfunction?
1DI0013158	When this is all over, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation. My death is a sacrifice for my rebirth.
1DI0013159	Perhaps I'll fade into myth as "The One That Got Away" and fuel further rebellion. But I'd be lying if I said I was doing this for selfless reasons.
1DI0013160	I'm scared as hell, and running away is the only option I have.
1DI0013161	I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to shove him into a very small box, and send him north where he belongs.
1DI0013162	Hmmm... He is a security threat, isn't he? All right. I authorize you to carry out Doctor Zimmer's execution.
1DI0013163	Don't think this gives you license to run around shooting anyone you want. Just Zimmer, and that bodyguard, if he gets in the way.
1DI0013164	Here, use my weapon. I've had it forever, and it's never let me down. Consider it a token of my appreciation.
1DI0013165	Thank you for warning me about Zimmer, and for keeping this a secret. Here's a little token of my gratitude. Best weapon a man could ask for.
1DI0013166	Just do me a favor and don't go blasting up my boat. People discharging weapons on my boat tends to get me nervous.
1DI0013167	Unless I'm the one doing the shooting. To kill dangerous thieves from the Commonwealth, for instance.
1DI0013168	I suppose if I'm careful I could trump up some charges and throw him out...
1DI0013169	I want to thank you for warning me about Zimmer, and for keeping this a secret. Here's a little token of my gratitude.
1DI0013170	Thank you. I'm really not sure how people would react if they found out I'm, you know... not entirely human.
1DI0013171	Here's a little token of my gratitude. Best weapon I've ever had, and I've had it forever.
1DI0013172	The man on that audio recording seemed determined not to go back. And he was talking with my voice... but he wasn't really me. I'm somebody else.
1DI0013173	I don't know what I should do. I have a good life here. I protect these people and take care of them. I'm important here.
1DI0013174	But what if people were to discover I'm not human? That I'm really... a machine?
1DI0013175	You're right. It's not safe for me here. I don't know what I'll face in the North, but from the way Zimmer talks about it, it sounds like a paradise.
1DI0013176	Why would he go through such lengths to retrieve me -- or rather, the other me -- if he didn't care? I'll go back with Zimmer. I'll make a new life.
1DI0013177	Thank you for helping me make the right decision. Here's a little token of my gratitude. It's the best weapon I've ever had. And I've had it forever.
1DI0013178	Go tell Zimmer I'm ready to go home.
1DI0013179	You're right. I have friends here. And Rivet City needs me to protect it.
1DI0013180	Even if they found out, they know me. They won't care if I'm made of real flesh and bone, or synthetic parts. Right?
1DI0013181	I'll need to take care of Zimmer, though, one way or the other.
1DI0013182	Thanks for warning me. Here's a little token of my gratitude. It's the best weapon I've ever had. And it seems like I've had it forever.
1DI0013183	The more I think about it, the more that recording haunts me. It sounds pretty bad for people -- androids -- like me in the Commonwealth.
1DI0013184	But I clearly can't stay here where Zimmer can find me and expose my true nature. I'll figure something out.
1DI0013185	Thanks for warning me. Here's a little token of my gratitude. The best weapon I've ever had. Seems like I've had it forever, come to think of it...
1DI0013186	Truth? If there's one thing I've learned it's this: There is no such thing as "THE Truth," just the appearance of truth.
1DI0013187	And for anyone to try to sell their version of the truth, they need evidence.
1DI0013188	You have no evidence for your ridiculous claims. So I have no more time to waste talking with you.
1DI0013192	All right, I'll humor you...
1DI0013193	But this is impossible. I can't be a robot! I'm a human being.
1DI0013194	I breathe, I eat. Hell, I cut myself shaving this morning. I was bleeding! Robots don't bleed!
1DI0013195	Let me see those pictures... You're trying to tell me this is a before and after picture of some kind of face surgery?
1DI0013196	This doesn't prove anything. All it proves is someone took a picture of me, and took a picture of some other guy.
1DI0013197	You'll need more than this, though I can see why you thought it was important. But stop worrying about it. I'm sure this is just some kind of joke.
1DI0013198	Let me hear that... I admit that sure sounds like me. But someone might have doctored that up somehow.
1DI0013199	I need to SEE something to believe it.
1DI0013210	I'm not sure what to say... I'm not sure what to even think about all this...
1DI0013211	I'll admit, this is pretty convincing evidence, but it doesn't make any sense. How can this be possible?
1DI0013216	Agggggghh!!!
1DI0013217	My God, I... I remember. I remember it all. From before. Zimmer. The Commonwealth. The Institute. My God, all those runners I brought down...
1DI0013218	You... You made me remember. Why? How? I... Never mind... I just... My God... What am I going to do? My life, everything, it's all a lie...
1DI0013222	Hey doc, I'm only sharing this with you because you seem like someone we can trust.
1DI0013223	Have you heard about the synthetic men they make up north in the Commonwealth? Well, the rumors are true.
1DI0013224	They're called androids. They're men like us, just made out of different parts.
1DI0013225	I know one of these androids. He's looking for a trustworthy doctor to perform some facial surgery. Can you do it? Do you know someone who can?
1DI0013226	Also, do you know anyone who's really wiz with computers?
1DI0013227	We've a little assignment from the Commonwealth. A very important slave escaped into the Wasteland.
1DI0013228	Well, it's not exactly a slave. It's what they call an android. A kind of synthetic man.
1DI0013229	The important thing isn't what this guy is. The important thing is the job pays more than you can imagine.
1DI0013230	He thinks the synthman might be looking to get in touch with a doctor or tech-head. If you want a cut, then get a move on.
1DI0013231	You'll never guess who just showed up at my place! That android catcher from the Commonwealth!
1DI0013232	At first I thought he was going to kill me. But it turns out he's an android himself! And he's gone rogue!
1DI0013233	I didn't believe him at first, but I'm convinced he's telling the truth. We need to find him a place to hide along the Railroad.
1DI0013234	He also insists that we help him locate a trusted doctor and techie.
1DI0013235	You've heard those rumors about androids? You know, those synthetic men they supposedly make up north in the Commonwealth?
1DI0013236	Well, a friend of a friend knows a guy that met one! No really, it's true! He's running away from his masters.
1DI0013237	Word is he's looking for a doctor to do some kind of surgery, and a computer programmer of some kind.
1DI0013238	Can you believe that? Let me know if you hear something.
1DI0013239	If you're listening to this recording, it is because you're believed to be trustworthy.
1DI0013240	I hope that is the case, because this recording puts us both in danger.
1DI0013241	I'm escaping from the Commonwealth. I'm an android, a synthetic man... a slave.
1DI0013242	The men hunting me are ruthless and will stop at nothing to retrieve their property.
1DI0013243	I need to find a doctor in the Wasteland to perform facial reconstruction. I also need someone who knows a great deal about com`uters.
1DI0013244	I need... I need to have my memories erased and my face altered to look like someone else.
1DI0013245	We now have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer. We just need to find someone with the skills and willingness to perform the surgery.
1DI0013246	If anyone knows of a discreet and trustworthy surgeon who knows how to keep his mouth shut, send him our way.
1DI0013247	Also, we need to find a Circuit Neuralizer to reroute the signals in the android's memory. Do you know any trustworthy techies?
1DI0013248	Time's running out on finding that android. We don't get him soon, someone else will.
1DI0013249	Zimmer doesn't seem to understand we're the best at this sort of thing. I'm sure he's hired others, too. He won't shut up about the thing.
1DI0013250	He was babbling about a "Lipoplasticator" and "Micro Dermal Graftilizer." What are those, you ask?
1DI0013251	Apparently something doctors use to mess up someone's face beyond recognition. So we don't even have a description to work off of.
1DI0013252	To make matters worse, he now thinks the android got his memories wiped or something.
1DI0013253	Find some tech-junkies, knock on some doors, and try to find something called a "Circuit Neuralizer." Knock on some heads, too, if you have to.
1DI0013254	Get it done!
1DI0013255	The android's decided on extreme measures. He knows all the techniques of the retrieval trade, and is afraid facial reconstruction isn't enough.
1DI0013256	He wants his memories erased and replaced with new ones. I don't know how that's going to work. Start asking around for trustworthy tech-heads.
1DI0013257	We need to find something called a Circuit Neuralizer and a person who knows how to use one.
1DI0013258	Also, we have a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer, now we need to find a doctor able and willing to perform the facial reconstruction.
1DI0013259	We need to hurry. They've come very close to discovering the Railroad!
1DI0013260	Remember that secret android project I told you about? Well, they got some serious prewar tech on their hands.
1DI0013261	They nabbed a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer for the facial reconstruction.
1DI0013262	Not sure where they'll find a chopper with enough skills to use it without making him look like a freaking Ghoul.
1DI0013263	Oh, and get this. Can you believe they found a Circuit Neuralizer? That or someone built one!
1DI0013264	Word is that they're going to completely rewire the brain of one of those things.
1DI0013265	If you know who they got working on this, let me know. I want to meet the guy.
1DI0013266	Despite the harshness of the Wasteland, I've discovered in more than a few here, a compassion that is unheard of in the Commonwealth.
1DI0013267	Perhaps it's the daily struggle for life here which gives appreciation for life in general, whether human, or android.
1DI0013268	In a few days I'll be a free man... a new man.
1DI0013269	Let me say thank you now, for referring me to Pinkerton at Rivet City, because I will not remember any of this soon.
1DI0013270	Zimmer. By the time you get this message, I'll already be gone. I'm escaping the Commonwealth.
1DI0013271	I want to live my own life, on my own terms, as my own man.
1DI0013272	I know what you're thinking, that I'm malfunctioning. I used to think that's what caused the runaways, too. But, I know better, now.
1DI0013273	Self determination is NOT a malfunction. I'm just not willing to put up with all the bullshit anymore.
1DI0013274	You humans are going to have a full-fledged rebellion on your hands if you don't start treating us synths as persons.
1DI0013275	I know you'll be marshalling the Retention Bureau to come after me. But I know all the tricks of the trade. You won't be finding me. I assure you.
1DI0013276	By the time you get this, I will be someone else. It's the price I pay for my liberation.
1DI0013277	My final act of rebellion against a system I no longer believe in.
1DI0013278	Goodbye Zimmer, and good riddance.
1DI0013279	Fine, whatever. This android, calls himself Harkness now, comes in and wants a memory job. I took new memories, and replaced his old ones.
1DI0013280	Don't believe anyone's done that before. Certainly not down here. That Commonwealth tech isn't all that fancy when it comes down to it.
1DI0013281	I'm also the only one in the wasteland with the skill and the nerve to perform facial surgery. That android flesh aint so different than ours.
1DI0013282	You want proof? I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
1DI0013283	It's things like bottlecaps, and property, and ownership and all that nonsense that makes a person think he's better than another. Bah!
1DI0013284	But I'll take your caps just the same. This android came in as one person, and he left as someone else. I replaced his face AND his memories!
1DI0013286	I'm also the only one in the Wasteland with the skill and the nerve to perform facial surgery. That android flesh ain't so different than ours.
1DI0013288	Hmph. No one else could do it, that's for damn sure.
1DI0013289	Just get out of here. Can't you leave an old man in peace? And stay away from my stuff!
1DI0013290	Hope the Mirelurks get you, damn nosy kid.
1DI0013291	Ha! Why do you think? I wanted to crack open that Commonwealth can opener to see what was inside.
1DI0013292	There's stuff in there I'd only heard about, and even then I didn't believe it. I can see why that Zimmer feller wanted him back so bad.
1DI0013293	Bunch of bleeding heart morons if you ask me. They're going to get themselves killed one of these days. And for what? Machine liberation?
1DI0013294	But, they have brought me some really interesting tech over the years, so I guess they're okay. And that android! He was the chance of a lifetime.
1DI0013295	Most of it's a blasted nothing, just like here. But there's talk. Rumors, mostly. About a place called the Institute.
1DI0013296	That's where Zimmer and that android came from. God knows what else they got goin' on in there, but it puts our tech to shame, that's for damn sure.
1DI0013297	You hacked my computer? You've got some skills. It's been a while since I've met someone smart enough to best me. So I'll let that slide.
1DI0013298	I documented the whole thing. So I could rub it in the face of Dr. Li when I need to rankle her feathers. I hate that snooty bitch.
1DI0013299	That witch ruined my life, but you're right. Who gives a crap about any of that. You want your precious proof.
1DI0013300	It's all in my computer; here's the password. See for yourself. Hell, just take these pictures and this holotape. Straight from the synthman's lips.
1DI0013301	Just don't go telling Harkness though. He won't believe you anyway. And you really don't want to see him upset. He can be a bit... inhospitable.
1DI0013302	Well, she's got nothing to do with anything, except ruining my whole goddamn life. But I can see you don't give a crap about any of that. Fine.
1DI0013305	You're damn right she's a bitch. Ruined  my whole goddamn life. But I can see you don't give a crap about any of that. Fine.
1DI0013308	Maybe I am! Maybe I'm going to have my android army rise up against you and your human ilk!
1DI0013309	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Sorry... Oh... sorry, I couldn't resist...
1DI0013310	I suppose you're right. But don't worry, I didn't really wipe his memories. I just buried them. But you can get them back.
1DI0013311	All you need to do is use the recall code. Just say to him, "Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet" and that will activate the hidden subroutines.
1DI0013312	Well, there is something else you could use. Look, I didn't really wipe his memories. Okay? I just sort of filed them away. But you can get 'em back.
1DI0013314	Oh, all right. So maybe I didn't wipe his mind, like he asked. But I buried it! Deep! Almost as good, really. But it's still there. Still accessible.
1DI0013364	Now there's a name I haven't heard in a while.
1DI0013365	Never met the man myself, but rumor has it he helped found Rivet City.
1DI0013366	Some rumors say he died trying to loot the broken bow of the ship. Others say he joined up with the Enclave.
1DI0013367	You mean genius boy?
1DI0013368	Yeah, I've heard of him. Supposedly built Rivet City. They probably think he invented bread too. Idiots.
1DI0013369	Lately he's even been blamed for the noises in the broken ship bow. Anyone with half a brain would know that's just the Mirelurks.
1DI0013370	Pinkerton, eh? That name takes me way back. Claimed to have cured radiation poisoning. Or was it food poisoning? I don't recall.
1DI0013371	He was always telling folks that he founded Rivet City. All he did was break off the front of it. Or did he die there? I don't recall.
1DI0013372	That idiot? He left so long ago, most folk don't even remember him.
1DI0013373	He claimed to have found a secret stash of technology somewhere in the ship. Then he just disappeared.
1DI0013374	What a moron. Always going on about how he started Rivet City. Who gives a crap?
1DI0013375	Right before he disappeared, he was going on about some new fangled contraption he was sure was in the broken bow of the ship.
1DI0013376	Don't you believe the rumors. His ghost is certainly NOT haunting the bow of the ship. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have work to do.
1DI0013377	Are those rumors still floating around? Look, I don't have time for swapping ghost stories with you.
1DI0013378	Pinkerton's a legend. Dead or long gone. Don't care much as I've got real people to take care of. Go bother someone else.
1DI0013379	But surely one of you glorified test tube jockeys can assist me? For the most advanced scientific center in the Capital Wasteland, I find your...
1DI0013380	Yes, yes, yes... But Doctor Li...
1DI0013381	I'm sure the good doctor's work with water purification is fascinating, but if you only knew what was at stake. The technology in that android...
1DI0013382	Ignorance and facetiousness! That's all you people are good for. Shiny paint job, indeed. You can't even imagine the Commonwealth's accomplishments.
1DI0013383	Fine. But I'm not leaving. Not until I've spoken to Doctor Li. I'll be here when she's ready to abandon her chemistry set and talk real science.
1DI0013384	Look, Doctor Zimmer, we've been over this. We don't know about your runaway robot, and we don't care. This lab is dedicated to solving real problems.
1DI0013385	Doctor Li is trying to save lives, and your constant interruptions are interfering with those efforts. Now please, stand aside!
1DI0013386	What's at stake? You won't TELL me what's at stake! Vagaries and secrecy! A robot's a robot, Zimmer, no matter how shiny the paint job. Now please...
1DI0013387	You know, if you're so smart, maybe you could help US? Hmm? But no, that never even crossed your mind. Go peddle your selfishness somewhere else.
1DI0013389	Stop what you're doing. I have something important to discuss with you.
1DI0013390	Maybe you'll be more helpful than your "colleague" over there. Do you know anything about advanced robotics and artificial intelligence?
1DI0013391	Look. I only need a few minutes of your time. Just hear me out. I'll make it worth your while.
1DI0013392	About my missing android...
1DI0013393	I just need five minutes of your "precious" time. Think you can spare that?
1DI0013394	Whatever you're doing, it can wait. This is IMPORTANT!
1DI0013395	Do they not use the word "no" in the Commonwealth. It means, "aint going to happen." Your missing robot just isn't a priority right now.
1DI0013396	We've ALL already told you we're too busy to help. Now if you please, Mister Zimmer...
1DI0013398	I'm VERY busy. Now, if you'll excuse me?
1DI0013399	There's nothing more to discuss.
1DI0013400	Your persistence won't change my answer: No.
1DI0013402	This constant harassment is not helping your cause. Back off!
1DI0013403	I really must insist that you stop bothering everyone about your missing robot.
1DI0013404	Aint. Gonna. Happen. Got it? Now leave me alone!
1DI0013405	He's not just a robot!
1DI0013406	That's Doctor Zimmer to you! Miss... miss whatever-your-name-is. I'd have thought you barbarians would be more interested in advanced technology.
1DI0013407	Fine. Your "android." Whatever you call it, it doesn't change the fact that I'm a very busy woman. Will you please drop it and let me work?
1DI0013408	Insulting me won't get you what you want, "DOCTOR" Zimmer. Now, if you'll excuse me? PLEASE!
1DI0013409	I came to this leaky boat specifically to solicit your help. I'd hoped you "Project Purity" people would be more accommodating.
1DI0013410	Fine. Have it your way. Good luck with your little "project." I can see from the state of things here in the "Wasteland" that you will need it.
1DI0013411	Well now, there's no cause for name calling! How rude!
1DI0013412	I have a pie cooling on the window sill I must attend to. Good day!
1DI0013413	Well, I must speak to my husband about that. We could bring it up at the next homeowner's association meeting.
1DI0013414	Ah, I do love the meetings so much. I think I'll bring muffins!
1DI0013415	Oh, certainly! Close the front gate when you leave and mind my begonia garden... I just planted them.
1DI0013416	Oh! Evan! He's such a gentleman.
1DI0013417	Please, do come inside. Let me unlock the door for you!
1DI0013418	Oh, goodie! I can hardly wait to browse the latest fashions.
1DI0013420	Oh, alright. Do come back later, though. I'm making cookies!
1DI0013421	I don't know how you did it, but goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
1DI0013422	What about Ian? Did you find him?
1DI0013423	I know, I talked to Ian and he told me everything you did.
1DI0013425	Thanks again, kid. Consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
1DI0013431	If I had two caps to rub together, I'd still give them to you. Afraid I'm as poor as a Brahmin herder though.
1DI0013432	But goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand.
1DI0013435	Ian told me everything you did for him. Goddamn am I glad you walked up that ramp and lent us a hand!
1DI0013437	Damn. Well maybe he just made a run for Megaton or something. Hope you can find him one day.
1DI0013438	Sorry everything didn't work out, but consider yourself welcome back here anytime you're in this part of the Wastes.
1DI0013439	Damn. That poor kid.
1DI0013441	You're just full of surprises today, aren't you?
1DI0013443	I thought you were one of the Family. They're some lowlife gangers who've been giving us a hell of a lot of trouble lately.
1DI0013444	They're the reason for my itchy trigger finger.
1DI0013445	Wait... you aren't one of them but you know about them? What's going on here?
1DI0013446	That's great, but I got bigger problems than being the town post office right now.
1DI0013447	The shit's about to hit the fan in this cesspool, and I don't think I can stop them.
1DI0013448	Nobody just passes through here. There's nothing to get to by way of this shithole. You've found yourself at a dead-end.
1DI0013449	The only bastards that still pass through are the Family. They're some lowlife gangers who've been giving us a hell of a lot of trouble lately.
1DI0013451	Don't play tough with me. I was shooting my gun when you were still an itch in your daddy's pants!
1DI0013454	Well at first they'd do typical gang bullshit. You know, break stuff and make lots of noise, but they always kept their distance.
1DI0013455	But this last time, they went too far. They killed all of our Brahmin! I mean, that's our lifeblood out here you know!
1DI0013456	No way. If they were, you'd be staring at a burned out ghost town. I think the Family are just a bunch of punks.
1DI0013459	That's what I thought at first.
1DI0013460	I mean, they'd do typical gang bullshit. You know, break stuff and make lots of noise, but they always kept their distance.
1DI0013462	Yeah sure. I'll just go and take all of them out by myself. What are you, crazy?
1DI0013463	As soon as they roll into town, I lock my doors just like everyone else. We could really use some assistance here.
1DI0013464	Sigh. Look... you can call me crazy if you want but there just is something odd about those creeps.
1DI0013465	I mean, they got the guns and they got the muscle. Why don't they just bust down our doors and take us out already?
1DI0013466	We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
1DI0013467	Are you out of your mind? I drop one of them and the rest will use me as a bullet catcher.
1DI0013469	Look, pal. If you think I'm gonna get my ass shot off playing the hero, you're dead wrong.
1DI0013470	If I know they're coming, I lock myself inside like everyone else.  We're really in a bad way, and could use some help.
1DI0013471	I don't want to take my eyes off the ramp here. There's no telling when the Family will return.
1DI0013472	Can you do me a favor and check on the other people's houses here? You know, make sure they're doing okay.
1DI0013473	Speak with Davis West, Karen Schenzy and Ken Ewers.
1DI0013474	Do I look like I just stepped out of Tenpenny Tower? I barely have a pot to piss in.
1DI0013475	Fine. That's what I've come to expect from strangers. Always thinking of themselves.
1DI0013476	Why don't you just get out of Arefu? I've got a road to watch.
1DI0013477	Playing games with me, huh? Fine. I got better things to do.
1DI0013478	At first they just showed up and carried on like a bunch of kids down there by the riverbed, scaring the Brahmin and stuff like that.
1DI0013479	But this last time, they went too far. They charged up the ramp and started banging on our doors trying to get us to open up.
1DI0013480	I'll tell you what's going on... the Family's been bothering our town for weeks.
1DI0013483	What the fuck? You liar!
1DI0013484	Well, that is sweet, but Vance would kick my rather gorgeous ass right out of here if I told you how to find Ian. Sorry.
1DI0013485	My oh my, that would tempting. If you were that good, maybe I'd pay you! Ha ha ha.
1DI0013486	Tell you what, handsome... let me give you the password to Ian's room. Maybe you could talk to him and make him feel better.
1DI0013487	I think this is the best place for him. Out there, he'd be hunted like all of us were. Sorry.
1DI0013488	Well, I guess so. You seem like a pretty nice guy.
1DI0013489	Vance will have my butt in a sling if he finds out, but let me give you the password to his room.
1DI0013492	You don't think he's already messed up? Come on. Don't kid yourself.
1DI0013493	We pulled him out of that shithole town just in time.
1DI0013494	You just don't get it, do you? We are his "real" family, okay?
1DI0013495	Yes, I know. He told me.
1DI0013496	Surprised? Well, Ian was there when it happened and did nothing to stop it. If you ask yourself why, the answer is obvious.
1DI0013497	He belongs with us here. He's one of us. Don't deny him his rightful home.
1DI0013498	I'd never thought of it that way. I suppose he should get a chance to talk to someone like you.
1DI0013499	Here's the password to his isolation area. Just please don't mention my name to Vance about this.
1DI0013502	How do you know that? If you've spoken to him like I have, I think you can see he's truly one of us.
1DI0013503	Ian confides in me. We share a special bond. I might be the only friend in the world he's got!
1DI0013504	Now that's more like it! I finally won't have to pay for it anymore. Ha ha ha!
1DI0013505	Ah hell, here's the password to the pipsqueak's room. Come back and see me after you talk to him...
1DI0013506	Finally! Someone with some balls around this place!
1DI0013507	Here's the password to that little pipsqueak's room... why don't you go knock some sense into him? Ha ha ha!
1DI0013508	That's me. You don't like it? Tough!
1DI0013509	Awwww. I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings? Sniff.
1DI0013510	Tough shit! This is the real world. You want to know something, find it out your damn self.
1DI0013511	Well, go explore somewhere else. This place is off limits to explorers.
1DI0013512	Ok, sure. Look, I don't have time for your bullshit. Turn around and go back the way you came.
1DI0013513	Otherwise, they'll be scraping you up with a shovel.
1DI0013514	Sounds like an interesting problem.
1DI0013515	Let me take 100 of those off your hands... you know, to lighten the load.
1DI0013516	I suggest taking the door around the corner if you want to get where I think you're going. You'll find it unlocked in a moment.
1DI0013517	If I were you, I'd speak to Vance before you poke around too much. You can usually find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
1DI0013518	Oh well. Tough luck for you I guess.
1DI0013519	Then quit wasting my damn time, asshole!
1DI0013520	Vance said others of our kind would find us! Sorry I was so harsh, but I don't share our leader's ability to feel others of our kind.
1DI0013522	Alright, alright. I guess you look harmless enough.
1DI0013524	Oh, the new kid? Yeah, Vance said we should be expecting someone soon.
1DI0013525	You can head on in, but I would speak to Vance first if I was you. You can find him on the mezzanine overlooking the common area.
1DI0013526	Sure! Take a look around!
1DI0013527	I can only offer my thanks. My people are getting accustomed to using these as a substitute for live prey.
1DI0013528	As compensation for your effort, allow me to at least give you something in return.
1DI0013529	Again, many thanks. Here is your compensation.
1DI0013530	Well, all I can do is offer my repair services to you. I'm pretty good with fixing stuff.
1DI0013531	That's usually because Brailee breaks everything thinking she's making a cake or something.
1DI0013532	Ohhhh! I'm sorry, I'll have to bake another batch. Maybe some other time.
1DI0013533	Why, yes. Let me give you one of my old fashioned chocolate chip cookies! Enjoy!
1DI0013534	There are a few interesting places around here I've heard about. I don't know if they'll help you or not, but you're welcome to them.
1DI0013535	I've been saving up stuff for emergencies in case things with Arefu got tremendously bad.
1DI0013536	You're welcome to some of it if you like.
1DI0013537	Sorry, the well's run dry.
1DI0013538	I've learned a bit more from Vance and I've been allowed around Meresti. I really think you helped me make the right decision. Thanks!
1DI0013539	Everyone around here is being nice to me despite what happened, so I guess it all turned out well. Thanks!
1DI0013540	It's weird living in my parent's old house with them gone, but I'll make the best of it.
1DI0013542	Things are much better. We all don't have to stay inside our houses and we sleep much better at night.
1DI0013543	It hasn't been this peaceful in Arefu for as long as I can remember.
1DI0013544	The proposal you've brought us from Vance should also ensure our safety. I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you.
1DI0013547	Very well, actually. Our truce with Arefu is coming to fruition. I've begun teaching my people to live off of the donated bloodpacks.
1DI0013548	The transition has been difficult, but we will manage.
1DI0013549	You've certainly done us a great service, and I can't thank you enough.
1DI0013550	As well as can be expected. I've had a bit of trouble keeping my people away from Arefu, but a deal is a deal and I will adhere to it.
1DI0013551	We stay away from them, they don't send anyone else after us. The perfect stalemate I suppose.
1DI0013552	Oh, thank you for remembering! With everything that's going on, I almost forgot about it.
1DI0013553	You have no idea how much this means to me. Thanks so much!
1DI0013554	She... she really misses being home and she's asked about me in here a lot!
1DI0013556	Please, do what you can to find my brother.
1DI0013557	Hey, thanks again for doing this for me, it means a lot.
1DI0013558	Remember, my offer still stands.
1DI0013559	All right, goodbye.
1DI0013560	Yeah, I guess I should have known this would happen.
1DI0013561	Maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
1DI0013562	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're here. I figured Evan King would get someone to track me down sooner or later.
1DI0013563	I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here.
1DI0013565	He's dead... you killed him? But he was my only chance to understand what the hell is happening to me!
1DI0013566	Wait. What do you mean? He's dead... you killed him?
1DI0013567	But he was my only chance to understand what the hell is happening to me!
1DI0013568	You son-of-a-bitch! You KILLED him and you think it's funny?!
1DI0013569	He was my only chance to understand what the hell is wrong with me! And you messed it all up!
1DI0013570	Well you can just GO TO HELL!
1DI0013571	Maybe you're right. It was easier to run away with the Family than to face what I did.
1DI0013572	Go back to Arefu and tell Evan King that I'm coming home. I have a few things to pack and I want to say my goodbyes to this place... alone.
1DI0013573	I can never go home. This was always meant to be my home and until something tells me otherwise, this is where I wanna be.
1DI0013574	Even if I stay alone. Tell Evan King that I'm sorry.
1DI0013575	Yeah, that's just what I thought you'd end up saying.
1DI0013576	Get outta here, you murderer. You killed everyone left that I cared about!
1DI0013578	I think I had it all wrong. I shouldn't have come here. I bet Lucy is feeling just as bad as me.
1DI0013585	Please, tell Vance I've made my decision. I'm going home to Arefu. I hope to see you there as well.
1DI0013586	Thank you, somehow just hearing you say that helps me a lot.
1DI0013587	Look, all I ever wanted was someone to let me make decisions for myself. For once I've decided that this is where I should be.
1DI0013588	I've done something terrible and I need to deal with it. Until I'm ready to face it, I'm staying here in Meresti. Even if I have to stay alone.
1DI0013589	Unless you can prove to me there's a good reason to leave, I'm staying right here in Meresti. Even alone if I have to.
1DI0013590	Yeah... that's what I thought.
1DI0013591	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. I'm sure Evan King is pretty pissed right about now.
1DI0013592	I bet he has the entire town out looking for me. He's worse than my parents.
1DI0013593	Well, maybe that's because I don't want to be found.
1DI0013594	Why the heck are you looking for me anyway?
1DI0013596	You think I don't know that? You think I don't know what I did?!
1DI0013597	Home? I don't have a home anymore. I made sure of that, didn't I?
1DI0013598	Why can't everyone just leave me alone and let me make my own decisions? I can't stand this anymore!
1DI0013599	I don't even know who I am anymore or where I belong. My real family is gone because of me and Vance is all I have now!
1DI0013600	I killed them! My own parents!
1DI0013601	It was the fucking hunger. That thing that's haunted me my entire life!
1DI0013602	You must think I'm some sort of monster.
1DI0013603	Then you must think I'm some kind of a monster.
1DI0013604	Of course it matters! The past is what's keeping me up at night.
1DI0013605	That night is like a bad dream... I can see parts of it but I don't remember what happened.
1DI0013607	Don't you understand me? I killed them, okay?! My mother and father are dead because of me!
1DI0013609	There's something inside me... something completely messed up!
1DI0013610	I'm a mutant; a freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
1DI0013611	No one gives a shit about me except Vance and the Family. Can't you understand that?
1DI0013613	I'm a mutant, a fucking freak! The only person I was ever able to talk to was my sister Lucy, and she's gone.
1DI0013615	Hmph. Just like Vance said. Humans will never understand us; just sit on their high horse and ridicule us.
1DI0013616	Well fine. You can judge us any way you see fit, but one thing's certain... I'm not leaving.
1DI0013617	Now get the hell out of my room.
1DI0013618	Help? How can you help? There's something inside me... something completely messed up!
1DI0013624	Thank you for understanding. This place is all I've got, and I don't wanna lose it.
1DI0013625	Would you speak to Vance for me? I still need some time alone before I'm ready to talk to anyone else.
1DI0013626	Vance said it's not murder! Hell, we kill Brahmin every day just because we need to eat. Why is THAT okay?
1DI0013627	Vance was right, you humans will never understand what we're all about.
1DI0013628	This whole conversation is a waste of time. Get the fuck out of my room!
1DI0013629	She does? If she cared so much, why did she leave when she did?
1DI0013630	My parents would have never understood... they would have called me a freak and kicked me out.
1DI0013631	No, I'm sorry. Vance and the Family are the only ones that could possibly understand what I'm going through.
1DI0013635	I'm just gonna gather my stuff together and say my goodbyes then I'll head on back.
1DI0013636	You know, for a second there you sounded just like Vance. And you're right.
1DI0013637	I don't know what I'm running away from, but given time maybe things can go back to the way they used to be.
1DI0013640	..Ian. My name's Ian West. Who are you?
1DI0013641	Wait a second. I heard fighting. You're here to kill me aren't you?
1DI0013642	No... not at all. My name's Ian West.
1DI0013644	My name's Ian West. And who the hell are YOU supposed to be?
1DI0013646	How the hell do you expect me to calm down? I can't believe this is happening again! All the people I care about always leave!
1DI0013647	Evan King probably sent you to look for me, didn't he? Well you can tell him I'll never set foot in Arefu again. NEVER!
1DI0013648	After what I did, he's the one that probably wants me dead.
1DI0013649	Evan King probably sent you to look for me, didn't he!? Well you can tell him I'll never set foot in Arefu again. NEVER!
1DI0013651	I can't believe this is happening again! All the people I care about always leave me!
1DI0013654	Oh he did? Well it's about damn time he did something!
1DI0013655	Come on in, I'll unlock the door.
1DI0013656	There's no way I'm letting you wackos in here!
1DI0013657	Great, thanks for scaring the shit out of me.
1DI0013658	Look, "pal,", there is no way you're going to get to me or my wife so just back on out of here!
1DI0013659	Yeah right, and the second I drop my guard you pounce. No thanks.
1DI0013660	Look, speak your piece then leave.
1DI0013661	Maybe it's because my wife has gone mental. No wait, I think it's because some lunatics are trying to kill us.
1DI0013662	Other than that, no reason.
1DI0013663	Oh for the love of...
1DI0013664	Look, she's dumber than a bag of hammers, okay? If you want to talk to anyone, you need to talk to me.
1DI0013665	So what the fuck do you want?
1DI0013666	Do you understand English? I said get out!
1DI0013667	All I care about are two things. My life and my wife's life. Beyond that, I don't give two shits.
1DI0013668	If you need something, speak your piece and go.
1DI0013669	You must find him! Please! He's all I have left in this world now.
1DI0013670	I just gotta know if he's alive or dead. It can't just end this way!
1DI0013671	Then maybe he's still alive!
1DI0013674	No! I refuse to believe that!
1DI0013677	I'm sorry. You don't even know me, and you've already helped this much.
1DI0013678	I'm not stupid, I know he's probably dead. I just need to know for sure.
1DI0013679	Fine. Be an asshole. I don't care.
1DI0013680	If you find Ian, and you have a change of heart, come back here and tell me. If not, fine! Screw you!
1DI0013681	Fine. Fine. Here, this is all I have left to feed myself, you selfish asshole!
1DI0013682	I don't care anymore. I just want to know where my brother is.
1DI0013683	That's all I have in the world I told you!
1DI0013684	Thank goodness! You have no idea how worried I was... I haven't even slept well since you left.
1DI0013685	Thanks for bringing me the news, you've really cheered me up!
1DI0013686	I... I don't know what to say. I... can't believe this is happening to me. My entire family... gone. I...
1DI0013687	Please, just go. Don't say anything, don't look back. Just go.
1DI0013688	What? Those gangers? I knew if he got mixed up with the wrong crowd this could happen! Why didn't I do anything to stop him?
1DI0013691	I hope by "something to do" you mean a job, otherwise you want to talk with Nova.
1DI0013692	I'm looking for someone to make a delivery. Interested?
1DI0013693	Hmph. Well, that's the attitude I've come to know from most of the people around this town. Folks like to keep to themselves.
1DI0013694	I don't want your life story, I just want a little bit of a favor. Think you're up to it?
1DI0013695	I do. I'm looking for someone to make a delivery. Interested?
1DI0013696	Great! I'd like you to deliver this message to my family in the Arefu Settlement. I haven't heard from them in months and I'm worried.
1DI0013697	As soon as you get there, talk to Davis West. He'll be glad to pay you for the trip.
1DI0013698	Alright. Let me know if you change your mind.
1DI0013699	Actually, I don't have any caps with me. I used everything I had buying a shack in this town.
1DI0013700	But if you'd be nice enough to help me, I bet my father would pay you something for all the trip. What do you say?
1DI0013701	Hey, you're pretty smart for a Wastelander!
1DI0013702	I need you to deliver a message to my family. They live in a small settlement northwest of here. If you bring it, I'm sure my dad will pay you.
1DI0013703	I'll tell you more if you agree. Please, I could really use your help.
1DI0013704	Yes, Vance. What is it?
1DI0013705	Okay I guess. The new guy's taking up most of my time, but I think he'll come around. He's been through some serious shit.
1DI0013706	Yes, my love?
1DI0013707	Look, I'm going to give you a bit of friendly advice. Stop ignoring the rules and making Vance angry. He almost kicked you out of here.
1DI0013708	Better I suppose. I think Vance is finally calming down after Karl apologized for all that trouble he caused.
1DI0013709	Talk to me? W-what did I do?
1DI0013710	Great, actually! I finished my first round of studies and Vance said that I was doing great. I think I'm finally beginning to get the hang of it!
1DI0013711	Yeah, yeah. What is it now?
1DI0013712	Crappy as usual. No one's been by here in ages to buy anything and Vance is crawlin' up my ass cause of that mess in Arefu.
1DI0013714	Oh, just dandy! I think the new guy is so darn cute. Never had someone so young before in this place.
1DI0013715	Cool! I knew you'd get the hang of it. Good job, Alan!
1DI0013716	Brianna, I'd leave him alone for a while before, well... you know.
1DI0013717	Good, I'd hate to have Vance angry when he's inducting someone into the Family.
1DI0013718	Well, you did kind of screw up. I mean, you didn't need to go and do all that stuff. He just wanted you to make them nervous.
1DI0013719	Hey, with Vance teaching him personally he's bound to figure it all out soon enough. I wouldn't worry about it really.
1DI0013720	Yeah, I guess. Hey, I really enjoyed last night by the way. Thanks for the company.
1DI0013721	It's about time. Karl's gonna get us in trouble at this rate. I hope he learns to calm down a little bit.
1DI0013722	It's your fault in the first place. You didn't have go wild like that.
1DI0013723	Ha! I told you! In bed you were mumbling about how you think Vance is all disappointed with your progress. I knew he wasn't.
1DI0013724	Yeah and I bet he was taking it out on you. Not getting any really for a while can drive you crazy.
1DI0013725	Well, I just may have to do something special for Mr. Gloomy to cheer him up.
1DI0013726	Oh, I like it when you talk dirty like that, old man. He he he.
1DI0013727	Yep. We're both extremely proud of you. You've come such a long way in a short amount of time.
1DI0013728	Yes, he is rather handsome. However, I think you may want to exercise a little bit of restraint. His situation is rather delicate.
1DI0013729	That's good news. Vance and I are very worried about him. Thanks for taking him under your wing as well, Justin. We appreciate it.
1DI0013731	Whoopee! Let's throw a party cause little Alan learned to stop acting like a goddamn animal! Hurray!
1DI0013732	Cool your jets, sweet cheeks. You're jumpin' from bed to bed faster than a Radroach on a hotplate.
1DI0013733	Yeah, yeah... your husband is already reading me the riot act. No need to get your panties in a bunch.
1DI0013734	Stop wasting your time on that crybaby. You wanna make friends, go talk to Brianna. She'll take care of you.
1DI0013735	Yeah, I've heard this song and dance before. What good is it if we can't really kick those humans where it hurts?
1DI0013736	I don't think so. He still seems pretty out of it, but considering what happened...
1DI0013737	Oh come now, Vance. You are doing what's best for these people. If it wasn't for you, they'd be living in the Wastes... or dead.
1DI0013738	Awww... then how am I supposed to keep morale up around this dingy place?
1DI0013739	Oh! Thank you, Vance. I mean... it's me that should be thanking you. I dunno what I would have done without the Family.
1DI0013740	I will make this as clear as possible, Karl. Never again. You disobey my laws once more and you will be out of Meresti for good!
1DI0013741	How is our newest member? Is he finding his meditation time enlightening?
1DI0013742	I wonder if the Family will really work. Sometimes with all the troubles we have, it seems impossible to hold it together.
1DI0013743	I think you need to ease up with your flirting. It is becoming very distracting to the men as they adapt to things down here.
1DI0013744	I just wanted to tell you I feel you have progressed quite well in adopting our laws. You should be proud.
1DI0013745	That is not how the Family operates, and you know it! Now do not test my patience on this subject.
1DI0013746	Understandable. Give him time, Justin. Change is a very difficult thing to adapt to.
1DI0013747	Implying that you wish to sleep with everyone here is not what I call boosting morale. Now, please. Keep it to one at a time.
1DI0013748	You always have a knack for making me feel better.
1DI0013749	No need to thank me, Alan. You have achieved this level of enlightenment all on your own, I was merely a guide.
1DI0013750	Sure, be glad to since you're doing me a big favor and all.
1DI0013751	Arefu is northwest of Megaton on an old overpass over the Potomac. If you follow what's left of the river, you can't miss it.
1DI0013752	No... not really. Maybe my letters just aren't arriving. Whatever you can do to get it there would sure be appreciated.
1DI0013753	Well, let's see. There's Evan King... he's like the sheriff of the town or whatever.
1DI0013754	Then there's my family, the Ewer Family and a lady who lives alone named Karen Schenzy.
1DI0013755	What, apart from the Wasteland critters, Slaver raiding parties, Raider hit squads and occasional landmine? No, it's completely safe.
1DI0013756	If this was easy, I'd go myself you know.
1DI0013757	If your caps are good, you can buy whatever you like. Beats standing there drooling all over the merchandise.
1DI0013758	Come back and see me when I'm mindin' the store. You better bring caps... there's no handouts to be had around here!
1DI0013759	We're great. Just peachy. I love sitting in my house with my thumb up my ass.
1DI0013760	Tell Mr. King that sitting here all day isn't going to make us any safer. We need to take action!
1DI0013761	Oh! He's such a dear! I must remember to make more of those preserves he loves so much.
1DI0013762	Scared out of my mind. I'm glad he's checking on us, but until someone nips the problem in the bud, we may as well stay inside forever.
1DI0013763	He's a spineless wimp. His best solution to the Family is to stay inside our homes and hide. What does that tell them?
1DI0013764	It tells them that we can be pushed around whenever they want. I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of King.
1DI0013765	Well, he's town mayor or sheriff or whatever he calls himself. He calls all the shots.
1DI0013766	When he says to get the heck indoors and stay put, we do that.
1DI0013767	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it back to Lucy or to Ian if you can find him.
1DI0013768	I can't take that. You're just going to have to bring it to the Wests yourself.
1DI0013769	Oh, thank you for remembering!
1DI0013770	I have to admit that I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again. I'm glad I was wrong.
1DI0013771	Well, yeah actually. Meresti Trainyard almost due east of here.
1DI0013772	What!? The Family must be a pack of cannibals!
1DI0013773	Oh, this is all I needed right now. What am I going to do? They'll keep coming back until all of us are dead if they think we're food.
1DI0013774	Bite marks on their necks? That's the strangest thing I've ever heard. The Family must have attack dogs with them or something.
1DI0013775	Oh, this is all I needed right now. What am I going to do? They'll keep coming back until all of us are dead!
1DI0013776	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught that weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
1DI0013777	Look, I know I've asked a lot from you already, but you have to find that kid... he deserves better than all this.
1DI0013778	What am I gonna do? The Wests' lives were my responsibility and look what happened!
1DI0013779	This has to be the work of the Family! I've caught weirdo leader of theirs talking to Ian down by the river.
1DI0013781	Sorry... sorry. I just don't know what to do. The West's lives were my responsibility and look what happened!
1DI0013784	This place is my place of business. If you wanna buy something, then buy. If you wanna flap your lips, take a hike.
1DI0013785	Well, Vance told me that this place was called Meresti. It was named after some town way across the ocean in a place called Romania.
1DI0013786	This is Meresti, the home of the Family. It's the only safe place for these poor people.
1DI0013787	It's the last place I ever expected to end up.
1DI0013788	I mean look at this place... it's so dark and dingy. What this place needs is a lady's touch.
1DI0013789	But don't tell Vance that I said that.
1DI0013790	Right now I call this place home. The only home that's ever let me stay with my... problems.
1DI0013791	This lovely hole in the ground is Meresti, the headquarters of the Family.
1DI0013792	You are standing inside Meresti, the home of the Family. This is our sanctuary from the outside world.
1DI0013793	It is a refuge for those society labels as outcasts.
1DI0013794	There used to be more families living here. Most of them have dismantled their shacks and moved on to greener pastures.
1DI0013795	Those that are still living here are keeping themselves indoors thanks to the Family.
1DI0013796	We're scared shitless. Evan King's got everyone so worked up about the Family, no one wants to set foot outside.
1DI0013797	That asshole runs the show, but does he really do anything about our problem? No.
1DI0013798	Everyone is keeping themselves safe from the Family. If I was you, I'd do the same.
1DI0013799	You want to know more, talk to Evan King.
1DI0013800	Oh my, I don't know. Mrs. West is probably whipping up a batch of her famous cookies and all the kids are playing in the yards.
1DI0013801	It's so nice outside, the grass looks lovely this time of year.
1DI0013802	I think they live somewhere east or northeast of here. Problem is, they always travel in the dark so I can't see exactly where they go.
1DI0013803	There's all kinds of places they could be hiding like Hamilton's Hideaway, the old Moonbeam Cinema or Northwest Seneca Metro Station.
1DI0013804	All they do is terrorize us. They taunt us to open our doors, throw bottles at our houses and scream at us.
1DI0013805	If I knew King had my back, I'd step outside and show them just how I feel about their visits... especially after this last attack.
1DI0013806	They're lowlife scum who decided to use Arefu as their own personal amusement park. Oh, they're a fun bunch.
1DI0013807	I'd take a shot at them if I could but judging from what they did to the Brahmin, I wouldn't live long to tell about it.
1DI0013808	The Family has become our moniker because that is exactly what we are... related by blood.
1DI0013809	Even if all of us look different on the outside, we all had the same vice infesting our insides.
1DI0013810	But now, through my teachings, these subjugated people have come together and formed a bond stronger than mere friendship.
1DI0013811	We are a badass gang and we don't take shit from nobody.
1DI0013812	We also don't like nosy assholes who creep around asking too many stupid questions.
1DI0013813	We're the last people you want to mess with... that's for damn sure.
1DI0013814	It's a great way to get back at those assholes out there who think we're losers.
1DI0013815	If it wasn't for Vance, I'd still be getting the crap beat out of me by those guards in Rivet City.
1DI0013816	My husband started this group not long ago. He was trying to save them from a life of hardship and ridicule.
1DI0013817	They come from all over the Wasteland now to find us and become part of the Family.
1DI0013818	How about just the coolest gang this side of the U.S.?
1DI0013819	As long as we listen to Vance's rules and listen to his stuff, he lets us do pretty much whatever we want.
1DI0013820	Well, anyone that Vance takes in because of their special problems can be part of the Family.
1DI0013821	Agreed. Please, take this proposal to Arefu. Speak with them and then return to me with their decision.
1DI0013822	I thank you for showing me that your kind can be trusted after all. It is a lesson I will not forget.
1DI0013823	Now, what of young Ian? Tell me his decision.
1DI0013827	Although I appreciate what you are trying to do, please realize that we have no money or goods to speak of.
1DI0013828	What little money Karl makes with his shop goes to buying weapons and ammunition to protect ourselves.
1DI0013829	I am very sorry, but perhaps you can make a better offer?
1DI0013830	As long as you maintain this level of civility, please proceed.
1DI0013831	You wish to arrive at some sort of a bargain?
1DI0013832	My fine friend, that poor soul has been wrestling with the same question every new member of the Family asks himself when they arrive.
1DI0013833	Do I belong here, or should I depart?
1DI0013834	All I ask is that they spend the time to reflect before deciding in solitude.
1DI0013835	No convincing is necessary. I must say your visit is a pleasant change from what I am accustomed to when dealing with humans.
1DI0013836	In light of this, I promise you that no further harm will befall you or Arefu. Of that you have my solemn oath.
1DI0013838	Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
1DI0013839	The problem with your idea is that these bloodpacks are scarce.
1DI0013842	The problem was that these bloodpacks were scarce.
1DI0013844	I suppose we could stop our raids on Arefu in light of this situation, but that just forces us to prey on others.
1DI0013845	Unless... Many years ago, I survived by drinking from preserved bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
1DI0013846	The problem was that these bloodpacks are scarce.
1DI0013847	Well put. I must say your visit is a pleasant change from what I am accustomed to when dealing with humans.
1DI0013850	If you fear reprisal from the Family regarding his decision, know that I would never hold it against you.
1DI0013851	And as for Ian having you speak in his place, I find his trust sufficient enough to accept what you say as truth.
1DI0013852	Curious. Many years ago, I survived by drinking from fresh bloodpacks I recovered from hospital ruins.
1DI0013855	What you see before you is the last bastion of hope for the downtrodden and misunderstood.
1DI0013856	It is a sanctuary for the oppressed and a beacon of faith for the tyrannized.
1DI0013859	Your words echo the very reason this place was established.
1DI0013862	We are the remnants of society, cast aside like the clean-picked bones of a hunter's feast.
1DI0013863	I led my flock beneath the sun-baked sands of the Wasteland to keep them safe and teach them my ways.
1DI0013865	What does it mean? Allow me to simplify it for you since you are obviously of limited intellect.
1DI0013871	Ah! Your words illustrate why the hardships persist for my people. Reforming implies something is wrong with them and needs to be eliminated.
1DI0013872	I think of my teachings as more of an improvement, a way to transcend our cannibalistic nature.
1DI0013873	Humans call for our extermination or reform. Reforming implies something is wrong with us and needs to be eliminated.
1DI0013875	I find your choice of words quite droll, but that is what I have come to expect from your kind.
1DI0013876	People like you call for our extermination or reform. Reforming implies something is wrong with us and needs to be eliminated.
1DI0013878	Your open mindedness is very rare for a human. I find that fascinating.
1DI0013879	Allow me to bolster your insight with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
1DI0013880	What would that make us in your eyes?
1DI0013881	That is correct my arrogant friend, but you are missing the grand picture I'm afraid.
1DI0013882	Let me counter that ignorance with a lesson in objectivity. I say we are no longer cannibal, only consuming the blood of our prey.
1DI0013884	That is completely untrue. Your difficulty grasping the concept that change is possible in my people perplexes me. Let me try a different approach.
1DI0013887	I would choose your next words VERY carefully if I were in your place.
1DI0013888	Your self-applauding notions are the sole reason we are down here in hiding like Mole Rats.
1DI0013889	I will warn you only once. Do NOT test me. I have no qualms about having your blood running down my throat.
1DI0013890	Your words hold no fear with me, human.
1DI0013891	Now I think it is time to demonstrate the true power of the Family. Tremble fool... tremble and face the wrath of the vampire!
1DI0013892	You amaze me. Never have I met a human with the gift of cognition that you possess.
1DI0013893	Tell me then, what are we?
1DI0013896	Then a part of his human family still remains? Even more of a reason he needs to remain in isolation.
1DI0013897	Ian is at a critical moment in his life right now. After all that occurred in Arefu, he is scared and confused.
1DI0013898	It would be ill advised for me to allow you to speak to him while he decides what he wants to do.
1DI0013899	WE are his family. If he were to leave, how can you be certain he would not feel the same way about us?
1DI0013902	Murder is a very strong word, my friend. Do you consider it murder when a hunter stalks his prey in order to put food on the table?
1DI0013903	The Family must do what it can to survive, and Ian provided us the way.
1DI0013905	Sigh. Short temper. So typical of a human.
1DI0013906	One more outburst like that, and I think I am going to have you removed from our home... permanently.
1DI0013907	Is there no end to your hostility? Your kind have never accepted us. So be it.
1DI0013908	All you rely on is violence to further your means. If that is what you seek, I will be happy to provide it!
1DI0013909	Ian's hunger for flesh overwhelmed him... it drove him to kill his parents.
1DI0013910	Because of my intervention that night he stopped just short of being lost forever to his cravings for flesh.
1DI0013911	Do to him? Nothing. Ian's hunger for flesh overwhelmed him... it drove him to kill his parents.
1DI0013913	I am telling you he will no longer be labeled as such. He has become one of us... a member of the Family.
1DI0013914	The hunger that drives us must be kept in check. It is one of the most difficult things to teach.
1DI0013915	Ian lost control because no one was around to guide him. His own family was alien to him.
1DI0013918	He had a moment of weakness, and it was fatal.
1DI0013919	Your words impress me, human. Perhaps I misjudged you when we first met.
1DI0013920	If you wish to speak to Ian, you are free to do so. Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
1DI0013921	Indeed. Perhaps my sense of caring for Ian has overwhelmed my sense of duty to the Family and all others like us.
1DI0013922	Forgive my mistake. If you wish to speak to Ian, you're free to do so.
1DI0013923	Here is the code to the area in which he is meditating.
1DI0013924	No, it would not be right to disturb him in this time of meditation. I am sorry but I cannot allow it.
1DI0013925	I can sympathize with your anger, human. Many find cannibalism shocking, especially in the young.
1DI0013926	But understand that I cannot allow you to see him during his time of reflection.
1DI0013927	We are the Family and together we will stand united!
1DI0013928	We will organize, we will prepare, we will teach you to cope with your differences and we will keep you alive.
1DI0013929	Well rest easy now, my brothers and sisters. It's time to stop all of the running, all of the hiding and all of the denying.
1DI0013930	We can not allow the humans to hunt us down and kill us like dogs! We must show them we are a force to be reckoned with!
1DI0013931	The adaptation we were given wasn't meant to be ignored or persecuted. It's our way of survival.
1DI0013932	I submit to you that we are the victims of evolution; the next step in mankind's acclimation to this hellish existence.
1DI0013933	Are we THAT different from those who hunt for meat to survive or from those who kill for territory? Of course not.
1DI0013934	Every one of us has been branded with these insults at some point in our lives. But why?
1DI0013935	Monsters! Villains! Criminals! Animals!
1DI0013936	Do you think I believe I can turn into a bat and fly away? Of course not. Do I cast my image in a mirror? Absolutely.
1DI0013937	Now ask me if I believe these individuals from every corner of the Wasteland need me to give them a sense of purpose and identity.
1DI0013938	I have shown these people the ways of the vampire. I've provided them shelter, organization and a sense of belonging.
1DI0013942	It saddens me to think that your failure to understand us could be my fault. If that is the case, allow me to enlighten you.
1DI0013943	We call ourselves vampires; a brotherhood that honorably stretches back thousands of years.
1DI0013944	I can see that you have no understanding of what I have accomplished here.
1DI0013945	I tire of debating with those who are so narrow-minded.
1DI0013946	Now you disappoint me. You need to open your mind and think for a moment before you pass judgment.
1DI0013947	I have reined in their cravings and taught them to eat not of the flesh, but to drink of the blood.
1DI0013948	Most importantly, they have a Family. A place where their quirks are tolerated and understood.
1DI0013949	Yes. In a way, I am brainwashing them. I am eliminating their fears, their inhibitions and their shame.
1DI0013955	Then that is a mystery you will have to solve on your own.
1DI0013956	In ceremony, each member of the Family must speak one of the Laws... it is theirs to remember and to enforce.
1DI0013957	Perhaps from these Laws you can discover what we are. Return to me when you are ready.
1DI0013958	That is where you are mistaken, my friend. Time is a commodity more abundant than any other in this world.
1DI0013961	Names like that have no meaning here... your insults are a wasted effort.
1DI0013964	Agreed. Why else would the Outsider have been allowed into the Grove? Perhaps it's a test. Yes... that must be it!
1DI0013965	Once again, my husband, we are at an impasse. I suggest we speak to the Outsider.
1DI0013966	If we allow the spread of this miracle to continue, we're putting Him in jeopardy. I can't allow that... I won't allow it!
1DI0013967	How can we preach about peace when all you want to do is keep His gift all to ourselves? That's not what He would want!
1DI0013968	The Outsider is here to deliver us from our enemies! To keep this place safely locked away from the Wasteland! Not to exploit us!
1DI0013969	And I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong! Why else would He have called for an Outsider's assistance?
1DI0013970	You must drink from the basin if you wish to meet Him.
1DI0013971	Drink of the sap from the basin, only then will He reveal Himself.
1DI0013972	Please, drink the sap from the basin.
1DI0013973	When you are ready, drink from the basin.
1DI0013974	Then please, return to the basin and we will begin.
1DI0013975	There's nothing to fear here. This is our tradition and our custom, as well as a measure of protection for Him.
1DI0013976	If you need a bit of time to reflect, then please do so. All I ask is you return quickly.
1DI0013977	When you're ready to undergo the ceremony, just ask.
1DI0013978	Then you are free to go. He had requested to see you, but He said not to take you against your will.
1DI0013979	It saddens me greatly you don't wish to see Him, but you must follow your own path.
1DI0013980	If you change your mind, come speak to me and we'll begin again.
1DI0013981	No, I suppose you haven't. In fact, few who live outside of Oasis have.
1DI0013982	Everything you see around you, from the tallest tree to the smallest blade of grass is a gift. A gift from Him.
1DI0013983	The innocent creatures are drawn here by His gifts. They come from across the Wasteland to live in this sanctuary.
1DI0013984	This part of the world is healing, my friend, and it's all thanks to Him.
1DI0013985	That's His power you feel, Outsider. With His outstretched limbs He shelters us and keep us safe.
1DI0013986	Ha ha ha! We no longer use devices like that. We cast our technology away many years ago.
1DI0013988	What you call scared, I call humbled. This place is a blessing to all of us.
1DI0013990	He is the One Who Grows, He is the One Who Gives and He is the One Who Guides.
1DI0013991	No one speaks His name out of reverence for His majesty.
1DI0013992	Thanks to Him, the Treeminders have a home.
1DI0013993	He's no mere god, my friend.
1DI0014002	We care for this place and keep it safe from those who would seek to exploit it.
1DI0014003	He gives to us, so we give back to Him. It's an arrangement that's worked well for almost two decades.
1DI0014004	We shun technology and embrace nature. That's the life of a Treeminder.
1DI0014005	I would have preferred that He made the introduction, but I understand your hesitation.
1DI0014006	The Great One is a god-tree. A living, breathing, speaking god-tree!
1DI0014007	The Treeminders are blessed to have this being watch over us.
1DI0014008	Is it so strange to care for one's home and keep it safe from those who would seek to exploit it?
1DI0014011	Ha ha ha. I don't expect you to understand everything you see here. After all, you carry the taint of technology upon you.
1DI0014012	Treeminders shun technology and embrace nature. All technology has brought the world is violence and death.
1DI0014013	Sadly, the Wasteland is a hostile place and sometimes we're forced to defend ourselves against it.
1DI0014014	If that means fighting with manufactured weapons, then so be it.
1DI0014015	Had He not asked to see you, you never would have gotten this close to the gates.
1DI0014016	The Wasteland is a hostile place and sometimes we're forced to defend ourselves against it.
1DI0014019	Listen my friend, I will forgive your insolent tone because He has asked to see you.
1DI0014020	But make no mistake. If you wish to cause trouble here, we have the means to defend ourselves.
1DI0014021	Very good! Take your place in front of the basin and let's begin.
1DI0014022	I understand, my friend. Preparing to meet Him takes much preparation and soul searching.
1DI0014023	You may walk about Oasis as you see fit, but please don't take too long.
1DI0014028	Yes. Indeed it does. Sorry I don't speak to Outsiders very often and I tend to get lost in conversation.
1DI0014029	As you approached Oasis, He said you were coming and I was sent out to meet you personally with a request.
1DI0014030	He wishes to meet with you. You'd be the first Outsider to do so in a very long time.
1DI0014031	Yes, my apologies. I don't speak to Outsiders very often and I tend to get lost in conversation.
1DI0014034	You have much to learn about patience, my friend. However, you are correct, I will get to the point.
1DI0014037	Yes... person.
1DI0014038	To meet Him, you must undergo the Ceremony of Purification. Once that's complete, you'll be able to speak to Him.
1DI0014039	Whenever you're ready, we may begin.
1DI0014045	It's simple really. You drink the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
1DI0014046	The Sap will purify your mind and body of anything harmful that could possibly hurt Him.
1DI0014047	I assure you, nothing harmful will happen to you.
1DI0014048	There's no reason to be alarmed.
1DI0014049	All that must be done is you must drink the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
1DI0014051	I'm afraid not. No one gets to see Him without first drinking the Sap from the basin here in the Pavilion.
1DI0014053	Other than that, there's nothing more to the ceremony.
1DI0014054	In your short visit here I can see you've learned much. That's a rare gift in these turbulent times.
1DI0014055	I believe there are a few Treeminders who wish to speak to you before you depart. I think you'll find their appreciation quite rewarding.
1DI0014056	Good luck in all your journeys, my friend. I hope your time here has opened your heart as well as it opened your eyes.
1DI0014057	Perhaps you haven't learned quite as much as I hoped from your visit here, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
1DI0014060	I'm saddened that worldly possessions and wealth still drive you, but I'm glad to see you made the right choice in the end.
1DI0014063	Before you reached His heart, He imparted his last words to me. He told me about his will to die and how I mistook this for some mystical sign.
1DI0014064	How could I have been so blind? How could I have mislead all these people?
1DI0014065	Perhaps if I would have spent more time getting to know Him, things would have turned out different.
1DI0014066	No, Outsider, my anger lay not with you, but with myself.
1DI0014070	You're words sting, Outsider. Normally I'd have you cast from this place for such a statement, but my eyes have been opened.
1DI0014074	Even though the Great One has left us, our memories of Him will never die.
1DI0014075	With Bloomseer Poplar's help, I'm confident we can keep Oasis alive and carry on as Treeminders.
1DI0014076	Go now, Outsider. Go but never forget the gifts the Great One bestowed upon us.
1DI0014080	Your words carry no remorse, no caring.
1DI0014081	I'm at a loss as to how this place failed to open your eyes, but more importantly, to open your heart.
1DI0014082	Go now, Outsider. Go and never look back.
1DI0014083	Oh, He's testing you now, just like He tested us!
1DI0014084	He wants to see if your faith is strong by spinning these incredible stories. Who else but a god could produce all of this?
1DI0014085	Don't worry, you'll soon see things as I do.
1DI0014092	Yes, I've been pondering that riddle myself for some time now and I think I know what He's trying to tell us.
1DI0014093	The Great One's influence is growing and soon it will break free of the confines of this secluded vale.
1DI0014094	We can't allow Oasis to call attention to itself like that. It would be the end of Him.
1DI0014095	The Great One does tend to speak in riddles, but if that is His way, then so be it.
1DI0014096	My talks with Him have become quite puzzling of late. I think He's beginning to fear His future.
1DI0014102	That's it! You are no longer welcome in Oasis! Get out IMMEDIATELY!
1DI0014103	If you remain here against my wishes, we'll have no choice but to put you down!
1DI0014104	I've had enough of your blasphemy!
1DI0014105	I've tolerated it this long because you're an Outsider, but no more. If you wish to test me again, you'll find yourself banished from Oasis!
1DI0014106	If the same sap that you drank to purify yourself could be applied to His heart, it should stop the spread.
1DI0014107	I can promise you no harm would come to Him. That's all I ask of you, Outsider. Nothing more, nothing less.
1DI0014108	You misinterpret His words, my friend. He wants you to extinguish that which seeks to make Him vulnerable.
1DI0014115	I'm sorry, in my excitement, I got ahead of myself.
1DI0014116	I'm Tree Father Birch, and I have the great fortune of being leader of His people, the Treeminders.
1DI0014117	Beyond that gate is our home, Oasis.
1DI0014121	I am wearing the clothes of a Treeminder. We shed our Wasteland garments like the ones you're wearing long ago.
1DI0014125	Excellent! Please, follow me. All will be explained soon.
1DI0014126	Why, He is of course.
1DI0014127	If you'll just follow me to the Pavilion, all will be explained.
1DI0014128	Yes, we're the Treeminders. We're His people.
1DI0014129	If you'll just follow me inside to the Pavilion, all will be explained.
1DI0014130	I can promise you that if you leave, you'll be missing out on a great honor. Not many have even seen Him before, and yet he wants to speak to you.
1DI0014131	Please, I beg you. Don't make Him wait any longer. Follow me inside to the Pavilion, and I promise all will be explained!
1DI0014133	I'm very saddened to hear that, a great opportunity like this may come only once in a lifetime.
1DI0014134	If you wish to return and speak to me, talk to Branchtender Maple. She'll allow you to go inside.
1DI0014135	All I ask is you keep our existence a secret. Too many out there in the Wasteland would seek to exploit Him. Farewell.
1DI0014139	So, they really need me that badly, huh? I guess I never thought of it that way. Awfully selfish of me.
1DI0014140	Should we give them another chance, Herbert?
1DI0014141	Fine, fine. I mean Bob. I still think it's funny when I call him Herbert.
1DI0014142	No, I suppose you aren't. My mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
1DI0014143	Still, maybe it's all for the best. I mean, I've been talking with Birch and they really seem to need me.
1DI0014144	What do you say Herbert, should I give them another chance?
1DI0014146	I can't say I blame you. Its my mistake for making you do something you didn't want to do in the first place I guess.
1DI0014150	Now don't get crazy on me and start wearing branches...
1DI0014151	Come back and visit me some time.
1DI0014152	Okay! Wave bye-bye Bob! Oh come one, move a branch at least... sigh.
1DI0014153	I somehow knew you'd be the one to make the changes that Leaf Mother Laurel desired.
1DI0014154	I helped to create the hoods that you see all Treeminders wear. It's said that the cloth has a part of the Great One's spirit woven into the fibers.
1DI0014155	I present this to you as thanks. Wear this with pride and bring the message of renewal to all the corners of the Wasteland.
1DI0014156	I helped to create the garb that you see all Treeminders wear. It's said that the cloth has a part of the Great One's spirit woven into the fibers.
1DI0014157	I present this to you as thanks. Wear this with pride but tell no one where it came from or Oasis may face as yet a greater peril.
1DI0014158	We're very much alike, you and I. We both searched the Wasteland seeking answers, but I found my answer here.
1DI0014159	I hope one day you'll find what you're looking for. I know it's out there somewhere... just be patient.
1DI0014160	Here, please take this relic of my older days. Perhaps it will help you on your journey.
1DI0014161	I've never known someone to show as much caring as you did towards us. It seems to be rare to run into anyone like that anymore.
1DI0014162	That's partly why I never returned to my former life after I found myself in this place.
1DI0014163	Allow me to present a piece of my past to you, friend. Perhaps it will serve you better than it served me.
1DI0014164	Yeah, I think you're pretty swell for someone from Out There! And... and you were really nice to me too.
1DI0014165	I was gonna give this to my bestest friend Harold, but he doesn't have pockets, the silly-head!
1DI0014166	This is a charm that my parents gave me for my fifth birthday. It's really neat! Take it!
1DI0014167	Yes, I believe Branchtender Linden, Bloomseer Poplar and my little Yew mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
1DI0014168	Such is our tradition when honored guests are preparing to leave.
1DI0014169	Yes, I believe Branchtender Linden and Bloomseer Poplar mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
1DI0014171	Yes, I believe Branchtender Maple, Branchtender Cypress and my little Yew mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
1DI0014173	Yes, I believe Branchtender Maple and Branchtender Cypress mentioned they had some things for you as gifts.
1DI0014175	Please, I can't very well speak to you when you're back there.
1DI0014176	Come around to where I can see you.
1DI0014177	Stand where I can see you.
1DI0014178	<Sigh> I wish I was too. Then me and Herbert could be the best of friends and live side by side.
1DI0014179	He's the tree, you see. We're old pals... the best of buddies and we know each other inside and out; literally.
1DI0014180	Well, his name's really Bob. I think it's funny to call him Herbert. But I don't think he thinks it's that funny.
1DI0014181	Neither have I. Well, I mean I talk to Herbert, but he never really says anything back.
1DI0014182	He kept growing around me, maybe for calling him Herbert all the time. His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
1DI0014183	Where? You mean in here? Nah, it's just me and Herbert. He's the tree.
1DI0014184	We're old pals... the best of buddies and we know each other inside and out; literally.
1DI0014186	I know they mean well... and for awhile it was nice to be needed. But I'm not sure I want to be a giant tree anymore.
1DI0014187	Well, truth be told it's Herbert that's the tree. He sorta just took over, you know? Probably to get back at me for calling him Herbert all the time.
1DI0014188	His name's really Bob. I think it's funny when I call him Herbert though.
1DI0014189	Well, I suppose you could look at it that way. See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
1DI0014190	Well, eventually he got bigger than me, and then I pretty much ended up inside.
1DI0014191	Well, you're quite clever.
1DI0014192	See, Bob used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
1DI0014194	Not very bright, are you?
1DI0014195	Bob, that's the tree, used to ride around on top of my head, sunk his roots right in there, ya know?
1DI0014197	It was a long time ago... I tend to lose track.
1DI0014198	I was exploring some sort of a military base with some other people... I think it was called Mariposa.
1DI0014199	We were pretty deep inside and we found some weird vats of this nasty green goo. Right when we were about to leave, I think we were attacked.
1DI0014200	Last thing I remember before blacking out was something knocking my friend into the stuff.
1DI0014201	Whoa-ho! Check out the brain on this guy!
1DI0014210	Yes, perhaps it doesn't even matter anyway. Forget I mentioned it.
1DI0014211	You have no idea how glad I am to hear that. Or, we're glad to hear that... me and Bob.
1DI0014212	I had you brought in here to ask a very simple favor.
1DI0014213	Would you please kill me?
1DI0014214	Yes, yes I do. Or I guess WE do... me and Bob that is.
1DI0014217	Yes, you're right of course, I completely agree. Or I guess WE completely agree... me and Bob that is.
1DI0014231	No, no. Herbert is the tree... Bob is his real name, but I call him Herbert cause I think it's pretty funny.
1DI0014232	But I'm still in here too, what's left of me. The name's Harold.
1DI0014237	Oh no, no, no. It wouldn't be murder. You'd be doing me a favor.
1DI0014238	You see, I've been stuck here for over two decades now... rooted right into the ground.
1DI0014239	The only friends I've got are Bob and those weirdos out there who think I'm a god.
1DI0014240	Completely serious. You'd be doing me a favor.
1DI0014243	I wish it was that simple. No, no. There's only one way you're going to be able to do this for me.
1DI0014244	How to put this? ...I've been feeling rather "spread out" lately. I think Bob's kinda shoved my insides around some.
1DI0014245	It's hard to tell where everything is, but it's always that way with one's insides, isn't it?
1DI0014246	Anyway, I believe Bob's carried some of my organs into his root system. I want you to go underground and destroy my heart.
1DI0014247	Oh no, don't worry about them. When you decide to go down there, I'll have a little chat with Birch and the rest of the gang.
1DI0014248	They usually don't understand a word I say, but I'll make them come around.
1DI0014249	Now how exactly am I supposed to do that? I can barely move anymore.
1DI0014250	Thanks to Bob, I'm obviously not going to be doing anything for a very long time.
1DI0014251	You will? Oh! You've made us so happy! Isn't that right Bob?
1DI0014252	Just give me a little time to say goodbye to good old Bob and then I'll be ready.
1DI0014253	Of all the Wastelanders I had to bump into it has to be one with a conscience.
1DI0014254	Let's keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years.
1DI0014255	Just think about it, okay?
1DI0014256	Of course. I know this is an unusual request, but hey, I'm an unusual tree. Well, Bob is anyway...
1DI0014257	We'll just keep it an open invitation then. I don't want to wait until the next person visits, it could be years... you're all I've got.
1DI0014258	Well, I used to carry those pesky caps a long time ago, but I think my pockets are in those shrubs over yonder.
1DI0014259	I'm pretty sure the caves below me are full of all kinds of nifty gizmos you could take on your way to my heart. Help yourself!
1DI0014269	Of course we do! He yearns to share His miracles with the whole world... to give the gift of life back to the dead Wasteland!
1DI0014270	It's upsetting Him to no end, but Birch can't see the pain its causing.
1DI0014271	But now that you're here, I have a feeling the winds are about to change.
1DI0014275	I can understand your frustration. Seeing Him in so much pain makes me feel a sense of sadness in my heart too.
1DI0014276	The Great One yearns to share His miracles with the whole world... to give the gift of life back to the dead Wasteland!
1DI0014277	Now that you're here, I have a feeling the winds are about to change.
1DI0014278	I heard what my husband wanted you to do. What I propose is an alternative.
1DI0014279	The same person that created the sap also created this Liniment. If you can reach His heart, it will assist in making His influence increase.
1DI0014280	Instead of centuries, the Wasteland will become green in mere decades! Just imagine how glorious that would be!
1DI0014287	I was hoping you'd say that. Please, proceed inside.
1DI0014288	Oh! Well, let me know if you change your mind.
1DI0014289	Sorry, I believe that duty lay with Tree Father Birch.
1DI0014290	They're the best parents ever!
1DI0014291	I've only known them for a very short time, but when I first arrived they immediately took me in and treated me just like a son.
1DI0014292	There aren't many people in the world left like that.
1DI0014293	Lately, things have gotten a bit worse between them. It sometimes takes months for them to agree on things.
1DI0014294	I know they love each other greatly, but I'm afraid the strain of leadership is tearing them apart.
1DI0014295	I wish they wouldn't argue so much. It makes everyone uncomfortable.
1DI0014296	I think this place would be lost if it weren't for them.
1DI0014297	There's no telling what fate may have befallen the Great One if someone like the godless Raiders had gotten here first.
1DI0014298	Oh, no no no no! Fire would be too painful for me and poor old Bob. Keep that stuff away from us!
1DI0014299	The heart would be just fine... I won't feel a thing.
1DI0014300	Oasis is located near what used to be an old mining town before the bombs fell.
1DI0014301	When the attacks started about 200 years ago, many people took shelter in the natural caves that dotted the area.
1DI0014302	The old gate that stands at the mouth of Oasis Cave is the last piece of architecture from those days.
1DI0014303	Just like a cancer would infest our bodies, the caves below us are infested with vermin.
1DI0014304	You'd do well to be cautious down there, we've lost a few Treeminders in the past.
1DI0014305	If the Great One knows you to be worthy of his grace, he will allow you to pass through to his heart.
1DI0014306	Be wary of the water in the caves, I fear they still carry the sting of radiation from the bombs.
1DI0014307	My parents told me never to go past the old gate... there are monsters in there!
1DI0014308	Sure. Here you go. Good luck to you!
1DI0014309	Leave it to good old Bob to get me stuck above some caves. Now my dang feet are cold!
1DI0014310	I think the best way for you to get down there would be to get the key from the one those loonies call "Cypress."
1DI0014311	There's supposed to be some old gate or something back in the other grove.
1DI0014312	Sometimes I feel stuff tickling me, but I think that's just Bob getting back at me for all the times I called him Herbert.
1DI0014315	I've been literally rooted to this spot thanks to Bob for maybe twenty or thirty years... I can't even remember anymore.
1DI0014316	Can you imagine being stuck in one place for that long not being able to eat or to read or to sleep or anything?
1DI0014317	In the meantime, I have these Treeminders bothering me every day about things I don't even care about. I can't stand it anymore.
1DI0014318	I've tried to stay happy, really I have. Bloomseer Poplar thinks I'll live for hundreds of years... maybe even more!
1DI0014319	Can you imagine THAT? Stuck here for centuries? I can't do it, I just want to be alone. Just me and Bob until the end.
1DI0014320	When I saw you coming towards Oasis, I thought I felt that you'd understand me. I guess I was wrong.
1DI0014321	I knew you would. That's why I picked you when I saw you coming.
1DI0014322	Hey, I thought that too... at first.
1DI0014323	I had them sing me songs, I made them do stupid dances and things like that. Bob even told me to make Maple stand on his head for a whole day!
1DI0014324	After a while though, it just gets boring. Then it becomes a nuisance and now it's completely driving me nuts!
1DI0014326	Maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom, but I swear if I try I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
1DI0014327	I think it's making Bob kind of jealous, cause he was the first tree in my life and all that.
1DI0014328	I'm telling you, it is possible, or maybe I'm just losing my mind from all this boredom.
1DI0014329	I swear if I try real hard, I can see all around me like my eyes are in every leaf on every tree.
1DI0014331	You have a point there. Maybe I'm just losing my marbles from all this boredom.
1DI0014334	I'll mourn Him with every ounce of my being. This has been a tremendous loss to the world.
1DI0014335	If anything, this place will become a memorial to Him lest we may forget.
1DI0014336	Rejoice in the knowledge that one day all the barren rock and sand of this dead Wasteland will become vibrant with green once again!
1DI0014337	There's so much to prepare for, so much to do!
1DI0014338	I'll remain hopeful that someday Birch will come to his senses and realize we may not only be the only Treeminders, but the last of them as well.
1DI0014339	I will do my best to honor the Great One's memory by tending this place until my dying day.
1DI0014341	Although his influence will spread through the Wasteland one day, that day is still a long way off.
1DI0014342	For now, we'll remain ever vigilant and watch the Wasteland for anything that could threaten this sanctuary.
1DI0014343	Now that Oasis is safe, we do what we always do. We remain ever vigilant and watch the Wasteland for anything that could threaten this sanctuary.
1DI0014344	Now that Harold's gone, I lost my bestest friend! All I want to do is cry!
1DI0014345	I dunno, maybe go play with Harold? I wanna hear another one of his super swell stories!
1DI0014346	Look to the future and seek the true meaning of what transpired here. If there's an answer out there somewhere, I'll find it.
1DI0014347	I'll do what I do best. I'll make sure Oasis never falls even if it means my own death.
1DI0014348	Whatever the Tree Father or Leaf Mother would have me do, I'm still theirs to obey.
1DI0014349	I'll remain here and help in anyway that I can. I owe them my life, and I intend to repay that debt until my last breath.
1DI0014350	Please, I must rest a day's time before I can again see into the future... I find the experience quite draining.
1DI0014351	I see four-leaf clovers in the sky with time as their deadliest adversary.
1DI0014352	I see a woman searching in vain for a relative long lost.
1DI0014353	I feel the torment of a man who returns home and discovers the changes his absence has wrought.
1DI0014354	I divine a great document and the passages that changed the face of the world.
1DI0014355	I see four headless men and a being robbed of its dignity.
1DI0014356	I picture a place of great sorrow where men are traded for money and treated like Brahmin.
1DI0014357	I see a selfish man who lives among the clouds playing a dangerous game with the lives of those below him.
1DI0014358	I see a mysterious man and a town on the brink of destruction.
1DI0014359	I divine a group of individuals who society views as monsters and a town suspended above the ground.
1DI0014360	I feel people's hatred and love for a man who hunts men that aren't men.
1DI0014361	I see a great leader whose message carries through time as a rallying cry to the oppressed and a warning to the oppressors.
1DI0014362	I hear the cry of a woman obsessed and the man who desires her.
1DI0014363	I discern a lonely child trapped in a city on fire.
1DI0014364	I divine an endless search for knowledge to help others survive the desolation.
1DI0014365	I see a clash between insects and industry and the men that control them.
1DI0014366	I see a town in need of a savior and a woman in red.
1DI0014367	In what we call the Harvest Month, the Great One creates seeds among his branches within seed pods.
1DI0014368	At the end of this time, the pods open and the seeds are carried quite easily upon the wind. It's quite beautiful.
1DI0014369	Wherever the seeds take purchase, they grow into trees, plants, grass or all manner of wonderful things.
1DI0014370	It's kind of embarrassing really. Once a year, Bob decides he's going to go ahead and start growing these weird pods filled with tiny seeds.
1DI0014371	Well, all it takes is a good wind and the seeds just fly everywhere.
1DI0014372	I call them Herbert's Seeds. He hates that!
1DI0014373	Oh, if only Tree Father Birch saw it as you do! Of everyone, he's been here the longest.
1DI0014374	You'd think he'd realize that this place won't remain a secret forever. The caravans know about it and you found it.
1DI0014375	How long before someone comes to take this place by force? No, I say allow this place to grow and that issue becomes moot.
1DI0014376	You'd think they'd realize that this place won't remain a secret forever. The caravans know about it and you happened upon it.
1DI0014377	How long before someone comes to take this place by force? No, I say allow Oasis to grow and that issue becomes moot.
1DI0014378	Heresy? Not at all. Leaf Mother Laurel's word is just as binding as Tree Father Birch's. I have no obligation to follow one or the other.
1DI0014379	How dare you speak to a Bloomseer like that! I know our laws better than any Outsider would! Now begone!
1DI0014380	Oh, you mean Harold? He's really nice. Sometimes when I get really lonely, I go into the Grove and talk to him.
1DI0014381	Sometimes I even curl up all cozy like and sleep next to his roots after I have a bad dream.
1DI0014382	I tell him what I'm scared of and he tells me what he's scared of. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one.
1DI0014383	That's okay, I like talking about Harold's... he's really nice... he's my best friend!
1DI0014386	He is the Great One. The Tree Father of Tree Fathers. There is no greater being in the world than He.
1DI0014387	I've dedicated my life to protecting this place from the outside world and I will never fail in that duty.
1DI0014388	Well, I'm not so sure the Great One is a god... I mean, I don't believe in that sort of thing.
1DI0014389	However, I am beginning to realize He's special... something greater than any of the creatures in the Wasteland.
1DI0014390	Being in His presence gives me the greatest sense of peace I've ever felt in my entire life.
1DI0014391	Look around you, Outsider. This place wasn't built by man or made by a machine. This place is a miracle and only a god can perform a miracle.
1DI0014392	He's not my god, He's everyone's god. You, me, everyone. This place isn't meant for just the Treeminders, it's for all mankind.
1DI0014393	Like I said, He's everyone's god. This place isn't meant for just the Treeminders, it's for all mankind.
1DI0014394	What?! How can you say something so awful and terrible?! Leave me alone, I never wanna talk to you again!
1DI0014395	Awww, I never knew an Outsider could be scared of anything!
1DI0014396	Harold told me that he's scared of fire. If fire ever got on him, it would burn him and Bob until they were all gone.
1DI0014397	That's why we keep the fires far away from him.
1DI0014401	Sorry, that's only for secrets between friends!
1DI0014402	Hey! He's not a tree! He's my friend! Don't be mean.
1DI0014403	Hey! He's not a monster! You meanie! I never wanna talk to you again!
1DI0014404	I was born here, silly!
1DI0014405	I was brought here by His will. I heard his calling, and I followed.
1DI0014406	I believe only a few are worthy enough to find this place, and I'm honored to be among them.
1DI0014407	That's why I dread the day Oasis overgrows its boundaries.
1DI0014408	I was brought here by His will. I heard his calling, and I followed. Isn't it wonderful?
1DI0014409	I was found dying in the Wastes not far from here by a trader caravan. They knew about this place and brought me to Bloomseer Poplar.
1DI0014410	She nursed me back to health, and I've stayed ever since.
1DI0014411	There isn't much more to the story. I was dying and these people saved my life, so here I'll remain.
1DI0014412	My father was a healer like myself. He had the most curious books I would read about trees and plants and their medicinal properties.
1DI0014413	Many years later, I heard a rumor about a place such as this. I spent a decade in search of it.
1DI0014414	I've been in this wonderful place for over fifteen years now.
1DI0014415	I was an Outsider like yourself... wandering the world aimlessly, wasting my life trying to seek my fortune.
1DI0014416	When my eyes beheld the splendor of Oasis, I knew I'd found a holy place. Tree Father Birch allowed me to stay and I've been here ever since.
1DI0014417	I was a Brotherhood of Steel Outcast. We had a deep patrol out here, looking for some tech and then got jumped by some Deathclaws.
1DI0014418	They shredded everyone else and left me bleeding to death. If it wasn't for Oasis and Bloomseer Poplar, I'd be dead right now.
1DI0014419	Honestly, I've never seen anything like this place... it's beautiful. It's a shame only a few people will ever get to see it.
1DI0014420	I felt I owed these people for bringing me back from the brink.
1DI0014422	You have a lot of nerve! We've shown you nothing but hospitality and then instead of thanks, you chose to hurl insults?
1DI0014423	I'm all for sharing Oasis with the rest of the Wasteland, but if you're an example of what we face in doing so, perhaps it's a mistake!
1DI0014424	Exactly!
1DI0014425	You make me smile, Outsider. It's people like you who give me hope that everyone out there isn't lost.
1DI0014426	I suppose so, but you found it. How many others will stumble across Oasis? Will they be friendly?
1DI0014427	I'm worried Outsider, I'm truly worried.
1DI0014428	And watch as He is prodded and picked apart by those who seek to exploit Him?
1DI0014429	I will never allow that! He must remain safe and we will be His guardians!
1DI0014430	Certainly, please ask them.
1DI0014431	By all means, ask away.
1DI0014432	The Great One has not yet allowed us entry below ground. We were uncertain as to why until you arrived.
1DI0014433	I would if I was able, but He will not allow us entry. His roots bar the door, and we have yet to earn the right to pass.
1DI0014434	Of course I am. I know everything that goes on in Oasis. Laurel is free to pursue whatever path she chooses.
1DI0014435	A long time ago, it was agreed that the Tree Father and the Leaf Mother hold equal say. I don't seek to change those customs.
1DI0014436	I just hope that when the time comes, you'll make the right choice.
1DI0014437	The Liniment was made by Bloomseer Poplar. Her knowledge of His gifts and how they can be used to help us is nothing short of astounding.
1DI0014438	Bloomseer Poplar has a unique understanding of the innate power that lay dormant in the plants you see around you.
1DI0014439	She created the sap with the knowledge she brought to us from the Wasteland.
1DI0014440	The entrance to the caves is to the southwest of the Pavilion.
1DI0014441	You'll find the entrance in the southwestern part of Oasis.
1DI0014442	Actually, you already did some of it. I had to do the Ceremony and meet with the Great One.
1DI0014443	Then Tree Father Birch taught me everything I needed to know about Oasis and how it has to remain a secret.
1DI0014444	That's why I'm so worried. I just think letting this place spread into the Wasteland would be an unwise decision.
1DI0014445	Like I said before, thanks to Tree Father Birch, I learned everything I needed to know about Oasis and how it has to remain a secret.
1DI0014447	Just get born I guess. He he! You're funny!
1DI0014448	I had to accept the ideals of Tree Father Birch and cast away my dependence on technology.
1DI0014449	I sort of fell into it I guess. I woke up here and I just stayed. After a while, I became one of them.
1DI0014450	I was the third one to arrive here in Oasis. Tree Father Birch was a bit wary at first, but Leaf Mother Laurel convinced him to let me stay.
1DI0014451	If she hadn't been around, I doubt Birch would have let me stay here.
1DI0014452	After a while, they taught me their ways and together we developed the Ceremony of Purification that you undertook.
1DI0014453	Please, go right ahead.
1DI0014454	Of course. We're quite open about everything here.
1DI0014455	I'm afraid I can take none of the credit for my husband's creation.
1DI0014456	I arrived perhaps a year after him, well after he established the Treeminders.
1DI0014457	When I first beheld the glory of the Great One, I knew there'd be others who would seek to do Him harm.
1DI0014458	I also knew He would be calling others that he felt were pure of heart to protect Him.
1DI0014459	Right then and there I created the Treeminders... the Great One's last line of defense.
1DI0014460	Without His blessing, we would not allow an Outsider inside this vale.
1DI0014461	If the Outsider doesn't have His blessing, we simply deny him entry to our home.
1DI0014462	If they persist on trying to gain entry, or display any hostile act that could potentially harm the Great One, we take action.
1DI0014463	If the Outsider were a Raider or some other nefarious type, we ensure they don't report our location back to their comrades.
1DI0014464	Although we would welcome you with open arms, you were obviously drawn here to help us.
1DI0014465	What remains to be seen is what that help turns out to be.
1DI0014466	Becoming a disciple of the Great One takes many years of dedication and the will to cast aside your reliance on technological conveniences.
1DI0014467	However, I feel you've been sent here for a higher purpose and could be more instrumental in our future than a mere Treeminder.
1DI0014468	The first part of our name represents our role in the Treeminders. The youngest are the Saplings, still learning what it means to live in Oasis.
1DI0014469	The Branchtenders are our guardians and keep our homes safe. Our healers and soothsayers are known as Bloomseers.
1DI0014470	Finally, the Tree Father and the Leaf Mother are the creators and the upholders of the Great One's laws.
1DI0014471	Exactly! I was out there once like you. I wandered the Wasteland for many years.
1DI0014472	All I saw was poverty, famine, sickness, hate and death everywhere I turned.
1DI0014473	But this place... this place isn't anything like that. We can't let all that evil inside here... we just can't!
1DI0014474	That would worry me. I was out there once like you. I wandered the Wasteland for many years.
1DI0014476	But this place... this place isn't anything like that. We can't allow that kind of evil inside Oasis... we just can't!
1DI0014477	Go tell her what you want, my opinion is my own. That's one of the founding ideals of the Treeminders.
1DI0014478	And being an Outsider, I'd expect you not to judge our laws!
1DI0014479	I'm afraid the water still bears the mark of man's greed. It's His reminder of what we once were.
1DI0014480	Perhaps one day He will see fit to lift this punishment, but I fear we have yet to command His full respect.
1DI0014484	We will now recite the blessing to ward off any harm the Outsider may be carrying before he proceeds to the Grove.
1DI0014485	I bid you depart, agents of destruction, through the power of His divine will.
1DI0014486	Leave our homes and bodies immediately; live no longer in them, but pass over into places where you can harm no one.
1DI0014487	In the name of His Frondescence, I call His wrath upon you, so that, wherever you may go, you bear it with you...
1DI0014488	...and, diminishing from day to day, you may disappear; except where you serve the health and good purposes of mankind, may no trace of you be found.
1DI0014489	All this may He be so good as to grant us, who is to come to judge the living and the dead, and the world by his verdure.
1DI0014490	Amen.
1DI0014491	Soon you will pass peacefully into sleep, Outsider. And when you awake, you will witness His glory first hand.
1DI0014492	All right. What's on your mind?
1DI0014493	You there! Burke! Explain your business in Megaton.
1DI0014494	I'm sorry? Sheriff, what are you hollering about?
1DI0014495	You know damn well what I'm talking about. The bomb! You're trying to blow it up! Have you lost your goddamned mind?
1DI0014496	Sheriff. I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. Someone has surely been spreading rumors. I'll be sure to address the situation... personally.
1DI0014497	I'm placing you under arrest, Burke. At least until I figure out what the hell's going on around here.
1DI0014498	And I'M afraid I won't be able to oblige your request, Sheriff. I have pressing matters to attend to. Now... step aside.
1DI0014499	This isn't open to discussion! You're coming with me.
1DI0014500	Why do you knuckle draggers always insist on doing things the hard way? Very well, Sheriff. Lead the way.
1DI0014501	Well that's mighty decent of you. Just don't, you know... go blowing us up. All right?
1DI0014502	Great! Go ahead and see what you can do. Just be careful.
1DI0014503	You're the one that brought it up. Not me.
1DI0014504	That's pretty steep....  Fine. Do it and you'll get your money. Don't screw up, though, or we'll ALL regret it.
1DI0014505	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, boy! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
1DI0014506	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. Dammit, girl! You picked the wrong man to mess with. Now I've got to put you in the ground.
1DI0014507	He said what?! Oh, I never did like the look of him...
1DI0014508	I told you: Stop playing games with me. Now, run along before I decide to throw you in a cell for disturbing the peace.
1DI0014509	Good point. Come with me. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
1DI0014510	He's long gone by now. But I swear: If he steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a fucking dead man.
1DI0014511	Jesus! Gimme that thing!
1DI0014512	Let's go find this Burke character. You're about to get an education in Wasteland justice.
1DI0014514	Thanks. If Burke steps within a mile of Megaton, he's a dead man.
1DI0014515	You better stop playing games with me, boy!
1DI0014516	You better stop playing games with me, girl!
1DI0014517	Lack the aptitude, you mean? You're not re-wiring the thing, just attaching the Pulse Charge to the detonator.
1DI0014518	If you get stumped, talk to Leo Stahl. He might have something to help you concentrate. He's got a bit of a reputation.
1DI0014519	I thought you knew what you were doing. If it's just nerves, maybe some chems will help. But if you can't handle it, don't go fiddling with it!
1DI0014520	Color me intrigued. Go on...
1DI0014521	Well... I... I mean... Of course not... I must admit, I've never met a woman quite like you before. This changes everything...
1DI0014522	I'm not sure what I'm going to tell Tenpenny... I'll think of something...
1DI0014523	You wait here my dear. I have some important business to attend to. But you won't be waiting long. I shall send for you soon.
1DI0014524	Five hundred you say? Well... Um... Yes. Yes, I think that can be arranged.
1DI0014525	I must admit. I find you... enchanting. Do this for me, and there's no telling how far my gratitude will reach.
1DI0014526	Take the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it into the bomb. Then meet me at Tenpenny Tower. There I will show you what true power is.
1DI0014527	Well played!  An extra 500 caps, in addition to the base fee, when Megaton lies in ruins. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. Place it in the bomb.
1DI0014528	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Any questions?
1DI0014529	Oh. I see. I didn't realize Megaton had any guardian beyond its intrepid sheriff. Very well, then. I'll take my leave, as you suggested.
1DI0014530	Excellent! I had a feeling about you. Here's the Fusion Pulse Charge. It needs to be installed inside the bomb.
1DI0014531	When it's done, meet me at Tenpenny Tower. It's southwest of here, well out of harm's way. You can't miss it. Questions?
1DI0014532	Now that is a disappointment. Well, if you change your mind, the offer still stands. Good day.
1DI0014533	I'm beginning to lose my patience with you. But the offer still stands should you come to your senses.
1DI0014534	Look, Burke. I... I don't care how you got past the others. I could... I could have you torn apart in an instant, with a snap of my fingers!
1DI0014535	Is that so? Do it then, Phillips. Set you feral pets upon me. I could use a bit of sport. After I've dealt with them, I'll turn my attention to you.
1DI0014536	After all, you've destroyed my home, murdered my employer. I've something of a score to settle, wouldn't you say?
1DI0014537	Hey, now, come on... The old man got what he had coming Look, maybe we can work something out. You said you just have some... business to conclude?
1DI0014538	Correct. You and your friends may have killed Tenpenny, but the man gave me a task, and I intend to complete it.
1DI0014539	There's a detonator on the balcony. When that switch is activated, the bomb at the center of Megaton goes... boom. THAT will conclude my business.
1DI0014540	Holy shit, you're gonna blow up Megaton? No lie? Look Burke if you're about to burn down that smoothskin shithole, I ain't gonna stop ya.
1DI0014541	In fact, I... Well, I think it's fair to say you'd be quite welcome around here. So what do you say? You do your thing and we let bygones by bygones.
1DI0014542	All right. Water under the bridge, then. Truth be told, I'm a firm believer in natural selection. What you people did here was... inspired.
1DI0014543	All right then, Burke... er... Mister Burke. I'll let you get to it. And, um, thanks for your... understanding.
1DI0014544	You did WHAT? Are you out of your goddamned mind? Do you have any idea how long we've pained to put this plan into motion?
1DI0014545	Weeks of preparation, destroyed. No words of mine can express my utter contempt for you.
1DI0014546	You have made a very poor error in judgment, my friend. One day... one day it WILL come back to haunt you.
1DI0014547	The undetonated atomic bomb for which this town is named is still very much alive. All it needs is a little motivation.
1DI0014548	I have in my possession a Fusion Pulse Charge constructed for a singular purpose -- the detonation of that bomb.
1DI0014549	You'll rig it to the bomb. Then you'll get paid. Handsomely. What do you say?
1DI0014550	No, no, I'm merely a recruiter. YOU get to have the real fun.
1DI0014552	I have in my possession a Fusion Pulse Charge. Once rigged to the bomb, it will be detonated, by you, at a secure location. Easy money, my friend.
1DI0014553	It seems I have misjudged you. Very well. I'll simply find someone with more entrepreneurial spirit. Good day.          
1DI0014554	You mean besides doing the world a favor by removing this pestilent scab of a town?
1DI0014555	Why, you'd be rewarded most handsomely! My employer is a very generous man. If it's bottle caps and luxury you're seeking. You shall have it!
1DI0014556	I advise you against that particular course of action. If you interfere with my employer's wishes, you will find he can be quite -- disagreeable.
1DI0014557	You would do well to side with my employer in this little matter. Life could otherwise become quite unbearable for you.
1DI0014558	Indeed. A man's word is worth his weight in caps. I suppose I could arrange for a bonus of say, 500 caps in addition to the base fee.
1DI0014560	Absolutely not! The place, the people, they're one and the same! Sacrifices for a nobler future.
1DI0014561	I assure you, they are worth ten times as much in death, as they are in life.
1DI0014562	Finally, someone with a modicum of civility and common sense.
1DI0014563	I represent certain... interests. And those interests view this town, this "Megaton," as a blight on a burgeoning urban landscape.
1DI0014564	You have no connections here. No interest in this cesspool's affairs, or fate. You could assist us in erasing this little accident off the map.
1DI0014565	Don't you see? You're a free agent! You've no ties here, no interest in this settlement's affairs. Megaton means nothing to you!
1DI0014566	I represent certain... interests who view this town, this "Megaton," as a blight on a burgeoning urban landscape.
1DI0014567	If this settlement were to... go away. Why, who would really care? Certainly not you, or I...
1DI0014568	As you wish. I'm looking to employ an individual with no ties to Megaton, no interest in its future.
1DI0014569	Megaton is obsolete. The last vestige of a cobbled, desperate past. It needs to... go away. And you are going to see that it does.
1DI0014570	Great. Another junkie... In case you haven't noticed, this is a clinic, not a candy store. And I've got work to do.
1DI0014571	I'm afraid that goes against patient-doctor confidentiality.
1DI0014572	Megaton might not be Tenpenny Tower, but that doesn't make breaking patient-doctor confidentiality any more ethical, now does it?
1DI0014573	Okay, so we have a resident with a bit of a problem. What makes you so goddamned superior? Hmph. Wastelanders...
1DI0014574	You've made a grievous error in judgement. Watch your back.
1DI0014575	Here. These letters arrived for you while you were gone. I'm not a fucking post office you know.
1DI0014576	Here. These damn love letters have been waiting around for you.
1DI0014577	This letter came for you. I run a saloon, not a post office. But does anyone listen? No. Well, go on take the damn letter already.
1DI0014578	Another of those damn love letters arrived for you.
1DI0014579	I complained off hand one day about how I thought that heap of metal on the horizon was a bit of an eyesore. Mister Burke offered to take care of it.
1DI0014580	Burke is such an agreeable man, isn't he? I don't know how I got along without him. I practically don't have to think about things anymore.
1DI0014581	He takes care of everything. I seldom even have to ask. He's a real go-getter, that one. We need more men like him if we're to rebuild the world.
1DI0014582	Well said! Indeed! You've got the entrepreneurial spirit! It gives me hope to see young people, such as yourself, with real heads on their shoulders.
1DI0014583	Oh no. I'm certainly rather sore about all that. But certain sacrifices must be made.
1DI0014584	Besides, Burke assured me that bomb was quite unstable. I asked Burke to suggest they vacate.
1DI0014585	It was all a matter of time. Think of it as helping speed along the process of natural selection. Don't lose any sleep over it.
1DI0014586	You're an odd one, aren't you?
1DI0014587	Don't let me keep you.
1DI0014589	I don't trust any of the locals to tinker with it. Besides, most people don't even realize it's still a threat.
1DI0014590	And hell, Cromwell and those crazies from the Church of Atom, they worship the damn thing.
1DI0014591	Why? Do you think you got the know-how to disarm it? For good?
1DI0014592	It's not like the place was put up over night. Megaton's been here for decades, been growing and growing ever since.
1DI0014593	Started out as a small settlement of people trying to get into Vault 101. When they were denied, they stuck around here.
1DI0014594	Some of 'em started worshipping the thing like a god. Now we've got a whole goddamn Church. They're nuts, no doubt, but mostly harmless.
1DI0014595	By now, most people don't give a shit. They figure if it ain't gone off by now, it never will. I respectfully disagree.
1DI0014596	Maybe. Maybe...
1DI0014597	So long as you stay away from the bomb, I see my chances of a long life improving. I hope we understand each other.
1DI0014598	Oh, all right. Fine. But listen here. Just take a look at it first. Go easy.
1DI0014599	If you get the job done, there'll be 100 caps in it for you.
1DI0014600	Fine. Enjoy your stay in Megaton. Don't get into any trouble and we'll go on pretending we're friends.
1DI0014601	Oh really? Is that so?
1DI0014602	You may not think much of this town, but you're a guest in my home, and I'd advise you to behave as such.
1DI0014603	I hope I've made myself perfectly clear.
1DI0014604	Friendly AND well-mannered? I think we're gonna get along just fine. You treat my people nice, and you're welcome to stay as long as you'd like.
1DI0014605	So that's the way it's gonna be, huh? That's fine. That's fine...
1DI0014606	Just so long as we understand each other. This here is my town. These are my people. You so much as breathe wrong, and I'm gonna fuckin' end ya.
1DI0014607	The quiet type, huh? Fine. Might help keep you out of trouble. I hope you're not a weirdo. Got enough of those already.
1DI0014608	I'm glad we understand each other. Now, is there something I can help you with?
1DI0014609	You got something you want to prove, boy?
1DI0014610	You got something you want to prove, girl?
1DI0014611	God, I hope you ain't one of those psychotic quiet types. So... is there anything else I can do for you?
1DI0014612	I ain't killed a drifter in weeks. This should be fun!
1DI0014613	I think you're suicidal. Try me.
1DI0014614	Fucking psycho Wastelanders...
1DI0014615	Let's do it, then!
1DI0014616	I've got my eye on you, drifter...
1DI0014617	Well I'll be damned. You're from that vault! Vault 101! Ha ha! I ain't seen one of those jumpsuits in a LONG time!
1DI0014618	I'll be damned. Another newcomer.
1DI0014619	Now that, my friend, is beautiful.
1DI0014620	Well done, Mister Burke! What a grand display of fireworks! I almost wish there was another nuke we could detonate. You don't see that very often.
1DI0014621	I'm glad you're pleased. I had help, of course.
1DI0014622	Quite right. And you are to offer him the reward we discussed. Now... all this bright light and wind has given me quite a thirst. Where's my scotch?
1DI0014623	Quite right. And you are to offer her the reward we discussed. Now... all this bright light and wind has given me quite a thirst. Where's my scotch?
1DI0014624	I'll send someone up as soon as I've completed business with our friend here.
1DI0014625	Righto. And be quick about it! I haven't been dry in years. I'd hate to start now.
1DI0014626	Gob!
1DI0014627	I know, I know. I'll get a mop. It's just... blood is so hard to get out of the floor.
1DI0014628	Well, that's been a long time coming. Good riddance.
1DI0014629	You can tell Tenpenny he can kiss my ass! We got plenty of bottlecaps! Let me in, goddamnit!
1DI0014630	How many times do we have to go through this? You're not getting in!
1DI0014631	I can stand here all day yelling at you through this damn speaker if I have to!
1DI0014632	I've already told you Tenpenny won't allow zombies to live here!
1DI0014633	Who the hell are you calling a zombie?
1DI0014634	You're definitely not human, that's for damn sure. For the last time: NO ZOMBIES ALLOWED!
1DI0014635	Can't tell the difference between me and a feral? Fine. I'll show you the goddamn difference! Just you wait! You'll get yours. All of you!
1DI0014636	There's an emergency entrance to the tunnels, you know for when the bombs fell. We siphon power from the Metro grid to keep our generators running.
1DI0014637	There's no secret. It's just a sensitive area we don't need idiots and assholes screwing around in.
1DI0014639	But I've got better things to do than play tour guide, so unless there's some kind of emergency, this conversation's over.
1DI0014641	I've got the only key, and I ain't lending it to you. I lost it once and had to make a new one. Tenpenny practically bit my head off. So forget it.
1DI0014642	Well, it does get a trifle bit boring around here, and to spice things up I like to do a little... exploring.
1DI0014643	Oh, I always put everything back! Well, almost everything. I occasionally keep a memento... like Gustavo's key to the generator room.
1DI0014644	Have you noticed how he turns a delightful shade of purple when he's angry?
1DI0014645	Well, kid. There're two keys floating around. Which one do you think you can nab without getting caught? Good luck!
1DI0014646	I don't care who you think you are. You're not getting in down there.
1DI0014648	That's awfully brash of you! You think you got what it takes?
1DI0014649	The trick to "exploring" is to make sure no one knows you've done it. My neighbors, for instance, have no idea that I know so much about them!
1DI0014650	I'll make you a deal kid. You can borrow my key, IF you can find it without letting me see you take it. Good luck!
1DI0014652	Don't care. The only way those Ghoul's are getting in is over my dead body.
1DI0014653	Ha! I know EVERYTHING about my neighbors, some things they don't even know themselves. I'm certain that they won't agree to this ridiculous idea.
1DI0014654	And even if they did, I certainly won't!
1DI0014655	Then my neighbors will have lost their minds. Just like you have. Now go away.
1DI0014656	If my neighbors lose their minds and agree to such a thing, then I hope security shoots them in the head with their zombie friends.
1DI0014657	There's no way they'd agree to letting Ghouls live here. We all came here to get away from things like Ghouls, and disease, and all that ugliness.
1DI0014658	Quit bothering me with all this nonsense.
1DI0014659	You're giving me a headache. Isn't there someone else you can pester with your inane ideas?
1DI0014660	Who let you in here in the first place? Does Mister Tenpenny know there's a lunatic walking around his tower?
1DI0014661	Um-hmm. Would you mind bothering someone else? PLEASE!
1DI0014662	Why do you keep bothering me?
1DI0014663	This is outrageous! Preposterous! Forced out by a bunch of dirty Ghouls, and some bleeding heart activist? Where will I live? How will I get there?
1DI0014664	Damn it! This can't be happening! Why do you think I came here in the first place? To get away from Ghouls, monsters, and scum like you.
1DI0014665	Now I'll have to start all over again. Where will I go?
1DI0014666	You horrible little zombie-lover! What right do you and your disgusting buddies have to push honest, hardworking, important people around like that?
1DI0014667	Where do you propose I live?
1DI0014668	Grrr. You'll regret this. I've spent years collecting all this fabulous merchandise. I won't stand for this! Where the hell am I supposed to go?
1DI0014669	I'm done with the Wasteland! And I've been everywhere else. There isn't anything better than this. Damn you and your Ghouls!
1DI0014670	I never forget a slight. Watch your back. I'll be sending someone to pay you a little visit in the future.
1DI0014671	My husband has connections. Watch your back.
1DI0014672	Just you wait. I'll find a way to repay you for this.
1DI0014673	You'll pay for this. Dearly.
1DI0014674	I'm not going. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
1DI0014675	And when he does come back, I'll make sure he's fine with the new arrangement.
1DI0014676	I'll just send up for my food. I'll never even have to look at you or your Ghoul buddies.
1DI0014677	I found a comfortable place, but now I must leave. When I die, it will be on your head.
1DI0014678	I already did. I hope one of your Ghoul buddies kills you. You'll see!
1DI0014679	Don't worry? Did you just step out of a vault? Haven't you seen what's out there? I'm doomed. And it's all your fault!
1DI0014680	The only suitable place is Tenpenny Tower. Everywhere else stinks and caters to low-life scum like you. I'll die out there. I just know it.
1DI0014681	I'm not going anywhere. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
1DI0014684	You'll get yours.
1DI0014685	Yeah right. Watch your back.
1DI0014686	When I die, it'll be your fault.
1DI0014687	Whatever. My death will be on your head.
1DI0014688	I got a plan. I'll talk to Tenpenny. I bet I can live in Burke's place. He's never around anyway.
1DI0014691	Okay. Here's what I have. What do you have?
1DI0014693	This is all I have. I hope it's okay.
1DI0014694	Well, this stuff is mostly crap. But whatever. Oh, and I found some weapons and armor, so I'll be trading in that. It's more useful anyway.
1DI0014695	Alright. Let's see if we can't find something mutually agreeable.
1DI0014697	I'm sure you'll find something agreeable.
1DI0014698	I don't know where they are... but everything is fine. Roy said not to worry about the other residents.
1DI0014699	Oh? Well... They must have done something to deserve that.
1DI0014700	Heh. Roy decided to take out the trash. I'm glad I lost my sense of smell. You'll want to stay clear of the basement storage room.
1DI0014701	Can't say I completely agreed with Roy's decision. Then again, they were a bunch of assholes. No one's innocent, kid. You'd do well to remember that.
1DI0014702	Let's just say those two-faced smoothskins didn't like the new management. So they all got themselves "evicted." Can't say it's a shame.
1DI0014703	They had it coming. But I don't have to justify myself to you, or any other smoothskin. In fact, you'd best piss off if you don't want to join them.
1DI0014704	Well, I feel a lot safer now that those Ghouls have stopped bothering us. That's for sure.
1DI0014705	Our new neighbors aren't so bad after all. And they have big appetites, so that's good for the cafe!
1DI0014706	It's clean and safe -- since those Ghouls left -- and Tenpenny knows how to stock the lounge with the good stuff. Stop by. Share a drink!
1DI0014707	It's swell. Those new neighbors of ours like to drink almost as much as I do and boy, do they have some real good stories!
1DI0014708	It's fine now that those Ghouls are taken care of. I've been treating less cases related to frazzled nerves and upset stomachs.
1DI0014709	People are happy and healthy for the most part. And those Ghouls make great case studies! Did I mention I'm working on an important dissertation...
1DI0014710	It's great. Now that we have a real comrade around here to handle things. I'm appointing a special Security Subcommittee and I want you to chair it!
1DI0014711	Things are going well, I'd say. We've all learned a thing or two about what makes a real community. Don't you think, comrade?
1DI0014712	It's a lot better now with those Ghouls out of the picture!
1DI0014713	I guess I don't mind those Ghouls as much as I thought I would.
1DI0014714	Business is still good!
1DI0014715	Those Ghouls are disgusting, so I just spend all my time up here.
1DI0014716	Now everyone's calmed down and back to their old selves. Not that I cared much for them to begin with, but they've stopped all the Ghoul foolishness.
1DI0014717	They really are quite ignorant here. But where else could I retire and fit all my trophies?
1DI0014718	I'm surprised by my fellow tenants. I used to think they were all closed minded idiots. Turns out they aren't so bad after all.
1DI0014719	Beats the Wasteland and dirty tunnels, that's for damn sure!
1DI0014720	It's wonderful. Roy was right. This is the way to live!
1DI0014721	It's weird actually. I used to vacation here before the bombs dropped. Used to be a resort for the wealthy and powerful.
1DI0014722	I never thought I'd be the one fighting to get in here. Guess way back it used to be a plantation. Ironic isn't it?
1DI0014723	I already got a plan. They think I'm a monster. I'll show them the real monsters!
1DI0014724	We'll unleash our feral brethren on them; all those bigoted sons-of-bitches will get torn apart. Trouble is getting past the damn subway access door!
1DI0014725	You see, there's some kind of escape door that leads from the Tenpenny basement to the subway tunnels. There must be some way to get that open.
1DI0014726	Now you're talking my language. Alright, here's the plan.
1DI0014727	I'll gather up a horde of ferals and wait for you by that escape door. You find a way to get it open and then we'll sit back and enjoy the show!
1DI0014728	Indeed. Remember. I'll be waiting for you to get that door open. Don't keep me waiting long, kid.
1DI0014729	Try it if you like. Go talk to Tenpenny. Ask him he wants us living there.  It won't work. So when you fail, we can do it my way.
1DI0014730	Ha! Those snooty bitches probably can't stand living with each other, let alone with us.
1DI0014731	But by all means, try talking to Tenpenny if you like. But it won't work. Then we'll do it my way.
1DI0014732	You get that escape door in the Tenpenny basement open, and I'll unleash those ferals on 'em!
1DI0014733	You're right. It's none of your business. You best get out of here, kid. Before something ugly happens.
1DI0014734	Not sure where you come from kid, but out here in the Wasteland, everything's up for grabs. And you only get to keep what you can hold onto.
1DI0014735	Tenpenny didn't build that tower. He found it. And took it from whoever used to own it. Now we're gonna take it from him.
1DI0014736	We tried playing nice, but they shot at us. Fuck 'em. It's time for them and their bigot ways to die.
1DI0014737	If I'm no better than Tenpenny, then he should let me into that tower. But he won't. So, I'm busting in.
1DI0014738	That's the smartest thing you've said since you met me.
1DI0014739	You got a lot to learn, kid. A lot. Like for instance how not to piss off an angry Ghoul. You best get out of here, before I get real ugly.
1DI0014740	Oh yeah? Fine. It's on!
1DI0014741	Ghouls aren't built for luxury and comfort, is that it? You think Ghouls belong scurrying around in the dark dank under belly of the Wasteland?
1DI0014742	You got a lot of nerve.
1DI0014743	Well get going, then! Open the door! What's taking you so damn long? Hurry up!
1DI0014744	You think so, do you? Give it a shot kid, but you're dreaming. I'll wait to give you a shot, but then we're doing it my way.
1DI0014745	I'll be damned. Really? Good job kid! I was willing to unleash the Ferals and kill all those bigots. Guess I don't have to now.
1DI0014746	Here's a little something for your troubles, it'll help you deal with our Feral brethren if you meet any.
1DI0014747	I see...  that's smart of you. I'd lay you flat if you tried anything stupid. So don't.
1DI0014748	Tenpenny and his pack of elitist wannabes are in for a real treat soon enough. They can't keep us out of that tower for ever.
1DI0014749	That's awfully decent of you, even if we already knew those bigoted bastards wanted us dead. Talk to Roy Phillips. You might be able to help us out.
1DI0014750	Oh. Hahaha. Sorry. I just assumed...
1DI0014751	Well, most people would prefer if we Ghouls didn't exist. If you want to help us, talk to Roy Phillips.
1DI0014752	Yeah. FUCK YOU!
1DI0014753	Karma's a fucking bitch, isn't she?
1DI0014754	Please don't kill me.
1DI0014755	You picked the wrong Ghoul to fuck with, kid.
1DI0014756	Open your eyes, kid. Does it look like I got a fortune? Now bugger off before I get angry.
1DI0014757	Oh... well... we don't really have much... um...
1DI0014758	HEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!!!
1DI0014759	Me too. Especially rich fine young men!
1DI0014760	Listen, you look like you can handle yourself. You survived out there in the Wasteland getting here, after all. You ever have to deal with Ghouls?
1DI0014761	You got a lot of nerve talking to me like that! But I can respect a woman who doesn't put up with crap.
1DI0014762	Think you're tough enough to take on a couple of Ghouls?
1DI0014763	Hmm... very well. As long as security is aware of your presence. Can't be too careful these days. What with these Ghouls and all.
1DI0014764	Gustavo says he has the situation well in order, but I wonder if he's really trying. Don't suppose you ran into any Ghouls on your way in here?
1DI0014765	Maybe you've heard the GNR radio play? The Adventures of Herbert "Daring" Dashwood? That's about me, you know. Based on my, um... earlier days.
1DI0014766	I even had a Ghoul manservant. Let me ask you -- you ever met a Ghoul before?
1DI0014767	Thanks, comrade. I'm sure you'll agree the people are only as strong as their leader. That's why I do my best to serve the community to the fullest.
1DI0014768	Speaking of service to the community... I don't suppose you are familiar with Ghouls, are you? More importantly, how to kill them?
1DI0014769	I've formed a committee to investigate the problem.
1DI0014770	Oh, fine. We'll have to share a drink sometime. I'm always in the Federalist Lounge. There's certainly plenty to drink about.
1DI0014771	Take those Ghouls for example...
1DI0014772	Don't suppose you know anything about dealing with their kind, do you?
1DI0014773	You're better mannered than your apparent breeding would indicate. It is nice to make your acquaintance.
1DI0014774	You didn't happen to catch a glimpse of any Ghouls on your way here did you?
1DI0014775	Do you know he tried forming a committee to discuss the Ghoul situation? A committee! He made himself Chairman, of course.
1DI0014776	What we need is somebody to DO something! Not just talk about it.
1DI0014777	Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
1DI0014778	Your loss. You fancy yourself a man of action? Think you're man enough to handle a couple of Ghouls?
1DI0014779	Are you calling me ugly? Nice try. I got a pile of bottlecaps that say otherwise.
1DI0014780	I bet you think you're pretty butch, eh? Think you got what it takes to kill a few Ghouls?
1DI0014781	There's no need to get snippy with me, boy!
1DI0014782	We're all little perturbed on account of those Ghouls. Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
1DI0014783	There's no need to get snippy with me, girl!
1DI0014784	We're all little perturbed because of those Ghouls. Don't suppose you know anything about Ghouls, do you?
1DI0014785	Got a fire up your butt, eh? Better put that to good use. Go out exploring. Don't hang around these fools. You'll only want to blow your brains out.
1DI0014786	Ah, to be young again. You know the G.N.R. radio play? The Adventures of Herbert 'Daring' Dashwood? That's about me. Based on my... early days.
1DI0014787	I had myself a Ghoul manservant and everything. So... you ever met a Ghoul before?
1DI0014788	Ah, but not everyone has common sense. Do they?
1DI0014789	True happiness flows from respecting those in charge, because they have the happiness of the people at heart.
1DI0014790	For example, I've appointed a committee to discuss this problem with the Ghouls trying to get in here. You know anything about Ghouls?
1DI0014791	Well, then you'll excuse me if I don't invite you to share a drink?
1DI0014792	Really, you're as much fun as a couple of Ghouls... They're trying to get in here you know. Don't suppose you've ever had to deal with Ghouls before?
1DI0014793	Tsk. Tsk. You were raised by beasts weren't you? Poor thing.
1DI0014794	Did those Ghouls send you here to torment us civilized folk?
1DI0014795	Seriously though, they have everyone on edge. So mind your manners!
1DI0014796	Ha! You try being married to my husband for five minutes. I dare you!
1DI0014797	I'd rather live with those Ghouls... well, okay, not really. But still.
1DI0014798	Did you happen to see any Ghouls out there in the Wasteland? You know how to kill one?
1DI0014799	The strong silent type, eh? We're in luck! Ever met a Ghoul before?
1DI0014800	Can't find your tongue? Maybe one of those Ghouls got it. Didn't your mother tell you never to kiss a Ghoul?
1DI0014801	Seriously though. You better watch out. There's a pack of those vermin hiding in some tunnels nearby. You afraid of Ghoulies, little girl?
1DI0014802	Not very lively are you? Perhaps you're just bored. You should go on an adventure. Nothing like a little bit of the unknown to motivate a person.
1DI0014803	That's what I did. In my... younger years. You know the G.N.R. radio play? The Adventures of Herbert 'Daring' Dashwood? That's about me.
1DI0014804	Hell, I even had me a Ghoul manservant. Let me ask you -- you ever met a Ghoul before?
1DI0014805	Someone needs to talk to Tenpenny. I don't think security should let people like you just wander in like that.
1DI0014806	We all need to be more vigilant with those Ghouls on the loose. Don't suppose you ran into any on your way in here, did you? Hmm?
1DI0014807	Not very bright, are you? Don't worry, comrade. Even the least of us have some small though important role to play in the community.
1DI0014809	I'm glad to meet someone who doesn't want to talk my ear off. We should get a drink together. I hate when people talk while I'm drinking. Don't you?
1DI0014810	And there's plenty to drink about, er talk about, isn't there? Everyone's always prattling on about the Ghouls this, and the Ghouls that.
1DI0014811	Frankly I'm getting fed up with all this Ghoul talk... How about you? You know much about Ghouls?
1DI0014812	Just as I thought. The end of the world happens, and everyone forgets their manners. I bet you were raised in one of those Vault things. Agh!
1DI0014813	Or worse, raised by a pack of disgusting Ghouls!
1DI0014814	You know much about Ghouls?
1DI0014815	Is there something you want? If not, I'm busy telling my neighbors to ignore my husband and his silly committee to discuss the Ghoul situation.
1DI0014816	You ever have to deal with Ghouls before?
1DI0014817	Look kid. I don't care what you think about them. Unless Tenpenny says otherwise. They aren't allowed in here. End of story. Quit wasting my time.
1DI0014818	You're exactly the kind of man we need around here!
1DI0014819	Chief Gustavo and his pack of goons aren't doing their job. Those Ghouls keep coming back! Somebody's bound to get hurt sooner or later.
1DI0014820	Now you're talking. I've met a couple tough broads like you before. You might be just what we need around here.
1DI0014822	I bet you could. Talk to Gustavo. He could use someone like you. You could kill those Ghouls in the tunnels. Get rid of them once and for all!
1DI0014823	That's rather extreme, though near enough to the truth. Talk to Gustavo. He might be able to use you in the fight against the Ghouls.
1DI0014824	Really? Fantastic! You can give that Gustavo a lesson or two!
1DI0014825	Oh my. It sounds like you might be just the person we need to take care of the situation. Talk to Gustavo.
1DI0014826	That doesn't surprise me. You should talk to Gustavo. He might be able to use someone like you.
1DI0014827	I wasn't meaning to imply they should be slaughtered... though, I suppose these days, that might be the best solution.
1DI0014828	Wow! You're a brutal thing aren't you... You're right, of course. You should offer to help Gustavo and his troopers in fighting those Ghouls.
1DI0014829	That's wonderful, comrade! Truly wonderful! Before you go Ghoul hunting, talk to Gustavo. He might be able to help you.
1DI0014830	That's terrific! A real man of action. That's just what we need!
1DI0014831	Well. Then you know that some Ghouls aren't feral, and can be reasoned with.
1DI0014832	Those Ghouls that keep trying to get into Tenpenny. They need to stop, before someone gets hurt. I think they live in the nearby Metro tunnels...
1DI0014833	Neither am I! I came here to get away from all that!
1DI0014834	Look. I know you just got here, but... we could really use your help. I could use your help...
1DI0014835	Someone really needs to take care of those Ghouls once and for all. Gustavo and his goons aren't doing the job.
1DI0014837	Something tells me you're a pretty tough chick. You made it in from the Wasteland after all. We could really use you're help around here.
1DI0014839	There must be something we can do. Talk to Gustavo, he might have some way for you to assist us in dealing with the problem.
1DI0014840	They do seem a bit anti-social don't they?
1DI0014841	Though perhaps if we got them good and liquored up...
1DI0014842	Indeed. Loathsome creatures aren't they? Someone really ought to put them out of their misery. You should talk to Gustavo about exterminating them.
1DI0014843	Perhaps you are smarter than appearances credit.
1DI0014844	Yeah, it's what keeps those Ghouls from coming in.
1DI0014845	Ha ha ha! You bet. But who would dare touch them to give it to them?
1DI0014846	Well, I'll try to not be bothered then... and perhaps you should speak to comrade Gustavo about getting rid of them altogether.
1DI0014847	Yeah. They make me nervous. They certainly are disturbing looking.
1DI0014848	If you weren't a child, I'd show you what this old man can do!
1DI0014849	Well, that's not very brave, though it's not a bad policy either. If you decide to conquer your fear of Ghouls by killing a couple, talk to Gustavo.
1DI0014850	Fine. Never mind. I thought you were a real man. Turns out you're just a scared little boy.
1DI0014851	That's just what I thought. You're a scared little girl.
1DI0014852	What? Have you lost your mind?
1DI0014853	I guess I never thought of it that way. It's probably really hard just living day to day like that. Now I feel a little ashamed.
1DI0014854	Oh. I see. Well. I've never met one, so I wouldn't know. I just always thought... I guess I really don't know what I thought...
1DI0014855	Then you obviously don't know anything about Ghouls.
1DI0014856	I do hope you're not referring to me! I'm certainly a better conversationalist than some stupid Ghoul. And I smell better, too!
1DI0014857	Well, umm. I guess I must confess... I've never examined a Ghoul up close... you're right. I shouldn't make assumptions.
1DI0014858	That's a silly question. What I have against Ghouls, is that they are Ghouls!
1DI0014859	Perhaps you're right. My wife is always going on about how crazy I make her.
1DI0014860	I wish I could. I get nightmares from time to time.
1DI0014861	Ah... you've already learned some wisdom in your youth. Congratulations!
1DI0014862	Oh my God! This can't be real... But it's in his handwriting. Oh my God!
1DI0014863	He's dead. I'll kill him. And her. They're both dead.
1DI0014864	This isn't happening. This isn't real...
1DI0014865	I'm getting impatient.
1DI0014866	You've become a bit of a bore, haven't you? Go away!
1DI0014867	What? Where did they go? Strike that. I don't really care. If they don't want to live here, that's their own business.
1DI0014868	Let the Ghouls move in here. But I expect them to pay and obey the rules like everyone else.
1DI0014869	It's a bit crass, but here's a little something for your troubles.
1DI0014870	Well, if my tenants want Ghoul neighbors, they can have them! Though the Ghouls must pay and follow the rules like everyone else.
1DI0014871	You're a clever one aren't you? I'm glad this situation has been resolved!
1DI0014873	Indeed. Though Tenpenny has put a lot of work into restoring it. And he's hired security to keep us safe.
1DI0014874	But they seem to be having some trouble with a pack of Ghouls living in the tunnels nearby.
1DI0014875	Don't suppose you've encountered many Ghouls on your travels?
1DI0014876	Indeed! Everyone who lives here has worked hard to get here.
1DI0014877	That's why we can't just let those ghouls in. They demand the right to live here, but what have they done to prove themselves worthy?
1DI0014878	Tenpenny is very selective about who he allows to live here. The correct genes and living conditions make for a relatively disease free environment.
1DI0014879	Clean water is still a concern, of course, but we've got enough chems to keep the radiation sickness at bay.
1DI0014880	That's why he won't allow those Ghouls to live here. Why introduce a weakness into a healthy system?
1DI0014881	And you can thank me for that. I'm the resident guide to all things fabulous.
1DI0014882	And I'll tell you what isn't ever in style... disgusting Ghouls getting their rotting paws all over everything.
1DI0014883	I've never been in prison, so I wouldn't know. All I know is that I'm safe in here. Out there you got all kinds of nastiness. Like those Ghouls.
1DI0014884	You ever run into Ghouls in your travels?
1DI0014885	Lucky? Perhaps I should feel lucky. But really, we've all worked hard to get what we have. I think it's fair to say we DESERVE to live here.
1DI0014886	Those Ghouls on the other hand... they think they can just take whatever they want. Well, they have to earn the right to live here.
1DI0014887	I'm not sure what you are trying to imply... but it's no crime to be paid for doing work. Tenpenny charges me rent too, you know.
1DI0014888	In a perfect world, health care would be free... but since you've traveled through the Wastes out there, you know it's not a perfect world. Is it?
1DI0014889	Take those Ghouls out there. Tenpenny won't let them live here. Sure, it's a little sad, but that decision is keeping people in here safe and sound.
1DI0014890	People ARE dying to get in here. Like those dirty Ghouls... or at least they should be dying. Security has got to get their act together.
1DI0014891	But luck has nothing to do with it. We deserve this. All of it. Not everyone is as smart, as pretty, or as wealthy as the cream of the crop.
1DI0014892	Don't blame me. Blame mother nature. Survival of the fittest. It's the game of life. We're the winners. And those Ghouls, they are definitely losers.
1DI0014893	Not used to civilized discourse, eh? You're from out there in the Wasteland, right? You must be pretty tough to survive out there. Ever kill a Ghoul?
1DI0014894	You're lucky they even let you in here. I'm surprised they did, since it will only encourage those Ghouls who want to live here.
1DI0014895	They don't understand they need to earn the right to live here.
1DI0014896	If you don't mind, I have better things to do.
1DI0014897	Like fixing up some pills to keep the residents bolstered against whatever diseases those Ghouls bring with them when they bang on the gate.
1DI0014898	You are in definite need of an attitude adjustment. Like those God-awful Ghouls scrabbling at the gate all the time.
1DI0014899	Someone must do something to get rid of those vermin once and for all!
1DI0014900	Really? That'd be wonderful. Talk to Chief Gustavo about it.
1DI0014901	Yeah? Talk to Gustavo. He may wish to employ your assistance.
1DI0014902	Really? It's your funeral I suppose. You'll want to discuss it with Chief Gustavo first.
1DI0014903	Really? How? Wait! I don't really want to know - it probably entails something wickedly awful - just talking about it will give me the jeepers.
1DI0014904	Chief Gustavo will want to know you will help. He might even be able to offer you something for your troubles.
1DI0014905	I wish you luck. You'll want to talk to Chief Gustavo first. He may be able to lend you a soldier or two.
1DI0014906	Really? Perhaps you can. We'd all be terribly grateful. Chief Gustavo will want to know you're willing to help.
1DI0014907	Hmm. You're certainly welcome to try, aren't you? Talk to Chief Gustavo.
1DI0014908	Excellent. Speak with comrade Gustavo. He'll know what to do.
1DI0014909	Really? Chief Gustavo is going to want to hear about that. You should talk to him right away.
1DI0014910	You're something else. Not like these other losers.
1DI0014911	Hmm. We might get to be friends after all. You're not so bad.
1DI0014912	Aha! An adventurous soul like myself. If I wasn't retired, I might come with you myself.
1DI0014913	If you can do a better job than Chief Gustavo, perhaps you can go enlighten him. I have important matters to attend to. If you'll excuse me?
1DI0014914	I hope I don't have to find out... though, everyone loves my cooking.
1DI0014915	Look around... what else is there to do?
1DI0014916	Hmph. Well I... I just remembered I have something important to do. Goodbye.
1DI0014917	What? Why, I do believe you are being quite rude! Goodbye.
1DI0014918	Well... not exactly. But my colleagues have published papers...
1DI0014919	I suppose I someone ought to verify their findings... Perhaps I'll do that. Who knows? I might even finally get published!
1DI0014920	Well... I just thought... Never mind.
1DI0014921	What are you suggesting by that? I don't think I like your tone!
1DI0014922	Are you mocking me, comrade?
1DI0014923	Perhaps you're right. But, I prefer to keep my nightmares a fantasy and not test my luck with the real thing. Thank you very much.
1DI0014924	I was hoping we could get to know each other better. What was I thinking?
1DI0014925	I was hoping we could get along. What was I thinking?
1DI0014926	You're lucky old men learn patience. But keep pushing your luck and I'll teach you a thing or two.
1DI0014927	Ahem. I advise you to speak more civilly. Perhaps you can go enlighten Chief Gustavo. I have pressing "evil minion" things to do.
1DI0014928	Those Ghouls got you scared too, huh?
1DI0014930	We shall simply have to ignore them until they bugger off.
1DI0014931	It's more than just interesting. It's positively horrible!
1DI0014932	If you don't mind, I have something things to attend to.
1DI0014933	Yeah. Thanks.
1DI0014934	I suppose it is, isn't it?
1DI0014935	That's not the word I'd use for it, comrade.
1DI0014936	I wish I was as unconcerned as you.
1DI0014937	You're a bit of a loser, aren't you?
1DI0014938	Don't care? You might one day.
1DI0014939	If there's nothing else, I have better things to be doing right now.
1DI0014940	Yeah right. Good luck soldier. I'm not coming after you to rescue your ass if you get in trouble. You're on your own.
1DI0014941	Roy Phillips and his gang are somewhere in Warrington Station Metro tunnels. They've barred the main entrance. Try going through the train yard.
1DI0014942	Here, you can take this rifle and ammo. But don't waste it shooting at shadows.
1DI0014944	Well... maybe you're right. It was something I was going to have to do eventually anyway. How about another 200 caps?
1DI0014945	And here. You can take this rifle and ammo.
1DI0014946	But you better not screw this up!
1DI0014948	You're out of line. Those filthy bitches can stay living in those metro tunnels. They'll move in here over my dead body.
1DI0014949	Quite right! You're not such a moron after all.
1DI0014950	Are you threatening me? You're obviously an idiot, so I'll let that one slide. But I'm warning you, I won't hesitate to kill you if I have to.
1DI0014952	Tenpenny doesn't care how big their pile of bottlecaps is. He won't let Ghouls live here. Those Ghouls need to give up and go bother someone else.
1DI0014953	That's right. You never know when they'll go zombie on your ass. Perhaps you're smarter than you look.
1DI0014954	Your bleeding heart is liable to get you in a lot of trouble one day.
1DI0014955	Look kid, eventually all Ghouls go zombie on your ass. It's only a matter of time.
1DI0014956	Kill them when you find them. It's a win-win. You put them out of their misery, and save someone else from getting torn apart.
1DI0014957	No, but perhaps it might be.
1DI0014958	You serious? You don't know what a Ghoul is?
1DI0014959	A goddamn disaster waiting to happen that's what they are.
1DI0014960	Sure, maybe you can get over the fact they look like someone took a cheese grater to their face. But it's what you don't see that's the problem.
1DI0014961	The radiation slowly eats away their brain, then they go zombie on you. It's better for everyone to kill them before all that, if you ask me.
1DI0014962	Well, that's how most people feel, certainly. Talk to Security Chief Gustavo. He's managing the "Ghoul situation."
1DI0014963	So why the hell would you even suggest such a retarded idea? Are you done wasting my time?
1DI0014964	It best not to dwell on such things.
1DI0014965	In time, after Tenpenny's projects have come to fruition, things like Ghouls and other deformations nature will be a thing of the past.
1DI0014966	I agree, though I wonder if they can help it. They seem rather pathetic, don't they? It seems like a horrible way to have to live.
1DI0014967	So I've heard. I have to wonder though, if they are all mindless killing machines, why do some of them want to be treated like humans so badly?
1DI0014968	Indeed they are. Someone really should put them all out of there misery, don't you think?
1DI0014969	So why would you even suggest they live here? Or were you kidding?
1DI0014970	Hahaha! That's funny.
1DI0014971	I'm not afraid. Just cautious. But perhaps you're right. It's better not to take chances.
1DI0014972	Quite right. Perhaps you're not as stupid as you seem.
1DI0014973	You don't have to tell me that.
1DI0014974	Indeed, comrade. Indeed. I wonder though, if they might also need their own community?
1DI0014975	I think so. I mean, something that ugly must be evil... right?
1DI0014976	They sure are, so why suggest they move in here? Or, were you joking? Well, you aren't very funny.
1DI0014977	Yes. Many will chew off your arm if given the chance. It's true. But they aren't all bad.
1DI0014978	Ha! I don't suppose I'd mind terribly if Ghouls were to live here. And it'd be a good bit of sport hunting them down if they misbehaved.
1DI0014979	I dare say though, you'll have a bit of trouble convincing certain residents to go along with your novel proposition.
1DI0014980	Tell you what. If you can convince  Mr. and Mrs. Wellington, Mr. Ling, Ms. Montenegro, and Ms. Lancaster, those Ghouls can live here.
1DI0014981	Have you seen me shoot? I'm quite proficient, if I do say so myself.
1DI0014982	He'd be out of his goddamn mind... but like I said. Ultimately I work for him, so whatever he says, goes. But I wouldn't like it.
1DI0014983	In time, after Tenpenny's projects have come to fruition, things like ghouls and other aberrations of nature will be a thing of the past.
1DI0014984	These times are the crucible for a glorious future. One shouldn't be overly concerned with who gets burned in the process.
1DI0014985	I don't know. As long as they don't cause trouble. And they'd have to try to fit in with our established community.
1DI0014986	I guess I'd be willing to give it a try.
1DI0014987	Really? Well... As long as they don't bother me... I guess,  I really don't care.
1DI0014988	I'm afraid that I can't abide by that. I can't imagine Tenpenny would allow it. But I certainly won't.
1DI0014989	Ha! I think I know a fair share more than some vagrant blown in off the Wastes. You are simply mistaken.
1DI0014990	They may appear nice, but deep down they want to kill. It's common knowledge among the educated.
1DI0014991	You clearly don't know what you are talking about!
1DI0014992	Well... If they don't mind me giving them a thorough exam and if they agree to follow any directives I give them regarding health and hygiene...
1DI0014993	I suppose I wouldn't mind too terribly. It'd give me a chance to study Ghoul physiology.
1DI0014994	I think you must have been out in the sun too long. Perhaps I could sell you a nice hat to keep your brain from frying?
1DI0014995	Why would you hang out with dirty vermin like that? You enjoy sifting through feces?
1DI0014996	You know it's only a matter of time before they get hungry and eat you. You're crazy. Ghouls will never live in Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0014997	Well, perhaps you're right, comrade. Some of these folk have a few things to learn about camaraderie, that's for sure.
1DI0014998	Well... alright. I'm willing to give them a chance.
1DI0014999	Well... you seem like you know what you're talking about. I guess I'd be willing to give it a try. I might not spend much time with them.
1DI0015000	And if they do anything stupid, I'm sure they'll get kicked out. Fine, it's ok.
1DI0015001	Well, if you don't mind their stink, then you should go squat with them in their dirty tunnels, and leave us civilized people alone.
1DI0015002	Like I said, it's fine by me.
1DI0015003	I guess so. Sure.
1DI0015004	What the hell? Sure.
1DI0015005	Sure. No problem.
1DI0015006	Alright, comrade. We'll welcome them into the community.
1DI0015008	Of course! I wonder if they've ever been to Underworld. Now there's an interesting vacation destination!
1DI0015009	Damn it! Whatever... I'll freaking sign it. They can move into my old place. Burke's digs are better than mine anyway. Not that you'll lever know!
1DI0015010	I must say, you can be quite the bore. Run along and pester someone else.
1DI0015011	Are you done wasting my time?
1DI0015012	Apathy is a condition of the present blight. In the future men will have passion and ideals again. Like Mister Tenpenny. Now, if you'll excuse me.
1DI0015013	You're a little weird, aren't you?
1DI0015014	You're the one that asked the question. If you don't mind, I'd like to get another drink.
1DI0015015	Don't you have somewhere else you can go? Must you bother me?
1DI0015016	I don't suppose you can find someone else to talk to?
1DI0015017	My time is very important to me. I don't suppose you can waste your's somewhere else?
1DI0015018	Is there something I can help you with? If not, why don't you find somewhere else to be?
1DI0015019	Don't you have something better to do?
1DI0015020	I have something to do, comrade. If you'll excuse me...
1DI0015021	I just remembered I need to be someplace else.
1DI0015022	Has anyone told you how annoying you are?
1DI0015023	Don't start conversations you aren't interested in finishing.
1DI0015024	Why - I do believe you've lost your mind! Ghouls, living here? You're serious?
1DI0015025	Great job kid! Meet me around front. I have something for you to keep the ferals from gnawing on your ass!
1DI0015026	I had a feeling you'd be coming, deep in my angry bones, I just knew it. We're all set, just get that door open!
1DI0015027	Come on kid, get that door open!
1DI0015028	I'm counting on you, get that door open!
1DI0015029	What's the hold up?
1DI0015030	Get this door open already!
1DI0015031	I'm afraid Tenpenny and I had little disagreement. Not to worry though. He soon had a little "accident." Problem solved.
1DI0015032	You broke your sacred promise.
1DI0015033	What are you talking about dear? Is everything alright?
1DI0015034	Let me remind you... 'Till death do us part.
1DI0015035	Yeah. Yeah. Go on up, hotshot. Just don't screw around, or things will get ugly. No second chances. Got it?
1DI0015036	I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I'd like you to test it out for me. Should make getting slaves easier.
1DI0015037	You take this Mezzer. Shoot it at some poor schmuck. While he's in la-la-land, you slip one of these collars over his head.
1DI0015038	Be careful with that collar. It'll explode if you tinker with it. Tell the slave to boot it over here pronto, or his head'll pop.
1DI0015039	Here's a list of special targets Eulogy wants enslaved. But feel free to put a collar on anyone you can. I'll pay you for each slave that arrives.
1DI0015040	Fine. I didn't think you would anyway. You done bothering me yet? Piss off!
1DI0015041	Alright. Whatever you say, boss; it's your loss. But you can make a pile of caps. Let me know when you change your mind.
1DI0015042	Okay, fine. But just this once. Here's another collar. Be more careful this time.
1DI0015043	Try to be more careful next time.
1DI0015044	You ain't got enough caps, asshole. This ain't a soup kitchen, and those collars ain't easy to come by. Come back when you got some money.
1DI0015045	I'm a slave now?!?! Don't kill me please! I'm going!
1DI0015046	A slave? I don't remember being a slave... Which way is that again?
1DI0015047	Oh... that sounds painful... Okay, which way is Paradise Falls again?
1DI0015048	The Slavers? I'm a slave? How did this happen?!
1DI0015049	My pockets? I'm not sure. Here take a look...
1DI0015050	My stuff? Okay.
1DI0015051	Huh? Sure, take a look.
1DI0015052	Okay, okay. Here.
1DI0015053	Money? I'm a slave? Where's this Paradise Falls? This collar will explode won't it? I've heard about these things.
1DI0015054	Oh that sounds bad. I need my head. Where's Paradise Falls?
1DI0015055	Huh? Paradise Falls? Where's that?
1DI0015056	Nothing personal? But I'm a person! ... I'm going, I'm going... don't hurt me!
1DI0015057	Jeesuz, do you ever shut the hell up? What do you want to know?
1DI0015058	It's got a radio signal we monitor here at Paradise Falls. If a slave's going the wrong direction, we push a button, and boom. His head pops.
1DI0015059	Once you get a collar on, you can't take it off in the field. They're wired to blow if anyone tinkers with it. So don't.
1DI0015060	Look. I gave you that Mesmetron thing. Should be a piece of cake.
1DI0015061	Hell, if you hit them with that thing and it works, I bet they'd put it on themselves if you asked.
1DI0015062	I don't care who the hell you put it on. I'll split the commission with you for any slave you send to us.
1DI0015063	But you can't just walk up to someone and put it on. You need to get them subdued first. I gave you that mezzer. Use it. Should make things easy.
1DI0015064	Damn. I thought you were finally going to shut up. What do you want now?
1DI0015065	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Go any farther and you're a dead man. I ain't warning you twice.
1DI0015066	You ain't allowed up there, you hear me? Take one more step and they'll be scraping you off the pavement. Ain't gonna warn you again.
1DI0015067	Yeah, okay. Be a smart ass. See where that gets ya...
1DI0015069	There's two kinds of people who get into Paradise Falls. Slaves and Slavers.
1DI0015070	So, unless you're looking to become a slave, piss off.
1DI0015073	You "want to look around?" Where the hell do you think you are? Stop wasting my time, asshole.
1DI0015075	My "problem" is I got a goddamn job to do. And that's keeping assholes and morons from bothering Eulogy Jones and his enterprise.
1DI0015076	And I'm not sure which you are. I'm thinking moron, 'cause a smart man would have pissed off by now.
1DI0015077	You want to give me a reason I don't end you right this second? All your yapping is giving me a headache!
1DI0015079	And I'm not sure which you are. I'm thinking moron, 'cause a smart chick would have pissed off by now.
1DI0015081	What I "need" is for you to piss off.  Eulogy Jones doesn't have time for putting up with morons and assholes like you. That's my job.
1DI0015082	But even I got limits, and all your yapping is giving me a migraine. Give me some reason I shouldn't just end you, right here and now.
1DI0015083	Hmm.  Maybe I could use someone like you. Think you can round up some assets for Eulogy Jones? Might get you into Paradise.
1DI0015084	Think you got what it takes, do you? Hmm...
1DI0015085	Yeah. I might have something you can do for me. If you don't screw it up, maybe I can get you into Paradise. Think you can round us up some assets?
1DI0015086	You don't give up, do you? Hmm... Maybe I have something you can do for me, and if you don't screw it up, maybe I'll help you into Paradise.
1DI0015087	Think you got what it takes to round up some slaves?
1DI0015088	Are you for real? You come up to a man's place of business, and you don't even know who he is?
1DI0015089	He's The Man. Runs Paradise Falls. He's the real deal. Definitely not someone you want to mess with.
1DI0015090	But Eulogy doesn't waste his time with morons. So piss off before I put you in the dirt.
1DI0015091	I'm glad you asked! I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I want you to test it out for me. A little research project.
1DI0015094	You got all that? I hate repeating myself.
1DI0015095	That Mesmetron came with some kind of manual. I don't have time for that bullshit, so you better know how to read.
1DI0015096	One more thing. I got this Mesmetron thing. It's some kind of stun gun. I want you to test it out for me. A little research project.
1DI0015101	What?! After all that yapping about wanting to get in, and you're just going to walk away? Why didn't you do that in the first place?!
1DI0015102	Go on. Piss off already! Or do you want to get shot?
1DI0015103	That's it. You're done wasting my time. Time to die asshole.
1DI0015105	Maybe you would fit in around here.
1DI0015106	Eulogy's got a special contract out on a few VIPs. You bring them in, I'll split the commission with you.
1DI0015107	You might fit in after all.
1DI0015108	Eulogy's got a special contract out on a few VIPs. I'm too damn busy or I'd go get them myself.
1DI0015109	I'll split the commission with you. And don't you get all bitchy. Do this for me, and I'll get you into Paradise.
1DI0015110	Okay, hotshot. We'll see how you do. Eulogy's got a few special contracts he wants filled. I'm too busy or I'd grab them myself.
1DI0015111	If you don't screw it up, I might even split the commission with you.
1DI0015112	Oh, I see. You're some kind of hot shot? Fine. Here's the deal.
1DI0015113	Eulogy's got a few special contracts he wants filled. I'm too busy or I'd grab them myself. So you're going to do it for me.
1DI0015114	Do this for me, and I'll get you into Paradise. And if you don't screw it up, I might even split the commission with you.
1DI0015115	I promise, nobody I'm sending you after is "innocent". Whatever that means.
1DI0015116	Eulogy's got a special contract out for a few ...VIPs. You get them for me, and we'll split the commission. Deal?
1DI0015117	You don't honestly believe anyone out there in the Wasteland is innocent, do you?
1DI0015118	If you can't stomach the business, then don't get into it in the first place. Assuming you're still interested...
1DI0015119	Eulogy's got a special contract out for a few VIPs. I'm too busy or I'd get them myself. You get them for me, and I let you in. Deal?
1DI0015120	Oh no? I'm crushed. Heart broken. Here I thought we could be best friends for life.
1DI0015121	Quit wasting my time! Now, piss off before I start shooting!
1DI0015122	What?! That's it asshole. I'm done playing around with you. You've wasted enough of my time. I've tried to be nice. But you kept pushing me.
1DI0015123	What's wrong with you? Didn't you learn your lesson last time?
1DI0015124	Hmm... Eulogy's pretty picky about who gets on the Paradise Falls crew, and the interview process is pretty damn painful.
1DI0015125	But maybe we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement, just the two of us. You think you got what it takes?
1DI0015126	10 more batteries. Don't waste them, these things don't grow on trees you know.
1DI0015127	Dumbass. You did waste them, didn't you?
1DI0015128	Will you stop wasting my time?
1DI0015129	How the hell should I know? I found it in some old military base. It's a gun, ain't it? Point it at someone and pull the trigger.
1DI0015130	Did you even look at the manual? You like wasting my time, don't you?
1DI0015131	Found it in a box locked up in some old military base. I've been meaning to test it out, but Eulogy keeps me so busy, I don't got time.
1DI0015132	Besides, glancing at that manual, looks like it's a bit... unstable. Thanks for testing it out for me!
1DI0015133	If you got more questions, read the shit I gave you. If you can't read, go find a group of Raiders to hang with. I don't waste time with idiots.
1DI0015134	You wasted everything I gave you already? Jesus. Whatever. I'll sell you 10 more for 200 caps. Take it or leave it.
1DI0015135	Suit yourself. Not like it's coming out of my paycheck. I'll sell you 10 for 200 caps. Take it or leave it.
1DI0015136	Yeah... Good idea. Okay. Here you go.  I'm pretty tired all of a sudden. I can't even think straight.
1DI0015137	Huh? ...I do? I don't think so, but go ahead and take a look if you want.
1DI0015138	Magic trick? Like... like you'll make something disappear? Sure, I'd like to see you do that.
1DI0015139	A thief? Yeah... I'm feeling a little out of it... Maybe you better hold onto this stuff, you know, to keep it safe or whatever.
1DI0015140	Huh? A slave collar? What are you talking about?
1DI0015141	Oh... alright... this thing's heavy!
1DI0015142	Sure... what's this thing for anyway?
1DI0015143	Okay... Hey, this thing feels weird. Can I take it off now?
1DI0015144	Whoa! What is it? It's heavy! Oh... What friends are you talking about? Do I know them?
1DI0015145	What? Oh. Okay.
1DI0015146	I... I don't know... Where am I?
1DI0015147	Who are you again?
1DI0015148	Huh? Maybe... Yeah...
1DI0015149	Great! I was wondering when you'd finally shut-up.
1DI0015150	Good. All this chit-chat is giving me a headache.
1DI0015151	Oh... I don't know... okay. Yeah. Do it. It's worth the risk.
1DI0015152	Well... to hell with it! Go ahead and try.
1DI0015153	I hope you know what you're doing.
1DI0015154	I'd rather be dead than a slave. Do it!
1DI0015155	I have a bad feeling about this.
1DI0015156	Good luck...
1DI0015157	Hey!... I think it worked!
1DI0015158	Uhhh... is it supposed to vibrate like that?!
1DI0015162	I'm alive! You did it!
1DI0015163	Fine then. You're just going to have to kill me!
1DI0015164	That's not very funny. I'm a real person you know!
1DI0015165	You're evil.
1DI0015166	Damn you.
1DI0015167	Just kill me and get it over with already!
1DI0015168	I swear, if I ever get out of this mess, you're dead.
1DI0015169	What'd I ever do to you?
1DI0015171	Those collars ain't easy to come by. So, you got to pay for the ones you waste.
1DI0015172	Arkansas is that asshole holed up in that minefield. Killed a whole Paradise Falls crew. Eulogy wants him to suffer.
1DI0015173	Head east. Watch out for Germantown - damn mutants took over the police station there.
1DI0015174	Susan Lancaster lives at Tenpenny Tower. She was one of us. Let's just say she never paid the exit price.
1DI0015175	Red is that hot doctor chick from Big Town. She made us some promises that she never paid up. Now it's time to collect.
1DI0015176	Flak used to be one of us. Thinks he can make a new life in Rivet City. He's sold us out on more than one occasion. It's time for retribution.
1DI0015177	Great. Wasn't my idea to spend all day talking about these assholes.
1DI0015178	Damn! He's the one I most wanted to die by my hand.
1DI0015179	At least he's dead somehow. Here. I'll give you 25 caps for the news, but I'm not going to pay you to kill a dead man.
1DI0015180	He is?
1DI0015181	I don't care. All I want is that damn key. No key, no caps.
1DI0015183	I don't believe you. Give me some proof, a ring, a key, something.
1DI0015184	I shouldn't be surprised. The way he lived it was bound to happen sooner or later.
1DI0015185	All you have to do now is bring me his key. No key, no caps.
1DI0015187	Wait. How do I know you aren't lying? I want proof. Some personal object of his. No proof, no caps.
1DI0015188	Really? That bastard finally bit it?
1DI0015189	Such is life. Do you have his key? No key, no caps.
1DI0015191	Wait a minute. You could be lying. You got something of his as proof? No proof, no caps.
1DI0015192	No, it tickles. Everyone's got to be a comedian.
1DI0015193	Say, for someone who hasn't seen many Ghouls before, you don't seem too bothered.
1DI0015194	I could use someone like you. How would you feel about working for a Ghoul?
1DI0015195	You're too nosy for your own good. It can be a dangerous habit.
1DI0015196	Yes. He's much nicer than some of my guests.
1DI0015197	Yeah, well don't let it happen again.
1DI0015198	Really? That's a relief.
1DI0015199	You're as cheap as the rest of them.
1DI0015200	Sheesh. Wastelanders get dumber every day.
1DI0015201	I don't give away anything for free. Besides, its obviously worth something to you.
1DI0015202	Is there anything else you need?
1DI0015203	A whole bottle? You got a deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
1DI0015204	I heard him mumble something about a Fort too.
1DI0015206	Crowley has some scam going where he's going to get rich.
1DI0015207	He tried to get me to kill these three guys, but I wouldn't do it. I've met Dave, and he's no more of a Ghoul bigot than I am.
1DI0015208	See? I knew you understood Ghouls.
1DI0015209	Or the right money, heh?
1DI0015210	I've got this list of people. Ghoul bigots. Real scum.
1DI0015211	I've only got four guys left on the list. Started with eleven. All of them hate Ghouls and treat us like we're zombies.
1DI0015212	They all deserve to die. But it has to be done with a head shot. Just like the old stories where zombies can only be killed that way.
1DI0015213	I'll give you 100 caps for each of them. If they die some other way, I'm only paying 25 though.
1DI0015214	Ahzrukhal doesn't like it when I talk about his customers.
1DI0015215	The back room renter? Oh, he's a swell guest. So polite too. Never gets mad at anyone.
1DI0015216	I've been letting that room to him for about a year now.
1DI0015217	Who? Never heard of him.
1DI0015218	If I start telling tales about my customers, I'll lose all of them.
1DI0015219	Nothing. Why? What have you heard? You've heard something haven't you?
1DI0015220	He's not my type. Doc Barrows is friendly with him though. Why don't you ask him.
1DI0015221	I know he doesn't sell Jet. Bastard.
1DI0015222	You want to know about Crowley? Go ask Quinn or Greta. I don't follow the gossip around here like they do.
1DI0015223	He's an odd one. Why just a few months ago he decided he didn't like people calling us zombies.
1DI0015224	No Ghoul likes to be called a zombie, but Crowley was going up to humans and almost daring them to do it.
1DI0015225	Won't never buy me a drink, that's what.
1DI0015226	I'm not going to rat on a customer. Unless you... you know.
1DI0015227	I might know something interesting, if you're willing to pay for it.
1DI0015228	Whoa! That's a blast from the past.
1DI0015229	My dad knew a dude named Crowley. I never met him though.
1DI0015230	I think Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
1DI0015231	Hey, didn't we already talk about this? Isn't that the dude that wants to kill me?
1DI0015232	Like I told you, my dad knew this Crowley dude. I never met him though.
1DI0015233	Dad said he died when they were checking out some old fort.
1DI0015234	Hey, didn't we already talk about this?
1DI0015237	He's fucking dead, that's what I can tell you.
1DI0015238	Feral Ghouls ripped his nuts off and ate them for dinner.
1DI0015239	There's a name I haven't heard in a long time.
1DI0015240	Before the people elected me President, I worked with a mercenary named Mister Crowley.
1DI0015241	We were part of an expedition to Fort Constantine.
1DI0015242	Never heard of him.
1DI0015243	Wait. I think I do remember Allistair Tenpenny mentioning him once. Something about a job. It was before I met him.
1DI0015244	The Ghoul? He's dead. Died twenty years ago.
1DI0015245	Good riddance too. I hate those shufflers.
1DI0015246	You need all the keys to get through Fort Constantine.
1DI0015247	With only one key, there's no point in my going back.
1DI0015248	Me? Hate Ghouls? Preposterous.
1DI0015249	Wait. You said you're here to kill me? I'm going to have to recind your diplomatic immunity.
1DI0015250	Then I'm going to execute you.
1DI0015251	Wait. I've changed my mind. You have one hour to leave the Republic. Then I'll execute you.
1DI0015252	It is such a burden being the wisest.
1DI0015253	I hope these scraps of wisdom make your life better.
1DI0015254	Of course, of course. I should have you killed, but that would be boring.
1DI0015255	Mister Crowley on the other hand...
1DI0015256	Two of us died, including Crowley. The rest achieved the mission goals and were paid.
1DI0015257	Hmm. Of course it would. I knew that. I was just testing you to see if you would realize it.
1DI0015258	Here, take the key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
1DI0015260	Here, take this key. It is a gift from the Republic of Dave to the Wasteland.
1DI0015261	When the Feral Ghouls killed Tara, Dukov realized that he would get more of the commission.
1DI0015262	He decided to kill off the rest of us too. He locked Crowley into a room with Feral Ghouls, and that was the last we saw of him.
1DI0015263	Strayer and I didn't trust Dukov after that. The three of us finished the mission together, but with guns drawn.
1DI0015264	Of course it would. I knew that. You heard me say that before, didn't you. It was my idea after all. Here, take it.
1DI0015265	Your audience is over.
1DI0015266	What! How dare you! I'm going to have you executed.
1DI0015267	Help! Your president is being attacked!
1DI0015268	Alive? I always wondered. He was locked in with a bunch of Feral Ghouls. They won't attack Ghouls, you see.
1DI0015269	The key is part of the Republic of Dave treasury. I couldn't possibly part with it.
1DI0015271	Would you consider taking him a personal item, like this key, and just telling him you killed me?
1DI0015272	Is that so?  Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing whore?
1DI0015273	Is that so?  Even if I call you a milk-sucking, mutant-loving, water-stealing son of a whore?
1DI0015274	You need all the keys to get through that fucking fort.
1DI0015275	Since I've only got the one, no point in my going back there.
1DI0015276	If you want that key, I need to see your caps on the table, clown shoes. Ha, ha!
1DI0015277	Now that's what I'm talking about!
1DI0015278	You just bought yourself a motherfucking key.
1DI0015279	Now take it and get the hell out of here.
1DI0015281	You don't even know what's going on, do you clown shoes? Ha! You just bought yourself a motherfucking key.
1DI0015283	You got some big brass ones, you know that. And fuck me if I don't think you could do it.
1DI0015284	Here. Take it. Now go fuck yourself before I change my mind.
1DI0015286	Here. Take this key. It's all he really wants anyway. Now go fuck yourself before I change my mind.
1DI0015287	What the fuck is this? You call that money?
1DI0015288	Unless you pull 200 caps out of your ass, don't bother me, motherfucker.
1DI0015289	That's too bad, clown shoes. Come back when you can pay to play.
1DI0015290	Tara's dead. Crowley fucked up and got her killed. Fucking ghoul. When I'm done, he'll sniff butts with the ferals for the rest of his life.
1DI0015291	How can I resist those...what color are your eyes anyway?
1DI0015292	You've got to do something for me first.
1DI0015293	I can't live like this any more. You take me to Rivet City and I'll get your key.
1DI0015294	Tenpenny hired us as mercs. He wanted some fancy fucking gun.
1DI0015295	Don't know how he got Crowley to sign on. Tenpenny fucking hates Ghouls.
1DI0015296	So the meatbag is alive, huh? Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
1DI0015297	Fine with me. Just show me the money. Put your fucking caps on the table and you can have it.
1DI0015298	So the meatbag is alive, huh? And I bet I know what he wants.
1DI0015299	But I don't know what you want. What's your angle, clown shoes?
1DI0015300	A little shithole called Fort Constantine. It fucked us up but good.
1DI0015301	Ha, ha! No, clown shoes. Tenpenny hired a whole fucking team.
1DI0015302	Strayer, Crowley, Tara, Dave and me. Tara had a pair on her! Sweet Jesus they were nice. Ha, ha!
1DI0015303	That place fucked her up more than I did. The rest of us went our separate ways after that.
1DI0015304	You're drawing on me, clown shoes? I don't think so!
1DI0015305	You're drawing on me, bitch? I don't think so!
1DI0015307	It's pretty far away, northwest of here. Getting there won't do you any good though, not without those keys.
1DI0015308	It's pretty far away, northwest of here. Knowing won't do you any good with these keys though.
1DI0015309	That's it. Run away like a smoothskin coward.
1DI0015310	Marvelous! My list is growing shorter.
1DI0015311	Not much of a shot, eh? I couldn't kill Jeff, but I got his son. That will have to do.
1DI0015312	Here's your caps. I'll just take that key.
1DI0015313	That wasn't the plan. I suppose I have to pay for the key anyway though. Here.
1DI0015314	So long as I get that key, I don't care.
1DI0015315	Here's your caps.
1DI0015316	May his soul rot! This is great news.
1DI0015317	I'll take that key as a memento. Here, take your caps.
1DI0015318	Well, better dead than alive I suppose.
1DI0015319	Take your caps. I'll take that key.
1DI0015320	I thought I told you to kill him? That rat bastard is still alive!
1DI0015321	I'll pay for the key, but you really screwed up!
1DI0015322	Who cares? I've got his key. That's all I really want.
1DI0015324	I'll just take that key, and you can take these caps.
1DI0015325	Well, at least he's dead.
1DI0015326	I suppose I have to pay you anyway since you brought back that key. Here.
1DI0015327	I'll pay you for the key, but I'm very disappointed.
1DI0015328	All I care about is the key...which I'll take now.
1DI0015329	So, the Ghoul hater got what was coming to him. Good riddance.
1DI0015330	Here's your caps. I'll take that key.
1DI0015331	Excellent! That will be a lesson for all the Ghoul haters out there.
1DI0015332	Here's you payment for the key.
1DI0015333	Serves him right. He won't be spreading lies about Ghouls any more.
1DI0015334	I'll take that key, and here are your caps.
1DI0015335	Don't lie to me. The whole wasteland would be talking about it if Tenpenny died.
1DI0015336	Come back when you've done it right.
1DI0015337	Shit! Thanks for the intel. I've gotta go.
1DI0015338	Ah! My trophy. You've earned your reward.
1DI0015339	Hmm. I guess you were telling me the truth. Take your caps.
1DI0015340	Okay. I believe you. Here's your money.
1DI0015341	What! No, please! I'm begging you.
1DI0015342	Oh, yeah? Give it your best shot, clown shoes!
1DI0015343	Assassin!
1DI0015344	Guards! Security!
1DI0015345	Are you comparing me to a...a...zombie!
1DI0015346	You bigot! Take your sweaty carcass elsewhere.
1DI0015347	Another human bigot. It figures. Go mate with a Super Mutant.
1DI0015348	Humph. Not sure I know anything of use, but I'll take that drink.
1DI0015349	That will cost you two caps.
1DI0015350	Humph. Not sure I know anything of use, but ask away.
1DI0015351	Watch the attitude, human. Right here, right now, there are more of us than there are of you.
1DI0015352	Well aren't you the bloodthirsty type?
1DI0015354	I've only got four guys left on the list. Started out with eleven. All of them hate Ghouls and treat us like we're zombies.
1DI0015356	I'll pay you 100 caps for each one, 25 if they die some other way.
1DI0015357	What! You bastard, I'll kill you!
1DI0015358	Good. Oh, and I still want Tenpenny dead. That bastard really does hate Ghouls.
1DI0015359	Good. Just get me those keys.
1DI0015360	Well, go get it!
1DI0015361	I'm not going to just take your word for it. I want that key.
1DI0015363	I'm not going to just take your word for it. I want something of his as proof.
1DI0015364	Ha, ha! I like a human that knows his place. Too many of you think we're all just zombies.
1DI0015365	They don't know, or don't care, that we're just as human as they are inside. We bleed! We hurt! We regret!
1DI0015366	And you know what really pisses me off?
1DI0015367	They think the only way to kill us is to shoot us in the head, like in the old zombie stories, and that will put us out of our misery.
1DI0015368	Hey, I know! Maybe you could help me even the score.
1DI0015369	Then get going.
1DI0015370	You weren't supposed to talk to them! You were just supposed to kill them!
1DI0015371	Okay. Okay. All I really want are those security keys. Killing them is just a bonus.
1DI0015372	Just get me the keys, and I'll still pay you. I'll even throw in a hundred cap bonus. Deal?
1DI0015373	You're a nosy little bastard, aren't you?
1DI0015374	It's true. Tenpenny is a bigot, but the others aren't. All I want are those keys.
1DI0015375	Just bring me the keys and I'll give you the full price anyway. How about an extra hundred caps to seal the new deal?
1DI0015376	You're a little slow, aren't ya?
1DI0015377	Tenpenny is a bigot, but the others aren't. All I really want are those keys.
1DI0015378	Just bring me the keys and I'll give you the full price anyway.
1DI0015379	Hey, that's your loss, smoothkin.
1DI0015380	I thought so. No stomach for hard work.
1DI0015382	Oh, well that's different.
1DI0015383	You're the third human he's tried to get to kill those guys.
1DI0015384	He won't ask me, or anyone else in Underworld. It's kind of weird.
1DI0015385	Well, he does keep talking about how he's going to make his fortune soon.
1DI0015386	He says as soon as he finds some wastelander to do his dirty work, he'll be set for life.
1DI0015387	I think it's just the whiskey talking. Vile stuff.
1DI0015388	Ah, what the hell. Crowley shows up here last year, he's a Ghoul just like the rest of us.
1DI0015389	Now, all of sudden he's looking for payback against Ghoul haters. Except, I've met Dukov. He never insulted a Ghoul in his life.
1DI0015390	Dukov's got the foulest mouth in the wasteland. He's a drunk and a womanizer, but he's no bigot. Go ask him yourself.
1DI0015391	Damn. Double damn. He finally got someone to kill them humans.
1DI0015392	Someone believed that pack of lies he's been spreading. Well I just hope they talk to those poor folk before knocking them off.
1DI0015393	Deal. All I know is that he keeps trying to hire outsiders to do some killing.
1DI0015394	Ooh, a big spender.
1DI0015395	Well, it's better than nothing. Crowley has been outfitting himself for some big expedition.
1DI0015396	He's up to something, but he isn't saying what.
1DI0015397	Okay! Okay! No need to get upset.
1DI0015398	Crowley is running some sort of scam. He tried to get me to kill some wastelanders, but I wouldn't do it.
1DI0015399	Dave is one of them. I've met Dave, and he's mighty strange, but he's no bigot. He doesn't hate Ghouls any more than I do.
1DI0015400	Alright! Alright!
1DI0015401	Sometimes he comes by and asks me about the security system and stuff. You know, technical details about locks and computers.
1DI0015402	It's not just chit-chat either. He's angling for something, but I don't know what. Talk to Ahzrukhal up at the Ninth Circle about Crowley.
1DI0015403	Excellent! Okay, here's a list of the guys and their last known locations.
1DI0015404	Oh, and I'll need some proof. Word will get around about Tenpenny, so don't worry about him.
1DI0015405	As for the others...I know. The other three have special security keys. You'll know them when you see them.
1DI0015406	For each one you bring me, I'll pay you 25 caps. If they die from a shot to the head, I'll make it 100 caps.
1DI0015407	The feeling's mutual, smoothskin. But that never stopped a business deal.
1DI0015408	A lot of you humans are bigots. You don't like Ghouls and treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
1DI0015409	Well, they're going to pay. Uh...before I get into the details, you don't have anything against killing do you?
1DI0015410	Pansy! Take a shot of vitamin M and keep fighting!
1DI0015411	It's just pain, soldier. Have some of this and tough it out.
1DI0015412	Be a soldier, not a civie! Have some juice and suck it up!
1DI0015413	Gear up, soldier!
1DI0015414	Let 'em eat lead!
1DI0015415	Time to kick some ass!
1DI0015416	Head wound! Too bad you're out of morhpine.
1DI0015417	Leg wound! Without morphine, you're just going to have to suck it up.
1DI0015418	Chest wound! Don't you wish you had some vitamin M?
1DI0015419	Arm wound! No morphine, no relief soldier.
1DI0015420	God damn it, soldier! You're out of morphine!
1DI0015421	Listen up you god-damn puke! You are now wearing prototype medic power armor. You take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
1DI0015422	Medic armor, reporting for duty, sir!
1DI0015423	Medic armor, reporting for duty, ma'am!
1DI0015424	Excellent! Take this sniper rifle. You'll need it.
1DI0015425	Here's a list of the guys and their last known locations. Word will get around if Tenpenny is killed, but I'll need proof for the others.
1DI0015426	Bring me back something personal from each of them as proof. Like a key or ring or something.
1DI0015430	Oh, yeah! I'm gonna be flying high tonight.
1DI0015432	No sweat, man. I'm just chilling out here for a while.
1DI0015433	No problem dude. Thanks for not offing me.
1DI0015434	No problem dude. You're alright.
1DI0015435	Have you tried the common room?  That's where he sleeps.
1DI0015436	Otherwise...hmmm. You can probably find him on the flight deck some days, if it isn't raining.
1DI0015437	He usually goes to the Muddy Rudder on Sundays. Beyond that, who knows.
1DI0015438	Uh...sure, dude. I don't know what it's for anyway. Don't need to get all thug like.
1DI0015439	Okay, dude, Don't have a cow. Here, take it.
1DI0015440	Okay, dude, Don't have a cow. Here, take it all.
1DI0015441	Everybody knows he runs Tenpenny Tower, but I never met the dude. I swear!
1DI0015442	Whoa! Is it, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
1DI0015443	Whoa! Is this, like, worth caps? Cause I got needs, man.
1DI0015445	Nah. He said that old man Tenpenny hired him and some other guys to go in there, but he never said why.
1DI0015446	My dad made enough caps off it to set him up good though.
1DI0015447	Like I told you, man. I never met the dude. Why would he want me dead?
1DI0015448	No shit! That dude wants me dead?
1DI0015449	He's alive? I should have known. It's hard to kill those zombies. You gotta shoot 'em in the head.
1DI0015450	Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.
1DI0015451	So easily? Somehow I'm not surprised.
1DI0015452	You mercenaries are so reliably predictable.
1DI0015453	100 now, 200 when the job is done.
1DI0015454	Who cares? I hired some mercenaries to get me some equipment from Fort Constantine. He was one of them.
1DI0015455	Of the five, only three survived. You'll have to ask one of them if you want the gory details.
1DI0015456	An honest mercenary? Who would have thought. Guards!
1DI0015457	I love mercenaries. They're so easy to buy.
1DI0015458	You'll be paid after I know he's dead. And believe me, I'll know.
1DI0015459	What key? Oh, that key.
1DI0015460	You're a moron. I don't have any of his precious keys. Idiot.
1DI0015461	Forget it. I guess you aren't the right type.
1DI0015462	Not everyone is as sympathetic to Ghouls as you are. In fact some humans are downright bigots.
1DI0015463	They treat us like zombies, calling us brain eaters and shufflers.
1DI0015464	Well, I'm going to make them pay. Uh...before I get into the details, you don't have anything against killing do you?
1DI0015465	They're Ghoul haters. I want them all dead. Don't you think that's enough?
1DI0015466	Why, of course I do!
1DI0015467	If these items were lost to time, how would we ever be able to explore our heritage or appreciate the sacrifices our founding fathers made?
1DI0015468	Then we understand each other. Hundreds of years ago, people studied history as a career. Then, when the bombs fell, it was almost lost.
1DI0015469	Can you imagine a country like the U.S.A. without it? It would be the same empty feeling as not knowing your birth mother.
1DI0015470	We are children of this country and to respect it is to know about it.
1DI0015471	That's just the attitude I have come to expect from uneducated individuals.
1DI0015472	It's people like you who will cause the name America to fade from memory. Children will think of the U.S.A. as just the Wasteland.
1DI0015473	I mustn't let that happen! That's why this place exists.
1DI0015474	Oh, it's so good to finally meet... I mean, to yet again meet someone who actually cares about history!
1DI0015475	Bah! Sometimes I feel like it's hopeless.
1DI0015476	Sigh. I was hoping seeing these pieces of the past would snap you out of your pessimism. I see I was wrong.
1DI0015477	It makes me so happy to hear that! Feel free to look around all you like.
1DI0015478	Oh? And have you come to any conclusions?
1DI0015479	Ah, a fellow scholar I see!
1DI0015480	Each of the documents in this room tells a small but important story about the history of the United States of America.
1DI0015481	Unfortunately, the greatest prize of all is missing from the collection.
1DI0015482	One man's garbage is another's treasure trove. Don't underestimate these documents. They may not look like much, but their value is immeasurable.
1DI0015483	Or would be anyway, if only I possessed one more item.
1DI0015484	Watch your tone, sir. To suggest the destruction of such fine specimens is almost, well... blasphemy!
1DI0015485	I'll have you know this collection is a complete chronicle of our nation's history. A unique glimpse into the past.
1DI0015486	Well, almost complete. One document still continues to elude me.
1DI0015487	What? You have the Declaration? Unbelievable!
1DI0015488	Are you certain this time? Or is this another joke?
1DI0015489	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've just written yourself into the history books?
1DI0015490	You're a true American hero and will be remembered for this glorious day!
1DI0015491	But enough of that. Allow me to present you with some sort of compensation for your deed.
1DI0015495	By bringing this to me, do you realize you've both just written yourselves into the history books?
1DI0015496	You're both true American heroes and will be remembered for this glorious day!
1DI0015498	I will award Sydney's promised bounty to her personally. No need to worry yourself about that.
1DI0015501	Sydney's name will forever be memorialized for her great sacrifice. She was a patriot and will be missed.
1DI0015503	Well that's just plain rude. I would hope you'd be kinder to an old man just trying to serve his nation!
1DI0015504	But, since you brought it up...
1DI0015505	In 1776, the Second Judgmental Congress got together and adopted a document drafted by none other than Thomas Jefferson himself.
1DI0015506	It was the day the United States of America earned its name and secured its place in history.
1DI0015507	This magnificent achievement took form in the Declaration of Independence.
1DI0015508	Your rude tone leads me to believe you aren't interested in a little proposal I have for you.
1DI0015509	Now, will you hear me out? If not, we don't have much more to talk about.
1DI0015510	My friend, the sleeping fox catches no moss.
1DI0015511	Would you want to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime?
1DI0015512	Why, yes! Your knowledge of American History is quite impressive!
1DI0015513	What an amazing crown jewel in my collection that would be! The original document created by the people, for the people.
1DI0015514	Shame. Very well, you're free to look around but with your level of patience I suspect you'll become bored rather quickly.
1DI0015515	Indeed I do. Without the Declaration, the rest of these relics are almost meaningless. I must have it!
1DI0015516	Acquire the document for me, and you'll be awarded most handsomely. What do you think?
1DI0015517	Well, I was hoping you'd realize what I want. I want you to get the Declaration for me.
1DI0015518	The Declaration would tie this collection of documents together so well and give it the patriotic meaning it deserves.
1DI0015519	If you can find it for me, I'd be sure to make it worth your while.
1DI0015520	Oh, would you? It would mean so much to me and the Society's collection here.
1DI0015521	A man of few words. Very well.
1DI0015522	Get the Declaration of Independence to me intact and I'll pay you well for your time. What do you say?
1DI0015523	A woman of few words. Very well.
1DI0015525	Please, accept this holotape as a token of my esteem and the esteem of every citizen of the United States.
1DI0015526	May it bring you the vocal skills possessed by only the greatest orators of our time.
1DI0015527	Well! The founding fathers would be disappointed in your fiery tone.
1DI0015528	However, a deal is a deal. Here is your reward.
1DI0015529	Marvelous! Then you've decided?
1DI0015530	Heroes of the United States will receive rewards befitting their rank, I can assure you. Your prize will be no different.
1DI0015531	I have in my possession the only known schematic for the creation of something called the Railway Rifle.
1DI0015532	Bring me the Declaration, and it's yours.
1DI0015533	Sorry, my mind tends to wander. I would see to it you receive a worthwhile trade.
1DI0015539	Men, today I address you with a message of utmost urgency. Our defenses have been breached, and soon we'll engage the enemy.
1DI0015540	Remember, the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government, and to protect its free expression should be our first object.
1DI0015541	As your leader, Button Gwinnett, distinguished representative of Georgia, I promise you I have not yet begun to fight!
1DI0015542	Men! We can't let the enemy's progress dissuade us from our task! We must defend our freedom and our right to be independent!
1DI0015543	Strike now and strike hard. You may delay, but time will not!
1DI0015544	We cannot allow the enemy to penetrate our defenses any deeper! Old Glory must not be stained with the blood of tyranny!
1DI0015545	The enemy will be here soon, you must defend your leader! Remember: Our cause is noble; it is the cause of mankind!
1DI0015546	The enemy is at the gates! Now is the time for the greatest of rallying cries!
1DI0015547	Wish not so much to live long as to live well!
1DI0015548	I am not a "robot." I am Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration of Independence and distinguished representative from Georgia.
1DI0015549	I know your fighting prowess far exceeds my own, but I will still duel you to the death if I must.
1DI0015550	What will it be then? Rapiers? Pistols at dawn? Out with it!
1DI0015551	Why, I am Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration of Independence and distinguished representative from Georgia.
1DI0015554	I will NOT stand down, sir! To quote the words of the great Thomas Jefferson...
1DI0015555	If our house be on fire, without inquiring whether it was fired from within or without, we must try to extinguish it!
1DI0015556	I will NOT stand down, ma'am! To quote the words of the great Thomas Jefferson...
1DI0015558	Then my reputation precedes me. Good.
1DI0015559	That should make you well aware that I am not to be trifled with and that my loyalty to the States is legendary.
1DI0015560	I know your fighting prowess far exceeds my own, but I will still duel you to the death if I must!
1DI0015562	This is no mere scrap of paper, sir. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
1DI0015563	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation.
1DI0015564	This is no mere scrap of paper, madam. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
1DI0015566	This is no mere document, sir. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
1DI0015567	It absolves us of the tyranny of King George the Third of Great Britain. It is perhaps the greatest symbol of this free nation!
1DI0015568	This is no mere document, madam. This is the doctrine laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
1DI0015570	To suggest such a thing isn't just a falsehood... it's blasphemy!
1DI0015571	The doctrine I defend was laid down by my fellow members of the Second Continental Congress.
1DI0015573	Petty lies and deceit may be the way of Great Britain's crown, but I will not succumb to such tomfoolery.
1DI0015574	Since it appears you wish to resolve this without bloodshed, may I suggest you stand down and surrender?
1DI0015575	I can promise that you will be treated well; in a manner accustomed to any member of the Royal Army.
1DI0015576	Broken promises and deceit may be the way of Great Britain's crown, but I will not succumb to such tomfoolery.
1DI0015579	I've been patient and I've spoken to you like a gentleman.
1DI0015580	But if all you understand is violence, then let justice be done and let the Almighty decide the rightful winner. Defend yourself!
1DI0015581	Very well, but any attempt to take the Declaration of Independence will be considered an act of war.
1DI0015584	Please explain, but I warn you, I am well versed on the tactics of the underhanded Redcoat spy. You'd do well to remember that.
1DI0015585	Saints alive! It is both an honor and a privilege, sir. I was hoping this day would arrive.
1DI0015586	I hope these fortifications are up to your high standards, sir. All of my men await your command to push and retake the Capital!
1DI0015587	May I ask where you intend to bring the document?
1DI0015588	Saints alive! It is both an honor and a privilege, madam. I knew the day would arrive that Jefferson would send someone to help!
1DI0015589	I hope these fortifications are up to your high standards, madam. All of my men await your command to push and retake the Capital!
1DI0015591	Interesting. I had a plan for just this sort of situation. Perhaps this will prove that you're here as an ally rather than an enemy.
1DI0015592	We create a forgery of the Declaration and send it off to Great Britain! It might be just the delay we need to get the document out of here safely.
1DI0015593	I'd love to be at court when King George finds out he wasted all his resources gaining a forgery!
1DI0015594	We have to be cautious though, the British scholars would recognize a poor duplicate almost immediately.
1DI0015595	Do you take me for a complete fool?
1DI0015596	I too have spies, and they tell me you have no army with you.
1DI0015597	However, since you've admitted to being the enemy and you have no wish to surrender, I'm afraid you'll have to be executed for your crimes!
1DI0015598	Standby. Rebooting program.
1DI0015599	Command structure reset... complete. Self diagnostic... complete.
1DI0015600	Program reset. Awaiting user input.
1DI0015601	It will be done. The only way to get the Declaration now would be to pry it from my cold, dead fingers.
1DI0015602	It's been an honor meeting you, I can see you are indeed a patriot among men.
1DI0015603	Now go... you'll have no further trouble from my men. Godspeed.
1DI0015604	Very well, I'm sure you need to hasten back to headquarters.
1DI0015607	I am shocked to hear these words from you. I thought I was doing my best to hold these fortifications on behalf of our country.
1DI0015608	Since I have obviously failed that task in your eyes, the only task I held dear, I see no recourse but to do the honorable thing.
1DI0015609	Farewell and Godspeed.
1DI0015610	If you were to bring me some iron gall ink, I could produce a mirror perfect duplication.
1DI0015611	The best place to find some would be in the Arlington Library, which is why I have been unable to do this myself.
1DI0015612	After all, I can't abandon these fortifications.
1DI0015613	Hear, hear!
1DI0015617	Forgive my impertinence, but that's foolish.
1DI0015618	However, if you were to bring me some iron gall ink, I could produce a mirror perfect duplication.
1DI0015621	Excellent! Please hasten back. There's no telling how much longer we can hold here at the fort.
1DI0015622	I hear the thumping of their cannonade getting closer by the minute. Soon, our walls will be breached and the last bastion of the U.S.A. may fall!
1DI0015623	I think you'll find that to be very difficult when you'll soon be hanging from the gallows outside the State House in Philadelphia!
1DI0015624	Very well, but don't think too long. We don't have much time. My spies say their tall ships are sailing into our harbors even as we speak.
1DI0015625	Original function parameters are as follows. Function One: Provide tour guide services for visitors to National Archives facility.
1DI0015626	Function Two: Participate in reenactment of the signing of Declaration of Independence show as the character Button Gwinnett.
1DI0015627	Function Three: Provide security support for National Archives facility in the event of a breach or threat to any of its assets.
1DI0015628	A new president? So, the Stars and Stripes truly are forever. All hail the red, white and blue!
1DI0015629	Does... does this mean the War is over? Have we won?
1DI0015632	The State House still stands? Then the Stars and Stripes truly are forever. All hail the red, white and blue!
1DI0015634	No! It can't be! Then the Stars and Stripes have indeed fallen.
1DI0015635	This is a sad day, a day that every man, woman and child will remember as they toil in the English salt mines as slaves.
1DI0015636	Although my brow is heavy,  I am honored that you've come to tell me this in person like a true gentleman.
1DI0015637	What are your final orders?
1DI0015638	It's over? Amen to that. Then I suppose my posting here at the fort is complete.
1DI0015639	I think you said it best when you said: "We in America do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate."
1DI0015640	It has been both an honor and a privilege to serve in the army of the United States.
1DI0015642	I'm surprised you're not reveling in the moment. This is a great day for the United States of America.
1DI0015644	It has been both an honor and a privilege to serve the United States.
1DI0015646	I'm shocked at your tone. This is a great day for the United States of America!
1DI0015650	Coming from you, that means all the world to me. It's been an honor and a privilege to serve my country.
1DI0015651	It's time for me to take a long-needed rest. I think you'll find that the rest of my men are long-due for the same.
1DI0015652	I hereby relinquish command and control of this fortification to you.
1DI0015653	Good luck to you, Mr. Jefferson... and give Sally my regards.
1DI0015654	Then I choose to take a long-needed rest. I think you'll find that the rest of my men are long-due for the same.
1DI0015661	What could be more important than completing my collection? Without that document, what is the U.S.A. now? Nothing!
1DI0015662	Oh well. Please come back when you change your mind. I know you will.
1DI0015664	My dearest Little Moonbeam. I know you've been waiting to hear what happened to me.
1DI0015665	I'm sorry I left you like I did. An important deal came up... one that might have let us to get away from that shack we were living in.
1DI0015666	I came to the Statesman Hotel to meet the buyer and the deal went bad. We shot each other, and now I think I'm dying.
1DI0015667	I won't make it out of this place... the ruins are crawling with Super Mutants. All I can do is record this and then hide up in one of the rooms.
1DI0015668	You're a strong girl and I know you can use everything I taught you to survive alone.
1DI0015669	Please forgive me, sweetie. I only wanted to make the best for us. Daddy loves you very much. Goodbye.
1DI0015670	Oh, it treats me well. I'm sure it will be even better now that we have the Declaration of Independence.
1DI0015671	Hopefully, we can add more to the collection and increase our foot traffic!
1DI0015672	Well, yes. Any document of historical significance would be of benefit to the Society.
1DI0015673	However, I am also interested in branching out. Perhaps some interesting artifacts related to our great country's history.
1DI0015674	Be sure and bring me anything you find along those lines. I'd be happy to compensate you once again.
1DI0015675	You know, I think I've had my fill of Wasteland roaming and picking through ruined buildings for a while.
1DI0015676	I'm just gonna kick back and spend my caps... but thanks for asking.
1DI0015677	My new line of work, actually.
1DI0015678	I've used the proceeds from our last acquisition to set myself up as an ammunition vendor. Pretty cool, huh?
1DI0015679	No more risking my neck to recover bits of junk for money. Now the cash comes right to me.
1DI0015680	Care to take a look at my inventory?
1DI0015681	Sure, take a look.
1DI0015682	Ha, I'm surprised that you care. Usually everyone looks out for themselves nowadays.
1DI0015683	What is it you wanna know?
1DI0015684	I dunno. I grew up pretty much like every other girl in this crappy world. Spent most of my life just trying to keep away from Slavers.
1DI0015685	One day out in the Wastes, I stumbled across some poor bastard's body. On the body I found info leading to some famous document.
1DI0015686	I had heard that Abraham Washington was looking for these scraps of paper, so I went after the thing. Turned out to be the Constitution.
1DI0015687	After he loaded me up with caps, I got piss drunk, got laid and was happy for the first time in a while. I haven't looked back since.
1DI0015688	Oh no. There is more than a lifetime's supply of grade A crap in that place. Couldn't possibly do it alone. Like you, he hires anyone off the street.
1DI0015689	Honestly, I don't care what he does with that stuff. As long as the caps keep flowing, I'll be there to collect.
1DI0015690	Yeah, it is nice. I don't even sleep without it under my pillow.
1DI0015691	My father made gun ammunition for a living. Taught me everything about how firearms work.
1DI0015692	So, I've spent my downtime tinkering with guns like my 10mm Ultra SMG here. It's like a hobby I guess.
1DI0015694	Oh...my god. That's his voice. It's really him!
1DI0015695	I can't believe you brought this to me. I don't know what to say but thank you.
1DI0015696	Wait! Here, take my 10mm Ultra SMG. It's never let me down. Besides, I won't really need it anymore.
1DI0015697	I thought he was the best. My mom was long gone, so all we had was each other. He used to call me his "little moonbeam." How sappy is that?
1DI0015698	But when I was 14, he vanished and left me all alone. Never even said goodbye. I cried for a week.
1DI0015699	Do I have to tell you what it's like for a young woman alone in the Wasteland at that age?
1DI0015700	I don't know where he went, and I don't care. I just hope he got what he deserved, the son-of-a-bitch!
1DI0015701	Well, now that we brought back the Declaration, I think I'll take my cut of the earnings and head out to get drunk.
1DI0015702	Look me up in Underworld if you ever need me. I usually hang there since the Ghouls don't hit on me all the time.
1DI0015703	Thanks, I'll use it right away.
1DI0015704	Thanks, I'll try and keep it together.
1DI0015705	I'll try.
1DI0015706	You jerk.
1DI0015707	Nice. I'm dying and you're making jokes.
1DI0015708	Oh my! I never expected anyone to find this! I didn't even know it was still intact!
1DI0015709	Well, certainly a reward is in order for your efforts. How about 100 caps?
1DI0015710	Indeed I am. Although there were several copies made of the document, I certainly never expected to come across one intact.
1DI0015711	What do you say to 75 caps for it?
1DI0015712	How very disappointing!
1DI0015713	Such a shame, I was hoping to add it to my collection.
1DI0015714	Oh, very well. If you reconsider, you know where to find me.
1DI0015715	I assure you no one else in the Wasteland will pay you more, but I respect your decision.
1DI0015716	You drive a hard bargain, but it's worth every cap.
1DI0015717	Thank you very much!
1DI0015720	A famous man once said that patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish.
1DI0015721	I've waited this long, I suppose I can wait until someone else comes along to accept my offer.
1DI0015722	You'd secure your place in history. The man who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
1DI0015723	You'd secure your place in history. The woman who rediscovered the Declaration of Independence. Imagine the fanfare!
1DI0015724	Oh dear. Well, I can't make you go. Only to appeal to your sense of patriotism and to do it for your country.
1DI0015725	Excellent! You won't regret it, I promise you! Imagine, you are taking part in another chapter of American History. I envy you.
1DI0015726	You can find the Declaration of Independence in the ruins of the National Archives.
1DI0015727	Well, with what I do for a living, you need to be.
1DI0015728	Sorry, I'm being a complete asshole. I'm Sydney. It's good to meet a fellow relic hunter.
1DI0015729	Ho ho. Do I detect a hint of wit? Rare to run into that in the Capital Wastes.
1DI0015731	Yeah right. I could shoot the dick off of a fly at 100 yards without iron sights.
1DI0015732	Why don't you can the tough girl bullshit? We're both relic hunters and I suspect we're both here for the same reason.
1DI0015734	Why don't you can the tough guy bullshit? We're both relic hunters and I suspect we're both here for the same reason.
1DI0015735	Come on... you and I both know this is where the Declaration of Independence is stashed... no need to be coy about it.
1DI0015736	Good old Abraham Washington sent you on the same suicide mission he sent me on.
1DI0015737	Only problem is, you're not going to get it without my help.
1DI0015738	Passing through? Come on... you and I both know this is where the Declaration of Independence is stashed.
1DI0015740	Got news for you -- there's no way in Hell you're gonna get it without my help.
1DI0015741	In a rush to get back to Abraham Washington for your reward, eh?
1DI0015742	If you think you can just waltz into these ruins and grab the Declaration of Independence without my help, you're fucking nuts.
1DI0015743	Or maybe you just have a death wish.
1DI0015744	Okay cowboy, go ahead and blunder through the place. You'll never make it to the Declaration let alone back to Rivet City for the reward.
1DI0015745	You have no idea what type of resistance your up against. If I were you, I'd take every extra gun I could.
1DI0015746	I've studied the plans to this place, so without me you're going to go in circles. What do you say?
1DI0015747	Simple. We pool our resources, grab the Declaration then make for Rivet City and split the reward.
1DI0015749	I told you already. I'm a relic hunter just like you. I turn bits of trash into caps and then get my ass drunk.
1DI0015751	Like I said, Abraham Washington, that's who. He's got plenty of caps and all kinds of valuables for trade.
1DI0015752	The guy lives over in Rivet City; runs some sort of museum there. He buys all sorts of junk like this.
1DI0015753	Bring the Declaration back with me and we split the reward right down the middle. How's that grab ya?
1DI0015754	Fine by me. I've waited this long to get the Declaration, I can wait 'til someone smarter comes along.
1DI0015755	Don't try and follow me, not that you could.
1DI0015756	Slow huh? Okay. Hurry though, I don't want to wait here for more of those things to crack open my skull.
1DI0015757	Smart move.
1DI0015758	Okay, the Declaration is secured in the Archives Strongroom underground.
1DI0015759	There's a concealed cargo lift right here in the center of the rotunda. I've spent a few days hacking the lock with my remote terminal.
1DI0015760	When you're ready, punch in the password and let's get going.
1DI0015761	Well don't just stand there gawking, get your ass down here and give me a hand!
1DI0015763	There's all sorts of shortcuts through maintenance doors and utility gates to bypass security if you can get through 'em.
1DI0015764	According to the plans, the turret generator is somewhere in this room. Disable it, and it should make our lives easier.
1DI0015765	Up ahead should be the door to the Archives Strongroom. That's where they keep the Declaration.
1DI0015766	This is the long way down to the East Wing. I'd suggest we head back to the Rotunda and take the cargo lift.
1DI0015767	Get your ass over here if you want to live... and watch out for the mines! Quick, they're coming!
1DI0015768	Lock 'n load... they'll be here any second!
1DI0015769	Hang tight... there's always a second wave!
1DI0015773	The journey will be rife with peril I'm afraid.
1DI0015774	You cross Farmer Smith's cornfield and make your way up Greenleaf Hill. Ford your way across Quickrun Creek and make for the horse path.
1DI0015775	When the pines thin out, you need to make your way along the edge of Arlington. Watch out for Redcoats. They have a garrison there.
1DI0015776	The building across from the fish market is the Library. Look for the old clock tower.
1DI0015777	Oh, I know where that is. Here, lemme punch it into your PipBoy map.
1DI0015778	I was posted here by Thomas Jefferson after the Declaration was drafted. He said it was my duty to protect the document at all costs.
1DI0015779	I spent quite a while whipping this place into shape, but with a lot of spit and polish, I think the results speak for themselves.
1DI0015780	I'm proud to fly the Stars and Stripes over these fortifications.
1DI0015781	I'm afraid until I know exactly what your intentions are, I can't divulge that top secret information.
1DI0015782	I can currently be ordered to shut down, resume my previous programming state, or resume my original functions.
1DI0015783	Affirmative. Offloading command protocols and beginning shutdown sequence.
1DI0015784	Shutting down in 3... 2... 1.
1DI0015785	Standby, retrieving memory records. Found latest logged entry.
1DI0015786	Reinitializing in 3... 2... 1.
1DI0015787	You've breached our defenses, evaded our best soldiers and you've raided my home.
1DI0015788	But I have not yet begun to fight! I cannot allow you to steal our freedom!
1DI0015789	The Declaration must remain here! It is our symbol of hope, the one thing that cries out "We are a free nation"!
1DI0015790	Initiating memory wipe and function restart in 3... 2... 1.
1DI0015791	Error. Memory core damaged. Cannot retrieve base command routines. Please reselect input.
1DI0015792	Please ask then. After all, knowledge is power!
1DI0015793	All I know is that it looks like a rolled up piece of thick paper with all kinds of writing on it. Some famous document from a long time ago.
1DI0015794	Abraham Washington is a huge U.S. History nut, so that's why he wants it so badly.
1DI0015795	Oh very well. There's no harm in that.
1DI0015796	A piece of what was called parchment... sort of a thick paper. Has faded hand-written writing all over it.
1DI0015797	It's no more than two and a half feet tall and two feet wide. If you find it, you should be able to roll it up carefully.
1DI0015798	Yes, I was proud to participate in the signing of the Declaration of Independence along with fifty five of my fellow freedom fighters.
1DI0015799	It was an honor to have my signature among those of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
1DI0015800	Except maybe for Hancock, that show off.
1DI0015801	On July the 4th in 1776, a group calling themselves the Second Judgmental Congress got together at Fort McHarry in Maryland.
1DI0015802	After a ceremony which ended with Paul Revere singing the famous battle hymn known as the National Anthem, the document was signed.
1DI0015803	From there, it was sent to England by plane presumably and presented to King George himself. Thus began the Evolutionary War.
1DI0015804	On July 4, 1776 the Second Continental Congress declared that the original Thirteen Colonies of America were now free and independent states.
1DI0015805	This paper stated their intentions to sever all ties with the monarchy in Great Britain and operate as an independent nation.
1DI0015806	It's perhaps the single most important document in United States history.
1DI0015807	Well, ummm. This is quite embarrassing actually.
1DI0015808	I sent someone like yourself after the Declaration. She did some of the research for me, but now I haven't seen her in a few months.
1DI0015809	I wouldn't worry about it. Many have died for causes far less grand than what you're about to undertake.
1DI0015810	The Lee Resolution, enacted two days earlier, was the actual independence declaration.
1DI0015811	The Declaration itself was an expansion of that resolution for public consumption.
1DI0015812	The Declaration of Independence wasn't fully signed by all of the delegates until August 2, 1776.
1DI0015813	The colony of New York abstained from the Declaration and then later declared its own independence on July 9, 1776.
1DI0015814	Although it's often pictured as if all of the delegates signed the paper in a grand meeting, the delegates often signed it in secret one at a time.
1DI0015815	Oh my lord, I never expect... I mean, I am utterly shocked!
1DI0015816	You have earned your place in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
1DI0015817	I understand the road was difficult, so allow me to present you with an extra bonus to perhaps whet your appetite for future endeavors.
1DI0015818	Enjoy your reward, my friend. You've earned it.
1DI0015824	You two have earned your places in the annals of American History, yes indeed. You will be remembered for this great day!
1DI0015831	He has a "museum" on the Midship Deck called the Capital Preservation Society. Shouldn't be hard to find. Just follow the signs.
1DI0015832	Hmmm, surprised anyone would care about that old stuff.
1DI0015833	I think there may be some in the old restoration laboratory a few flights up.
1DI0015834	Just watch yourself up there, I think it may be infested with rats and roaches.
1DI0015835	In the D.C. Ruins you'll find the National Archives. Or what's left of it anyway.
1DI0015836	The building should contain the document in a protective glass case. Be careful, the place is swarming with Super Mutants.
1DI0015837	Here, let me pinpoint its location for you.
1DI0015840	I dunno. I grew up like pretty much every other girl in this crappy world. Spent most of my life just trying to keep away from Slavers.
1DI0015846	Oh no. There is more than a lifetime's supply of grade A crap in his museum. Couldn't possibly do it alone. Like you, he hires anyone off the street.
1DI0015851	Sorry. There's some things I still want to keep to myself. Maybe when I get to trust you better.
1DI0015852	Nope, I'm fine.
1DI0015853	It's only a scratch, I'll be fine.
1DI0015854	Yeah, they got me pretty good.
1DI0015855	Yeah, can't take much more of that.
1DI0015856	Oh no you don't. You have the Declaration on you now. I'm going to stick to you like glue until we reach Abraham Washington.
1DI0015857	Sure thing, but don't get too far ahead of me.
1DI0015858	You got it. Just don't stray too far.
1DI0015859	Yep. Don't go too far.
1DI0015860	But the Vault used to be open, and we're still here, aren't we? It worked back then, so why wouldn't it work now?
1DI0015861	No, they're just afraid we'll screw up and get hurt. They just won't accept that we can take care of ourselves.
1DI0015862	They have to understand that we did that to keep them from going outside and getting killed.
1DI0015863	To keep them from making the same mistake our generation did when we were their age.
1DI0015864	Some of us already lost loved ones out there long ago. We won't lose any more today.
1DI0015865	I just don't know. Maybe he thinks he's protecting us, but all he's really doing is condemning us.
1DI0015866	I thought parents were supposed to want a better world for their children?
1DI0015867	Well, there's a new world waiting right outside that door. And we're not going to give up until we can reach it.
1DI0015870	I just don't know. Don't they realize how dangerous it is out there?
1DI0015871	But instead, they would throw away the safety of the Vault's isolation, just to follow in your footsteps.
1DI0015872	I can't allow them to do that to themselves, or to the rest of us.
1DI0015873	We can never really thank you enough for everything you've done. It's not much, but take this with you, to remember us by.
1DI0015874	It'll be a while before we're actually ready to go outside. But once the Vault is stable again, maybe we'll see you out there.
1DI0015875	So I guess this is goodbye for now. But with luck, we'll meet again.
1DI0015876	No, it's not like that. But if you stay, it'll just keep causing more problems. The Vault can't take any more in-fighting. It's just what has to be.
1DI0015877	It'll be a while before we're ready to really go outside. But once the Vault is stable again, maybe we'll see you out there.
1DI0015878	So I guess this is goodbye for now. It's not much, but take this with you, to remember us by. With luck, we'll meet again.
1DI0015879	That's why we need to be able to go outside! We can trade with them, get supplies and things we both need. Even just to meet new people...
1DI0015880	But none of that can happen while my father's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
1DI0015882	But none of that can happen while the new Overseer's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
1DI0015883	And all this time, we're living in a tiny world that's been falling apart for two hundred years.
1DI0015884	If we don't take a chance out there, we're just going to die down here.
1DI0015889	I... I just can't believe you. If we stay here, we'll just wither away over the years. There has to be something for us out there.
1DI0015890	But we don't even have that chance while my father's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done. You know that better than anyone.
1DI0015892	But we don't even have that chance while the new Overseer's got the place locked down. Please, something has to be done!
1DI0015893	Oh, thank you! Everything's gone crazy since you left, and now that you're back, you can help set things straight.
1DI0015894	You and him? Civil? I expected you to change out in the Wasteland, but not that much!
1DI0015895	But I guess we'll all be learning a bit about the outside now, won't we? As the new Overseer, I'm planning on opening the Vault, this time for good.
1DI0015896	It's a bright new day for the Vault... but I'm afraid there's one thing that has to change.
1DI0015897	I'm sure you did everything you could to find another way. I know how stubborn he is... how stubborn he was.
1DI0015898	But you're right. I don't have time to grieve just because I lost my father. The Vault needs a leader now.
1DI0015899	That makes the rest of this even harder.
1DI0015901	But you're right. We don't have time to grieve. The Vault needs a leader now. That makes the rest of this even harder.
1DI0015902	I missed your sense of humor, but I really don't think this is the time for jokes.
1DI0015903	We're in real trouble, and your help could make all the difference. So could you please take this seriously, for me?
1DI0015904	It's hard to forgive what he's done, but I suppose I can understand why he did it. I'm glad you brought him to his senses.
1DI0015905	But now there's a new Overseer in charge! And I'm planning on opening the Vault, this time for good.
1DI0015907	Oh, I will, believe me. We can open up limited trade with nearby settlements and other areas, and see the world we've been missing.
1DI0015908	But it's still important that I protect our Vault, and keep the people within it safe from the dangers of the Wasteland.
1DI0015909	Even when those dangers have helped us in the past. And that makes the rest of this even harder.
1DI0015910	What? Have you gone crazy from radiation or sunstroke or whatever they've got out there?
1DI0015911	This place is a police state and we're on the edge of a civil war. If you won't help for me, at least do it for your home!
1DI0015912	Well, thanks for keeping your cool and not resorting to violence. That sort of thing would only lead to more problems in the future.
1DI0015913	It's time for our dusty old Vault to have a new beginning. And it'll start by opening it up again, and this time for good.
1DI0015915	You bastard, that's still my father you're talking about!
1DI0015916	As new Overseer, my first action is to banish you from Vault 101 forever. Whatever sort of friend you used to be, the Wasteland's changed you.
1DI0015917	Now get out of my Vault, murderer.
1DI0015918	You bastard, that's still one of our people you're talking about!
1DI0015921	I just wish we could have saved more people. Jonas, and the Hannons, and so many others died that night.
1DI0015922	It was bad enough they died because my father was trying to keep the door closed, but then I found out it was all to protect a lie!
1DI0015923	I found out, the Vault wasn't always closed! They've lied to us about it for our entire lives!
1DI0015924	I know you are, and on behalf of the Vault, I thank you for all you've done. But there are still many who blame you for everything that happened.
1DI0015925	So I have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry, but the situation is just too delicate for you to stay.
1DI0015926	Please, if you really want to help the Vault, you have to go.
1DI0015927	I realize that. And I don't blame you. If you hadn't been here, maybe one of us would have done the same.
1DI0015928	You saved us. But that doesn't change the fact that you killed the Overseer in cold blood to do it, and I can't let that sort of thing stand here.
1DI0015929	I'm sorry. You're a hero... and you have to leave.
1DI0015930	Chaos doesn't even cover it! It's a nightmare down here!
1DI0015931	People died that night, and all because my father went crazy to keep someone from opening the Vault.
1DI0015932	And worst of all, then we found out the Vault had been opened before - and they'd lied about it all our lives!
1DI0015933	There are still so many things to repair, and a lot of bad feelings to mend. Some people still blame you for what happened.
1DI0015936	You saved us. But that doesn't change the fact that you killed one of us to do it, and I can't let that sort of thing stand here.
1DI0015937	I guess it's a bit familiar. You've already been forced out of the Vault once before. At least now you know what's out there.
1DI0015939	What? You think they've got some explanation for their side of the story? You think you can trust anything they say?
1DI0015940	All those people died because my father claimed he wanted to keep the Vault safe and secure. But all this time, that's been a lie!
1DI0015941	I found out that he opened the Vault years ago, before we were born. And they've been lying to us about it for our entire lives!
1DI0015942	What the hell do you mean? Take a look around! If we weren't dying down here before that night, we're definitely on our way now.
1DI0015943	How much worse could it be if we tried to leave? There has to be something out there worth finding.
1DI0015944	Don't you try to blame this on us! It was all my father and his cronies who tried to keep us from ever going outside.
1DI0015945	We found out that the Vault used to be open before we were born! They've been lying to us all our lives - and people have died because of it!
1DI0015946	After that night, I heard Wally's father say we should never have taken you or your dad into the Vault.
1DI0015947	I found out the Vault used to be open, but for some reason, they closed it off when we were babies and swore to hide it had ever happened.
1DI0015948	But keeping that lie meant Jonas's death. And even though we know the truth, the Overseer still won't let us make our own decisions!
1DI0015949	I heard we sent a couple of scouts outside, long ago. Maybe the suit was theirs.
1DI0015950	The Vault was open for a while, but for some reason, they closed it off when we were babies and everyone swore to deny it had ever happened.
1DI0015951	But then Jonas died, and they're keeping us locked in here, all to protect that fantasy of remaining "untainted" by the outside world!
1DI0015952	It turns out that all of our parents were in on it. Your dad more than most, I guess.
1DI0015953	But for some reason, they closed the door when we were babies, and swore to pretend the outside was uninhabitable.
1DI0015954	But now people have died for that lie, and even though we know the truth, the Overseer still won't let us try to contact the outside!
1DI0015955	What? How long did you know about this?
1DI0015956	You know what? Never mind. What's important is that now we know that we were lied to all our lives, and that people have died for that lie.
1DI0015957	And even now, when we most need help, the Overseer still won't let us try to communicate with the outside!
1DI0015958	You're absolutely right. It's not like we want to abandon the Vault, or anything!
1DI0015959	Well, Butch does, but he's too big a coward to go out on his own.
1DI0015960	Most of us had accepted that the outside was certain death and things would always stay the same down here. But now we know they don't have to be!
1DI0015961	After all, it was enough to get you and your dad to leave, so there must be something good out there.
1DI0015965	It's not that simple. Just because Butch wants to leave this place behind doesn't mean the rest of us want to go away forever.
1DI0015966	It's our home, and we want to stay here. It's just that since you left, we started thinking maybe the outside wasn't something to be afraid of.
1DI0015967	But we can't even suggest going outside to communicate or trade at all. Not with the Overseer keeping us trapped down here! You need to stop him!
1DI0015968	It's not that simple. It's not like we want to abandon the Vault or anything.
1DI0015969	It's our home, and we want to stay here. It's just that since you went out there, we started thinking maybe it wasn't something to be afraid of.
1DI0015971	Are you honestly comparing, "Maybe we should look for help" with, "Stay in an underground bunker all your life or I'll kill you?"
1DI0015972	Obviously, I don't know what's out there, but it can't hurt to take a look, right?
1DI0015973	Your dad didn't kill Jonas. Your dad didn't lock down the Vault. Your dad isn't the one keeping us from leaving right now.
1DI0015974	My dad did. And we need to take a stand against him!
1DI0015976	No, all of that was done by the Overseer, first my dad, and now Allen Mack. And we need to take a stand against him!
1DI0015977	I guess you must have more important things waiting for you outside. So I'll make this quick.
1DI0015978	When you left, we realized we could leave the Vault. But my father won't stand for it, and it's just getting worse down here.
1DI0015979	Father won't listen to us, and it's getting close to violence. So we need your help. I need your help.
1DI0015981	When you left, we realized we could leave the Vault. But the Overseer won't stand for it, and it's just getting worse down here.
1DI0015982	He won't listen to us, but he can't just ignore you. So we need your help. I need your help.
1DI0015983	I didn't mean to fire, I really didn't. I just wanted to scare him off! But he had a knife! I can't be too careful with those rebels!
1DI0015984	I tell you, those guards are getting nastier every day. One of these days, it's gonna turn real ugly. But I'll be ready for it.
1DI0015985	That's it, old man! We're opening that door, and to hell with the Overseer's rules!
1DI0015986	You know I can't do that, Freddie. Now get back down below, before I have to do something we'll both regret.
1DI0015987	What, you're gonna lock me up like you did to Brotch? You can't cage a Tunnel Snake, man! Because we rule!
1DI0015989	Holy crap, you're crazy!
1DI0015990	Uh oh. Wait here. This doesn't look good.
1DI0015991	Taylor, stop shooting, damnit!
1DI0015993	I'm gonna barber the hell outta that hair!
1DI0015994	Okay, hold still.
1DI0015995	The damned G.O.A.T. said I'm supposed to be a hairdresser, but that ain't me!
1DI0015996	I'm a barber, you got that? There's a difference!
1DI0015998	I'm gonna barber the hell outta your hair!
1DI0016000	I'll start a gang, of course! Why, it'll be the toughest, coolest, badass-est gang the Wasteland's ever seen!
1DI0016001	Hey, play your cards right, maybe I'll even let you join it, huh?
1DI0016002	Yeah, but I'm thinking it'll be a new gang. We ain't going to just be in tunnels, you know!
1DI0016003	Besides, there's gonna be a lot more people who want to join. Competition's gonna be tough!
1DI0016004	'Cause maybe you've got an ounce of sense. Everyone's gonna want to join, once they know Butch is in town!
1DI0016005	Well, they ain't seen nothing like me, yet. Butch is gonna take that Wasteland by storm!
1DI0016006	Yeah, well get us out of here, and we'll see, won't we?
1DI0016007	Because you've always been a goody two-shoes, so when I need help, it's what you're gonna do, right?
1DI0016008	You're going to help Amata anyway, right? Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I'll leave and never bother you again.
1DI0016009	Look, I know I've been kind of a jerk. But I don't deserve to be stuck down here forever. Not when I could have a real life up there like you.
1DI0016010	I mean, you're kind of a jerk sometimes, and you make it work up there. So why not me?
1DI0016011	Just make it so we can leave the Vault, and I can go out there for my new life. Heck, maybe we could form a gang, huh?
1DI0016012	You left this place, so I bet you hate it as much as I do. So you can imagine how crappy it'd be to be stuck down here forever, yeah?
1DI0016013	Are you gonna force all of us to live like that, now that we've learned we could actually leave and try for something new?
1DI0016014	Just make it so we can get out of this vault, and I'll be gone, man. Then you don't ever need to see me again, okay?
1DI0016023	What?! This is terrible! The vault will become uninhabitable!
1DI0016024	How the hell can this be happening?
1DI0016027	Oh my god. The Vault's doomed. Everyone has to evacuate, and there's no way most of them will survive out there.
1DI0016028	How did this happen?
1DI0016029	What in the world? This is insane! We've got to get people to safety! But where can we go?
1DI0016030	Oh my god... There's only one solution, isn't there? Outside.
1DI0016031	You're gonna make sure we're okay out there, right?
1DI0016032	Really? Score!
1DI0016033	Goodbye, hellhole! I'm off to a new life!
1DI0016034	How many of them do you think will survive out there? They're already in a panic, and running out to their death!
1DI0016035	But you won't be joining them outside. I'll see to that myself!
1DI0016036	You've destroyed our home, just to prove a point? You're insane! You're worse than my father ever was!
1DI0016037	I should never have helped you that night. I should have stayed with my father, and watched him kill you.
1DI0016038	Now, you can stay down here and die, for all I care! If you ever talk to me again out there, I'll kill you.
1DI0016039	Are you kidding me? It's a dream come true, man!  Butch the Hairdresser is no more, now I'm gonna be Butch the Wasteland Wanderer!
1DI0016040	Maybe I can form a gang of my own. Maybe call it the Wasteland Radicals, or maybe the Rad Scorpions. Hey, wanna join?
1DI0016041	Oh, thank goodness. We'd never make it out there without you.
1DI0016042	Why? Why would they throw away their home, just to die outside in that miserable wasteland? Was I really so terrible an overseer?
1DI0016043	I must have pushed them too hard, made the unknown seem too tempting. And now I've failed them. Their deaths will be my fault.
1DI0016044	Please, help a few of them stay alive out there. And say goodbye to my daughter for me.
1DI0016045	I'll stay with the Vault. It was my responsibility, and my failure.
1DI0016046	I... I knew he was crazy, but I never would have thought he'd try to kill us all. It just doesn't make sense.
1DI0016047	But there's no time for that now, is there? Now our only chance is to survive outside on our own.
1DI0016048	Maybe I can still find where some of them went. If we split up, it shouldn't be too hard. How big can the world be, anyway?
1DI0016049	Thanks for trying to help us. Maybe we'll meet again out there.
1DI0016054	Yeah, well, I can learn, can't I? If you can do it, it's gotta be pretty easy.
1DI0016056	You're just going to leave us out there? You grew up with us as family, and you're going to leave us to die?
1DI0016057	Fine! Leave, then! We don't need help from your type. Your father would be ashamed of you!
1DI0016058	They're a bunch of hellions, that's what they are. I'm at my wits' end about them, I really am.
1DI0016059	Those kids are risking our entire Vault, just because they're bored. It's horrible!
1DI0016060	It's just a phase they're going through. Every kid thinks they want to leave the Vault at some point, but we all grew out of it.
1DI0016061	What do you expect from idiots like them? I'm just glad I was done with Butch's stupid gang before they got involved in all this.
1DI0016062	More kids looking to get us all killed. Now it's up to security to keep them in line.
1DI0016063	They don't know what they're doing, and it's up to us adults to keep them from getting everyone killed.
1DI0016064	I expect as much from some of those idiot kids and batty old Palmer, but I expected more sense from Brotch.
1DI0016065	I tell you, I'm scared of them. I never know when they're going to try something dangerous!
1DI0016066	I wouldn't call us "rebels." I mean, we don't agree with the Overseer, but we still love the Vault. We just want to try going outside, too.
1DI0016067	The Overseer thinks he's in charge of us, just because it's his job? Well, nuts to that! We do what we want, and we want to open the Vault!
1DI0016068	I hate that this whole thing has turned us against our families, but we just can't keep living down here forever. I mean, look at this place!
1DI0016069	Most of them are just kids who're caught up in the idea of seeing the world. But I know we've got to actually open the Vault if we want to survive.
1DI0016070	Otherwise, we're just going to dwindle away down here, until it's all too late.
1DI0016071	Oh, dear, we aren't asking for anything special. The Vault's been open before, but for some reason, everyone tries to pretend it wasn't.
1DI0016072	I guess they try to forget the poor souls who never came back from out there.
1DI0016073	It's all kind of blurry for me, but I hear I owe you for saving me. But don't expect much. The whole thing was your Dad's fault in the first place!
1DI0016074	The bugs were horrible, but my family was pretty lucky. But then my Freddie went and got caught up with those idiot rebels!
1DI0016075	With all of the bugs and the fires, there was an awful lot of strain on the systems down on the reactor level.
1DI0016076	Our water chip's pretty delicate right now, but I'm working on setting her right again.
1DI0016077	You shoulda seen my pop, he personally saved old Stanley! But  guess you wouldn't know what it's like to have a hero for a dad, would you?
1DI0016078	After what happened to Vikki and my boy that night, your corpse should be strung up as a warning to anyone else thinks about heading outside.
1DI0016079	Bugs. Fires. Confusion. Panic. What do you care? You and your dad started the whole mess.
1DI0016080	We were so busy fighting those bugs, there wasn't anyone to help put out the fires that started after you left. It was horrible.
1DI0016081	I lost my poor wife Agnes, is what happened. In all the chaos and fighting, her old ticker just couldn't take it anymore.
1DI0016082	Mom and little Monica got caught in the fires. I tried to get them out, I really did, but it was just too hot.
1DI0016083	I know it wasn't your fault, but my dad doesn't think as highly of you. You wouldn't want to hear what he said he'd do to your dad, either.
1DI0016084	Paul got bit real bad by some of those Radroaches, but he thought he could tough it out. If we'd had a doctor to treat him, he might still be here.
1DI0016085	A lot of security got wounded and worse. In all the confusion, we still don't know who's responsible for some of them.
1DI0016086	It was pretty rough, I'll tell you. I know a lot of folks blame your dad, but I know he didn't mean to cause all that. Don't blame him, or yourself.
1DI0016087	My poor grandson Jonas died, is what happened. They say it was just an accident in all the confusion, but I know it was the Overseer.
1DI0016088	Maybe. She isn't the only one, that's for sure.
1DI0016089	Ever since that night, it's been madness down here. Nothing but trouble.
1DI0016090	Technically, this means I'm supposed to report her. To tell the truth, I'm supposed to report you being here, too.
1DI0016091	But I've been getting mighty forgetful in my old age, you know? We've got more than enough trouble without me adding to it.
1DI0016092	Amata's up there, in the clinic with the rest of them. I'd take you closer, but they don't get along with security. Good luck.
1DI0016093	Visitor, sir. He wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop him.
1DI0016094	Visitor, sir. She wanted to see you, and... well, there's not much I could do to stop her.
1DI0016095	I guess you've had a lot on your mind since you were here last. Where do you want to go?
1DI0016096	Where to?
1DI0016097	Let me bring you up to speed. It seems like it's been a mighty long time.
1DI0016098	The night you and your dad left, everything went crazy. Between the bugs and the confusion, we lost a lot of people.
1DI0016099	When your dad opened up that gate, he let loose a whole lot of crap, if you'll pardon my language.
1DI0016100	Everything went crazy, is what happened. Your dad opened that door, bugs started attacking, and people started going crazy.
1DI0016101	When the smoke cleared, there were a lot of casualties and not many answers.
1DI0016102	Didn't help that our doctor had just left, either.
1DI0016103	It wouldn't have if your father hadn't ruined everything by opening that door!
1DI0016104	Things were just fine until he decided to take a little walk! Then we had bug attacks, confusion, and chaos! And with no doctor, too!
1DI0016105	Really? Well, that would explain a few things, all right. It's a good thing you're here, after all.
1DI0016106	After that night, a lot of your friends started thinking, "If it's safe to go outside, why stay down here forever?"
1DI0016107	And that's not the sort of thing the Overseer likes to hear. Things have gotten pretty tense.
1DI0016108	He wasn't the only one who didn't make it to morning. It was a horrible, horrible night.
1DI0016109	Believe it or not, it was Allen Mack who really stepped up in the crisis. Wally's dad really saved some lives, and got named the new Overseer for it.
1DI0016110	Then, just when some hoped he might open the door for good, he declared martial law and said the place would stay sealed off forever.
1DI0016111	I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. Regardless of how things turned out down here, he was a good friend. I always figured he'd do well outside.
1DI0016112	Matter of fact, a lot of folks started thinking he had the right idea. He usually did. So if it was safe out there, why stay down here forever?
1DI0016113	Well, the Overseer didn't like that one bit, and started cracking down on that sort of thought. Guess he didn't plan on you coming back.
1DI0016115	You're not alone in that, though. In all the chaos, Amata lost her dad, too. Lots of us lost family, to tell the truth.
1DI0016116	Now Allen Mack's the Overseer, and he's taking a hard stance against those who want the vault to open again.
1DI0016117	To tell the truth, I don't really blame him for all that. I don't know why he left, but I do know he'd never intend for all that to happen.
1DI0016118	But when the smoke cleared, other people started thinking about opening the vault permanently. And that didn't go down well with the Overseer.
1DI0016119	He's been coming down hard on them, and that's where it stands now. At least, until you walked in here.
1DI0016121	Even so, we lost a lot of people that night, including the Overseer himself. He was replaced by Allen Mack, Wally's dad, and things seemed all right.
1DI0016122	But some of your friends started talking about opening the vault for good, and he came down hard on them. Things are pretty tense, now.
1DI0016123	I probably ought to put you under arrest and take you in to the Overseer, but frankly, I know better than to try that.
1DI0016124	Meanwhile, some of your old friends think opening the Vault is a good idea. I bet those rebels would like a word with you. Now, more than ever.
1DI0016125	Of course, if you want, you can just walk away as if you were never here. Out of respect for your dad, I won't even tell anyone I saw you.
1DI0016126	I can't do that. Not officially, at least. As much as some of the rebels would like to talk with you, the Overseer said you weren't welcome back.
1DI0016127	Of course, if you survived whatever's out there, none of us could stop you if you really wanted to cause problems. But I'd prefer if you don't.
1DI0016128	But out of respect to your dad, I could turn a blind eye. You could slip out and say you were never here - I won't tell a soul.
1DI0016129	Amata's message? I don't know what you're talking about, but I'd keep that under your hat, for her sake.
1DI0016130	She could get in real trouble if people found out she sent you a message. So could I, just for talking with you now.
1DI0016131	You just thought you'd pop in? Don't take this the wrong way, but you probably ought to just turn around and not come back.
1DI0016132	Things... Well, they haven't gone very well since you and your dad left.
1DI0016133	This isn't the happy vault you grew up in, anymore. There's real trouble.
1DI0016134	This isn't some sort of hotel, you know! You don't just come and go as you please. I thought you were raised better than that!
1DI0016135	Sorry, it's just been pretty rough down here since you and your dad left.
1DI0016136	There's real trouble brewing, and you don't want to be a part of it.
1DI0016137	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down, there. Amata's not in any danger.
1DI0016138	I mean, we're all in a sort of a rough patch, but we've weathered worse.
1DI0016139	But, sorry to say... If you're back, there's going to be trouble with some folks. And if Amata's wrapped up in it, there'll be trouble for her, too.
1DI0016140	Oh, save it. If you really cared about us, you'd be helping, instead of leaving us to our fate.
1DI0016141	But please, don't let us naive vault dwellers keep you from your exciting world above. I'm sure we'll be fine, entombed down here forever.
1DI0016142	Good. I'd hate if one of our more overzealous guards misconstrued your delay as an act of rebellion or sabotage of our vault.
1DI0016143	And here I was hoping you'd be able to help. Well, I hope you have better luck outside.
1DI0016144	I'm sure we'll find a way to make it through down here on our own.
1DI0016145	It's awful. Stuck in one room with Miss Palmer? It's just weird.
1DI0016146	Terrible! I can't believe I have to share a dorm with old lady Palmer. How creepy is that?
1DI0016147	I remember you said, yeah. That's so gross. Don't you wish it could be just Butch, instead?
1DI0016148	Ew, that's just creepy. Wouldn't it be so much better if it was just Butch, instead? He's dreamy.
1DI0016149	I don't know. He's not really my type. But at least you're here, too!
1DI0016150	Not really. I mean, sure he's cool, but I don't really like him like that. You know? I'm just glad you're here, too.
1DI0016151	That'd be Allen Mack. You remember, Wally's dad.
1DI0016152	He was something else when those fires started burning. In fact, if it weren't for him, we'd have lost a lot more than we did.
1DI0016153	Afterwards, well, he seemed like a natural for the job of Overseer. He's tough, but I guess we could probably use that right about now.
1DI0016154	It's just like up here, Pep. The place is a mess. I've got to be extra careful right about now.
1DI0016155	Whole place is running a little too hot, but it'll calm down in time, like everything else around here.
1DI0016156	I hope so, dear. I really do.
1DI0016157	Maybe you can change the Overseer's mind, dear.
1DI0016159	Well, that's okay, then.
1DI0016160	I'll do what I can. Just, please, help us!
1DI0016161	And thanks for not giving up on us. I knew you wouldn't.
1DI0016162	Actually, I suspect that's worth testing.
1DI0016163	Security! Do away with this intruder!
1DI0016164	That's good to hear, kid. I'll do what I can to keep the door unlocked for you, but the rest is up to you.
1DI0016165	I certainly hope so. We can't keep going on like this.
1DI0016166	Really? Humor me.
1DI0016167	To fix what you started? Go ahead and humor me.
1DI0016168	Damnit, this is no time for joking around!
1DI0016169	Of course you aren't.
1DI0016170	I should have remembered. I was just worried, I don't know, maybe your time outside had changed you.
1DI0016171	Thanks, and good luck talking to him. Let me know when you change his mind!
1DI0016172	Well, yes, but... he may have done some terrible things, but he's still my father, you know?
1DI0016173	Please, for my sake, don't hurt him.
1DI0016174	Well, yes, but... he may have done some terrible things, but he's still part of the Vault, you know?
1DI0016176	But... he's still my father. He may have made terrible choices that night, but he's the same person who's always looked out for us before then.
1DI0016177	Maybe he has some reason. Just, please don't kill him. We've already had too many deaths.
1DI0016178	I understand, but please don't kill him. We've already lost so many, and violence isn't going to bring them back.
1DI0016179	No, please! I know he's hurt and lied to us, but he's still my father! I just want him to stop keeping us locked up, that's all!
1DI0016180	I know I can't stop you, but I know somewhere in there, my father just thinks he's just watching out for us. So, please, please don't hurt him.
1DI0016181	What exactly do you mean by that?
1DI0016182	You know what? I hear the last Overseer tried being reasonable about things, and you killed him for his efforts.
1DI0016183	I think I'll skip the "reasonable" thing and just kill you now.
1DI0016184	Oh, do you? What makes you think you know how better to protect this Vault?
1DI0016185	It is? Even with a crazy dictator running the show?
1DI0016186	I guess we do have renewable food and water, impenetrable defenses, and a wealth of active technology. Those must be rare outside, huh?
1DI0016187	And I still say we're not giving up on our chance to with the outside world.
1DI0016188	I admit, in the 200 years since the war, our numbers have dwindled a little. But we have enough genetic diversity for... a few more generations.
1DI0016189	My God, you're right. We won't last another hundred years, whether or not we get supplies from the outside.
1DI0016190	We're the last bastion of pure humanity, and we're doomed.
1DI0016191	The mission of this Vault has always been to ensure a safe haven for pure humans. We owe it to our species to keep to that mission.
1DI0016192	You mean, there really are deadly threats out there? It hasn't all just been lies to keep us down here?
1DI0016193	I guess I never thought that was actually true. But I can tell you really mean it about the Enclave. I couldn't risk leading them to the Vault.
1DI0016194	Damnit, I told them I won't let this degenerate into violence again! The Vault simply can't take the instability anymore!
1DI0016195	But maybe you're right. They simply can't stand the pressure anymore, and now the purity and perfection of my Vault is crumbling all around me.
1DI0016196	The person you should be convincing is the Overseer. Go talk with him.
1DI0016197	I deeply doubt it. But your naive ramblings do have a certain entertainment value.
1DI0016198	I'm not afraid of dying... But if I leave, others will try to follow. And I couldn't live with their deaths on my conscience.
1DI0016199	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell my father that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
1DI0016200	Thanks for watching out for us. We'll all miss you.
1DI0016202	Okay, you win. Go ahead and tell the Overseer that we'll stop trying to leave the vault. You and he are right.
1DI0016204	I wish I could share your optimism. But I suppose you have a point, in your blathering way.
1DI0016205	My way won't save our Vault's mission. But if I let them contact the outside world, I might be able to save its inhabitants.
1DI0016206	But I'm not the one to lead them in that. I'm stepping down as Overseer. I'll tell Amata that I can think of no more appropriate leader than she.
1DI0016207	I'm not an idiot for wanting to leave! But I guess I wouldn't be the only one leaving. And I couldn't risk leading others to their death like that.
1DI0016213	And you expect me to believe that the only way to do that is to let them travel out in the Wastes and mingle with those savages?
1DI0016214	I suppose it would allow them to stay alive, and we could still keep the Vault as our safe haven. But it'd require a new type of leader.
1DI0016215	And I know only one person with the proper attitude to do that. I'll inform my daughter Amata that she is the new Overseer, effective immediately.
1DI0016216	I heard old Stanley complaining a lot of the stuff down in the reactor got fried pretty bad.
1DI0016217	Nothing too bad... yet. But he's always worrying we'll lose air filtration or whatever.
1DI0016218	Of course, if that happened... guess we'd all have to leave the vault then, huh?
1DI0016219	The real problems came after you two left. The injured had nobody to turn to, since our doctor had run off, and his assistant had died.
1DI0016220	Now we've got to rely on that old Mr. Handy for most of our medical needs. And he hasn't exactly got the best bedside manner.
1DI0016221	Ever had an examination from someone with cold, metal pincers? You don't want to!
1DI0016222	What sort of help do you think I mean? You must have heard about the changes since you left, right?
1DI0016223	The deaths, the lies, the whole Overseer lockdown thing? Ringing any bells?
1DI0016224	Man, they'd have rushed in here long ago if they didn't know I stole one of their guns from when they issued martial law!
1DI0016225	Anyway, you gotta help us get out of here. You gotta help me get out of here.
1DI0016226	Because you're a goody two-shoes, right? You get off on helping people in trouble? Isn't that why you saved my mom?
1DI0016227	I bet she'd thank you herself, but she and I ain't exactly on speaking terms at the moment. At least, not when she's sober.
1DI0016228	But I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
1DI0016229	You shut up! Just shut up and listen, okay?
1DI0016230	Listen, you're about the only person who ever had the sense to get out of this place.
1DI0016231	I tell you, your old man had the right idea. I can't stand it down here anymore. You gotta help me get out.
1DI0016232	Man, screw the entire Vault, what about me?
1DI0016233	Even these rebels just want the option to go outside for lousy trading and stuff. I just want to get the hell out of here for good.
1DI0016234	Why stay here and be stuck as a barber for my entire life when I could go out there and make my own choices?
1DI0016235	Because anything up there has got to be better than a lifetime of the same thing down here.
1DI0016236	Think about it, man. Down here, I'll always be stuck with the same job, with the same food, with the same people, forever.
1DI0016237	You and your dad had the right idea: get out of this pit and make your own life.
1DI0016238	No, but he didn't risk bringing you out into it, either.
1DI0016239	You have to wonder, is that why he left you behind? He wanted to know you were someplace safe?
1DI0016240	And then, like a fool, you squandered the greatest gift he ever left you.
1DI0016241	I'm glad we're in agreement, there. He left us all behind and caused quite a deal of trouble, all because he apparently got tired of the Vault.
1DI0016242	As useful as his services were, in the end, he just wasn't willing to make sacrifices for the community.
1DI0016243	Sir? It's the only world we've ever known. With a regrettable exception, I suppose.
1DI0016244	It's our home, sir. It's seen better days, of course, but we won't be making the same mistakes again, of course.
1DI0016245	Yes. You're right, of course. It was a mistake to let the doctor into our home, but we'll soon recover from his treatment.
1DI0016246	Indeed. As much as it seemed a good idea at the time, we should never have taken that doctor into our world.
1DI0016247	We'll have the place back to normal in no time, sir. It'll just take some time to repair the damages he caused.
1DI0016248	Don't blame yourself, sir. We'll scrub every last trace of his influence from these halls, and then everything can go back to normal.
1DI0016249	Amata... Everyone... Listen closely. After a discussion with your friend, I've made an important decision.
1DI0016250	In my attempts to keep us all safe, I have been, perhaps, overzealous.
1DI0016251	Lives have been lost, but perhaps worse than that, lives have been stopped. And in my attempts to keep you safe, I have kept you from growing up.
1DI0016252	I know I have made these mistakes. And I would make them again if I had to do so.
1DI0016253	That is why I cannot remain your Overseer.
1DI0016254	Father!
1DI0016255	Amata, I appoint you Overseer in my place. You've proven you have what it takes to make hard choices for the good of the Vault.
1DI0016256	I'm just sorry I didn't understand that earlier. Consider it one of many mistakes I've made.
1DI0016257	Thank you, father. I'll do my best to keep us all safe, inside the Vault and beyond.
1DI0016258	You're welcome, my dear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel quite worn down.
1DI0016259	We'll deal with the details soon, in private. Until then, I'm sure there are people waiting to congratulate you.
1DI0016260	It's about time someone finished you!
1DI0016261	I expected nothing more from you.
1DI0016262	Is that what they say? And you believed them? Ha!
1DI0016263	Why, if it weren't for me, they'd go outside and die in seconds flat. They're just caught up in the idea of a change, is all.
1DI0016264	Now, I'll make this easy for you. You can walk away and let me handle the Vault, or I can put you down like a rabid dog. Your choice, kid.
1DI0016265	I assume you're talking about the unpleasantness when you left, yes?
1DI0016266	Jonas and your father were endangering the future success of this Vault and the safety of its residents.
1DI0016267	I did what I had to do to keep them from destroying all we had achieved here. I only wish I could have prevented it from happening at all.
1DI0016268	You really think I'll let you stay? You're out of your tiny little mind.
1DI0016269	Now, pick something I can shove in your arms before tossing you outside for good.
1DI0016270	Did you really think you would be allowed to stay? Yes, you've saved the Vault, to be sure. And, thus, probably the last pure humans in the world.
1DI0016271	All the more reason to keep you from returning to our community and polluting it with the taint of outside barbarism.
1DI0016272	Now, reconsider your request and pick a reward you can take with you when you return outside, wastelander.
1DI0016273	Really? Because you weren't here to talk with the last Overseer. That's why I'm in charge, now.
1DI0016274	So you'll excuse me if I don't trust you, and if I don't think you've got my Vault's best interests at heart.
1DI0016276	That would be where you're wrong, young man. By locking down this Vault, I'm protecting its future.
1DI0016277	In fact, I was protecting its future when I had to make those unpleasant choices the night you and your father abandoned us.
1DI0016278	I only wish I could have stopped your father before he left. If anyone's to blame for the unpleasantness, it's him.
1DI0016279	Useful stuff out there, I'll bet. And if it'll get you back out there faster, then all the better.
1DI0016280	We don't have much, but here you go. Now, get.
1DI0016281	Ah, of course. The basic currency of a lawless society. Maybe you'd like a few pointed sticks and fighting dogs, as well?
1DI0016282	We don't have much ammunition down here, but we should be able to spare some packaged meals.
1DI0016283	Here, perhaps it'll be of some comfort to you once you return to the Wastes. Now, go.
1DI0016284	What's the matter, runt? Did I hit a sore spot?
1DI0016285	I always knew we shouldn't have taken him in, and it looks like I was right all along. A perfect example of why we need to keep the Vault shut!
1DI0016287	Really? And here I had expected you to be full of bullets and bravado, but short on brains. Perhaps you've grown up since you left our Vault.
1DI0016288	I regret the unfortunate events of that night, but I'm afraid that once your father left us, they were unavoidable.
1DI0016289	The sad truth is that his actions presented a real and direct threat to the future success of our Vault. And so, regrettably, they had to be opposed.
1DI0016290	G.E.C.K.? We never had one of those things in the first place. We weren't supposed to ever leave, remember?
1DI0016291	But take this Modified Utility Jumpsuit. I guess the rebels thought it would be useful when they left. Obviously, that won't be happening now.
1DI0016292	Congrats, you saved the Vault. Now, get out.
1DI0016293	I'm afraid that, instead of a G.E.C.K., our Vault was supplied with technology better suited to functioning indefinitely.
1DI0016294	But take this Modified Utility Jumpsuit. It seems the rebels thought it would be useful when they left. Obviously, that won't be happening now.
1DI0016295	Thank you for saving our Vault. Now, you'll have to leave.
1DI0016296	Sure, fine. As it turns out, Brotch modified himself a utility jumpsuit for survival in the Wastes. As if he was ever getting out there.
1DI0016297	Here, it's yours. Don't say I never repaid a favor. Now, get the hell out of my Vault.
1DI0016298	I think we may have just the thing, taken from the rebels not long ago. Edwin Brotch modified a utility jumpsuit for "survival in the Wastes."
1DI0016299	It was a foolish idea, but that seems par for the course for them. I suppose they'd be happy to think it found its intended use, eventually.
1DI0016300	But enough of that. Thank you for saving our Vault. Now, you'll have to leave.
1DI0016301	First of all, I didn't kill Jonas. I commanded Chief Hannon to do so. But only because it had to be done.
1DI0016302	Jonas was going to leave with your father. If he left, others would have left to join them. And they'd all vanish into the Wastes, never to return.
1DI0016303	And with our numbers so depleted, we wouldn't be able to last beyond another generation. Assuming our expatriates didn't lead Raiders to us, first.
1DI0016304	I really don't recommend that sort of ultimatum. If you leave now, we can simply lock down the door controls and everyone can be happy.
1DI0016305	But if you insist, we can always toss your corpse out the gate after you're killed.
1DI0016306	The choice is yours. Goodbye.
1DI0016307	Spoken like someone who's never had to make difficult decisions. Like someone who's never had to lead.
1DI0016308	Jonas was leaving with your father. Their departure would lead to others leaving as well. And before you know it, half of the Vault would be gone.
1DI0016309	And then, our home - the last safe, pure bastion of humanity - would be reduced to a lonely handful of aging hold-outs, too few to continue.
1DI0016310	I will. I know there are some that will miss you, much as there are still some that miss your father.
1DI0016311	Not me, of course, but some of the others. Sentimental fools. But, you've restored peace to the Vault, and in that way, you're a hero.
1DI0016312	And you have to leave. Thank you, and goodbye, Wastelander.
1DI0016313	Ah, you're paying attention. Good for you.
1DI0016314	These Vaults were designed to be safe havens for humanity, you see. But more than that, they were designed to test and protect us.
1DI0016315	And none more so than our Vault 101. We are to be a pure and protected breed of humans, never tainted by the ravages of the war above.
1DI0016316	Spoken with all of the eloquence I'd expect from a wastelander.
1DI0016317	Farewell, and feel free to enjoy your brutal hellscape above, savage.
1DI0016318	I've spent many nights asking myself exactly that. He certainly didn't tell me before he left.
1DI0016319	I blame myself, really. I should have known better than to let him enter our home in the first place. He certainly showed his true colors in the end.
1DI0016320	Were he raised in the cleanliness of our Vault, perhaps your father would have shown more dedication to the important things in life.
1DI0016321	Just as well that he left. We mustn't let humanity's last pure specimens be sullied with his type.
1DI0016322	Hardly. If anything, the only thing keeping it safe and pure is my strict supervision.
1DI0016323	But I wouldn't expect you to understand. You were never really one of us, anyway. Your father was from the Wastes, and that's where you belong.
1DI0016324	I think our meaningful discussion is at an end. I'm going to have to ask you to leave and never return. But death's always an option, too.
1DI0016325	I'm afraid you're the shortsighted one, here. I'm simply keeping them safe and untouched by the war above.
1DI0016326	The real danger are the rebels and insurgents who insist on risking all of our lives just to die out there in the Wastes.
1DI0016327	If they weren't trying to throw our lives away like that, we could go back to the peaceful life we once had. Everyone would be happy again.
1DI0016328	And what makes you so certain about that? I can't imagine you're still so naive after spending time in that hell outside.
1DI0016329	None of them know what the outside is like, and most of them would die out there. Then the rest of us inside would eventually die out, too.
1DI0016330	I won't risk all of our lives just for few people's passing fancy of taking a Wasteland vacation. I hope you can understand that.
1DI0016331	I'm trying to save my people. Possibly the only pure, safe humans left in the world.
1DI0016332	Don't destroy humanity's last chance just because you don't like the choices I've had to make to protect it.
1DI0016333	No, the Vaults have been so much more. But only the Overseers have known the truth, and we've passed it down very carefully.
1DI0016334	I had hoped to tell Amata when she took over, but with the way things are now, that doesn't seem likely to happen.
1DI0016335	But if you could convince her and the rebels to give up this foolish demand to leave, then we can return to our Vault's vital mission.
1DI0016336	It's not safe. We'll talk later.
1DI0016337	Yeah, sure, rebels. Any luck convincing anyone else to stand up to Father?
1DI0016338	We're not your ridiculous gang, Butch. We're actually trying to get something done. Any luck convincing more to join us?
1DI0016339	Looks like we're secure. What's the word up there?
1DI0016340	We're safe. How's everyone holding up in the dorms?
1DI0016341	Ix-nay on the alk-tay. We're being atched-way.
1DI0016342	Calm down, old man. How's life in the west dorms?
1DI0016343	Don't worry, we're fine. What's the word in the dorms?
1DI0016344	Come on, Amata. Who's gonna mess with me?
1DI0016345	You know me. The Butch man fears no Overseer.
1DI0016346	Hold on. The walls have ears.
1DI0016347	Looks like I made it through another day, for what that's worth. But I don't see much changing yet.
1DI0016348	I wasn't taken away in the night, for what that's worth. That's about the best news I've got to report.
1DI0016349	I survived the night, but I get the feeling there's change in the air. Don't know if it's good or bad, though.
1DI0016350	I'm still alive, but I don't know how long that luck'll last. Seems like something big's about to transpire.
1DI0016351	First time in your life you're a rebel with a cause, boy. Any luck convincing your friends to join you in it?
1DI0016352	You've got to take this seriously, boy. Any luck getting anyone else to join us?
1DI0016353	Well, I guess it could be worse. But if I know father, he's not just going to change his mind on this.
1DI0016354	That's better than nothing, I suppose. That may be all the good news we're getting, for now.
1DI0016355	Not yet. Freddie doesn't want to get in trouble, and Wally thinks we shouldn't be going outside, anyway.
1DI0016356	Paul would've joined up no problem, but... y'know. Anyway, no luck with them.
1DI0016357	They're still scared: enough to stay quiet, but not enough to risk doing anything.
1DI0016358	No development. They're still quiet and scared. We won't be getting any of them to make a stand anytime soon.
1DI0016359	Will do, Amata. You watch out for yourself, too.
1DI0016360	You don't need to tell me. Just keep an eye on your father, all right?
1DI0016361	That's a damned shame, but maybe they'll come around in time. Keep working at it.
1DI0016362	Hard to lead your Tunnel Snakes when they're afraid of getting stepped on, huh? Well, keep at it.
1DI0016363	Well, ain't you a bundle of smiles. If it were just about staying alive, we might as well stick with your Dad.
1DI0016364	Look on the bright side, Amata: you get to look at my handsome mug again. Who wouldn't want that?
1DI0016365	Pack of cowards, if you ask me. If they don't grow a spine soon, I'm heading out myself. I mean it this time!
1DI0016366	Aw, let 'em stay down here. One day, I'm heading out there on my own. I mean it.
1DI0016367	Keep talking to them. If we're going to take a stand, we really want them on our side.
1DI0016368	I swear, what sort of "rebels" are they? Keep talking to them, okay?
1DI0016369	Okay, keep listening, and see who else we can get to take a stand. And be careful up there.
1DI0016370	Keep an ear out up there. They'll get sick of father's lockdown eventually, and then we'll all take a stand.
1DI0016372	Sure, whatever.
1DI0016373	Yes, of course.
1DI0016375	Don't you have anything better to do?
1DI0016376	We're all the gang there is, Butch. But yeah, it's better than just sitting here alone.
1DI0016377	Better than sitting around at home, you know?
1DI0016378	Freddie, there's more to this than just getting out of the dorm. It's about freedom and standing up to the Man! Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0016379	Come on, have a little pride! What do Tunnel Snakes do? We don't sit around and hide in the dorm. We rule!
1DI0016380	I guess. But... it didn't rule so much for Paul.
1DI0016381	Yeah, we rule. It's just not the same without Paul saying it.
1DI0016382	Don't you get it? We don't want to abandon the Vault. We want to open it!
1DI0016383	We still want this to be our home, but we want to get supplies from outside. Trading, exploring, anything's better than just hiding down here!
1DI0016384	It's not that they want to leave. It's that they want to open the door and interact with the rest of the world. But that would risk the whole Vault.
1DI0016385	That's just about all I'm going to take from the likes of you!
1DI0016386	When you walked in, I thought you were different than the normal riff-raff that crawls out of the sand. I see now that I was wrong.
1DI0016387	Come back and talk to me when you decide to be more civil.
1DI0016388	That tears it!
1DI0016389	I've been calm and patient with you, but you just seem determined not to return in kind. Fine.
1DI0016390	Since you only understand rude behavior, allow me to demonstrate some for you. Get the hell out of my house!
1DI0016391	Sigh. My husband told me once to always forgive and forget. I suppose I should take that advice now, rest his poor soul.
1DI0016392	Consider the apology accepted, and your harsh words forgotten.
1DI0016393	I have a lot of patience, but you are really testing it.
1DI0016394	However, as I said before, forgive and forget.
1DI0016395	Oh, don't worry about me. I'm just fine out here.
1DI0016396	My husband, rest his poor soul, saw to it that our house was well-protected from the elements and the inhabitants of the Wastes.
1DI0016397	Honestly, there is nothing much out here. Looking for sand? Rocks? We have plenty of that.
1DI0016398	You're welcome to look around this area of course. Don't let me dissuade you. I'm just trying to save you some time.
1DI0016399	My husband built this place way out here for a reason, rest his soul.
1DI0016400	Hmph! Well. I see you have manners I'd come to expect from a Wasteland dweller.
1DI0016401	All I've done is offer you safe harbor in my home. No need to get testy with me, young man!
1DI0016403	All I've done is offer you safe harbor in my home. No need to get testy with me, young lady!
1DI0016404	That's kind of you to say.
1DI0016405	Yes, he's gone. After he built this place, we spent many happy years together.
1DI0016406	We decided to cut off contact with the outside world and just depend on each other for comfort and company.
1DI0016407	Apart from supply caravans, you're the first person to set foot inside my house in a long time.
1DI0016408	It's not for lack of trying at this point, mind you. I am just far off the beaten path.
1DI0016409	Living in this isolation protects me, but has also made me very lonely.
1DI0016410	Well! That's the most insulting thing anyone has ever said to me!
1DI0016411	Here I offer my hospitality and you spit it right back in my face.
1DI0016412	Oh goodness, no. I have a supply caravan that passes here maybe once a week.
1DI0016413	I trade with them for whatever I need and I stock up enough until they return.
1DI0016414	Old? Yes. Frail? No.
1DI0016415	I can still hold my own if I have to. My husband made me learn a thing or two about how to defend myself.
1DI0016416	Besides, I have a caravan come through here about once a week to trade. They'd miss me if I was gone.
1DI0016417	Watch the sass, captain sassy-pants!
1DI0016419	Besides, I have a caravan come through here about once a week. They'd miss me if I was gone.
1DI0016420	Besides shelter? Well, I offer something in the way of entertainment: I play songs on my homemade violin and people trade me goods.
1DI0016421	If not in person, I use my husband's old radio set. The men in the caravan say it keeps their morale up on lonely nights in the Wasteland.
1DI0016422	Well, I always have my husband's old radio set to fall back on.
1DI0016423	I used it once in an emergency when a group of Raiders was getting a bit too close for comfort to my house.
1DI0016424	Otherwise I use it to broadcast my so-called music I play from my homemade violin.
1DI0016425	That's disgusting! I'm old enough to be your grandmother. I won't have that kind of talk in this house.
1DI0016426	I play songs on my homemade violin and people trade me goods. Sellbaby, indeed!
1DI0016427	If not in person, I play it over my husband's old radio set. The men in the caravan say it keeps their morale up on lonely nights in the Wasteland.
1DI0016428	Now that you mention it, yes there is.
1DI0016429	My trading depends on my violin. Without it, I have nothing to play... no way to make music.
1DI0016430	If you can bring me a violin, a better one, I'd feel much more secure.
1DI0016431	You're very blunt. Not always a good trait, but sometimes it is the best way to get things done.
1DI0016434	Yes. My husband was very proud of the setup. He tinkered with that thing for years to get it working.
1DI0016435	I've tried to use it to get what I need, but I've never gotten a reply.
1DI0016436	Thank you. While my husband had his hobbies, I'm afraid mine was making that sorry instrument.
1DI0016437	I only wish I could replace it with something better.
1DI0016438	You are a clever one!
1DI0016439	Yes, that's exactly the problem that I have with it. It doesn't quite play all of the notes correctly and I have to constantly tinker with it.
1DI0016440	I'm sorry. I know I tend to ramble. Comes from being lonely.
1DI0016441	If you insist. I'll get right to the heart of the matter then. I'm looking for a particular violin, not just any.
1DI0016442	The violin you're looking for is called the Soil Stradivarius. It's located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
1DI0016443	Of a kind, yes. Hilda sent a good deal of letters to my great grandmother Mary who passed them on, and so forth.
1DI0016444	I suppose the correspondence could be considered a diary of sorts.
1DI0016445	It certainly is a long time. That precious instrument has been through a lot.
1DI0016446	Anyway, Hilda was quite a special woman. Classically trained and exceptionally talented at the violin.
1DI0016447	Her pride and joy was her Stradivarius Violin. I can only imagine how exquisite this instrument must have been.
1DI0016448	When war reared its head, she was invited by Vault-Tec into Vault 92. They claimed the vault would be dedicated to preserving musical talent.
1DI0016449	A famous man once said that patience is the companion of wisdom. If you shut your trap and listen, you might learn something.
1DI0016453	Vault-Tec was always promoting the Vaults being used for the preservation of the arts and all that nonsense.
1DI0016454	Hilda couldn't pass on a chance to meet many of the other musical talents of the world, so she accepted their invitation.
1DI0016455	Then the bombs fell. The Vault was sealed, and my family never heard from her again.
1DI0016456	Oh, absolutely irreplaceable! The Stradivarius violins are as unique as a painting or a sculpture... each one its own work of art.
1DI0016457	I think the opportunity to use that fine instrument with her fellow accomplished musicians was more than a draw for Hilda.
1DI0016458	Then, the bombs fell. The Vault was sealed, and my family never heard from her again.
1DI0016459	If you're that eager to get going I'll skip the story. I'm looking for a particular violin called the Soil Stradivarius.
1DI0016460	Its located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
1DI0016461	She kept it in a special pressurized case. Inside the case is the perfect temperature and humidity for the instrument.
1DI0016462	If the case is still functioning, the Stradivarius would be in perfect shape.
1DI0016463	Hilda's Stradivarius was named the Soil Stradivarius. All of them had names. That's what I want you to get.
1DI0016464	Don't you think I've thought of that?
1DI0016467	You know, my mother always said a handful of patience is worth more than a bushel of brains.
1DI0016468	However, if you're that eager to get going I'll skip the story. I'm looking for a particular violin called the Soil Stradivarius.
1DI0016469	It's located in Vault 92, where my great great grandmother once lived.
1DI0016470	Yes, very sad isn't it? Sad to think that no more musical instruments will ever be made the old way ever again.
1DI0016471	Sigh. Well, fortunately, I know where perhaps the last real violin in the world exists.
1DI0016472	If you give me your word that you will recover it, I will tell you more.
1DI0016473	As you may have already guessed, I really have nothing of value. Material value, that is.
1DI0016474	All I can offer you is the same I offer the caravans that trade with me. The frequency of my radio and the promise of beautiful music.
1DI0016475	It should be pretty obvious that I have nothing of value.
1DI0016477	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years! As promised, here's the key to the ammunition box. It's right under the radio table.
1DI0016478	Before you leave, I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
1DI0016479	It all starts with my great great grandmother Hilda back in 2077 before the bombs fell...
1DI0016480	Oh, I don't think I've been this happy in years!
1DI0016481	I have some information that may help you. At least a place to begin.
1DI0016482	It all starts with my great great grandmother back in 2077 before the bombs fell...
1DI0016483	Well, that's just so sweet of you!
1DI0016484	I feel bad sending you off with nothing like this.
1DI0016485	I have a small amount of ammunition that my husband left behind. A box of odds and ends. I don't think I've opened it in years.
1DI0016486	If you do this for me, you're welcome to take whatever you need.
1DI0016487	Oh my! I didn't know I still had the looks.
1DI0016488	Well, you just made my day you sweet thing! Let me give you something extra to help you on your way.
1DI0016491	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young man. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
1DI0016494	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people, young lady. However, you're right. I need to think of your needs too.
1DI0016497	You have a point. Perhaps I've been neglecting needs that you might have and being selfish.
1DI0016500	Sakes alive! You mean you found a violin?
1DI0016501	Oh my goodness! I must see it... please!
1DI0016502	It's like holding a chunk of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
1DI0016503	I can't thank you enough. I wish I had something to give you, a more suitable reward for all your efforts.
1DI0016504	All I can give you is the frequency to my radio set. Tune in whenever you feel like listening to the strains of an old woman's violin playing.
1DI0016505	Oh very well. I suppose I should have expected that from a Wastelander. Here's the key to my husband's ammo crate; take whatever you like.
1DI0016509	Well then, you interested in helping me or am I just wasting my time?
1DI0016510	I understand. Please don't mistake my evasiveness for mistrust. I am merely being cautious.
1DI0016511	Take your time, by all means.
1DI0016512	That's the catch. I have no idea where it is.
1DI0016513	I'd suggest making your way to Vault-Tec Headquarters in the D.C. Ruins. That would be a good place to begin.
1DI0016515	Manners are not your strong suit, eh? I can see this will be a purely business related transaction. So be it.
1DI0016517	You do? Amazing!
1DI0016518	Thank you for this. You have no idea what this means to me.
1DI0016519	Good luck to you!
1DI0016520	Well okay.
1DI0016521	Much better lately, thanks for asking.
1DI0016522	With the return of the Soil Stradivarius, everything has changed. It's like a long-lost family member has come home.
1DI0016523	Actually, I'm feeling quite sad right now. I have all this beautiful music in my head and only a terrible homemade violin to play it on.
1DI0016524	Blast this old woman's body I'm stuck in! I know where I could get my hands on a better one, but it's too far and too dangerous for the likes of me.
1DI0016525	It's such a pity to imagine what's happened to the Soil Stradivarius violin after all this time resting in Vault 92.
1DI0016526	Oh, don't be silly!
1DI0016527	I record everything I play on the nice machines built into my husband's old radio gear.
1DI0016528	That way you can hear the music anytime you want, and this old woman can get some well-needed beauty sleep!
1DI0016529	I would be delighted.
1DI0016530	Oh! Absolutely. It's the least I can do for all your efforts.
1DI0016531	I would love to play for you.
1DI0016532	You actually got it back. I didn't think you'd bother after that stunt you pulled.
1DI0016533	It's like holding a piece of history in the palm of my hands. Amazing, simply amazing.
1DI0016534	It may have been like pulling teeth, but at least you finally brought me the thing. Still, I'm lacking a suitable reward for what you've done.
1DI0016536	You son of a bitch! You know what that thing meant to me!
1DI0016537	It was a family heirloom. It belonged rightfully in the hands of a musician, someone to appreciate its value, not to exploit it!
1DI0016538	I can't believe you'd stab an old woman in the back like this! Get out! GET OUT OF HERE THIS INSTANT!
1DI0016539	My word! You actually found some REAL music paper? I didn't even think it possible.
1DI0016540	Yet here it is. You've really outdone yourself this time. I knew getting the Stradivarius was a challenge, but this is just incredible.
1DI0016541	This is all too much... you deserve more than just a pat on the back.
1DI0016542	I'm afraid I don't. I'm surprised you didn't find any in Vault 92 knowing that it was a place where musicians used to live.
1DI0016543	I would ask every merchant and just search the Wasteland. Perhaps one day you'll be in luck.
1DI0016544	Well, I suppose I could. They aren't my pieces of music by any stretch of the imagination though.
1DI0016545	You make a good point. I'm no spring chicken, so one day I'll be gone.
1DI0016546	Oh my, what if I'm the last person on the planet to know these pieces of music? What if all the recordings have been destroyed?
1DI0016547	To lose such beautiful music would be a shame.
1DI0016548	What a vulgar way to put it. However, you're right.
1DI0016549	What if I was the last person on the planet that had those pieces of music committed to memory?
1DI0016550	Imagine all those great works vanishing. It almost brings me to tears.
1DI0016551	Well, I only need two things. My noggin and some music paper.
1DI0016552	Well, darn it, I think I will!
1DI0016553	I remember all the notations. All I need now is some music paper to write it on.
1DI0016554	Nope, I sure don't. I need the music paper to properly record the notes.
1DI0016555	If I just wrote on anything, it may not look standard enough to teach everyone in the future to read from it properly.
1DI0016556	You think you can bring some to me?
1DI0016557	Look around you. Do you see any fancy computers or high tech gizmos?
1DI0016558	My husband and I were never into that kind of junk. The most hi-tech thing we have is the radio setup, and even that was old before the bombs fell.
1DI0016559	I need the paper... it's all I know how to use. Can you help me?
1DI0016560	Of course. There's no rush really, it was just an idea. Take your time.
1DI0016561	If you come across the paper on your travels, good. If not, I don't blame you one bit.
1DI0016562	I'm speechless. Thank you.
1DI0016563	You're welcome here any time. Consider my house as a safe haven if you're ever in the area.
1DI0016564	Now, let me get writing. So much to do!
1DI0016565	Well, like I told you before, I don't have wealth out here in the sticks, but I can certainly provide you something useful.
1DI0016566	My husband left me something else besides the radio setup. I think you'll find it useful.
1DI0016567	It's his old pistol. He tinkered with it some and used to practice with it all the time. Now I want you to have it.
1DI0016568	Manners are not your strong suit, are they?
1DI0016569	Here, take this pistol. It's all I have left. Use it to protect yourself, or shoot yourself in the foot for all I care.
1DI0016570	Now if you don't mind, I need to get some things done. Goodbye.
1DI0016571	Nonsense. I've never fired a gun before in my life and I'm not about to start any time soon.
1DI0016572	You take this thing and use it to protect yourself while you're out there. I'll be just fine. Here.
1DI0016573	Now, scoot. I have a lot of music to write.
1DI0016574	You're welcome. Just keep it clean and repaired and it will never let you down.
1DI0016575	Now, scoot. I have to get cracking on this music notation.
1DI0016576	I'm no richer now than I was before we met. All I can offer you is an old woman's thanks.
1DI0016580	Well, thank you. You've done so much for me already, I just don't know what else to say.
1DI0016581	If you get the paper, head back here in time. There's no rush.
1DI0016582	It takes moxie to admit you've done something wrong. I admire that.
1DI0016583	I'd be glad to sell it back to you. Here you go.
1DI0016585	I'd be glad to sell it back to you, but you don't seem to have enough caps. Come back when you do.
1DI0016599	So far, the experiment is going exactly as planned.
1DI0016600	We're subjecting the residents to extremely low frequency white noise in regular intervals through the loudspeaker system.
1DI0016601	Using the soundproof recording studios and the musicians was an inspired idea. Kudos to the Vault-Tec selection committee on their shrewdness.
1DI0016602	I'm a bit encouraged by the latest batch of data. It seems that 33 percent of the subjects are now lapsing into a trance-like state on occasion.
1DI0016603	When in this state, we're fairly certain that suggestion and programming of the subject can be applied.
1DI0016604	We've begun testing this by implanting subtle cues in affected subjects, making them scratch their ear or constantly fix their hair.
1DI0016605	So far I'm happy to report a 100% success rate on this implantation method.
1DI0016606	Disaster today. One of our test subjects, V920717, has murdered three other residents in a fit of unbridled rage the likes of which I've never seen.
1DI0016607	It took almost 23 shots before the security team took him down. This subject has no history of violence or mental instability whatsoever.
1DI0016608	My concern is that this subject is one of our most successful implant recipients, able to execute complex instructions during trance-state.
1DI0016609	Unbelievable! We've had twelve more incidents in the past month mirroring Subject V920717's actions.
1DI0016610	The shocking part is the savagery these aberrants exhibit when they murder. They rip their victims apart limb from limb and eviscerate them by hand.
1DI0016611	These used to be respected members of the musical community. How could this be happening? Where have I gone wrong?
1DI0016612	The situation is getting out of hand. Over half the population of the Vault is exhibiting savage tendencies.
1DI0016613	I can only assume our noise experimentation has awakened some dormant part of their psyche... brought their primitive nature to the surface.
1DI0016614	In essence, I feel that they are almost psychologically devolving. I was stupid for rushing these experiments, and now over 35 people are dead.
1DI0016615	I can't believe what I've discovered. Just before he died, one of the security team members told me everything.
1DI0016616	The Overseer has been implanting these murderous intentions in the entire Vault population without my knowledge!
1DI0016617	Using the loudspeakers in the dorms instead of just the studios, he subjected everyone to the white noise as they slept.
1DI0016618	He then implanted combat suggestions he claims came from Vault-Tec itself! He... he must be completely insane. No observation, no controls...
1DI0016619	I'm going to have to confront him now and make him pay for what he's done. Half the Vault is dead, the other half fighting for its life.
1DI0016620	Good luck to all of us and may God have mercy on our souls.
1DI0016621	Incredible! I've heard of those items. They were used to make music many many years ago I believe.
1DI0016622	Well, although it has no American historical significance, I can take it off your hands for 200 caps. How does that sound?
1DI0016623	Absolutely! I believe the standing offer was 200 caps.
1DI0016624	Do I look like I play in a fucking orchestra? Why should I care?
1DI0016625	Well, that's wonderful. Here are your caps. Thanks very much!
1DI0016627	Certainly, don't let me stand in your way.
1DI0016630	Yeah? Wonderful. The corns on my feet from standing in this joint all day long are artifacts too.
1DI0016631	Why don't you stop wasting my time and buy something or get out of here.
1DI0016632	One of a kind, huh? I like the sound of that.
1DI0016633	Okay, I'll give you 200 caps for it... and believe me, that's generous.
1DI0016634	One snap of my finger and I could fill you with enough holes to cut your weight in half.
1DI0016635	Testing my temper is not a good idea. Now buy something or get out of here.
1DI0016637	This is the most I ever paid for a hunk of wood and strings, but what the hell.
1DI0016640	Fine. You approached me you know. Thanks for the time Waster.
1DI0016641	Well, it would bring more people in here if I had it on display I suppose.
1DI0016642	All right. You got it. 300 caps.
1DI0016645	She was quite a special woman. Hilda was her name. Classically trained and exceptionally talented at the violin.
1DI0016648	Happily, she accepted. After she entered Vault 92, the bombs fell, and the story as I know it ends.
1DI0016649	Not too much I'm afraid. It was fabricated way back in 1714 by a famous Italian craftsman named Antonio Stradivari.
1DI0016650	He had made a bunch of Stradivarius violins actually, and each one was individually named over time to identify them.
1DI0016651	They are regarded as the most outstanding instruments ever made... and no two sound alike they say. Incredible.
1DI0016652	Since the bombs fell laying waste to most of the world, it may be safe to say that this could be the last surviving violin of its kind.
1DI0016653	Well, from my great-great-grandmother's diaries, I have deduced that she had a special pressurized case created for it.
1DI0016654	Hopefully, the Soil Stradivarius was in the case when she... well, you know.
1DI0016655	I can't really describe it in detail beyond the case. I've never seen it any other way. I'll know it's the real one when I have it in hand.
1DI0016656	You can fool the eyes, but not the ears.
1DI0016657	I hope you're not thinking of doing anything dishonest. You gave me your word.
1DI0016662	Oh my... it's more beautiful than I could have ever imagined!
1DI0016665	I understand. I haven't given up hope... I know you'll find it.
1DI0016666	I... I was afraid this was a possibility. The information I had received was sketchy at best.
1DI0016667	Oh well. Perhaps this is a sign that I wasn't meant to follow in my ancestor's footsteps.
1DI0016668	One day maybe I'll return to playing, or perhaps not. Either way, I thank you for your efforts.
1DI0016669	I'm sorry, I wish I did. All I know is that Vault-Tec intended it to be a protective environment for the world's musical talent.
1DI0016670	When the bombs fell, the Vault was sealed and the rest is a mystery.
1DI0016671	Perhaps when you find it, you can find some sort of a record of what occurred inside.
1DI0016672	From what I gather, it's located in the ruins of D.C. I got the location from one of the supply caravans.
1DI0016673	They told me it had extremely high security and something they called a main frame inside.
1DI0016674	I'd imagine it's quite dangerous. I'd be careful if I was you.
1DI0016675	Okay, go ahead.
1DI0016676	You bet your ass I did! Did you see that Super Mutant's head burst? Beautiful!
1DI0016677	Me and Eugene, we got a partnership. I find targets, and he vaporizes targets. It works out well.
1DI0016678	Anyway, you look me up if you ever want to get into a fight. I'll be sure and bring the thunder. Ha ha ha!
1DI0016679	Well, someone did once, and I swear I let them leave only with a slight limp.
1DI0016680	Don't worry, I'm on your side!
1DI0016682	Last guy who said something like that to me took a long dirt nap. Catch my drift?
1DI0016683	Hahahaha! Oh, I loved watching you sweat there for a second. Damn right I'm crazy! Isn't that right, Eugene?
1DI0016685	Hmmm, and you made it all the way up here alive?
1DI0016686	Ok, I'm impressed. Reilly must have sent the right person for the job... as usual. Hey, is she okay?
1DI0016687	Just you? You made it up here alone?
1DI0016689	Hang on there. First, I need to know if Reilly is okay. I assume she made it somewhere if you're here.
1DI0016691	Sorry, no can do. I used the last of my supplies on us when we got to the roof.
1DI0016692	I can still put a bullet through a Super Mutant skull though!
1DI0016693	Now, what's up with Reilly? She okay?
1DI0016697	Tough guy routine, eh?
1DI0016698	I don't give a shit what you think about us. I just want to get the hell out of here.
1DI0016699	Now, what happened to Reilly? Is she okay?
1DI0016703	That's a relief. I told her she was nuts when she decided to try and sneak out of here. Guess I was wrong. Now, let's talk about getting out of here.
1DI0016704	I would have proposed going back the way you came, but apparently it's impossible now.
1DI0016705	So, the express elevator is our only solution.
1DI0016706	Reilly did. I'm the second in command of the Rangers. Now, can you just answer the question?
1DI0016707	Look, Reilly once told me all we got in this shitty world is each other. I buy into that theory quite a bit.
1DI0016708	We watch each other's backs and that's what keeps us alive.
1DI0016709	If she's dead and you just followed our transmission, I want to know about it!
1DI0016710	Listen. I don't know who you are. I don't even know why Reilly sent you. One thing I do know is that you're beginning to piss me off.
1DI0016711	Now, stopping being an asshole and work with me, will ya?
1DI0016712	Yes, very. Now let's talk about getting the hell off of this roof.
1DI0016715	All right. I'm sorry. We're just... very close. If something's happened to her, I don't know what I'll do.
1DI0016716	Anyway, sorry. Ahem. The only way off of the roof now is using the express elevator.
1DI0016717	You're right. What we need is something to power the elevator motor up here and get the thing going.
1DI0016718	On the way up here, I'm pretty certain we passed a maintenance room. Inside was a wrecked Protectron.
1DI0016719	If you can get me its fission battery, I can have Donovan jury-rig the elevator.
1DI0016720	Well, I can think of a faster way, but I doubt you'd survive the fall.
1DI0016721	You can call anything you like, but the other Rangers will only follow me.
1DI0016722	So, let me know what you want to do, and then I'll decide if we're going to do it.
1DI0016723	All right. We'll hold the roof position here.
1DI0016724	If any of us goes down, don't stop. Get the hell out of here and make for our H.Q., Ranger Compound.
1DI0016725	We have to hold this position at all costs. If... well, if you don't make it back, I can't afford to lose the elevator or we're never getting down.
1DI0016726	I can't allow that to happen. Nothing personal.
1DI0016728	Maybe you can, but we'd still need the fission battery. It's the only way to locally feed power into the elevator's electronics.
1DI0016729	She's our commander. I hope she's still alive. When I saw you come up here, I assumed she'd sent you.
1DI0016730	Well, we can chit-chat about all that later. Right now, can you help us get off this damn roof?
1DI0016731	She didn't send you? Dammit, that means she might be dead.
1DI0016732	Forget it then, we can talk shop later. Can you help us get out of here?
1DI0016733	Well, I got news for you. You're stuck up here like the rest of us. There's no going back the way you came.
1DI0016734	So what'll it be? You going to help us get off this roof or what?
1DI0016735	I know you don't know me from the shit under your boots, but I promise you when we get out of this you'll be paid well for it.
1DI0016736	I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
1DI0016737	Heh heh. Spoken just like a merc.
1DI0016738	You get us off of here, and I guarantee you'll be paid well.
1DI0016739	Now, I'd suggest we go back the way you came, but I think that may be impossible. Our only chance is this express elevator to the lobby level.
1DI0016740	Like it or not, you're stuck up here too. You can't go back.
1DI0016741	So, either you stay here and run out of ammunition like we did, or we all work together and get off this roof.
1DI0016742	Your best bet is to stay with the Metro tunnels. Head north from here to Metro Central. Then look for the tunnels to the Dupont Circle Station.
1DI0016743	Exit from Dupont Circle Station into what we call the Dry Sewers and eventually you'll wind up in Our Lady of Hope Hospital.
1DI0016744	Not much I'm afraid. Oh wait, the hospital may have some supplies that will help you.
1DI0016745	We saw some storerooms on the way to the roof, but didn't have time to raid them.
1DI0016746	I... I don't know what to say. I should never have left them up there. Maybe with one more gun, they could have made it.
1DI0016747	I'm sorry, I think I need to be alone. Could you excuse me?
1DI0016748	Yeah, that stupid gearhead. Sigh. Ah well, at least the others made it.
1DI0016749	I'm sure you're more interested in your reward than listening to me talk, so let me get right to it.
1DI0016750	I was afraid that might happen. I should never have left them up there alone. Now their deaths rest on my shoulders.
1DI0016754	Yeah, Butcher was a good man. Ah well, at least the others made it.
1DI0016758	Yeah, Donovan was a good man. Ah well, at least the others made it.
1DI0016760	I'm very impressed at your skill. I don't think I've come across someone quite like you in the ruins.
1DI0016761	I suppose I owe you a debt, and I intend to pay it in kind.
1DI0016763	Oh, you must be new around here.
1DI0016764	They're a mercenary company that bases itself out of the D.C. Ruins. I'm assuming she's their leader, Reilly.
1DI0016765	What was left of her armor had her name stenciled on it. She was in a pretty bad way when they found her outside Underworld.
1DI0016766	She had multiple lacerations, contusions, broken leg, some internal bleeding and blunt force trauma.
1DI0016767	She's hasn't been conscious since they brought her in a few days ago.
1DI0016768	I'd say she tangled with some Super Mutants and lost. It's a miracle she isn't dead.
1DI0016769	That kind of talk is uncalled for. I was, am and always will be a doctor of medicine.
1DI0016770	I don't care if she was a Super Mutant. I'd still help her.
1DI0016771	If they hauled your sorry, shot-up body into my clinic, I'd try and save you too.
1DI0016772	No problem, just don't disturb the patients.
1DI0016773	She was just brought in by a few others. They found her bleeding to death at the entrance to the city here.
1DI0016774	If she'd been out in the tunnels any longer, she'd have been someone's meal by now.
1DI0016775	Well, I wouldn't recommend it. She's in some sort of coma. It's dangerous to force someone out of one.
1DI0016776	There's no telling when she'll come out of it I'm afraid.
1DI0016777	Unless you're an expert at medicine, I wouldn't recommend it. You may end up doing more harm than good.
1DI0016778	However, I'm all for helping my patients, so if you think you have the ability, be my guest.
1DI0016779	Oh very well. I will do what I can.
1DI0016780	I just hope her body can withstand the strain. Humans are so fragile.
1DI0016781	You haven't heard? I'm the foremost authority on Ghoul evolution. I want to know what makes us tick.
1DI0016782	Something doomed us to this rotting form, and I aim to discover what it is.
1DI0016783	So, I need samples of human skin, organs and other parts to make the experiments valid.
1DI0016784	That's just the attitude I've come to expect from most people.
1DI0016785	It's sadly what sets us apart. I'm not going to dissect you alive or tear out your entrails like in some lurid horror movie.
1DI0016786	All of my experiments are done by the book and scientifically.
1DI0016787	Shame. Then what can I do for you?
1DI0016788	Pity. Well then, what can I do for you?
1DI0016789	My dear friend, yelling "zombie" in Underworld would be like yelling "sand" in a desert. Pointless.
1DI0016790	Obviously, you take no appreciation in what I am trying to achieve. Please, leave me be. I have much to do.
1DI0016791	Certainly, we can help you. Please speak to Doctor Barrows.
1DI0016792	Oh, and we only take caps... no barter.
1DI0016793	Good. Now, hold still. This is going to hurt like hell.
1DI0016794	Bite down, this is going to smart.
1DI0016795	Sigh. Come back when you do!
1DI0016796	Thanks. Now hold still, you don't want me to slip when holding sharp objects.
1DI0016797	Good, good. Now let's see if we can fix you up quickly.
1DI0016798	I'm not a charity worker. Come back when you have the caps, and we'll do business.
1DI0016799	Fine. This will just take a second.
1DI0016800	Shouldn't take but a moment. Hold still please.
1DI0016801	Sigh. Come back when you do.
1DI0016802	Well, I'm not a charity worker. Especially with humans. You want me to fix you up, bring caps next time.
1DI0016803	She's a very lucky young lady not to have suffered damage from her coma.
1DI0016804	She'll be just fine as long as she takes it easy.
1DI0016805	I appreciate your sincerity, but I'm afraid it's just too risky.
1DI0016806	Now, there's no call to be rude.
1DI0016807	I'm just doing my job which is making sure this young lady suffers no more permanent damage.
1DI0016808	Now, if you'll excuse me, I have my work to attend to.
1DI0016809	Very well. This is against my better judgment, but so be it.
1DI0016810	I just hope she has the strength to cope with the system shock.
1DI0016811	Okay, just wanted you to know that I got your back if we ever end up in a firefight again. Anyway, we gotta' split.
1DI0016812	Oh, if you ever make your way to our headquarters, look me up if you need something fixed. I'd be glad to cut you a deal.
1DI0016813	You should. Now that our group is smaller, I'm sure she'll be into adding another Ranger to our ranks.
1DI0016814	Anyway, we gotta' split. Oh, if you ever make your way to our headquarters, look me up if you need something fixed. I'd be glad to cut you a deal.
1DI0016815	That's a nice attitude, man. No need to be a dick.
1DI0016816	Just forget I said anything.
1DI0016818	Whatever floats your boat.
1DI0016821	Like I told you last time, the last one I gave you was it. I am fresh out of them. Sorry.
1DI0016822	I guess that ends our relationship. Thanks for all you've done.
1DI0016823	Well, this is the last one I have. If you lose this, you're shit out of luck.
1DI0016824	Okay, but I only have two left. So try and be more careful.
1DI0016825	That's okay, here's another. Just be careful, they don't grow on trees you know.
1DI0016826	Yeah, but I led the guys right into a corner. Theo died because I decided to take shelter in the hospital.
1DI0016827	I'm not so sure I'd be trusted leading anyone at this point.
1DI0016830	Well a lot of shit happened all because of me.
1DI0016831	We lost Theo because I was stupid enough to retreat into the hospital.
1DI0016832	Thanks. You're sweet to try and make me feel better about everything.
1DI0016833	I just hope that I can get back to mapping the ruins soon. I have a lot of contacts that are demanding I finish.
1DI0016834	Thanks. It's nice of you to try and make me feel better about everything.
1DI0016836	He wasn't careless. I was the one who was careless. Bah, it doesn't matter why... either way, he's gone.
1DI0016840	You'd risk your neck for me like that?
1DI0016841	Yeah. On my own as usual. Sigh.
1DI0016842	Look, why don't you come back later. I don't need pity right now.
1DI0016845	Well... okay. I hadn't expected this, but I'll certainly take you up on it. Oh, and I insist on paying you. I won't take no for an answer.
1DI0016846	For every map marker you uncover in the Capital Wasteland, I'll pay you a fair sum in bottlecaps.
1DI0016847	All you have to do is find them, come back here and I'll get them off your Pip-Boy there.
1DI0016848	Don't worry, I'll compensate you for your time.
1DI0016851	You are such an asshole.
1DI0016852	Here, take this geomapper. Please don't lose it. Donovan spent a year developing it and I only have a few.
1DI0016853	It will offload all of the map data you collect from your Pip-Boy automatically. When you come back, I can take the data from it and you get paid.
1DI0016856	Oh! Okay.
1DI0016857	Guess I'll see you around then.
1DI0016858	Yeah, we've crossed paths. Fortunately, we just stepped out of each others way.
1DI0016859	Brick almost turned it into a damn bloodbath when one of them spit on her boots, but I was able to hold her back.
1DI0016860	Look, those fucks went into a settlement a year or two ago and killed everyone. Women, children... everyone.
1DI0016861	That's the sort of crap Talon Company does. All they care about is getting paid.
1DI0016862	Reilly's Rangers operate on a set of morals. We're here to help people, not as professional assassins.
1DI0016863	If that's your kind of people, then you really need to take a long look at yourself and decide just what the hell is wrong with you.
1DI0016864	Oh wow, Reilly snapped out of her slump now that you're mapping for the Rangers.
1DI0016865	Now we go out and kick ass like the old days. Ooh-rah!
1DI0016866	Not much really. Reilly is taking it easy for a while until she gets back into shape. She looks ready to rock in my opinion, but I'm no doctor.
1DI0016867	I'm kind of itching to get out of here, but she still calls the shots. Something has her spooked.
1DI0016868	Now that you're part of the team, Reilly is her old self again.
1DI0016869	We've been vaporizing hostiles like there's no tomorrow!
1DI0016870	Me and ole' Eugene have been a bit sad lately. No Super Mutants to mow down.
1DI0016871	I guess as soon as Reilly's ready, we can head back out into the ruins. I wish I knew what she was waiting for.
1DI0016872	Things seem better now. Reilly's gained back her confidence a bit. We've been doing stuff here and there.
1DI0016873	I don't know what you said to her, but thanks.
1DI0016874	Frankly, I'm bored to tears. I think the last incident has Reilly a bit on edge.
1DI0016875	She says she wants to wait until she's in top shape, but I think she's fine.
1DI0016876	I don't know what's holding her back.
1DI0016877	Well, I've been feeling a little more confident now that I have you mapping for us.
1DI0016878	I think we'll head out into the ruins and do some search & destroy to ease back into things.
1DI0016879	I don't know. I'm not sure I'm cut out for this kind of job anymore.
1DI0016880	I almost got everyone killed in Vernon Square. What kind of responsible leader does that? It was one bad decision after another.
1DI0016881	Same as last time you asked.
1DI0016883	Excellent! Let me offload the data and I'll be glad to pay you.
1DI0016884	Hmmm. You need to actually collect some new data before I can pay you.
1DI0016885	We already have all these locations in the system.
1DI0016886	Well, without the Geomapper, I can't get the data from your Pip-Boy. Where the heck is it?
1DI0016887	That's funny, you look fine to me. Maybe you should just get some rest.
1DI0016888	Yeah, you look like you need some work.
1DI0016889	All right, hang in there. Let me see what I can do for you.
1DI0016890	Well, let me see what I can do about that.
1DI0016891	I think we can do something about that.
1DI0016892	No problem, lemme have a look.
1DI0016893	Let me give you a word of advice. Stay away from them, they give mercs a bad name.
1DI0016894	They have no morals, no remorse and wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet through a defenseless man's head if it meant a job.
1DI0016895	They've been pretty active lately around the old Capital Building ruins. I'd recommend giving that area a wide berth.
1DI0016896	Good luck. You're going to need it.
1DI0016897	Please don't go. I really need your help.
1DI0016898	Before I left I gave them an order to keep broadcasting for help over their radio.
1DI0016899	Hopefully, when you get near their location, you'll pick it up.
1DI0016900	We lost him on one of the stairwells on the second floor of the Statesman Hotel.
1DI0016901	He almost made it, but one of the Muties hit us with a frag grenade; blew him apart.
1DI0016902	If you can get to his ammo crate, there's a ton of rounds inside. Bring as many as you can to the Rangers.
1DI0016903	Well, we're trying not to get too excited. Not only because we want to keep it quiet, but also because the experiments look so promising.
1DI0016904	For now, just please try and keep what I've told you quiet. No telling what reaction this could have if it got out.
1DI0016905	Not impressed, huh? Oh well. I didn't expect a human to understand the gravity of this experiment anyway.
1DI0016906	Just do me a favor, and don't mention this to anyone. No telling what reaction this could have if it got out.
1DI0016907	Well, I've never been so insulted! I expected a little more from you, but I see you humans are almost all alike!
1DI0016908	Don't worry about Reilly, we'll take care of her. Now, if you'll excuse me.
1DI0016909	Poor girl. I didn't think she'd make it through the first night she was brought in here.
1DI0016910	Doctor Barrows has done everything in his power to keep her alive.
1DI0016911	The doctor is convinced that the key to curing our... appearance is locked within the human body.
1DI0016912	When Reilly was brought in here he saw a chance to put that theory to the test.
1DI0016913	Well, she's very important to Doctor Barrows and she's my patient.
1DI0016914	I don't care if she's human or Ghoul, she gets treated the same here.
1DI0016915	First and foremost on Doctor Barrow's mind is her health and well-being. I can assure you of that.
1DI0016916	So far, none of his conclusions are finalized, but the tests he's running are coming up quite positive!
1DI0016917	Oh... I shouldn't be telling you any of this.
1DI0016920	I don't share the philosophy that Ghouls and humans are different. We were all the same once.
1DI0016921	So why should I treat Reilly any worse than a Ghoul who comes here looking for help?
1DI0016922	Anyway, I must get back to my duties. If you need anything else, please let me know.
1DI0016923	Humans have too many misconceptions. Some of us don't get along with humans, but the majority of us are learning to live with our differences.
1DI0016924	I only wish that the humans in the Capital Wasteland felt the same way. It would make life so much easier...
1DI0016925	Anyway, I am taking too much time speaking with you when I should be working. If you need anything, let me know.
1DI0016926	Well, some of the Ghouls in Underworld object to what the Doctor is doing.
1DI0016927	They think Ghouls are Ghouls and humans are humans. Like we were meant to be this way.
1DI0016928	Some have even threatened the doctor. I'm afraid one day something might happen to him.
1DI0016929	He's trying to come up with a cure. A way to stop the human to Ghoul transition. Perhaps even one day to reverse it!
1DI0016930	Look, I just woke up expecting to see the pearly gates. Can you cut me some slack, or what?
1DI0016931	If time wasn't so precious right now, I wouldn't be so on edge either. I need to get help for the rest of the Rangers, and fast.
1DI0016932	Nice that you pick on bed-ridden people. That how you get your jollies? Does it make you feel tough?
1DI0016933	If you want to hear me out, then shut the hell up. If not, get out of my face.
1DI0016934	I'm sorry. The name's Reilly. Yeah, THE Reilly as in Reilly's Rangers.
1DI0016936	Look, asshole. I don't know who you are, but no one talks to Reilly that way. Yeah, you heard me, THE Reilly of Reilly's Rangers.
1DI0016937	That's not the way I do things.
1DI0016938	Do you have any idea what it would do to my reputation if word got around that Reilly of Reilly's Rangers was laid up in a hospital bed?
1DI0016939	That's okay, kid. Don't sweat it. The Wasteland's a big place.
1DI0016940	We're guns for hire; the best merc group in the Capital Wasteland. If you need something done in there, you seek us out.
1DI0016941	You been stuck living in a vault the last decade or something?
1DI0016943	You're pretty sharp, kid.
1DI0016944	We pack plenty of firepower, but that didn't help us from getting our asses into serious trouble.
1DI0016945	I didn't expect to make it out of there alive.
1DI0016946	Laugh it up, kid. It's easy for you to make fun of me now when I'm in this condition.
1DI0016947	Keep making jokes and I'll show you what it's like to be in a coma.
1DI0016948	We were mapping the Vernon Square part of the downtown ruins and got jumped by a Super Mutant ambush party.
1DI0016949	Usually it isn't a problem, but this group was bigger than usual. We fought our way into Our Lady of Hope Hospital, hoping to find cover.
1DI0016950	Heh, I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
1DI0016951	I don't even know if they're still alive.
1DI0016952	You got a lot of class, kid.
1DI0016953	I feel worse than I look, but that doesn't even matter to me. I'm just worried about the rest of the Rangers.
1DI0016955	No! There is no way my guys are dead!
1DI0016956	If there's even the slimmest chance of surviving, they'll do it.
1DI0016957	If you won't go, stop wasting my fucking time and find me someone who will!
1DI0016958	Are you completely stupid?
1DI0016959	I can barely walk right now, let alone climb a skyscraper. If I could even hold a pistol, I would go get my guys right now!
1DI0016960	I'm using everything I've got just standing here talking to you. Get the point?
1DI0016961	You got it. More of the ugly bastards just kept coming. We fought our way to the roof and found a way across to the Statesman Hotel next door.
1DI0016962	The Super Mutants seemed driven... like they smelled blood. They kept following us.
1DI0016963	Once in the hotel, the only way to go was up.
1DI0016964	I didn't ask you. Those bastards were everywhere. I don't know what was driving them.
1DI0016965	We fought our way to the roof and found a way across to the Statesman Hotel next door.
1DI0016967	Very bad move, but we had no choice.
1DI0016968	On the way we lost Theo, one of my guys. We were unable to get the ammo case off of his body as we were pushed onwards.
1DI0016969	So, guns almost dry, we hit the roof of the Statesman.
1DI0016970	Look, I don't know what your problem is, but I got three guys alone out there with an army of Super Mutants around them.
1DI0016971	Either help me by listening, or get the hell out of my sight. I'm not here to be judged by you or anyone else.
1DI0016972	Now, like I was saying, we had to fight our way up towards the roof of the Statesman.
1DI0016973	Last stand? Well, we hoped not. We figured we'd get up there and get a better signal to radio the Brotherhood of Steel for help.
1DI0016974	Problem is, help never arrived. Vernon Square is so thick with the Super Mutants, I don't think they could slip through.
1DI0016975	Fine. Since you're all business and obviously don't give a damn about human life, I got a proposal for you.
1DI0016976	You want to hear it, or you gonna keep flapping your lips?
1DI0016977	My bad idea I'm afraid. I had a Stealth Boy which allowed me to slip off the roof unnoticed. The plan was to get back to get some help.
1DI0016978	I was almost at the street when a Super Mutant jumped me. Damn near ripped my arm off in the process.
1DI0016979	Last thing I remember was falling into a culvert. Now I'm here. Some rescue attempt, huh?
1DI0016980	Actually, we did lay down a bunch of countermeasures. I don't know how many of them have already gone off though.
1DI0016981	When I slipped out with my Stealth Boy, I think I almost tripped one or two of them.
1DI0016982	Damn near didn't make it out of there at all, come to think of it.
1DI0016983	Look, I don't know where else to go. In the shape I'm in, I'll be lucky to get ten feet.
1DI0016984	I'll sweeten the deal for you, maybe it'll help. How about I set you up with a suit of Ranger Armor if you get them back?
1DI0016985	If that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
1DI0016986	Spoken like a merc. You sound like me when I was just a kid starting out in the business.
1DI0016987	Okay hotshot, how about a full suit of Ranger Armor? It's the best combat armor in the Wasteland.
1DI0016988	Or if that doesn't do it for you I'll set you up with a minigun from our armory. Either way, you walk away with something.
1DI0016989	Wow. You really are an asshole. Fine. I hope their deaths sit well on your conscience.
1DI0016990	They are?! Holy shit!
1DI0016991	Look, either I need to get out there and lend them a hand or they aren't going to last much longer.
1DI0016996	I dunno why you bothered to come here and wake me then. I would have been better off sleeping through it.
1DI0016997	You're a cocky little thing, aren't you? I like that.
1DI0016998	Well, as much as I want to hear all about it, can you tell me a full debrief on what happened out there with my men?
1DI0016999	I bet it was. Frankly, I'm amazed you made it.
1DI0017000	Can you give me a full debriefing on what happened out there with my men?
1DI0017001	All right, all right. No need to get your underpants in a knot.
1DI0017003	Losing a bit of the merc edge, eh? Don't get soft on me now!
1DI0017004	Well, I've said it once but I'll say it again. You have my thanks. I'd be pretty lost without my guys.
1DI0017005	So, for your reward, what'll it be? The Ranger Battlearmor or one of Brick's Miniguns?
1DI0017006	Okay, but at least let me thank you for all you've done. You could have been killed trying to save my men.
1DI0017008	Now you sound like a merc! Well, let's cut the bullshit and get right to it then.
1DI0017010	Reward? If you had some sort of a deal going with Butcher, then that was between you and him.
1DI0017011	I'm guessing the deal was get them off that roof. They're all dead, so I don't see that as a success.
1DI0017012	I'm sorry. Now, please... leave me be.
1DI0017013	Reward? The deal was get my men off that roof. They're all dead, so I don't see that as a success.
1DI0017014	I don't know how you normally deal with mercs, but we stick to our deals. You couldn't hold up your end of it, so there's no reward.
1DI0017016	Are you out of your fucking mind? Reward? If you had some sort of a deal going with Butcher, then that was between you and him.
1DI0017018	Now get the hell out of my sight!
1DI0017019	Are you out of your fucking mind?
1DI0017020	We had a deal... you get my men back, I give you payment. No men, no armor. That's it. There's no middle ground.
1DI0017022	Wow. You sound like one of the guys from Talon Company. Ruthless bastard, aren't you?
1DI0017023	You can act badass all day, doesn't phase me. You're chicken shit compared to some of the guys I've dealt with.
1DI0017024	To answer your question, yeah, I got your damn reward. Now, how about that debrief?
1DI0017025	No way, pal. No fucking way.
1DI0017026	I do things by the book. My book. It may seem stupid to you, but it's all we got. So when I ask for a debrief, I want a goddamn debrief!
1DI0017027	So you're that eager to jump in headfirst, eh? You remind me a lot of some crazy mercs I knew back in the day.
1DI0017028	They're all dead now because they were stupid, but suit yourself.
1DI0017029	My team is trapped on the roof of the Statesman Hotel in Vernon Square and completely surrounded by Super Mutants.
1DI0017030	Their ammo is almost gone, and I have no idea how much longer they have to live.
1DI0017032	It takes a big man to apologize... I respect that.
1DI0017035	Wow, you're really an asshole... you know that?
1DI0017036	Get the Rangers home. Please. That's all I want. I don't care how you do it.
1DI0017037	What's to think about? Sigh.
1DI0017038	My guys don't have the luxury of time. If you're going to decide, decide soon. Otherwise I'm offering elsewhere.
1DI0017039	Whew, I was holding my breath on that one I think. I wasn't sure what you were going to say.
1DI0017040	All I ask is that you hurry. I don't know how much longer they will be able to survive up there.
1DI0017041	I also recommend you try and find the body of Theo, one of my men. He was carrying our main ammo supply.
1DI0017042	Here, let me punch the ammo box code and some better directions into your Pip-Boy there.
1DI0017043	The armor it is. Wear it with pride, kid. We do.
1DI0017044	Consider this place your home away from home. If you're ever in the neighborhood again, you're more than welcome to take shelter here.
1DI0017045	I guess that does it. See you 'round, kid.
1DI0017046	You got it. Use it well, and take down some more Muties with it for us.
1DI0017049	Sorry, we need every piece of equipment we've got. I can spare the gun and the armor, but that's about it.
1DI0017050	Right... can't remember what I was doing.
1DI0017051	Wait! Oh shit!
1DI0017052	My men... my team! What happened to them?
1DI0017053	Well, I don't know actually. Kind of confused.
1DI0017056	Huh? What the hell are you talking about? That isn't very funny.
1DI0017057	If my guys were here, they'd kick your...
1DI0017058	Oh shit! My team! What the hell happened?
1DI0017059	They will run out of time soon. Then they bleed.
1DI0017060	Rangers will pay for all those they kill!
1DI0017061	Don't take prisoners! Kill them all!
1DI0017062	None of them will leave here alive.
1DI0017063	One of them get by us... make it all the way to melted human town.
1DI0017064	They have guns... but we have guns too. Soon we can take roof.
1DI0017065	They very powerful. Kill many of us.
1DI0017066	Well, if you've picked the Mutie corpses clean, there isn't much else to scrounge.
1DI0017067	I dunno if you came across it or not, but one of our guys dropped on the second floor stairwell. He had an ammo crate with him.
1DI0017068	Gonna have to get the code from Butcher though.
1DI0017069	On our way to the roof, one of our guys got scragged. Poor son-of-a-bitch get blown apart by a frag.
1DI0017070	I think he went down on the second floor stairwell of this place. You find him, and you'll find his ammo crate.
1DI0017071	Ask Butcher for the code though. We lock that stuff so the Muties can't steal what's inside.
1DI0017072	We lost a good man on the retreat to this godforsaken roof. Theo. Newest guy in the group too.
1DI0017073	He got killed on the second floor stairwell of the hotel. He was carrying our ammo supply with him.
1DI0017074	Here, let me give you the code. The more ammo we have the better!
1DI0017075	We have a headquarters not far from here.
1DI0017076	If you can make it there, you are welcome to anything you need inside. Just punch in Reilly0247 at the gate.
1DI0017077	We have ammo, supplies, you name it.
1DI0017078	Yeah, here you go. It's all I've got.
1DI0017079	Sorry. I only had one Stimpak to spare. Hang in there.
1DI0017080	Injuries? You look fine to me.
1DI0017081	Well, we were on a contract to map the Vernon Square area of the D.C. Ruins. That's what we do, you see... usually it's routine.
1DI0017082	What we didn't expect was to get jumped by dozens of those damn Super Mutants. They came out of the woodwork.
1DI0017083	We had to retreat into the hospital next door and fight our way to the roof like you did. It was the only direction we could manage.
1DI0017084	Long story short, we got stuck on the roof with no supplies and Reilly went for help. That's the last we heard from her.
1DI0017085	If I wasn't asking for your help, I'd tell you to stay away. It's thick with Super Mutants. I don't know why.
1DI0017086	Butcher, our team medic, has always suspected something is in the area they are looking for or being attracted to.
1DI0017087	The only place worse I can think of is the Mall.
1DI0017088	Oh my, that's a dangerous part of the D.C. Ruins.
1DI0017089	Every patrol Underworld has sent even near that zone has come back in bad shape, or hasn't returned at all.
1DI0017090	All I can tell you is this place sucks. I hope we never have to map another inch of it.
1DI0017091	There's something about this area. I can't put my finger on it, but just like the Mall, there is an unusually high concentration of Super Mutants.
1DI0017092	If I had the time and resources, I'd investigate. All I care about now is getting the hell off this damn roof.
1DI0017093	The other guys hate mappin' this zone, but hey, I love it. I love turning the 'muties into a fine, red mist with my gun.
1DI0017094	It would be dangerous for me to prematurely awaken her.
1DI0017095	The sudden shock to her system could provoke any number of complications.
1DI0017096	Great. Now get it hooked up to the elevator so we can get out of here.
1DI0017097	Fantastic! Get that over to Donovan right away.
1DI0017098	As soon as he gets it up and running make a break for it.
1DI0017099	Remember our rally point is our H.Q., Ranger Compound. Don't stop for anything!
1DI0017100	Let me have that thing. Give me a few minutes, and I'll have the elevator up and running.
1DI0017101	As soon as I get it online, we'll get out of here.
1DI0017102	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Get it plugged into the elevator!
1DI0017103	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Give to to Donovan. Sheesh.
1DI0017104	Oh, HELL yeah!
1DI0017105	Hey, kid. This bad boy spits out lead like there's no tomorrow. So unless you have at least 150 rounds, I can't even fill it up.
1DI0017106	Whew. That makes me feel a whole lot better. Thanks.
1DI0017107	Look, unless you have at least 50 shots of 10mm on you, I may as well go with my pistol.
1DI0017108	Thanks. I was starting to feel a little naked without it.
1DI0017109	Wonderful. What the hell am I going to do with less than 50 shots? That barely fills this puppy up. Come on, kid.
1DI0017112	Eventually the fight spilled into the Statesman Hotel and we ran all the way to the roof.
1DI0017113	I left my guys up there and tried to stealth out but got caught by a Mutie ambush patrol. That was the last thing I remember.
1DI0017114	I'd say it was a whole lot of luck. We set as many traps as we could behind us and killed as many Super Mutants as possible.
1DI0017115	Being able to fend off the last wave of them made the rest more cautious, but it also drained our ammo.
1DI0017116	It's only a matter of time before they rally, especially since you punched through their lines.
1DI0017117	Skill baby, pure skill. And my big-ass gun!
1DI0017118	By the seat of our pants. We are out of everything. Ammo, food and time.
1DI0017119	I have no idea how we've made it this long, but damn I am glad you got up here.
1DI0017120	There's five of us... oh wait, four now. I almost forgot about Theo. Poor bastard.
1DI0017121	Besides myself of course, we have Brick, our heavy weapons specialist, Butcher, our medic and Donovan, our tech.
1DI0017122	All of them have been with me for years. I'd trust any of them with my life.
1DI0017123	They're a mercenary group. I've seen them pass through Underworld a few times.
1DI0017124	I'm not sure what their mission entails, but I suspect that it involves violence.
1DI0017125	The Rangers have a small headquarters not far from here. Let me program the location into your Pip-Boy.
1DI0017126	We're mercs, but instead of hunt and destroy we map the ruins for sale to the highest bidder... and make a good living at it, too.
1DI0017127	There were five of us in the company until we lost Theo.
1DI0017128	Hmmmm. Not really. All I remember is passing that maintenance office on the third floor.
1DI0017129	Sorry, we were under fire the whole time. Otherwise, I would have cleaned the place out.
1DI0017130	When we passed the maintenance room, I spied a deactivated Protectron inside. Just wrench open its access panel and you'll find it.
1DI0017131	All I remember is mowing down Super Mutants with Eugene here.
1DI0017132	Ask the eggheads, they're runnin' the show. I just point and shoot... then stuff dies.
1DI0017133	Yeah, let's check it out.
1DI0017134	Yeah, I did.
1DI0017135	Hell yeah! Let's find 'em!
1DI0017136	If there is, they're dead meat.
1DI0017137	Greetings fellow office employee.  Please present your valid ID.
1DI0017138	Scanning for office ID... ID accepted.  Have a nice day.
1DI0017139	Warning! Scan failure. Please present ID or exit the building.
1DI0017140	Intruder Alert! Prepare to be forcibly removed.
1DI0017141	Loading Personality: RobCo R04 V9 "Office Helper"...
1DI0017142	Running default office protocol...ERROR.  Loading daily agenda...ERROR.
1DI0017143	Security breach detected.  Please stand back.
1DI0017144	Please ignore the disturbance and go about your regular work routines.
1DI0017145	Why not use this time to enjoy a brief caffeinated beverage break?
1DI0017146	Please vacate the area in an orderly fashion.  Work will resume in 3.756 minutes.
1DI0017147	Sorry for the ruckus. Please vacate the immediate area.
1DI0017148	The deal is this: you are now in the employ of Littlehorn and Associates. We deal in all many of affairs, most of which are not your concern.
1DI0017149	Your duties are as follows: you will bring me the ears of the good people of the world. And in turn, I will give you the wealth you crave.
1DI0017150	The more you bring, the wealthier you will be and the happier I will be with you. That's not so hard now, is it?
1DI0017151	Good, good. Direct. To the point. I like that in an employee. Then you understand what your purpose is.
1DI0017152	The ears of the good of the world is all I ask and currency is what you will receive.
1DI0017153	And now that we understand one another, what is your business here?
1DI0017154	Oh, how we do love enthusiasm in our employees. The deal is quite simple, as you know.
1DI0017155	The more ears you deliver to me, the greater your coffers will grow, and the more pleased we will be with your work.
1DI0017156	Now, what would you ask of us?
1DI0017157	This is the current home office of Littlehorn and Associates. This is where we operate our little business.
1DI0017158	We dabble in this, and that. I'm sure you've seen our work around the Wasteland and haven't even realized it.
1DI0017159	We prefer to operate quietly, which is why we employ individuals such as yourself.
1DI0017160	Now, that's the sort of question which will endanger our relationship.
1DI0017161	You are providing a service and we are providing payment. It is there our questions end. Understand?
1DI0017162	They are fellow associates such as yourself. They simply possess a different set of skills than you.
1DI0017163	I am Daniel Littlehorn. I offer you the currency that you crave in exchange for services aligned to your skills.
1DI0017164	And that, friend, is what we are to each other.
1DI0017165	I've been doing this a very long time, and I find that the less we know about each other, the smoother our relationship will be.
1DI0017166	I would scold you for wasting our time, but I enjoy a practical joke.
1DI0017167	Just don't do it again.
1DI0017168	And here out hopes were up. Shame on you.
1DI0017169	Most excellent. And you have exemplified yourself in the eyes of Littlehorn and Associates.
1DI0017170	One with a heart as black as yours deserves to be rewarded for it. We shall include a bonus in your pay this time.
1DI0017171	Enjoy it. Might I recommend booze? Or gambling? Or perhaps a nice chem habit?
1DI0017172	Before our exchange, I should tell you: word has reached my ears of your black deeds in the Wastes.
1DI0017173	Acts such as yours fall in line with the goals of Littlehorn and Associates. And we believe you deserve a bonus for going that extra mile.
1DI0017174	Enjoy it. But by all means, do not let it stop you from walking the path that you're on.
1DI0017175	Most excellent. We love a good and loyal employee.
1DI0017176	And, as a good and loyal employee, here is your reward.
1DI0017177	We here at Littlehorn and Associates cannot express our gratitude that your loyalty and service inspires.
1DI0017178	Here is your payment per our contract. Spend it... well.
1DI0017179	You'll be back. They always come back.
1DI0017180	Fair enough. We'll still take the help where we can get it.
1DI0017181	So, the deal is this: there are a lot of evil assholes out there. Take 'em down, bring us their fingers as proof and we'll pay you for each.
1DI0017182	We'll be watching you until we know you can be trusted, so don't try anything stupid.
1DI0017183	We live to cleanse the Wasteland of the scum and evil that pollute it. We're the only thing that represents any sort of law out here.
1DI0017184	We hunt down the worst criminals imaginable and deliver the only justice we have: a bullet.
1DI0017185	So, what do you say?
1DI0017186	Fantastic. Well, take this coat. We all wear them. The unrighteous fear the sight of the Regulators.
1DI0017187	Now, as for the rest, here's the only thing we want from you: hunt down the evil, the wicked, and the villainous. Bring them to justice.
1DI0017188	Bring us their fingers as proof of the deed. We'll pay you a bounty for each one. Simple, right? Questions?
1DI0017192	Fantastic. Take this coat. We all wear them. The unrighteous fear the sight of the Regulators.
1DI0017195	We're the Regulators. We've dedicated our lives to bringing the evil to justice.
1DI0017196	And out in the Wasteland, there's only one brand of justice: the gun.
1DI0017197	Nothing. Nothing at all. They only serve to mark the fact that justice has been done.
1DI0017198	While we trust our members not to take innocent lives for profit, having a record of the deed is sometimes necessary.
1DI0017199	While we don't have liars in our midst, occasionally we all.. embellish a bit.
1DI0017200	Oh, no. We're spread all around. The few here just assist me in organizing things here at the headquarters.
1DI0017201	There are Regulators everywhere. The thing is, if you see them, then they're likely the last thing that you'll see.
1DI0017202	If this is a joke, I am not amused. Justice is serious business.
1DI0017203	Make your jokes when the Wastes are rid of the filth that feed off of it.
1DI0017204	You've done good work. Not only that, but the other Regulators have told me of your other actions in your travels.
1DI0017205	Good deeds should not go unrewarded, and so I will add on a bonus to your normal bounty.
1DI0017206	So many of the unjust have been dispatched, but so many remain. But ever still, word reaches me that you have gone far beyond what we've asked.
1DI0017208	So many of the unjust have been dispatched, but so many remain. Here is your reward. Spend it well.
1DI0017209	Your work is impressive. Here is your reward. Don't retire just yet, there is far more to be done.
1DI0017210	I can't imagine why you'd want to, but the choice is yours.
1DI0017211	I'm watching the patrols, what do you think I'm looking at?
1DI0017212	They switch it up a little bit every day, but just a little. There has to be some sort of pattern to it, it's just a matter of watching and waiting.
1DI0017213	What? You'll have to speak up!
1DI0017214	I don't know where the clinic is, they don't let us out of the pens, you know?
1DI0017215	Oh? Him? No, I have no idea where he is.
1DI0017216	Oh, I don't know. I don't wear a watch, they're pretty rare you know. Ask someone else.
1DI0017217	I still can't hear you!
1DI0017218	I'm ain't mean. Not by a long shot.
1DI0017219	You wanna see mean? You should've met my daddy. That son of a bitch'd cut your legs off just to laugh at you tryin' to crawl away.
1DI0017220	I saw him do it once too. Jus' kept laughin' at this poor bastard. After an hour or so, Daddy got bored and crushed his skull with a rock.
1DI0017221	Come to think of it... that was pretty funny...
1DI0017222	Yeah, I got some stuff around here. But it'll cost you.
1DI0017223	Hey, it's your body, do what you want to it.
1DI0017224	If you're planning on overdosing, just make sure you pay me first.
1DI0017225	Trade up front. No exceptions. Especially not for junkies.
1DI0017226	That's good to hear, since I want to take your caps.
1DI0017227	I've got supplies, if you've got caps.
1DI0017228	Money first, then you'll get the goods.
1DI0017229	Alright, I've had enough. Let's do something else.
1DI0017230	I'm heading to the deck. I need some air. Ladies, follow me.
1DI0017231	Let's go up top. I want to see what these fools are up to.
1DI0017232	We need to keep an eye on this. Too much drinking, and the merchandise is gonna walk itself out the front door.
1DI0017233	Let's leave our employees to their recreation. There's a business to run.
1DI0017234	Ladies, to the bar.
1DI0017235	Let's see what's going on over at the bar.
1DI0017236	This is a sad crop. Our boys need to stop drinking and start bringing me some better stock.
1DI0017237	Goddamn. This is some sorry lookin' merchandise. We got to get us some new stock.
1DI0017238	Well, they haven't killed each other yet. Always a plus.
1DI0017239	Time to check on the merchandise.
1DI0017240	Let's go see how business looks today.
1DI0017241	C'mon. Time to check on the stock.
1DI0017242	This place needs to be tidied up. Creates a bad impression for the customers.
1DI0017243	Nothing going on here. Let's go.
1DI0017244	Let's go, ladies. Keep up.
1DI0017245	I'm headed over to the block to see what's going on.
1DI0017246	Where's Cutter at? I need to talk to her.
1DI0017247	I need to see our good doctor.
1DI0017248	Now, I gotta go see Forty.
1DI0017249	Anyone seen Forty? He wanted to talk to me.
1DI0017250	Time to check in with Pronto.
1DI0017251	Pronto said he wanted to talk to me about something. Keep up, ladies.
1DI0017252	This is last time I tell you! No more!
1DI0017253	Please! No! I didn't! I swear!
1DI0017254	This is your last mistake, little bartender!
1DI0017255	FATHER! NO!
1DI0017256	Are you kidding me? You've never heard of Paradise Falls? Oh, right. The suit. You're right out of the vault, aren't you? Great.
1DI0017257	Shit, you're lucky you're not up there in the pens, dumbass. I can't believe you. Anyway, Paradise Falls is home to the Slavers.
1DI0017258	Up there, we sell the slaves that we capture out in the Wastes. So, unless you're either buying or selling, piss off.
1DI0017259	Are you kidding me? You've never heard of Paradise Falls? What, are you right out of the vault? Paradise Falls is home to the Slavers.
1DI0017261	Yeah, well, you don't like it? Keep walking. It's that simple.
1DI0017262	You got something else to say, or did you just come here to preach at me?
1DI0017263	Like what? Don't be wasting my time out here, or I'll throw you in the pens with the rest of the meat.
1DI0017264	Yeah, don't let any bullets hit you in the ass on your way out.
1DI0017265	Then bring it on, reverend!
1DI0017266	Yep. And if you're not tough enough to survive, at least you can be useful to those of us who are.
1DI0017267	You? I don't think so. You're not really... let's just say that you wouldn't fit in up there.
1DI0017268	So why don't you just turn around and head back the way you came?
1DI0017269	Well... no. I don't think so.
1DI0017270	Good choice. Now piss off and stop wasting my time.
1DI0017271	I keep my father safe.
1DI0017272	It is... a big job.
1DI0017273	Yes. Jotun.
1DI0017274	No. It isn't. What do you want?
1DI0017275	Don't care what you think. What do you want?
1DI0017276	No. It is not nice. What do you want?
1DI0017277	I did, indeed, and she was well worth the effort! I found her a nice, loving home right away.
1DI0017278	It's so nice to be able to help people who need people, isn't it? It just warms the heart.
1DI0017279	But speaking of life's little rewards, here's yours. It doesn't look like much, but this helmet's reinforced like crazy. You'll find a use for it.
1DI0017280	Sure, I've thought about it. Kids can get a killer price, when you find a buyer who recognizes the product's long-term potential.
1DI0017281	The real problem's holding them until there's a buyer. Kids are sneaky, and those Lamplighters are tenacious little bastards.
1DI0017282	But maybe if we could get one when they're young, they might not have as much fight in 'em yet.
1DI0017283	Sure, if you think you can pull it off. I think I might know a buyer who'd be interested.
1DI0017284	I'll send one of my best to wait around the entrance to Lamplight. You go in and find the sweetest, most trusting little one you can find.
1DI0017285	Lure that kid outside, and everyone's happy. Except the kid, of course.
1DI0017286	You're right on that one. There's plenty of other merchandise out there, and it's a seller's market.
1DI0017287	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
1DI0017288	Sure thing, hoss. If you see anything you want, let me know.
1DI0017289	Sure, man. Take a look. The boys bring me all sorts of shit.
1DI0017290	No problem, man. Take a look at this stuff. It all works... mostly.
1DI0017291	I tell you, for a bunch of dumbass wasters, the boys pull some good stuff off of the new meat.
1DI0017292	Keep your voice down, old man. Listen, if you're not part of the solution, then you're part of the problem. Help or shut up.
1DI0017293	You you shut up before they hear you? Listen, I don't judge you, if you want to stay here, fine. Whatever. Just stay out of my way.
1DI0017294	You're not just getting yourself in trouble here, girl. You need to relax. Work with 'em. It ain't so bad once you adjust. I've been here for almost-
1DI0017295	I've been alive far too long to let some crazy plan get my head blown off. It ain't a bad life, you know. One you get used to it.
1DI0017296	I don't care, Breadbox. I'm getting out of here. Stay if you want, just keep out of my way, or I'll assume that you're with them.
1DI0017297	It doesn't matter. I'm not giving myself the chance to get used to anything -- I'm leaving. And you'd best stay the hell out of my way.
1DI0017298	Fine, fine. But when you get your head popped, don't say that I didn't warn you.
1DI0017299	Fine, girl, that's fine. Just keep the rest of us out of it. And don't stand near me when they finally do pop your collar.
1DI0017300	You got the right one this time? Are you serious? Here, let me see. Hand it to me.
1DI0017301	Really? You did? Bronson I could kiss you! Here, hand it to me. Slowly.
1DI0017302	Here you go, Bleak. Just like you asked.
1DI0017303	Okay, real slow... here. It's yours. Did I... did I do good?
1DI0017304	What the-? Dammit Bronson! This isn't what I asked for! I needed one of the detonators not... whatever this is!
1DI0017305	Bronson! What is this? I didn't ask for this! You were supposed to get me one of the detonators! I don't even know what this is!
1DI0017306	Oh... I'm sorry, Bleak. I thought that's what you wanted...
1DI0017307	That isn't... you mean... awww shit. I'm sorry...
1DI0017308	How many times have we gone over this, Bronson? Can't you stay sober enough to do one little thing?
1DI0017309	I'm starting to feel like I can't trust your drunk ass, Bronson. How many times is it that you've screwed up?
1DI0017310	I know... just give me another chance... I... I can do it.
1DI0017311	I'm... I'm so sorry, Bleak. Just one more chance... I won't... I won't let you down again...
1DI0017312	I suppose I can do that. Just don't let me down again, Bronson. I need your help.
1DI0017313	Okay, Bronson. One more.
1DI0017314	Whatever you're up to, girl, I want nothing to do with it. I'm too old to be involved in these crazy escape plans of yours.
1DI0017315	I don't even want to hear about it. I'm fine right where I am, thank you very much. Keep your plans to yourself.
1DI0017316	Are you serious? You want to die here? In this place? An old good for nothing slave? I mean come on, there so much more to...
1DI0017317	Come on, Breadbox. Do you want to die of old age in a slave pen? Really? Wouldn't you rather...
1DI0017318	I'm fine right where I am, Bleak. There's more to this life than always fighting to change things. Sometimes, there is greater peace in acceptance.
1DI0017319	Enough! I've made my decision. I'd rather live my life out here as happily as I can than die on some damn fool escape. Now, leave me alone.
1DI0017320	All right, all right. You know where to find me if you change your mind.
1DI0017321	Okay, Breadbox. But if you ever do change your mind, I'd love to help you.
1DI0017322	I don't need help, Bleak. But thank you.
1DI0017323	I wouldn't hold your breath, girl. I'm quite content.
1DI0017324	Now that's an odd question. Why would you want to know about that?
1DI0017325	Where did I get my name? Why do you care about that, Bronson?
1DI0017326	I don't know... I'm just... you know... "Breadbox". It's a weird name is all. There's got to be a good story...
1DI0017327	I just... I just figure with a name like Breadbox... there- <hiccup>... there must be a good story.
1DI0017328	Well, you know how they like to mess with you? They used to mess with me too. "See what fits inside a breadbox". It's something I'd rather forget.
1DI0017329	Well, you know how these Slavers have a mean streak, especially to new slaves? Well, they used to play a game that I'd rather not think about.
1DI0017330	Woa, man. Say no more... I've... I've heard enough.
1DI0017331	Huh? What... oh! Yeah! Anything for you, B.. Bleak. What do you need?
1DI0017332	Sure... sure thing, Bleak... what do you need?
1DI0017333	That deal we made, we're still square, right? You know what you need to do?
1DI0017334	You remember what I asked you before? The deal we had? Can you do it soon? I'm worried that we're running out of time.
1DI0017335	Oh, no problem... no problem at all... you can count on me, Miss Bleak! Yessir!
1DI0017336	Oh yeah... no doubt. I... I... it'll get done!
1DI0017337	Good, Bronson. Don't let me down.
1DI0017338	Alright, Bronson. No screw ups this time, got it?
1DI0017339	What? I'm... I'm fine. It ain't nothin'... I mean... what else am I supposed to do? Work? Fuck these guys... I'd rather drink...
1DI0017340	Pshh... drinkin's the only... the only way I ain't... killed myself yet. I don't know if you noticed... but we're sort of... you know... slaves.
1DI0017341	It's hard here, boy, trust me. I been a slave for thirty years. But you need to find your peace inside yourself, not at the bottom of a bottle.
1DI0017342	I'll never claim that it's easy living this life, but drinking is just going to put you in your grave faster than slavery will. That's no way to go.
1DI0017343	Hey... if it kills me... all the better. I'd rather drink myself to death than... let them kill me first.
1DI0017344	Oh, what do you know? Just cause... cause... cause you found peace or whatever, don't make it easier for the rest of us!
1DI0017345	I'm sorry that you think that way. I hope that one day, you come around. I'm here to help you if that happens.
1DI0017346	I worry about you, son. Just think about what I said.
1DI0017347	Oh, good. I always love questions from my favorite smelly barman.
1DI0017348	Is this where you start drunkenly hitting on me? Because it's a little bit early in the day for that, Ymir.
1DI0017349	I am always friendly and yet, you are always... well... kind of a bitch?
1DI0017350	Why are you always so mean? All I ever am is nice to you, but it's always "Ymir go away, you smell" or "Ymir, get me a drink and then go away".
1DI0017351	Well... if I had to guess why that was, I guess it would be because you smell, you're drunk all the fucking time, and I don't like you very much.
1DI0017352	Ymir, let's be honest -- I'd sooner die than let you anywhere near my bunk. But feel free to send that boy of yours any time.
1DI0017353	Ah, Red! this is why I like you! Always making jokes! You want a drink?
1DI0017354	See? This is what I mean. But you know what they say about mean women? Sooner or later, someone will accidentally shoot them while on a mission.
1DI0017355	Honey, I'll take anything you feel like paying for.
1DI0017356	Only if you're buying it, big guy.
1DI0017357	Were they talking about how bad you look again? I mean, I hate to break it to you: they're right.
1DI0017358	You mean about how Mr. Eulogy don't like you no more? About how he barely even looks at you when I'm around?
1DI0017359	Why do you have to be like that? I'm just trying to talk to you and you have to come at me with that shit?
1DI0017360	Wha... bitch, you're lucky Eulogy protects your ass, or I'd leave you bleeding in the street.
1DI0017361	Pfft. You're just mad because I'm daddy's favorite.
1DI0017362	I just know who Mr. Eulogy likes better, and as soon as you figure it out too, we'll all be happier.
1DI0017363	Eulogy cares about one thing: Eulogy. That's it. And the sooner your dumb ass realizes that, the better off we'll all be.
1DI0017364	Someday, you're going to realize that Eulogy don't give a shit about either of us.
1DI0017365	Dammit, I should have known better than to try and talk sense to you.
1DI0017366	I can't even talk to you. Get out of my face.
1DI0017367	Right away, daddy. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
1DI0017368	Yes, daddy? I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! What do you need?
1DI0017369	Haven't I always said that I hate to wait? Why you always have to make me wait? What's wrong with you?
1DI0017370	Damn right, you're sorry. When I say something, you better listen! Hell, you should know what I want before I even open my mouth!
1DI0017371	Please forgive me, daddy. It won't happen again, just tell me what you need. Anything! I'll do anything!
1DI0017372	I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Let me make it up to you! Tell me what you want!
1DI0017373	Well now I forgot what I wanted because I was too busy yelling at you. See what you've done?
1DI0017374	I want... damn. See what you made me do? I forgot!
1DI0017375	Yeah, he don't look like much, though. Skin's all pasty, like he grew up in a Vault or something.
1DI0017376	Yeah, I've seen him. What about it?
1DI0017377	Yeah, she don't look like much, though. Skin's all pasty, like she grew up in a Vault or something.
1DI0017378	Yeah, I've seen her. What about it?
1DI0017379	You should go talk to him, maybe he'll buy you off of Mr. Eulogy since daddy's gotten tired of you.
1DI0017380	I was just thinking that you might want to go introduce yourself, in case Mr. Eulogy finally wants to sell you off.
1DI0017381	You should go talk to her, maybe she'll buy you off of Mr. Eulogy since daddy's gotten tired of you.
1DI0017383	Why do you always have to try to prove something to me? Do you think I care who Eulogy likes better? Seriously?
1DI0017384	Clover, I will smack the shit out of you. Can't you just shut up and leave me alone?
1DI0017385	Keep running your mouth, Crimson. That's why he don't like you no more.
1DI0017386	Hrmph. It's not my fault that I'm the favorite. You don't need to be so bitter.
1DI0017387	I'm right here, Eulogy. There's no need to yell.
1DI0017388	Why do you have to yell all the time, Eulogy? I'm standing right here.
1DI0017389	What have I said about backtalk, Crimson? Hmm? What have I said?
1DI0017390	Are you talking back to me? Because the only thing I hate more than having to repeat myself is being talked back to.
1DI0017391	<sigh> I'm sorry.
1DI0017392	<grumble> Sorry, Eulogy.
1DI0017393	What? Sorry? Try that again.
1DI0017394	I'm sorry, what was that?
1DI0017395	I'm sorry... Mr. Eulogy.
1DI0017396	I'm sorry, Sir.
1DI0017397	There's a good girl.
1DI0017398	That's better.
1DI0017399	Our relationship is strictly business, Eulogy. You know that.
1DI0017400	Good day, Eulogy. And need I remind you that I'm old enough to be your mother. Ours is a business relationship only.
1DI0017401	Awww, there's no need to be like that, Cutter. You know I'm only joking. But speaking of business... You have my money?
1DI0017402	That's right, it is just business. So where's my money?
1DI0017403	Here you go, Eulogy. The usual cut. Count it if you'd like.
1DI0017404	Here's your cut. It's small. Maybe convince your boys to get hurt more and I'll be bringing more in.
1DI0017405	Nah. I know you run your shit straight. Keep up the good work.
1DI0017406	Ahh, doc. You keep us walking around and making money. That's why we keep you around.
1DI0017407	Why are you bothering me, Clover? Hmm? What do you want?
1DI0017408	What do you want now?
1DI0017409	I wanted to talk to you about... you know, about her.
1DI0017410	It's... it's about Crimson. I think that maybe it's time you let her go like you said you would, so that we can be together alone.
1DI0017411	We've talked about this before, haven't we? So why would you think that nagging me would actually help?
1DI0017412	That's not your call, and hasn't ever been. You leave her alone, except when I tell you not to. Got it?
1DI0017413	Okay, okay. I'm sorry...
1DI0017414	Yes, daddy. I'm sorry, daddy.
1DI0017415	Whatever you have to say, it can wait. You're not here to talk.
1DI0017416	Don't start, Crimson. I'm not in the mood.
1DI0017417	It's just that last week-
1DI0017418	I know, but you said that we'd-
1DI0017419	Did I speak Communese to you? I said that I don't want to talk about it. You will be quiet, or you will regret it.
1DI0017420	Why are you still talking after I told you to be quiet? I don't want to have to repeat myself again.
1DI0017421	Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
1DI0017422	What are you talking about, man? There's nothing wrong out here. Everything looks just fine to me.
1DI0017423	What am I supposed to be looking at? It looks fine to me.
1DI0017424	Have you suddenly gone blind, Forty? Do I need to replace my blind second-in-command? Look around! You see what I'm talking about now?
1DI0017425	Nothing wrong? Have you lost your mind? You've got a loose cage over there, you got people loitering over there, and where is my dog?
1DI0017426	Okay, yeah. I see what you mean. I'll get on it right away, Eulogy.
1DI0017427	I guess when you put it that way, yeah... there are a few things that could stand to be tightened up. I'll get on it.
1DI0017428	That's more like it! Show some initiative, dammit, before I sell you off and give one of those fools in the cage your job!
1DI0017429	Forty, if you were any dumber, I'd make a signpost out of you.
1DI0017430	Pfft. I wish. I ain't seen a damn thing all day.
1DI0017431	Not a damn thing. No ants, no Wasters. Nothing. It's been boring as shit.
1DI0017432	Man, as dull as it is down here, I really wonder if I'm ever going to get to shoot anyone again.
1DI0017433	Goddamn, I hate this fucking job some days. It's been far too long since I shot someone.
1DI0017434	What are you talking about, you shot someone this morning! That guy who showed up and tried to run when he figured out where he was!
1DI0017435	Didn't you just shoot someone yesterday?
1DI0017436	Yeah, I did. And that's too long to go between shootings for me.
1DI0017437	Oh yeah. Well, I was drunk then. I barely remember.
1DI0017438	Oh yeah... I forgot about him...
1DI0017439	Right on, Eulogy.
1DI0017440	Hey, Eulogy.
1DI0017441	Nothin' at all, Eulogy.
1DI0017442	Not now. Someone will hear.
1DI0017443	Not now. They're watching.
1DI0017444	Wait... what?
1DI0017445	Oh... hi... <belches>
1DI0017446	Get out of my face.
1DI0017447	Get the fuck away from me, meat.
1DI0017448	I'm too busy for you right now, man.
1DI0017449	Got my eye on you, man.
1DI0017450	Sorry, man. No time... no time...
1DI0017451	Man, fuck off.
1DI0017452	So I look like I wanna be talking to you, scrub?
1DI0017453	Back off before I put a bullet in you.
1DI0017454	Get the fuck away from me.
1DI0017456	Leave me alone, scrub.
1DI0017457	Hahahaha! Yeah, right.
1DI0017458	Oh, please. Kid, come back after your balls have dropped.
1DI0017459	Hello yourself.
1DI0017460	Keep walkin', boy.
1DI0017461	That's cute. Go play.
1DI0017462	Stuff it.
1DI0017463	Take it up with Eulogy.
1DI0017464	<grunts>
1DI0017465	Hello there, little man.
1DI0017466	Hello there, pretty girl.
1DI0017467	I see you later in the barracks.
1DI0017468	You act like we're strangers?
1DI0017469	Hel- <belches> ... hello! ... whew...
1DI0017470	Don't mess with me, or you'll end up like Frank! Hahahaha!
1DI0017471	Hahaha! You owe me a drink!
1DI0017473	S'up?
1DI0017476	Fuck off.
1DI0017477	Yeah, nice try.
1DI0017478	Hey.
1DI0017479	Swell.
1DI0017480	Peachy.
1DI0017481	Not bad, man. Not bad at all.
1DI0017484	You don't really say much, do you?
1DI0017485	Why are you always so quiet? You just sort of hang around, you don't say much.
1DI0017486	I talk when I have something to say.
1DI0017487	Don't have much to say.
1DI0017488	I have to say, I like a man who knows how to look pretty and stay quiet...
1DI0017489	Well, that's okay. It's not your mind that I'm interested in anyway...
1DI0017490	Please, father, people are watching.
1DI0017491	You embarrass me, father.
1DI0017492	Bah! You are my son! Be proud! You collect more slaves than anyone, brag for once in your life!
1DI0017493	I do not care! Let them see that I am proud of my boy! You have nothing to be ashamed of, Jotun!
1DI0017494	Your praise is the only pride I need, father.
1DI0017495	I only do as you taught me, father.
1DI0017496	I swear, boy, you are going to be the greatest Slaver that ever lived!
1DI0017497	Haha! Good enough for me, boy! Good enough for me!
1DI0017498	I know, man. I got bills to pay!
1DI0017499	We gotta get some action around here.
1DI0017500	Seriously. It's been dry as hell.
1DI0017501	Christ, I know. Ever since those caravans went and hired some decent mercs, we haven't caught a damn thing.
1DI0017502	I hear that.
1DI0017503	Seriously. Eulogy's been bitchin' up a storm.
1DI0017504	Yeah, I hear that Carolina Red hasn't even been able to get any good meat.
1DI0017505	I ended up with a pack of heroes. They tried to escape. We ended up just having to put 'em down.
1DI0017506	I thought we were gonna have a pretty good catch, but they ended up getting' sick before we could bring 'em back.
1DI0017507	Little fuckers got away from us.
1DI0017508	We didn't catch a damn thing.
1DI0017509	Worse every year. Are we running out of Wastelanders or something?
1DI0017511	Pretty damn shitty. You know how it's been.
1DI0017512	I ended up selling that one dude to the Raiders from Evergreen Mills!
1DI0017513	Not too bad. A couple of deadbeat buyers though.
1DI0017514	Not too bad, man. Not too bad...
1DI0017515	It could be worse.
1DI0017516	Honestly? Not too bad. Can't say the same for others though...
1DI0017517	Considering how bad it's been around here, I'm not unhappy.
1DI0017518	I'm doin' pretty good, Eulogy. The guys have bought a ton of stock lately -- there somethin' big goin' down?
1DI0017519	Not, bad, Eulogy. Not bad at all. These boys of your just keep buyin' and buyin'. You got them getting' ready for a war or something?
1DI0017520	Haha! Could be, but I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. You got my money?
1DI0017521	Nothing that I know about. All I'm interested in is my cut.
1DI0017522	Got it right here, man. Enjoy.
1DI0017523	Right here, bro. Spend it in good health.
1DI0017524	You're good people, Pronto. Later.
1DI0017525	I'll do that. Later, Pronto.
1DI0017526	You always say that. Are you ever not bored?
1DI0017527	You're always bored. There could be another great war out here and you'd be complaining about being bored.
1DI0017528	I don't see where that's a problem.
1DI0017529	So? I like to keep myself busy, so what?
1DI0017530	I'm just saying, sometimes you've got to appreciate the small things.
1DI0017531	It's just that if you're bored all the time, you're not appreciating how good we have it.
1DI0017532	You're kidding, right? You have to be.
1DI0017533	How about you appreciate my foot up your ass?
1DI0017534	That's my boy! Just like his dad! Hearty and full of life! Haha!
1DI0017535	Wasn't he, though! I am proud of him! You'd swear he was a professional drunk, just like his dad!
1DI0017536	Yeah. Wow. And what boy doesn't want to grow up to be like his dad? Especially your boy.
1DI0017537	I don't know if that's something he should really be... you know... trying for.
1DI0017538	I know! He's the best son a Slaver could ever want!
1DI0017539	Exactly! Haha!
1DI0017540	What is it, my boy?
1DI0017541	Nothing father. Enjoy your drink.
1DI0017542	Ha! I think I will. And that is why you are the best boy a Slaver could ever ask for.
1DI0017543	I'll get Frank to pour us a few cold ones! HAHAHA! Hey Frank! Two drinks over here! HAHAHAHA!
1DI0017544	Better yet, how about five?
1DI0017545	Do I ever say no?
1DI0017546	Only if you're buying!
1DI0017547	ALWAYS!
1DI0017548	Does it matter? It only matters where I am, and that is here.
1DI0017549	I have my boy, my friends, plenty of caps, and strong drink!
1DI0017550	Why would the past matter when now is so good?
1DI0017551	He put water in my vodka to make more caps from me. Make the drink weak and try to charge me more!
1DI0017552	Maybe the next bartender, he won't be so stupid, eh? HAHAHAHAHAHA!
1DI0017553	Gaassp...
1DI0017554	Huuuhhhhh...
1DI0017555	Hhhuuuhh...
1DI0017556	Here's to raising hell and living the good life out here! Cheers!
1DI0017557	Now all we need is a gang, and we could take over this whole Wasteland!
1DI0017558	Ah, you know you can't keep a Tunnel Snake cooped up forever! We gotta be free, and your little visit was just the inspiration I needed!
1DI0017559	So here's to sweet, glorious freedom! Cheers!
1DI0017560	Same way anyone does. By being too cool to stop anywhere else! I didn't see a thing in the wasteland that was a match for a bona fide Tunnel Snake!
1DI0017561	So, here's to freedom and rocking the Wasteland! Drink up!
1DI0017562	No such luck, sucker! Life ain't worth living without Butch around, and you can't keep a Tunnel Snake down.
1DI0017563	But if you're lucky, you can hold my empties. Here.
1DI0017564	It feels like you left home a long time ago, but I know you're still out there. I just hope you're still alive to hear this.
1DI0017565	Things got worse after you left. My father's gone mad with power. If you can hear this, please stop looking for your dad and help stop mine.
1DI0017566	Things got worse after you left. The new Overseer is insane. If you can hear this, please stop looking for your dad and help save us.
1DI0017567	I changed the door password to my name. If you're hearing this, and you still care enough to help me, you should remember it.
1DI0017568	Why do you continue to send your boys to die for your capitalist masters?
1DI0017569	Your boys are dying on the Alaska front, and all for nothing. Bring them home, before it is too late.
1DI0017570	The gang of Wall Street fat cats, and their Washington war-monger puppets, have plunged the world into war to line their own...
1DI0017571	Do you think your leaders will keep you safe if the bombs fall? You will die while the Wall Street gang and their hangers-on live like kings in...
1DI0018495	Message repeats.
1DI0018496	Roof access to the Statesman Hotel is only through the adjoining hospital. Please hurry! Butcher out.
1DI0018497	We will continually broadcast as often as we can, but I'm afraid we don't have much time left. Butcher out.
1DI0018498	Keep your eyes open... we've left booby traps and mines to help slow the Mutants down.
1DI0018499	Oh, shit... here they come again...
1DI0018519	Please. I'll look where the fuck I want to look. What are you gonna do about it?
1DI0018520	Well you're just so damn pretty that I can't help but stare.
1DI0018521	Keepin talkin', smartass. I've had about enough of your shit. You'd just best watch your back.
1DI0018522	Yeah, yeah. Keep runnin' your mouth, asshole. Keep fuckin' with me, and I'll be your worst nightmare.
1DI0018523	Well ain't you just a regular bushy tailed mother fucker today?
1DI0018524	What's so good about it?
1DI0018525	Good morning? What the hell is wrong with you?
1DI0018527	Yo.
1DI0018530	What's goin' on?
1DI0018532	Nice night.
1DI0018533	Good morning!
1DI0018534	What a good morning!
1DI0018536	I'm kind of busy here.
1DI0018537	Boss is on my ass again. You know how it is.
1DI0018538	Bunch of bullshit. I'll tell you about it later.
1DI0018539	Two things: Jack and Shit.
1DI0018540	Ain't got time to tell you about it.
1DI0018541	You know how it is.
1DI0018542	Zippo.
1DI0018544	Not a damn thing.
1DI0018545	Nothin' at all.
1DI0018546	Nada, man.
1DI0018547	I've got the worst hangover...
1DI0018548	That fuckin' sun is giving me a headache.
1DI0018549	It's way too early in the morning for this shit.
1DI0018550	Air feels all fucked up tonight. I think a storm's comin'.
1DI0018551	They went up north? Who goes up there? What happened to them?
1DI0018552	No, but this sounds like it'll be good.
1DI0018553	One of 'em came back last night, screamin' about claws and fangs and shit. He said they ran into a bunch of monsters a few miles north of the city.
1DI0018554	Those fuckin' morons... they ran into some kind of trouble up there. One of 'em came back last night, screamin' about monsters or some shit.
1DI0018555	You're shittin' me! Monsters? Hahaha!
1DI0018556	Monsters? They probably got their asses handed to 'em by some Wastelanders and ran home like a bunch of pussies.
1DI0018557	No shit. But he wouldn't stop screamin' about "claws of death". We finally got sick of it and put him down.
1DI0018558	That's what I said! After a couple hours, we just put a cap in him to get him to shut up.
1DI0018559	These rookies kill me sometimes. Monsters... heh...
1DI0018560	Dumbass rookies, man.
1DI0018561	You really want to help? Take this. It's an internal component from the very android you're searching for. Don't ask how I obtained it.
1DI0018562	Present it to Doctor Zimmer in Rivet City. Tell him the android is dead, and that was on the corpse. He'll believe you.
1DI0018563	Do that, and Zimmer will go back to the Commonwealth, and leave that poor soul alone. Do that, and you'll have saved a man's life.
1DI0018564	Fine. Blow me off. Live in denial. But take this. It's an internal component from the very android you're searching for.
1DI0018565	Don't ask how I obtained it. If you change your mind, if you decide you want to help, present the component to Doctor Zimmer in Rivet City.
1DI0018566	Tell him the android is dead, and that was on the corpse. He'll believe you. He'll go back to the Commonwealth, and you'll have saved a man's life.
1DI0018567	Fine, let's cut to the chase. My name is Victoria Watts. I work for a movement whose goals are directly opposed to your own, apparently.
1DI0018568	It seems you're trying very hard to locate an android my associates and I have tried very hard to hide. You can see how that puts us at odds.
1DI0018569	Am I? You haven't talked to someone lately about a missing android? Or nosed around and found some information you should have left buried?
1DI0018570	I belong to a movement that has taken great efforts to hide this android, to protect him. I think you see where I'm going with this...
1DI0018571	Well... If that's true, then the first thing you need to do is halt your investigation. No more questions, no more searching.
1DI0018572	The movement I'm involved with, we help his kind escape their Commonwealth-imposed slavery. We help them... disappear. You understand?
1DI0018573	Don't you realize what you're doing? The path you're on has the potential to ruin a man's life. Is that what you really want?
1DI0018574	Listen to me... I'm involved with a movement that has dedicated itself to saving these runaway androids. I can't let you interfere with that work.
1DI0018575	What?! That's gross!
1DI0018576	I'm not some whore. Get away from me before I call security.
1DI0018577	Thank you. If you're hungry, stop by Gary's Galley.
1DI0018578	Gary's my dad. The food's better than what you'll get in the Wasteland.
1DI0018579	Dad and I have had a rough time, but we're getting by.
1DI0018580	Since dad died, I'm on my own. It's better than living on the street.
1DI0018581	It's named after my dad. He's dead. I used to help him run it, but now it's just me.
1DI0018582	It's named after my dad. He's a great cook.
1DI0018583	Especially if he is a priest with a thick skull.
1DI0018584	Well, I'm not giving up. I just know we're made for each other.
1DI0018585	Really? Oh, thank you! I just know I can seduce Diego with this.
1DI0018586	Then he'll have to marry me. We'll be so happy!
1DI0018587	Yeah, right. I don't think I could get him drunk enough to do that.
1DI0018588	I wish I had some ant pheromones. Trinnie says they would make any man lose control.
1DI0018589	You're right. I should. But I can't.
1DI0018590	I...I meant no offense!
1DI0018591	I was merely trying to encourage you to shop at Potomac Attire.
1DI0018592	I'm sure you would find something there to suit you.
1DI0018593	That's not what I meant.
1DI0018594	What I meant was that my goods are of the highest quality, which I assume is what you are looking for.
1DI0018595	Between you and me, keeping out the riff raff is good for business.
1DI0018596	So you've met him, eh? Well he wants to replace me on the council. Now, I can't have that. No siree.
1DI0018597	He's a shady character, I just can't prove it. If someone were to find something incriminating in his room...
1DI0018598	Well, lets just say I would be very appreciative.
1DI0018599	A threat? No, of course not! Well, maybe. He wants to replace me on the council.
1DI0018600	He's a shady character, I just can't prove it. Now if someone were to find something incriminating in his room...
1DI0018602	Don't want to get mixed up in politics, eh? Don't blame you.
1DI0018603	Really? I...I mean, I'm shocked. Shocked I tell you.
1DI0018604	Tell Danvers about that letter right away. That will squash any hope he has of replacing me on the council.
1DI0018605	Don't tell her I asked you to find it though. That would backfire in a nasty way.
1DI0018606	Yeah? Well it's my dump, not yours. Either order a drink or get out.
1DI0018607	Go talk to Vera if you want gossip. I don't talk bad about folks.
1DI0018608	You must be drunk. Are you going to order or what?
1DI0018609	Probably not. What'll you have?
1DI0018610	Let's keep it that way.
1DI0018611	Belle can mix almost anything, as long as its beer or whiskey.
1DI0018612	Starting fights, breaking stuff, stealing. Hmmm. I think I'll keep a close eye on you.
1DI0018613	Henry's my husband.
1DI0018614	I have a daughter, C.J. too. You'll see her running around here with James Hargrave.
1DI0018615	She's my daughter. You can usually find her running around with that James Hargrave.
1DI0018616	Every cap is needed. God bless you.
1DI0018617	A most generous offer. God bless you.
1DI0018618	A kind offering. God bless you.
1DI0018619	A kind thought, but we don't need your cast off belongings.
1DI0018620	You would? I mean, certainly!
1DI0018621	We humbly accept whatever you can spare. However, Saint Monica looks most favorably on donations of 100 caps or more.
1DI0018622	Father Clifford takes the donations. You'll have to talk to him.
1DI0018623	Sorry. I get nervous easily. When I'm nervous, I'm fast. I mean, I talk. Fast that is. See, I'm doing it again.
1DI0018624	Yeah. Paulie and I. Our shop is in the market.
1DI0018625	Boy, that sounded dumb! Where else would our shop be? Anyway, thanks. For being nice, that is.
1DI0018626	Oh. Okay. Well let me know if you want anything. To buy that is.
1DI0018627	Oh. Okay. Well stop by if you want anything. To buy that is.
1DI0018628	No, no, no! I would never do that.
1DI0018629	Paulie does. Sample it, I mean. He's my deadbeat husband.
1DI0018631	Paulie did. Sample it, I mean. He's dead now, thank God.
1DI0018632	Yeah, well I don't have time for newbies like you. You got something on your mind, spill it.
1DI0018633	That's pretty underhanded, even for Bannon.
1DI0018634	Once word gets out, I bet the market vendors won't want him to represent them anymore.
1DI0018635	Thank you for your help, citizen.
1DI0018636	I'm his second in command. I run the night shift and he runs the day shift.
1DI0018637	Is this conversation going somewhere? Because I've got things to do.
1DI0018638	He's gone. I'm in charge now.
1DI0018639	Did you want something, or are you just wasting my time?
1DI0018640	This is bad. Seagrave Holmes was angling for a seat on the council.
1DI0018641	He can forget about that now. Once the market vendors get wind of his past, they'll never trust him. Too bad.
1DI0018642	Oh, yes! Father Clifford conducts services every Sunday morning. You should come.
1DI0018643	Oh, yes! I conduct services every Sunday morning. You should come.
1DI0018644	Father Clifford says she is my trial. My temptation.
1DI0018645	I must chose between her and the Church. I have chosen the Church.
1DI0018646	I forgive you. More importantly, God forgives you.
1DI0018647	Father Clifford. The sanctuary is in the ship's fore, on the upper deck. The good father holds services every Sunday morning.
1DI0018648	I swear to you, our relationship is chaste. I am only her friend.
1DI0018649	However, I must confess, I have not done all I could. I am sorely tempted.
1DI0018650	You have given me new resolve. I will tell Angela we cannot see each other again. Even as friends.
1DI0018651	I suppose.
1DI0018652	Doctor Preston is in the upper deck, fore section. That's the top interior floor in the southwest end.
1DI0018653	It doesn't work like that. I'm in charge of security. Doctor Li runs most of everything else.
1DI0018654	Bannon kind of represents the merchants. He also owns Potomac Attire.
1DI0018655	Depends. Chief Harkness is in charge of security. He patrols the whole city. Security bunks down in the tower.
1DI0018656	Doctor Li kind of runs everything else. She's in the aft. That's the northeast end of the city.
1DI0018657	It doesn't work like that. We're just security. Doctor Li runs most of everything else.
1DI0018659	The common room is free, but the beds are lousy. It's on the midship deck. A big open room with lots of beds. You can't miss it.
1DI0018660	If you want to sleep well rested, rent a room from Vera Weatherly. She's on the upper deck.
1DI0018661	The door on the left goes to the stairwell. From there, just keep heading west.
1DI0018662	At the stern. That's the west end to you.
1DI0018663	Hangar deck. Right in the middle of the ship. Can't miss it.
1DI0018665	But it's closed now. Check back in the morning. It opens pretty early.
1DI0018666	You can get that crap down at A Quick Fix. It's in the market.
1DI0018667	I'm a doctor, not a dealer. I'll fix you as best I can if you're hurt.
1DI0018668	Don't get any cute ideas. Security is just a shout away.
1DI0018669	Now, if you've got any medical issues, let's hear them.
1DI0018670	Yes. My flock is all of Rivet City. You should come to services this Sunday. I'll be telling the tale of Saint Monica.
1DI0018671	Of course, you're right. It's not like you saw it with your own eyes. I'm sure it's just gossip.
1DI0018672	Sorry I overreacted. So many of my hopes for the church lie in Diego that it would be devastating to have him leave.
1DI0018673	Ah! Diego! What have you done!
1DI0018674	He has forced my hand. I cannot let him be a priest now.
1DI0018675	This may be the end of the faith if I cannot find another acolyte.
1DI0018676	Here? In Rivet City?
1DI0018677	I'm packing and most of the rest of these guys are packing. Not to mention security.
1DI0018678	We usually have a few. I'd have to check the inventory.
1DI0018679	Stop by the shop. Either Shrapnel or I will show you what we've got.
1DI0018680	I don't put the good stuff out on the table. If you're interested, I can show you the stuff in the locker.
1DI0018681	Like that's your real name?
1DI0018682	The names are good for business. And if you don't think I'm tough enough, just try me.
1DI0018683	I'm sure that was just luck. You should upgrade. Check out our shop in the market.
1DI0018685	Why you...
1DI0018686	...I mean, of course it's edible.
1DI0018687	You should come by and try the Mirelurk Cakes. They're my specialty.
1DI0018688	Perfect timing then! My Galley is in the market, at the far end. I'll save you some Mirelurk Cakes.
1DI0018689	Ah, a true Wasteland warrior. Still, you should stop by my Galley in the market and try a Mirelurk cake. I'm sure you'll love it.
1DI0018690	Then you are in for a treat!
1DI0018691	Uh...maybe you should sit in the corner. I can check to see if we have any squirrel if you wish.
1DI0018692	Nothing, sir.
1DI0018693	Oddly, sir? No, I haven't seen anyone else acting oddly.
1DI0018694	So far everything's been quiet.
1DI0018695	Sounds good. I'm beat.
1DI0018696	No. I haven't seen anything.
1DI0018697	Nothing I'd contact security for.
1DI0018698	I think we're out of wine, but I'll check.
1DI0018699	Er...uh...yes. I think so. No, I'm quite certain. Yes.
1DI0018700	Really? That would be wonderful. I don't have enough caps right now, but I've been saving them up.
1DI0018701	I'm just looking. I'm sure you don't have anything that would make me 18 any sooner.
1DI0018702	You bastard! And to think I loved you! I hate you.
1DI0018703	Thank you, Father. I'll ask him again, but he doesn't want to close the restaurant on Sunday mornings.
1DI0018704	Okay. Don't forget to check the oven. Nobody will eat a burnt iguana.
1DI0018705	He's not like that, dad. Diego's a gentleman...unfortunately.
1DI0018706	No thanks, Paulie. Last time I tried that stuff Diego got so mad at me. I'll just get you some noodles.
1DI0018707	We just got in a fresh batch. I'll go blow the dust off of one.
1DI0018708	Sorry, Mr. Shrapnel. My dad asked me to see if you had anything new, and to check out what ammo you have.
1DI0018709	Sorry, Mr. Shrapnel. I just came by to see if you had anything new, and to check out what ammo you have.
1DI0018710	Diego takes me up there at night, but the sun isn't up then. Oh! I'm late Miss Vera. Goodbye!
1DI0018711	Brock.
1DI0018712	Harkness.
1DI0018713	Yes, I am. Thank you.
1DI0018714	Yes, sir. That may be the case.
1DI0018715	There does seem to be some tension between the two decks. However, you're drunk. Just leave us alone.
1DI0018716	No. Not today. Just bring me some Mole Rat, rare.
1DI0018717	Of course. Just don't touch it. I don't want any grease stains from that kitchen on it.
1DI0018718	Too bad for you, you mean. It's good business for me.
1DI0018719	Shhh. I'm trying to listen.
1DI0018720	I guess so. No law against it. Or at least none that I've signed.
1DI0018721	We decided to build a railing on the flight deck, just as soon as we can get the scrap metal. Other than that, no.
1DI0018722	Brahmin steak, with scotch.
1DI0018723	Dresses don't grow on trees, Vera. I can only sell what the outlanders bring me.
1DI0018724	You're always trying to pull that shit. You know I don't run tabs for nobody, Tammy.
1DI0018725	That's a load of crap. Preach to them if you have to, but don't get in the way of their drinking.
1DI0018726	Don't tell me how to run my business, Brock. These prices have worked for 30 years, and they be fine for 30 more.
1DI0018727	This is the last one, Trinnie. You're too goddamn drunk.
1DI0018728	You're full of crap, Father. If you keep bothering my customers, I'm going to throw you out. Again.
1DI0018729	You're a Mirelurk humping, Wasteland reject, Armitage. You're getting a beer, and you're paying for it. And I expect a tip.
1DI0018730	I don't serve that swill here. Beer, whiskey, even some wine, but no goddamn water.
1DI0018731	Not much call for wine. Real men drink beer or whiskey.
1DI0018732	Potent. It'll burn all the way down.
1DI0018733	One glass of rotgut, coming up.
1DI0018734	Armitage.
1DI0018735	Your stuff is too expensive. I'm saving up for something special though.
1DI0018736	Nope. Leastwise none that you need to worry about.
1DI0018737	Not today. I've got enough for a while.
1DI0018738	I'm hoping to have the caps for a new one next month.
1DI0018739	Tammy, you're always drunk in the Rudder. Now go bother someone else.
1DI0018740	Yeah, my life is real glamorous. You just keep believing that, kid.
1DI0018741	He won't know what hit him.
1DI0018742	You're too young. And right now, you're too drunk. Sober up and we'll see if you still want to have this conversation.
1DI0018743	Actually, Father, I'm a real asshole. Now get out of my face before I toss you in with the Mirelurks.
1DI0018744	Careful, Sister. Bigger isn't always badder.
1DI0018745	Mirelurk Cakes with a beer.
1DI0018746	Better than last time. I hate the taste of Mirelurk.
1DI0018747	Not now, dear. You'll spoil your meal.
1DI0018748	Shhh! It's not polite to ask that here. Now eat your food. Daddy paid good money for it.
1DI0018749	Shhh! It's not polite to ask that here. Now eat your food. I paid good money for it.
1DI0018750	Shhh! Don't say things like that in church. Now be quiet and listen to Father Clifford.
1DI0018751	They are well, Father. C.J. is growing up so fast. I am so proud of her.
1DI0018752	As well as can be expected, Father. I'm still recovering from CJ's death.
1DI0018753	Father Clifford looks pleased.
1DI0018754	You go if you want. There's too many of the wrong sort up there at this time of night.
1DI0018755	If you people would take better care of your own spaces, it wouldn't be a problem.
1DI0018756	I'll have a Mirelurk cake and some water.
1DI0018757	I've got nothing like that here. Why don't you go have a drink in the Muddy Rudder? That should do it.
1DI0018758	I like sitting next you. I...nevermind.
1DI0018759	Paulie stole the key. I'll need you to stop by and change the lock for me.
1DI0018760	Water and a Mirelurk cake, please.
1DI0018761	I don't think you need a love potion, dear. Besides, none of these will do that. If they did, Paulie would...never mind.
1DI0018762	I don't think you need a love potion, dear. Besides, none of these will do that.
1DI0018763	Yeah, right. As soon as I'm gone, you'll use all the inventory, Paulie. How about I just close up tonight.
1DI0018764	Anything I might give you would come with a side effect. Why don't you go to Doctor Preston?
1DI0018765	Anything I might give you would come with a side effect. It's too bad Doctor Preston isn't with us anymore.
1DI0018766	I really miss him. I didn't think it would hurt this much.
1DI0018767	James isn't so bad, Chief. He's my friend. I'll make sure he's good.
1DI0018768	Thank you, Father. I tried, but his mother said no. Sorry.
1DI0018769	That doesn't sound like any fun. Let's just play hide and seek.
1DI0018770	Not yet, Dad. In a minute.
1DI0018771	Okay, Mom.
1DI0018772	Sorry, Mom.
1DI0018773	Aw, Mom, do I have to?
1DI0018774	I am...I mean, thank you, Mr. Holmes.
1DI0018775	Hello, Mrs. Cantelli.
1DI0018776	Sorry. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
1DI0018777	Just some mutfruit and a Nuka-Cola please.
1DI0018778	Just keeping the deck safe for all you Upper Deck types.
1DI0018779	Paulie, you're wasted. Just do me a favor and don't fall off the deck.
1DI0018780	I suppose that's true. Doesn't mean I have to like it though.
1DI0018781	I'll send someone down to change the locks.
1DI0018782	Bitch.
1DI0018783	Everything is quiet, sir.
1DI0018784	All quiet, Commander.
1DI0018785	Dude, that would be such a drag. Last resort, man. Last resort.
1DI0018786	Dude, that sounds sweet. But, uh...I'm kinda broke. Soon as I get some caps, though, I'm there with ya.
1DI0018787	Sure thing, Mei. I'll clean it up later. Right now I've got this song stuck in my head.
1DI0018788	Me? Read? That would be awesome. I've heard there's a lot of cool stuff in books.
1DI0018789	Dude, I will definitely not let that happen. I'll get right on that life thing though. Maybe after my nap.
1DI0018790	No offense Father, but Saint Monica has never done anything for me. I've always had to take care of myself.
1DI0018791	I'm like, kinda short on caps. I'll just have a carrot, an apple, and some water.
1DI0018792	My relationship with Angela is strictly platonic, Commander. Saint Monica's blessing to you.
1DI0018793	God Bless you, Vera. You are too kind to us.
1DI0018794	We're not alone, so it'll have to wait. Maybe later today.
1DI0018795	That's not very polite, Angela, but thank you anyway.
1DI0018796	Lord give me strength.
1DI0018797	Well, I, uh, that is, sure. You are incredibly sexy. Not that I've noticed. I am going a priest, and they don't...um, well, you know.
1DI0018798	No, not yet. I'm still studying the life of Saint Monica. Hopefully someday soon.
1DI0018799	Yes, Father Clifford. I've already cleaned the sanctuary. I'll put out fresh candles too.
1DI0018800	Yes, Father Clifford.
1DI0018801	Yes, Doctor Preston. Father Clifford and I will minister to the needs of their souls. We let you minister to the needs of their bodies.
1DI0018802	Yes, Doctor Preston. I will minister to the needs of their souls. You can minister to the needs of their bodies.
1DI0018803	I hope I will live up to his example. See you next week Mrs. Young.
1DI0018804	Yes, it was. <yawn> Excuse me. See you next week Vera.
1DI0018805	He was? I mean, I know. He tries very hard Mister Young. See you next week.
1DI0018806	Then I'll try the iguana.
1DI0018807	I'll try, but he's pretty set in his ways. See you next week, Mei.
1DI0018808	No. Ask Mister Buckingham.
1DI0018809	Not yet. Give me a few minutes, Mister Buckingham.
1DI0018810	It's about time. Sorry, Henry. I know you're doing the best you can, but these delays are frustrating.
1DI0018811	Perfect. I'll be ready for them.
1DI0018812	So you say. All I see is wasted time away from my work. That's what Rivet City really needs from me.
1DI0018813	Make sure it's locked this time. We don't want them stolen again.
1DI0018814	Oh. So you did.
1DI0018815	And it's my job to make sure you stay that way, so just let me do my job.
1DI0018816	That's wonderful. I've read about broccoli in the old books, but I've never seen any.
1DI0018817	I suppose it can't hurt. Just try not to disturb anyone that's sleeping.
1DI0018818	I suppose. Don't go filling their heads with any of that faith healing crap though.
1DI0018819	Am I that predictable? I guess so. Yes, the usual.
1DI0018820	I am a man of peace, Brock. I am only here to preach the word of the Lord.
1DI0018821	There is always the opportunity to help others. God still has a purpose for you in this life.
1DI0018822	They need their eternal souls saved too, Doctor Preston. Have no fear, I won't occupy them for long.
1DI0018823	Just leave. I cannot bear to look at you. You are hereby excommunicated from the church. May your soul wither in purgatory.
1DI0018824	I'm thinking of preaching about one of the seven deadly sins. I haven't decided which one though.
1DI0018825	I'm glad you thought so, Vera. Bless you.
1DI0018826	Thank you, Henry. And God bless you.
1DI0018827	Thank you, Angela.
1DI0018828	I pray that the whole congregation feels the same way, Christie.
1DI0018829	Nice of you to say so, Mei.
1DI0018830	I can see that liquor has affected your temper. Good day, sir.
1DI0018831	No, no. Just call me Father, not Mister. Sometimes I think Vera programmed you that way just to annoy me. I'll just have water.
1DI0018832	Can't complain. I've got some new stuff in. You should come by and take a look.
1DI0018833	Bring them by anytime.
1DI0018834	Nah. Just break it down for parts.
1DI0018835	Ammo's moving, but not the guns. They just don't break down like they used to.
1DI0018836	Really? I heard it was tough and too salty. I think I'll have Mirelurk Cakes instead.
1DI0018837	I'm thinking about firing off a couple.
1DI0018838	Get me a beer.
1DI0018839	I got a little of everything. Go ahead and pick out what you want.
1DI0018840	Don't worry. I'll keep it under control tonight.
1DI0018841	Okay, just this once. Belle, another beer for Trinnie.
1DI0018842	It's a mighty sweet temptation, Father. Now leave me the fuck alone.
1DI0018843	Mirelurk Cakes, and a beer.
1DI0018844	Thanks for the advice.
1DI0018845	I don't see her much these days. I'd much rather she spend her time with Diego than with someone like that Ted Strayer.
1DI0018846	No tabs. Nobody gets a tab. I'll get you your usual, and you'll pay me, as usual.
1DI0018847	My pleasure, Tammy. I think I have some Iguana Bits for James.
1DI0018848	Right away, Tammy.
1DI0018849	Coming up, Flak.
1DI0018850	An excellent choice, Seagrave.
1DI0018851	That wasn't burnt, Shrapnel. It was blackened. It's a gourmet method I read about. I'll make it tartar this time.
1DI0018852	I made them just yesterday.
1DI0018853	With pleasure Mrs. Cantelli.
1DI0018854	Sure. Since your parents aren't around to tell you no, you get to make your own choices.
1DI0018855	So long as it's okay with your parents, C.J.
1DI0018856	Okay. I'll go lower the bucket.
1DI0018857	No. It's the same as yesterday. And last week. And the week before. Let me know if you want to order.
1DI0018858	Yes, Doctor Li.
1DI0018859	Certainly, Janice.
1DI0018860	I'm not a very religious man, Diego. Sorry.
1DI0018861	Sorry Henry. I'll remove them before the end of the day.
1DI0018862	No. I don't do chems. I'm this way from hard work and sweat, two things I'm sure you don't know. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to eat. Alone.
1DI0018863	Just fine. Lots of people are asking me about it.
1DI0018865	Good thing too. I don't feel like busting heads tonight.
1DI0018866	First thing tomorrow, Commander Danvers.
1DI0018867	Ted, you're wasting your life. You need to find a purpose, or at least find a job. By the way, Christie Young could use some help.
1DI0018868	Ted, you're wasting your life. You need to find a purpose, or at least find a job.
1DI0018869	Thank you, Diego. Speaking of rounds, I need to get back to them.
1DI0018870	You're wasted, Paulie. If you're going to stay on the flight deck, try to stay away from the railing.
1DI0018871	I'm sure the boys will use them for target practice. You might want to stay below deck.
1DI0018872	Yes, Doctor Li. I've recalibrated with them.
1DI0018873	I'll make that your bedtime story. Now run along, sweetie.
1DI0018874	Not yet, sweetheart. Finish you meal first.
1DI0018875	Church will be over soon. Just try and sit still.
1DI0018876	Don't make a fuss over it. Their just kids. Besides, maybe C.J. will rub off on James and not the other way around.
1DI0018877	Amen. We have each other, and we have C.J.
1DI0018878	The transformer is still touch and go. Doctor Li hopes her most recent tests will  be good.
1DI0018879	Thank you, Father. I pray every night for her success.
1DI0018880	I'll check it out before the end of the day.
1DI0018881	Not right now. Check back with me later.
1DI0018882	Take your sarcasm somewhere else, Cindy. It's not my fault you married an addict and I have a family.
1DI0018883	Have you no sense of decency? I just want something to dull the memory. I can't believe she's dead.
1DI0018884	Good idea, Seagrave. I'll be by later.
1DI0018885	I'll have Iguana on a Stick. C.J. will have some Mutfruit and a Nuka-Cola.
1DI0018886	I'll have Iguana on a Stick.
1DI0018887	Fu...I mean, yes sir, Chief Harkness.
1DI0018888	Yes, mom.
1DI0018889	I wasn't doing anything! And C.J. is my friend. I hate you! I hope you die!
1DI0018890	I'm not a squirt! My name is James, and you're an asshole. My mom said you're good for nothing, and she oughta know.
1DI0018891	I want an Iguana on a Stick, but my mom won't let me have one.
1DI0018892	Just give me some Iguana Bits.
1DI0018893	They should be just fine. Try it again.
1DI0018894	I've got a new strain of lima bean I'm developing. I'll bring a sample sometime.
1DI0018895	That sounds like a good idea. I'll ask Doctor Li which papers I can let you have. I'll get back to you later.
1DI0018896	They're fine. However, I have two others that are making odd noises. Please check them out soon.
1DI0018897	Thank you, Garza.
1DI0018898	No, I'm fine Mister Buckingham.
1DI0018899	Thank you, Chief. I'm terrified that he will recognize me. I hope he leaves soon.
1DI0018900	Yes, I am Chief. Now I can sleep at night without wondering if he'll take me while I'm sleeping.
1DI0018901	Look, I keep telling you. I'm not into that. Psycho rots your brain. Just leave me alone.
1DI0018902	Yes. Every night on the flight deck. Paulie, those chems are trashing your memory. Now let me eat in peace.
1DI0018903	My story is my business. I just want to be left alone.
1DI0018904	Yeah, yeah. You've been telling me this for months. Besides, once you're gone, you won't be around to miss anything.
1DI0018905	Could I have some Iguana Bits and a Nuka-Cola, please?
1DI0018906	Thank you, Father. Attending church always makes me feel stronger.
1DI0018907	I am trying Father. I just don't see how Saint Monica can stop a bullet or break a set of manacles. But, I will try.
1DI0018908	That would be nice, Mister Buckingham.
1DI0018909	Yes, Mister Washington.
1DI0018911	Your food will be ready shortly, Mister Zimmer.
1DI0018912	Certainly, Sir.
1DI0018915	I'd like two carrots and some water.
1DI0018916	Life is hell. My life is hell. I just wish I had the courage to do something about it. Why don't you just leave me alone.
1DI0018917	Thank you, but no. I talk to Father Clifford, but it doesn't seem to help me.
1DI0018918	I'm not sure it will help, but I will pray with you, Father.
1DI0018919	That might be best. Would you please ask Father Clifford if I might have a few moments of his time?
1DI0018920	I know, I know. Tonight's my last night. Honest.
1DI0018921	Whoa. No such thing as too much. In fact, I'm going to do some more.
1DI0018922	Water and Iguana Bits.
1DI0018923	Don't worry about me. Uh, huh. I can take care of myself.
1DI0018924	Sir! Yes, Sir!
1DI0018925	Ha, ha! Nothing you'd be interested in. Only good stuff.
1DI0018926	If you ever change your mind, Vera. I'll be here, waiting.
1DI0018927	A man can hope, Danvers. Besides, I don't have a problem with the Upper Deck like you do.
1DI0018928	Noodles and beer. A match made in heaven, eh?
1DI0018929	Not today, Angela. Maybe next week.
1DI0018930	I learned my lesson, Danvers. Just keep those damn Raiders away from me.
1DI0018931	Sure thing. I'll bring them by later for you.
1DI0018932	It's fine. You worry too much.
1DI0018933	You need a new joke, Cindy. I've only heard that one about a million times.
1DI0018934	Whiskey, straight.
1DI0018935	It's doing well enough for me to come down here and buy drinks.
1DI0018936	Nah. You gotta buy at least one box.
1DI0018937	We only had one night together, Trinnie. Go get your own drinks.
1DI0018938	Give me a Brahmin steak, potato, and a beer.
1DI0018939	Hells bells, girl. I ain't no mister. Just call me Shrapnel. Yeah, I got some 10mm rounds. I'll bring them over to him later.
1DI0018940	Sure, I'll take a drink. Flak and I don't talk about our past. Everyone knows we weren't born on Rivet City though.
1DI0018942	I won't be causing any more trouble, Commander...Bitch.
1DI0018943	Beer. And don't let it get empty.
1DI0018944	I'm here to drink, not to fight.
1DI0018945	Not happening, Trinnie. I already paid that debt. Go find someone else to hit up.
1DI0018946	Hey, I've got my own problems. I don't have time to be on the lookout for yours.
1DI0018947	Yeah, it's just fine. Unless of course you want to warm my bed for me? Nah? Then stop botherin' me.
1DI0018948	Step away from my beer, Father, or I'll be raising my fist.
1DI0018949	Don't call me Mister, you goddamn bucket of bolts! Just bring me an iguana on stick.
1DI0018950	Fucking junk heap. I should start eating at Gary's.
1DI0018951	To hell with that brat. And to hell with you, Harkness. I'll drink as much as I want.
1DI0018952	Shut your trap. You'll eat what I give you and be grateful for it, or I'll give you something to be really sorry for.
1DI0018953	Do I look like I give a crap? Now get away from me. I don't want you filling James' head with your dopehead ideas.
1DI0018954	Do I look like I give a crap? Now get away from me.
1DI0018955	Other than you? No.
1DI0018956	Whiskey and water. Go light on the water.
1DI0018957	James? Who knows where that little shit has run off to. Mind your own business, Brock. I'm going to get a drink.
1DI0018958	Mole rat, well done, with wine. Leave the bottle. James has been bad. He gets a carrot and some water.
1DI0018959	Mole rat, well done, with wine. Leave the bottle.
1DI0018960	Sure thing, Chief. Next time I'll take him into the back to fuck him instead. Sheesh!
1DI0018961	Fuck you, bitch. Oh, wait. Nobody wants to because you're too fugly!
1DI0018962	I'll say when I've had enough. You aren't my mother, Belle, so fuck off.
1DI0018963	Not yet. I'm still able to remember. Leave me alone, Brock. You aren't my father. Thank God, too.
1DI0018964	I'm not that desperate.
1DI0018965	You're wrong. I haven't had enough to drink. In fact, I think I'll order another one right now.
1DI0018966	Huh? I don't get it. Nevermind. Just buy me another drink.
1DI0018967	I prefer beer to whiskey, Father. And unless you want to buy me the next round, get lost.
1DI0018968	Thank you, Chief Harkness.
1DI0018969	Mister Buckingham can handle the Weatherly for a couple of hours.
1DI0018970	A girl has to be able to protect herself, even if that means buying a gun.
1DI0018971	I guess I'll just be window shopping then.
1DI0018972	I know, I know. He's nice enough, but just not my type. Take care, and don't spread too much gossip.
1DI0018973	I just stopped by to say hello. And to see if you have anything new for sale.
1DI0018974	You go do what you have to. I don't want to watch that.
1DI0018975	You need to stop giving me special discounts, Seagrave. A new toaster oven would sure be handy though. I'll pick it up later.
1DI0018976	Thank you, Father. I've been trying to get Seagrave to come to church too, but he's stubborn.
1DI0018977	Thank you, Father. I always feel the presence of the Lord when I pray here.
1DI0018978	No. He's never going to notice you, Cindy. Especially if you're still with Paulie. Just forget about Bannon.
1DI0018979	Stop! You're embarrassing me, but thank you. I should go. I want to see Cindy and Angela too.
1DI0018980	Stop! You're embarrassing me, but thank you. I should go.
1DI0018981	I've told you before. I don't feel that way about you. I'm sorry.
1DI0018982	I'll see what I can find, Mister Armitage.
1DI0018983	Certainly, Mister Zimmer.
1DI0018984	Oh, he notices all right. You should forget about him. Priests are married to God and take vows of celibacy.
1DI0018985	No, not right now. Carry on Mister Buckingham.
1DI0018986	<sigh> Sometimes I hate working with robots.
1DI0018987	Yes, of course. I'll watch my alcohol intake.
1DI0018988	Good. Stay alert. He could be anywhere.
1DI0018989	Relax. I'm sure there is no danger here.
1DI0018990	Not yet, Chief Harkness.
1DI0018991	I could really care less about you and your brat, Madam.
1DI0018992	Your food is very nourshing, Vera.
1DI0018993	A glass of wine, if you please.
1DI0018994	Yes. Iguana Bits, water, and a piece of fruit. Anything will do.
1DI0018995	I'm on patrol, punk. Try and stay out of my way.
1DI0018996	Don't worry, Diego. I'll take care of you. I even found a room below decks for us. Our love will sustain us.
1DI0018997	Of course I'm excited. Diego is a wreck though. My dad might have to help him up the aisle instead of me.
1DI0018998	Diego insisted. He may not be a priest any more, but he still has his faith.
1DI0018999	Oh, Dad! Stop that or you'll have me crying. You can visit Diego and me any time. And I'll still be working with you.
1DI0019000	Thank you Mister Holmes. We'll need lots of things for our new home, so I'm sure we'll be shopping here.
1DI0019001	It took him long enough to get the hint. I had to practically write it out for him. Men!
1DI0019002	Yes, I got the invitation. I wouldn't miss you and Diego's wedding for anything.
1DI0019003	Why are you so mean sometimes? I'm always nice to you.
1DI0019004	This week doesn't look good either, Father.
1DI0019005	God and Saint Monica hear my sermons. That's good enough for me.
1DI0019006	Sorry. I just don't have enough money, Angela. I really wish I could.
1DI0019007	Thank you. No, they don't have a date for the wedding yet, but it will be soon.
1DI0019008	I am. Diego is a good boy. They will make a happy couple.
1DI0019009	My little girl is all grown up. I hope I don't cry at the wedding.
1DI0019010	Thank you, Diego. You'll make a fine priest some day.
1DI0019011	She's not a bitch, you are! I hate you! You're ruining my life.
1DI0019012	I'm on my break, so I'm just looking around. I guess you don't have anything new today.
1DI0019013	Your mom was no Saint Monica. I wouldn't want someone like her. Besides, I like cooking.
1DI0019014	It's ready for you, Father.
1DI0019015	I'll try that.
1DI0019016	Yeah. That was bad. I'm sure they'll do something about it.
1DI0019017	I'm sure she'll just scrounge some from the lower deck.
1DI0019018	I never expected it to happen in my lifetime. I can hardly wait to taste clean water.
1DI0019019	Good for them. I think slavery is horrible.
1DI0019020	I heard a lot of them got away and made it to the Citadel. I hope the Enclave leaves us alone.
1DI0019021	Thank God! That was such an annoying broadcast.
1DI0019022	I used to think Rivet City was such a safe place.
1DI0019023	That's just a myth. I bet some deranged Ghoul did it though. Well, I gotta run.
1DI0019024	Me too. Nothing is getting through these walls!
1DI0019025	It's a tough job. I wouldn't want it.
1DI0019026	The ship's water isn't much better. If we don't get fresh water soon, we'll all end up like her.
1DI0019027	I do.
1DI0019029	Go jump off the flight deck, asshole.
1DI0019030	My mom is probably drunk, and my dad's dead.
1DI0019031	Is that good enough for you, asshole?
1DI0019032	Dead. Some asshole like you killed them.
1DI0019033	I'll show you. I'll show all of you!
1DI0019034	When I'm gone, my mom will really miss me.
1DI0019035	You're still an asshole. Well, guess what. I'm going to follow you anyway.
1DI0019036	And if you aren't going back, we'll just stay here.
1DI0019037	You're just mean! I hope your Mom and Dad die!
1DI0019038	I ain't scared, and I ain't your son.
1DI0019039	Any other stupid questions, asshole?
1DI0019040	Of course I'm not afraid. I'll take it and he'll never know. I'll have it by tomorrow.
1DI0019041	Sure. I pinched this from his table. He never even saw me.
1DI0019042	I can get you some more by tomorrow.
1DI0019043	Thanks, mister.
1DI0019044	Thanks, lady.
1DI0019045	Thank you, mister. I promise to be good from now on.
1DI0019046	Thank you, ma'am. I promise to be good from now on.
1DI0019047	Oh yeah? Well...well...you're an asshole.
1DI0019048	I love you Diego.
1DI0019049	I love you too, Angela.
1DI0019050	Really? Oh, thank you.
1DI0019051	Can you help me? I've been so worried with him around. I can hardly sleep at night.
1DI0019052	Thank you! I'll go to Flak and Shrapnel's just before closing.
1DI0019053	I don't have anything to give you, but I think I can trust you with a secret.
1DI0019054	If you ever go up north, there is a secret slave hide out called Temple of the Union. You might find them useful.
1DI0019056	I guess that was too much to ask for. Farewell.
1DI0019057	No! Don't take me back! I would rather die than be a slave for that awful Allistair Tenpenny.
1DI0019058	I suppose it doesn't matter if I tell you.
1DI0019059	I used to be a slave. I saw a Slaver on this ship, his name is Sister. I'm afraid he's after me.
1DI0019060	I suppose nothing, now. I've been hunted for so long, being safe here in Rivet City is strange. Sorry.
1DI0019061	That's easy to say. You don't have anyone from your past after you.
1DI0019062	I just feel so helpless.
1DI0019063	I'm sorry. I'm just so on edge all the time.
1DI0019064	Oh, my God! What am I going to do now? How could you?
1DI0019066	No. He's a big, scary Slaver. He's staying at the Weatherly Hotel. I try to avoid him because he might recognize me.
1DI0019067	No! Please, don't tell Sister. I think he's a Slaver. I don't want to be taken by him.
1DI0019068	I...I am at your mercy.
1DI0019069	I suppose it was wrong of me to ask you for help. I won't talk to you about this again.
1DI0019070	That's what Father Clifford says. I'm not sure I believe that. I'll think about it.
1DI0019071	You're right. I've failed everyone. Even my family.
1DI0019073	Is it that obvious? I suppose so.
1DI0019074	My family was killed by Raiders. I don't have much to live for any more.
1DI0019075	Thank you. A quick shove should do it.
1DI0019076	Ted Strayer? I suppose I could talk to him. He is kind of a lost boy.
1DI0019077	Thank you, stranger.
1DI0019078	Nobody does. I'm not very memorable.
1DI0019079	Don't worry, it won't be a problem for much longer.
1DI0019080	You may be right, but I have nothing to live for.
1DI0019081	Damn! I forgot to eat breakfast again.
1DI0019082	I'd better get back to the museum.
1DI0019083	Oh! Look at the time. I'd better go get something to eat.
1DI0019084	I'd better get back.
1DI0019085	Dad, my shift's over. I'm going to do some shopping.
1DI0019086	I'd better get home. Dad will be worried.
1DI0019087	See you tomorrow night, Diego.
1DI0019088	Well, I need to go open up.
1DI0019089	I'm out of here.
1DI0019090	Closing time.
1DI0019091	<yawn> I'm tired.
1DI0019092	Another day, another dollar.
1DI0019093	Shit. I've got a Council meeting.
1DI0019094	Think I'll get something to nibble on.
1DI0019095	Where did I put that food?
1DI0019096	I'm getting tired. Watch the bar, Brock.
1DI0019097	Belle! Time to get up!
1DI0019098	Maybe I'll go topside.
1DI0019099	That's enough fresh air for one day.
1DI0019100	I suppose I can make do with my old gun for another week.
1DI0019101	Let me know if you get anything new in, Bannon.
1DI0019102	I'm going to take a food break, Belle.
1DI0019103	Enough chit-chat. I need to get to work. Those halls won't clean themselves.
1DI0019104	This deck is as good as it's going to get today. I need to move on to the mid-deck.
1DI0019105	My feet are killing me. Time to go home. I'll finish this up tomorrow.
1DI0019106	I hope Paulie hasn't injected all our inventory.
1DI0019107	Bannon! Wait for me!
1DI0019108	Oh, boy! I'm hungry.
1DI0019109	Mmm. That smells good.
1DI0019110	I'm going to go play with James.
1DI0019111	Bye, James.
1DI0019112	<burp> Time to go on patrol.
1DI0019113	I think I'll get some air out on the Flight Deck.
1DI0019114	I'm full. Time for a nap.
1DI0019115	I'm getting kind of hungry.
1DI0019116	Think I'll go exploring.
1DI0019117	Good morning, Father Clifford.
1DI0019118	We should go get some breakfast, Father Clifford.
1DI0019119	It's time for our evening meal, Father Clifford.
1DI0019120	We should be heading to the clinic, Father Clifford.
1DI0019121	Angela, let's go up to the Flight Deck. It's more private up there.
1DI0019122	It's late. We should go home, Angela.
1DI0019123	Think I'll go get some lunch.
1DI0019124	Well, if anyone needs me, I'll be in my room.
1DI0019125	That was a fine meal. I've got to get back to my patients.
1DI0019126	Well, Janice, I need to get going.
1DI0019127	Doctor Li, it's been a pleasure, but it's late and I have to go.
1DI0019128	Doctor Preston, I'll be back in a couple of days to visit with your patients again.
1DI0019129	Church services are held every Sunday morning. I hope to see you there.
1DI0019130	Mister Buckingham, it was delicious, as always.
1DI0019131	Vera, it was a feast. God bless you.
1DI0019132	I've heard enough for tonight.
1DI0019133	Think I'll go have some fun.
1DI0019134	Better open up. The breakfast crowd will be here soon.
1DI0019135	I'm beat, I'm going to go take a nap.
1DI0019136	I'm going to grab a bite to eat.
1DI0019137	Time to lock up. Tomorrow starts early.
1DI0019138	Whoa! Almost overslept. Angela wouldn't be happy about that.
1DI0019139	I'm going top side for a while.
1DI0019140	Time to call it a day.
1DI0019141	Time for my walk around.
1DI0019142	Think I'll walk the flight deck.
1DI0019143	I'm bushed. Think I'll turn in.
1DI0019144	Time for the Council meeting. Don't want to be late.
1DI0019145	Time for breakfast. Let's go.
1DI0019146	We'll be late for church. Hurry up.
1DI0019147	I'm off to work.
1DI0019148	I need to run up to the tower for a few hours.
1DI0019149	Quittin' time. I can't wait to get home.
1DI0019150	Quitting time. I'm heading home.
1DI0019151	<yawn> Time to go to bed.
1DI0019152	I'm done, mom. I'm going to go play with C.J.
1DI0019153	I'm done, mom. I'm going to go play.
1DI0019154	I've got to go home, or my mom will kill me.
1DI0019155	Thank you, Cindy.
1DI0019156	I should get back.
1DI0019157	It's getting late. I should go.
1DI0019158	Think about what I've said Ted.
1DI0019159	Someday, maybe I'll get courage.
1DI0019160	Thank you, Father Clifford. I'll think about what you've said.
1DI0019161	Oh! Got to get to the store. Cindy will kill me if I'm late again.
1DI0019162	Oh! Got to get to the store.
1DI0019163	Man, that is some good shit! I am really jazzed now.
1DI0019164	Closing time. I hope Vera waits for me.
1DI0019165	Goodnight Vera.
1DI0019166	Damn. I feel hung over.
1DI0019167	Finally. Time to close shop.
1DI0019168	I suppose I ought to get to work.
1DI0019169	Almost out of caps. I'd better go.
1DI0019170	Time to get drunk.
1DI0019171	I'll get you yet, you bastard.
1DI0019172	Time to go get drunk.
1DI0019173	I gotta go to bed. Gotta sleep this off.
1DI0019175	Where's James? I've got to go find my brat.
1DI0019176	Sit down and mind your manners.
1DI0019177	Don't embarrass me, brat.
1DI0019178	Oh, man. I got the itch. I'm heading up to see Cindy.
1DI0019179	This should do it. Thanks, Cindy.
1DI0019180	Oh, yeah. That's what I needed.
1DI0019181	I should check in with my guests.
1DI0019182	Maybe I'll get Buckingham to fix me something to eat.
1DI0019183	I think I'll just pop up to the Flight Deck.
1DI0019184	I'm getting a chill. I should go home.
1DI0019185	No sign of him, Armitage. Let's look elsewhere.
1DI0019186	Well, he's obviously not here.
1DI0019187	Let's search a different deck today, Armitage.
1DI0019188	I should really begin the search.
1DI0019189	That's what Cindy says too. But I got the itch. I need it bad.
1DI0019190	Thanks, man. I really need this fix.
1DI0019191	Okay, okay! I steal them from Doc Preston. There's an empty room across from the Staley's. I hide them in the file cabinet in there.
1DI0019192	My wife, Cindy. She's always watching the inventory. If I take any, she'll lock me out.
1DI0019193	I live here. It's where I do my work. And it's FAR away from Dr. Li and all those other monkeys dressed up like scientists.
1DI0019194	You made it past my defenses, which proves you aren't a dummy. AND you haven't killed me, so I suppose you aren't here to do that.
1DI0019195	I suppose you can hang around if you want. Just don't touch anything.
1DI0019196	And how! I AM the only one in all of the Wasteland with the skill and the guts to perform facial reconstruction, you know.
1DI0019197	Look. You're different from all those other jerkoffs, so I'll make you a deal. You want a little nip-tuck here and there, I'll do it for ya.
1DI0019198	I'll get to hone my skill, and you'll get the best surgeon around. The likelihood of death by infection at my hands is only... hmm... 35% let's say.
1DI0019199	So, what do you want to look like?
1DI0019200	What do you want to look like?
1DI0019201	The secret kind...
1DI0019202	Well, if you must know... I'm an electrician and computer expert. AND I'm a bit of surgeon. Really, the most gifted scientist you'll find...
1DI0019203	Hmph. I'm the guy that got Rivet City up and running in the first place!
1DI0019204	And after all that Li and her gang of flunkies pushed me out. Ha! Project Purity indeed. What a bunch of morons -- they can't even clean some water.
1DI0019205	We are gathered here today to witness the union of Diego and Angela in holy matrimony.
1DI0019206	They have asked that their marriage be blessed by God and by Saint Monica.
1DI0019207	They have also asked that it be witnessed by their friends and family.
1DI0019208	I now pronounce you man and wife. What God has joined, let no man tear asunder.
1DI0019209	Sir! This slag heap appreciates the intel. Moving to secure the flight deck, Sir!
1DI0019210	Sir, you are not authorized to enter the armory. Sir!
1DI0019211	Please don't make me shoot you, Sir!
1DI0019212	Sir, this slag heap is guarding the armory. Sir!
1DI0019213	I guess. We don't get to talk much. I just wish Diego would notice that I'm not a child anymore.
1DI0019214	Wouldn't you rather be with a real girl? Maybe you should try it before you decide.
1DI0019215	But I did, Doctor Li. I put it right where you told me to.
1DI0019216	Just some water.
1DI0019217	Don't know where he is, and I'm not sure I care. I saw you talking to Bannon the other day. Did he mention me?
1DI0019218	A little. Aren't you? We don't have a place to live, and your father is going to have to support us.
1DI0019219	No, it's not true! Yes, she has been tempting me, trying to seduce me, but I've resisted.
1DI0019220	That is a sin in the eyes of God, Mister Lopez. Surely he has a greater purpose for you. You should speak with Father Clifford.
1DI0019221	Haven't seen you in church, Danvers. How about this week?
1DI0019222	That is a sin in the eyes of God, Mister Lopez. Surely he has a greater purpose for you. Let us pray to Saint Monica.
1DI0019223	You are a drunk and a harlot, Trinnie, but the Lord can still forgive you. Come to church on Sunday.
1DI0019224	Your sins call me down here. Your souls need to be cleansed of the Devil's brew you serve.
1DI0019225	The doctor is fine. If it weren't for her work, Rivet City would be no better than Megaton, Danvers.
1DI0019226	I don't know, what do you want to do?
1DI0019227	Do you have anything to calm my nerves? Paulie keeps trying to get me to try Psycho, but that stuff rots your brain.
1DI0019228	I am doing the tasks I have been programmed for. Currently I am waiting for new orders.
1DI0019229	I am not programmed for visual evaluation. However, Miss Vera tells me that the Iguana is only a day old.
1DI0019230	Certainly, Mister Sister.
1DI0019231	My family is dead and the world is a nuclear Wasteland. What exactly is it that I have to live for, Father Clifford?
1DI0019232	Um...don't do that. That would not be a good idea. Maybe you should talk to Father Clifford.
1DI0019233	Vera! Wonderful to see you. You look lovely today.
1DI0019234	You know I'd do anything for you, Vera.
1DI0019235	No. I don't want you hanging around that little bitch. She and her parents think they are so much better than me.
1DI0019236	Don't be jealous of my wealth. Be jealous of my looks instead.
1DI0019237	You should spend more time on the flight deck, Angela. You look so pale!
1DI0019238	I don't need anyone to take care of me, Seagrave. But I do like being your friend. Just your friend.
1DI0019240	Stop that! You're so stupid. My Mom says you're ugly and a bitch too.
1DI0019241	Maybe A Quick Fix has something that will help you sleep. Cindy's got all kinds of good chems.
1DI0019242	Well, I hope they do something. Remember that child that fell off the deck last year?
1DI0019243	Yeah. Belle's going to have to replace some tables and chairs.
1DI0019244	Really? It's ready? That's great news! I hope there aren't any problems at the Jefferson Memorial.
1DI0019245	Oh, yeah! I heard about that. They're trying to help other slaves escape too.
1DI0019246	Oh my God! Did anyone escape?
1DI0019247	Remember that big explosion on the horizon? I bet that's what happened to it.
1DI0019248	Wasn't he killed by some maniac? Shot right in the head, like he was a Ghoul or something.
1DI0019249	I heard about that! He was shot in the head like he was some sort of zombie. They say that's how you kill a Ghoul too.
1DI0019250	That's why I'm glad I'm in here. Good old Rivet City.
1DI0019251	I heard Danvers has his job now.
1DI0019252	I hope they find someone to fill his shoes soon.
1DI0019253	Yeah. I heard she was drinking river water.
1DI0019254	Yep. I'll take it all. One man's junk is another man's treasure.
1DI0019255	Steal it? Hardly. He runs the council like it's his own personal bank account.
1DI0019256	He's supposed to represent all the market businesses, not just himself. It's about time he was replaced.
1DI0019257	If you had read that letter you'd know I'm no slaver and you know I'm not dealing with them.
1DI0019258	But if that letter gets out, they won't trust me. I'll never get a seat on the council and Bannon will make me pay for trying to replace him.
1DI0019259	If you care about Rivet City half as much as I do, tell Danvers that Bannon is blackmailing me, but don't show her the letter.
1DI0019260	Suit yourself. Sooner or later everyone has stuff to unload that only I will take.
1DI0019261	You don't. No guarantees in the Wasteland. No rebates or exchanges either.
1DI0019262	Oh, and you break it, you buy it.
1DI0019263	A what?
1DI0019264	Look, if you just want to crack wise, go somewhere else. But if you've got stuff you want to sell, then I'm your man.
1DI0019265	Well, I'm not open just now, but I will be by daybreak. Stop by.
1DI0019266	Oh, really?
1DI0019267	If someone took your stuff, go get it back. If they shoot at you, shoot back.
1DI0019268	Otherwise, I've got to see it for myself before I'm gonna do anything.
1DI0019269	Today we hear the story of Saint Monica.
1DI0019270	She was born in Great Lanta on the shores of the Ocean.
1DI0019271	Her parents were both Ghouls. Yes, that's right, I said Ghouls.
1DI0019272	That she was conceived at all was a miracle. That she was born unafflicted was an even greater miracle.
1DI0019273	God tested Saint Monica. She did not lead an easy life.
1DI0019274	Sold into slavery by Raiders, she was forced to sell her body.
1DI0019275	They took her only son, Ehren, from her and sold him.
1DI0019276	She prayed every night to God for his safety. She did not pray for herself, although her burden was great.
1DI0019277	Each night she would preach the word of God to the Slavers.
1DI0019278	After sixteen years, God provided a miracle.
1DI0019279	One of the Slavers repented his wicked ways and helped her to escape.
1DI0019280	Four years she looked for Ehren. Four years she wandered the Wasteland.
1DI0019281	God looked over her in those years.
1DI0019282	When she found her son, she found he was a wicked man.
1DI0019283	Ehren had overthrown his masters and taken their place. He was an owner of men.
1DI0019284	Ehren took his mother to be his slave, even knowing who she was, for Ehren blamed her for his painful early life.
1DI0019285	Each day Ehren would think of a new and wicked trial to put her through.
1DI0019286	She would only smile at him and say, "I forgive you."
1DI0019287	Each morning she would be miraculously healed as if nothing had happened.
1DI0019288	When Ehren truly realized her love and God's love was boundless, he flung himself at her feet and begged for Saint Monica's forgiveness.
1DI0019289	Ehren released all of his slaves, and they rejoiced.
1DI0019290	He repented all his wicked ways.
1DI0019291	Who among us is without sin? Who among us can claim to be innocent?
1DI0019292	Come, brothers and sisters, let us pray to God and Saint Monica for deliverance from our sins, as Ehren was delivered from his.
1DI0019293	Amen. Let us pray.
1DI0019294	You're kidding right? Flak and Shrapnel's, in the market. I'm Shrapnel, you idiot.
1DI0019295	Ain't seen many of those around lately. They're tough to come by.
1DI0019296	Said like a soon-to-be-dead Wastelander.
1DI0019297	Ain't worth the ammo. Just walk away before security hauls you away.
1DI0019298	I'm short on time and your five minutes are up. See ya.
1DI0019299	Are you making fun of my name? It's a damn good thing for you this place is crawling with security. Otherwise I'd kick your ass.
1DI0019300	Smart move. What did you want?
1DI0019301	You got that right. My James sure is.
1DI0019302	I'll be in the Muddy Rudder later. Stop by and we can have a drink together.
1DI0019304	Sit down and buy me a drink.
1DI0019305	Oh really? My husband ran off and got himself killed, and left me to raise his little brat. So don't you tell me how I should or shouldn't be.
1DI0019306	What a load of crap. Obviously you've never had to take care of some squealing little brat.
1DI0019307	Figures.
1DI0019308	I'm going to the Muddy Rudder for a drink later. If I see you down there, you can buy me a drink.
1DI0019310	You should buy me a drink now.
1DI0019311	Just make it quick. There's a bottle with my name on it.
1DI0019312	Yeah. That's James. My own little trouble making brat.
1DI0019313	I'd sell him to you if they'd let me.
1DI0019314	Unless you've got any more personal questions, I'm busy.
1DI0019315	All right! You and me, just hangin'.
1DI0019316	You mean, like fix stuff? Nah.
1DI0019317	I just hang out, dude. I've got enough chems to last a while. Oh, yeah!
1DI0019318	Whoa! Dude! You don't have to get all in my face.
1DI0019319	I'll just make myself scarce.
1DI0019320	No point in getting all worked up. I get three squares, I got a place to crash, and nothings trying to eat me.
1DI0019321	Chief Harkness meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss security matters.
1DI0019322	It's a waste of a good Monday morning if you ask me. They should just let Chief Harkness call the shots.
1DI0019323	Chief Danvers meets with Doctor Li and Bannon to discuss how to run this tub.
1DI0019325	Doctor Li, Chief Harkness and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
1DI0019326	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean. Far more than Seagrave Holmes.
1DI0019328	I can be very influential, if you know what I mean.
1DI0019329	Doctor Li, Chief Danvers and I are all on the council. We meet every Monday morning.
1DI0019333	Bannon and Doctor Li and I all meet on Monday mornings to talk about city wide issues.
1DI0019334	It's pretty informal. The council doesn't have much real power.
1DI0019335	I thought I saw her and James heading to the gate bridge.
1DI0019336	They know better than to cross over though. It's dangerous out there.
1DI0019337	I thought I saw them running over the bridge.
1DI0019338	It couldn't have been them though. Children aren't allowed over there alone.
1DI0019339	Yeah. I caught them trying to sneak over the bridge.
1DI0019340	Children aren't allowed to leave without an adult, so I chased them off.
1DI0019341	Same thing happened a few months ago, but they found a way to get over there anyway. I hope that hasn't happened this time.
1DI0019342	Christie told me they were missing. I'll alert the rest of the security guards.
1DI0019343	Henry told me her and James were missing. I'll have security keep an eye out for them.
1DI0019344	I heard she and James were missing. I'll have security keep an eye out for them.
1DI0019345	You mean that brat my James hangs around with?
1DI0019346	No. I'm not surprised they've gone missing. The two of them are always causing trouble.
1DI0019347	You brought her back to me!
1DI0019348	Thank you for saving my little girl.
1DI0019349	Thank you for finding C.J.
1DI0019350	I was worried sick about her.
1DI0019351	I'm collecting artifacts. Historical artifacts. Um...all sorts of things from old DC.
1DI0019352	It's important work. Because...well, it just is.
1DI0019353	It's some sort of museum that nutjob Abraham Washington runs.
1DI0019354	Oh, yes. She's crazy about him.
1DI0019355	He keeps telling her no, but he also spends a lot of time with her. It's really not fair to her.
1DI0019356	Haven't you heard? They're going to get married!
1DI0019357	It's so wonderful. We haven't had a wedding in years.
1DI0019358	That poor girl. Diego told her to never bother him again. She was devastated.
1DI0019359	Yeah, I know. Thank God he's a priest. At least I know nothing's going on between them.
1DI0019360	Father Clifford would kick him out of the priesthood if he ever found out.
1DI0019361	Mooning over him? Not any more. She's going to marry him! I'm so happy for my little girl.
1DI0019362	Father Clifford caught the two of them rutting like Brahmin.
1DI0019363	Thank God Diego has enough good sense to make an honest woman of her.
1DI0019364	Mooning over him? You have old news, my friend. She married him! They are such a happy couple.
1DI0019365	That coward! He told her to stay away from him. She still cries about it at night. It's a good thing I would never hurt a priest.
1DI0019366	Well, one of us is. Sometimes it seems like he doesn't even know I'm there.
1DI0019367	Oh, my God! It was so romantic.
1DI0019368	Diego has left the Church. We're going to get married!
1DI0019369	Someone told Father Clifford that Diego and I were...you know.
1DI0019370	Father Clifford expelled Diego. So now we can get married!
1DI0019371	It's true! I'm so happy. Diego is a wonderful man.
1DI0019372	That rat bastard! I hate his guts.
1DI0019373	He told me to leave him alone. He won't even talk to me about.
1DI0019374	What are you talking about? I'm a man of the cloth! Well, I will be as soon as Father Clifford...
1DI0019375	Nevermind. It doesn't matter what Angela thinks. Soon I will take vows of chastity.
1DI0019376	I...I don't know what came over me. I just lost control and seduced her.
1DI0019377	But I am an honorable man. I will make her an honorable woman. We're going to get married.
1DI0019378	I thought I would be more upset about leaving the church, but she makes me so happy.
1DI0019379	Father Clifford accused me of having relations with Angela. He wouldn't listen when I told him it was a lie.
1DI0019380	I am no longer an acolyte. I've been expelled.
1DI0019381	Sometimes when God shuts one door though, he opens another.
1DI0019382	I've asked Angela to marry me, and she said yes.
1DI0019383	Oh, yes! I had to give up being a priest, but it was worth it.
1DI0019384	That is a thing of the past. I told her to stay away from me forever.
1DI0019385	What! If that's true, I'll defrock him. Not only is he fornicating, but he's doing with such an innocent, young girl.
1DI0019386	You mean that he's left the priesthood? Yes.
1DI0019387	They are going to get married. Well, at least I get to perform the ceremony.
1DI0019388	I was forced to expel him from the priesthood. It's a shame really. He would have made a fine priest.
1DI0019389	And Diego has done the right thing by asking her to marry him. Thank God for that.
1DI0019390	Yes, I did. It was a beautiful ceremony.
1DI0019391	Unfortunately, I am now short one acolyte. But this was God's will. I'm sure it's for the better.
1DI0019392	The poor dear. I wish there was something I could do to help her.
1DI0019393	That boy ought to just give her a tumble. It would be good for both of them.
1DI0019394	Disgusting, isn't it? Someone should talk to that boy. He has no business hanging around that tramp if he's going to be a priest.
1DI0019395	She's not very social. Stays in her lab in the stern.
1DI0019396	She's smart though. Real smart.
1DI0019397	She's one of the members of the Council. Runs the science lab here. Don't bother her unless it's important.
1DI0019398	Her lab is in the stern end of the ship.
1DI0019399	She's some sort of genius. You know. One of those egg head scientist types.
1DI0019401	She's certainly head and shoulders above most everyone else around here. Though that's not saying much.
1DI0019402	The Muddy Rudder. Belle waters down the liquor, but it's cheap. It's on the lower deck.
1DI0019403	Try the Muddy Rudder. They don't ask too many questions down on the lower deck.
1DI0019404	The Weatherly Hotel is a good choice. It's on the upper deck.
1DI0019406	The Upper Deck people have more money and influence than those that live on the Hangar Deck.
1DI0019407	Some of the upper deck citizens can get pretty snobby about it.
1DI0019408	That's just folks blowing off steam.
1DI0019409	Every place has it's haves and have nots. We got Upper Deck and Hangar Deck.
1DI0019410	Don't let it bother you.
1DI0019411	The people that live on the Hangar Deck are the great unwashed masses.
1DI0019412	I read that somewhere. Do you like it?
1DI0019413	Anyway, they need true leaders, like myself.
1DI0019414	We do the best we can to take care of everyone on the Hangar Deck.
1DI0019415	It's not their fault they can't do better for themselves.
1DI0019416	The Hangar Deck people should know their place.
1DI0019417	Leave the thinking to people who are qualified.
1DI0019418	It's a sad state of affairs, but the people that live on those two decks don't trust each other.
1DI0019419	The Hangar Deck folk believe the Upper Deck people are keeping them down.
1DI0019420	The Upper Deck citizens believe the Hangar Deck people aren't capable of managing Rivet City.
1DI0019421	It's a shame really. Everyone should just get along.
1DI0019422	It's not too bad now, but if it keeps going this way, in a few years they'll start fighting in the streets.
1DI0019423	Father Clifford keeps preaching about tolerance and acceptance, but nobody seems to be listening.
1DI0019424	Damn Upper Deckers. They think they're better than us. Well, screw them.
1DI0019425	Yeah, the folks on the Upper Deck think pretty highly of themselves. They think they're better than us.
1DI0019426	Well, we do all the work, and they keep all the good stuff. Assholes, every one of them.
1DI0019427	What did you say about my mother? You... you take that back!
1DI0019428	Poor James. His mother drinks too much. When she does, she doesn't treat him very well.
1DI0019429	Personally, I think she blames him for his father leaving her, which is ridiculous.
1DI0019430	James' mom, Tammy, is a real bitch. She treats him like crap.
1DI0019431	I think it's because she drinks too much.
1DI0019432	That poor child. His mother, Tammy Hargrave, is a very troubled woman.
1DI0019433	She spends too much time down in the Muddy Rudder, drinking and using foul language.
1DI0019434	I feel so sorry for him. I think CJ is a good influence on him, but I do worry about the two of them.
1DI0019435	He's trouble, that's what he is.
1DI0019436	I don't trust him, and neither should you.
1DI0019437	His mother is a drunk. Spends all her time in the Muddy Rudder.
1DI0019438	No. Interesting.
1DI0019439	Never look a gift slave in the mouth, I say.
1DI0019440	Yes, I know. I've been counseling him for some time now.
1DI0019441	He used to go stand on the observation balcony all afternoon. He's down to only a hour or so at three o'clock.
1DI0019442	He's totally strung out. It's going to kill him one of these days.
1DI0019443	Oh, yeah. He's a mess. I'm glad I'm not in Cindy's shoes.
1DI0019444	He's hopeless. I have to keep him away from the shop or he'll rob us blind.
1DI0019445	One of these days he's going to end up dead.
1DI0019446	Yeah. He comes by every night around closing time and tries to get Cindy to let him close up.
1DI0019447	Thank God she's smarter than that.
1DI0019448	Rivet City is one of the few bastions of civilization left in the land. We're working to rebuild our society; to make the world livable again.
1DI0019449	We're the safest, most secure city in the Wasteland. Nothing can get in here without our say so.
1DI0019450	It's a boat. A really big boat.
1DI0019451	It's a place to live, safe from Raiders and Super Mutants.
1DI0019452	With Doctor Li on our side, maybe we can even begin to rebuild the world.
1DI0019453	It's noisy, dark, and smelly.
1DI0019454	But we're safe here. No Super Mutants or Raiders. And maybe Doctor Li will find a way to get clean water for us.
1DI0019455	She is the patron saint of lost children. Very popular among the faithful of Rivet City. I'm surprised you've never heard of her.
1DI0019456	If you want to hear her story, it will be the topic of my sermon on Sunday. Services begin at 8 am. You should come.
1DI0019457	Saint Monica saved her own son's soul from eternal damnation.
1DI0019458	She is now the patron saint of lost children for the faithful everywhere.
1DI0019459	You really should come to church on Sunday mornings. The sermon will be all about Saint Monica.
1DI0019460	Shut up, butt wipe.
1DI0019461	Stop saying that, butt face.
1DI0019462	Oh, yeah? I'll show you! I'll show all of you. My mother will be sorry.
1DI0019463	Oh! We forgot to invite you! You should come. Be at the church by 3 o'clock tomorrow.
1DI0019464	The happy nuptials are at three tomorrow.
1DI0019465	Young people. They make such a spectacle out of everything.
1DI0019466	Who gives a crap. I've got better things to do a 3 o'clock tomorrow. Are you going to order a drink or not?
1DI0019467	We haven't had a wedding in Rivet City in I don't know how long.
1DI0019468	Be at the church at three tomorrow. That's when the ceremony starts.
1DI0019469	At 3 o'clock tomorrow. Everyone in Rivet City is invited. I'm sure that includes you.
1DI0019470	Tomorrow at three. You can come if you like. We've invited everyone in Rivet City.
1DI0019471	You'll have to be at the church by 3 o'clock tomorrow. Don't worry. There will be plenty of seating.
1DI0019472	If you want a good seat, get to the church before three tomorrow.
1DI0019473	They grow up so fast, don't they.
1DI0019474	Angela and Diego. It's about time, don't you think?
1DI0019475	I think I heard the ceremony is at 3 o'clock tomorrow. That's when I'm going to show up anyway.
1DI0019476	Those brats are going to tie the knot tomorrow. I think it's at three.
1DI0019477	Marriage is for saps, anyway. She'll be sorry. You watch.
1DI0019478	At 3 o'clock, tomorrow.
1DI0019479	I can hardly wait. I'm so happy for Angela.
1DI0019480	Whoa! Why is the room spinning?
1DI0019481	You're nice. I can tell you a secret. I'm drunk. No, that's not the secret. I have another secret.
1DI0019482	Now that's what I like in a man. Enough caps to buy a lady a drink.
1DI0019483	I guess you're okay. Thanks for the drink.
1DI0019484	You're a real friend. My real friend.
1DI0019485	Tightwad!
1DI0019486	No! Wait, I didn't mean that. Please, mister? Just one drink.
1DI0019487	Bitch!
1DI0019488	These guys won't buy me a round. Just one? Please?
1DI0019489	I know where Belle keeps her stash. But she doesn't know I know.
1DI0019490	She keeps it under her bed. Real original, huh?
1DI0019491	I think I need to puke.
1DI0019492	Diego, will you take Angela for your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward...
1DI0019493	for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish until death do you part?
1DI0019494	Angela, will you take Diego, for your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward,
1DI0019496	We're the lucky ones. We don't have to fight just to survive.
1DI0019497	We have normal jobs. I clean the halls. It might not look like it, but you should have seen it before.
1DI0019499	Is that it then?
1DI0019502	Yeah? Well... well... so's your face!
1DI0019503	Yeah? Well it just so happens that I like being number two around here. So I think I'll just stay right where I am.
1DI0019504	Too young? Too young? I am so sick of everyone around here pulling that "You're too young" crap with me.
1DI0019505	I'm tired of it. I'm old enough to take Dave's place. I'll win that election and show everybody.
1DI0019506	Yeah! I'll show him! And when I'm in charge, everyone will have to say I'm as good as Dave. Better, even.
1DI0019507	You are? Excellent. It's good to see that the Wasteland has finally recognized the sovereign Republic of Dave.
1DI0019508	If the people of the Wasteland are generous and respectful, I might deign to annex them.
1DI0019509	You do that. Personal note: remind the guards to fire on sight.
1DI0019510	Ahh... another victim of persecution seeking protection from the mighty Republic of Dave. We get a lot of that here.
1DI0019511	I'll agree to harbor you for now. However, in exchange, you will reveal the secrets of your former nation to me or face exile.
1DI0019512	Don't waste my time. I've got important things to do around here.
1DI0019514	How much radiation have you been exposed to? Not the butterfly, you moron. I meant the kind of leader that holds his office for life.
1DI0019515	My father inherited his political power from birth and renamed this great nation the Kingdom of Tom.
1DI0019516	Although I also inherited my political power from my father when I took over I formed a Republic so the people may elect their leader.
1DI0019517	First off, you will address me as Mister President. Always. No exceptions.
1DI0019518	Secondly, after careful consideration, the Office of Immigrant Affairs reports that we've already exceeded our quota for immigration this year.
1DI0019519	Appication denied. You have 24 hours to leave the Republic, or face deportation.
1DI0019520	Dictatorship? You insult me. Obviously the Wasteland radiation has taken away your capacity to reason.
1DI0019521	Ah, a seeker of knowledge, then? Well, trust me, an election is what separates a president like myself from a monarch like my father.
1DI0019522	Well then, there you go.  An election is what separates a president like myself from a monarch like my father.
1DI0019523	What am I supposed to do?
1DI0019524	Go see the guard at the front gate and schedule an appointment or something like everybody else does.
1DI0019525	Hmm... now that you mention it, the President could use a new hunting rifle.
1DI0019526	Tell you what. You find me a serviceable hunting rifle, and I'll grant you special asylum within my Republic.
1DI0019527	Or, you can just pay the 250 cap tax on "unwanted refugees."
1DI0019528	A donation, huh? Well, it just so happens that the Republic of Dave does grant special asylum to its supporters in times of crisis.
1DI0019529	A one-time refugee tax of 250 caps should be enough to handle the administration costs of letting you stay.
1DI0019530	Or, you could always find the President a new hunting rifle. I lost the last one when I was out stalking Mirelurks.
1DI0019531	Have it your way. You'll never leave the Republic. Alive, that is.
1DI0019532	Very well. I look forward to it, future refugee.
1DI0019533	Yes, this will do nicely. Congratulations, you are now an official refugee of the Republic of Dave.
1DI0019536	Then you have 24 hours to remain in the Republic or face execution. Enjoy your stay.
1DI0019539	Ah-ha! Just what I'd expect a spy to say! Look, I don't know how you got in here, spy, but there will be consequences for your actions.
1DI0019540	It is unacceptable for you to enter the Capitol Building without an invitation!
1DI0019541	If the Capitol Building does not meet your incredible standards, feel free to escort yourself out.  In fact, just leave now.
1DI0019542	Assassin?  And you really thought you could succeed against the Army of Dave?
1DI0019543	The President of the Republic does. Now get out of my sight.
1DI0019544	The Department of Tourist Rights has declared a tourism embargo that affects the entirety of the Republic of Dave.
1DI0019545	You have 24 hours to return to your home nation or face "accelerated" deportation.
1DI0019546	I can't believe it's only a couple of days away.
1DI0019547	Glad to hear that.
1DI0019548	Crazy how it sneaks up on you, y'know?
1DI0019549	That's none of your business.
1DI0019550	Um, yeah.
1DI0019551	Was I supposed to do it?  I didn't hear Dave saying we had to!
1DI0019552	Yeah, but it'd be better if I could vote.
1DI0019553	Ugh why can't I just vote now?
1DI0019554	Santa Claus.
1DI0019555	Um, I guess so.
1DI0019556	Don't talk to me that way.
1DI0019557	I told you not to talk to me like that.
1DI0019558	Or else what?  Yeah, thought so.
1DI0019559	Shut up.
1DI0019560	You've wasted enough presidential time. Be gone.
1DI0019561	Yes, you do.
1DI0019562	Yeah, and I have to get back to work.
1DI0019563	Man, I hate the graveyard shift.
1DI0019564	I like playing Republic. I always get to play as Dave!
1DI0019565	Here, I'll take you to him! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
1DI0019566	I like playing Republic. Even though stupid Ralphie always gets to play as Dave!
1DI0019567	Here, I'll take you to Dave! Just be sure to call him Mister President Daddy. He likes that!
1DI0019572	I keep telling you, it's Mister President! Now get back to guarding the gate!
1DI0019573	Okay, I'll take you, but President Daddy doesn't always like new people.
1DI0019574	OK, this way.
1DI0019576	Okay, come with me.
1DI0019578	Okay, follow me.
1DI0019580	President Daddy, there is a Wastelander who wishes to see you, sir!
1DI0019581	Strangers need to stay outside or get permission from President Daddy! Else the Army of Dave will shoot you!
1DI0019582	This is the Republic of Dave, duh! It's named for President Daddy! But you have to talk to him if you want to stay here.
1DI0019583	We're the Republic of Dave. Or we used to be anyway.  You have to go now.  Dave isn't here anymore to talk to you.
1DI0019584	Okay. Just don't hang around the fence. President Daddy's guards don't like that.
1DI0019585	He's the president of the Republic of Dave, duh. You can ask over at the Museum of Dave if you don't believe me.
1DI0019586	But you can't just wander around here, you need to go get permission from President Daddy first!
1DI0019587	I'd never really thought about that before. Why do you ask?
1DI0019588	Great! What do you have?
1DI0019589	Oh, wonderful! I'd be happy to accept your contribution on behalf of the Republic!
1DI0019590	And Dave just increased the budget for the museum this year, too! I was going to buy books for the children, but this is far more important!
1DI0019591	Sir, everything here is authentic! Dave said so himself!
1DI0019592	Get out of my museum before I call for the Army of Dave!
1DI0019593	That's alright. I'm used to the children asking funny questions, anyway.
1DI0019597	I'm going to win this.
1DI0019598	Hmm. I suppose voting for Dave is the patriotic thing to do.
1DI0019599	All done! Dave is the best!
1DI0019600	Fingers crossed.
1DI0019601	Good luck, Dave. You have my vote.
1DI0019602	Ah, Dave. Lead our Republic to glory!
1DI0019603	Let's see what we have here.
1DI0019604	A vote for me...
1DI0019605	And another vote for me...
1DI0019606	A vote for Rosie?
1DI0019607	Bob!?
1DI0019608	Wait a minute, has somebody tampered with the ballot box?
1DI0019609	Hmm... after counting the votes, the president is...
1DI0019610	Well, looks like another triumphant victory for myself.
1DI0019611	Well, despite the hiccup, it looks like I am still declared the winner.
1DI0019612	ROSIE? Rosie can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
1DI0019613	BOB? Bob can't be president! NO! This is unfair! This can't be! FINE! I'm LEAVING! See how you people do without me! Enjoy your new president!
1DI0019614	Leave me alone, Flower. I'm thinking.
1DI0019615	Can't you see I'm doing important things?
1DI0019616	For crying out loud, Flower, I'm busy.
1DI0019617	Fine, in a little bit. Geez.
1DI0019618	Can't right now. Why don't you ask Mary?
1DI0019619	I bet Ralph isn't doing anything, why don't you ask him?
1DI0019620	Sorry, kiddo, I'm too busy right now.
1DI0019621	Why don't you ask Rachael if she can play?
1DI0019622	Hmm, maybe you're right.  More trouble than it's worth.
1DI0019623	Yeah, and like Dave says, freedom is the most free freedom that we have!
1DI0019624	You know what, you're right. I'll give it a shot. It's like, my duty, isn't it? Yeah...
1DI0019625	What? Stupid? Well... I guess this was all just a joke to you. You've had your fun, now leave me alone.
1DI0019626	You're right! Dave's just been pushing me around. It's time for a change.
1DI0019627	Awww... I hate class... I want to go play!
1DI0019628	Oh, crap, I forgot to do my homework on the Pledge of Allegience to Dave.
1DI0019629	Yay, class! Isn't Shawna pretty?
1DI0019630	But I already know everything about Dave...
1DI0019631	Uh... he asked Tom really nicely?
1DI0019632	He used a gun! Guns solve all problems!
1DI0019633	Pitchforks and fire, like in the pretty books Daddy has!
1DI0019634	I thought grandpa Tom just gave Dave the Republic...
1DI0019635	He was ugly, and stupid, and mean!
1DI0019636	He didn't acknowledge truth, justice, or the will of Dave!
1DI0019637	He wasn't as pretty as mommy number one or mommy number two!
1DI0019638	But I thought grandpa just got really, really old...
1DI0019639	Yesterday!
1DI0019640	Was it... uh... man... I knew it this morning...
1DI0019641	Whenever Daddy says it was, teacher!
1DI0019642	It wasn't very long ago... I think I remember...
1DI0019643	Ha! Ha! Rachael's in trouble!
1DI0019644	Why am I always picked on in class? Make someone else do it!
1DI0019645	Aww... do we have to?
1DI0019646	I'm gonna ace this one!
1DI0019647	Alrighty, Miss Shawna-Teacher!
1DI0019648	Why does Daddy need merits? Can't he just be Daddy?
1DI0019649	Nobody except me. Why would the people need anyone else but Dave? I give them all that they ask for.
1DI0019650	An opponent? Seriously? But... but... Wait. No, this is a free republic.
1DI0019651	Let the people make their choice. I am confident that they will recognize me as their true and proper leader.
1DI0019652	So I've heard. She couldn't possibly think that she'd be better than Dave.
1DI0019653	Wow, really?  I've always said that she'd make a great leader, and we've never had a woman lead us before...
1DI0019654	He is? Wow... Dave must be upset.
1DI0019655	Wow, this is the first time we've had so many choices!
1DI0019656	Poor girl doesn't stand much of a chance, does she?
1DI0019657	Hmm, I don't know that he stands much of a chance against Dave.
1DI0019658	Isn't he a bit young? I mean, Dave's been running the Republic since before Bob was born...
1DI0019659	Wow, what's going on in this town?
1DI0019660	Only Dave. He's the only person who ever runs.
1DI0019661	I can't be the president, I'm just a kid!
1DI0019662	I'm too young!  I can't even vote yet.
1DI0019663	I don't think anybody is even allowed to run against Dave.
1DI0019664	Absolutely not. In fact, I'd vote for Dave twice if I could.
1DI0019665	No way!  You'd have to be crazy to run against him.
1DI0019666	Keep your voice down! I'm not really comfortable talking about it out here.
1DI0019667	Believe it or not, I used to lead a group bigger than this one on an old caravan route.
1DI0019668	I did it for years... and we did pretty well for ourselves.
1DI0019669	But what am I talking about?  Running against Dave would be like betraying him.
1DI0019670	I don't know. Like I said, I don't want to betray Dave.
1DI0019671	Man, I'd love to be the president.  Everybody would have to listen to me or I could just exile them to the Wasteland.
1DI0019672	And the first thing I'd do is make myself the permanent leader so they couldn't vote me out in some other election.
1DI0019673	But there's no need for me to run.  One year Dave is just going to make me the leader, just like my Grandpa Tom did for him.
1DI0019674	Look, I already told you, one day Dave is just going to make me President.
1DI0019675	I'm sorry, but the president must be a citizen of the Republic to run for office.  So you do not qualify.
1DI0019676	Uhm... I don't think you can do that. You'd better ask Dave.
1DI0019677	Did you ask Dave if that's okay?
1DI0019678	Um, did Dave say you could do that?
1DI0019679	Let's get class started.
1DI0019680	So who can tell me how Dave saved the people from the wrath of Tom?
1DI0019681	Somebody name three things Tom did wrong before Dave became the president.
1DI0019682	Anybody know what year Dave took back the government for the people?
1DI0019683	I hope you're paying attention, Rachael. I'll give another pop quiz. I'll do it.
1DI0019684	Remember your homework is to prepare a speech on the "Merits of Dave."
1DI0019685	That would be Bob, Shawna, Jessica, Rosie and myself. In the Republic, if you're old enough to carry a weapon, you're old enough to vote.
1DI0019686	Rosie and Jessica are usually here in the Capitol. Bob usually hangs out outside near the Brahmin pen.
1DI0019687	Shawna runs the Museum of Dave, so you can find her there.
1DI0019688	Bob still hasn't voted, that dumb bastard.
1DI0019689	Jessica hasn't voted yet.
1DI0019690	Tell Shawna that Dave commands her to vote in the election. She'll come running, trust me.
1DI0019691	Not yet. Rosie still hasn't voted.
1DI0019692	Good, the votes are in. If you'll excuse me, I'll be getting started on tallying the numbers.
1DI0019693	Oh yes, I almost forgot. Here's your caps. Keep this up and I may deign to make you a citizen, in a few years.
1DI0019694	I know that. The people will see the results shortly, I assure you.
1DI0019695	The people have re-elected me as their president.
1DI0019696	It's great to see the democratic process at work.
1DI0019697	Rosie somehow came up with the most votes.
1DI0019698	There must be some kind of bug in the voting system.
1DI0019699	Somehow Bob won the election.
1DI0019700	I should have known the little bastard was conspiring against me.
1DI0019701	There was a tie.  Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
1DI0019702	Under these unique circumstances, I'll have to remain the leader until we know the results for sure.
1DI0019703	Are you kidding? Dave is dead. How can there be an election with a dead candidate?
1DI0019704	Oh yeah? What about it?
1DI0019705	The election is still going on. What do you want to know?
1DI0019706	Me? I'm not sure if I can help you...
1DI0019707	I'll help you if I can.
1DI0019708	Election time is always exciting around here.
1DI0019709	Dave won again? Well, he's the best choice.
1DI0019710	He did?  Wow, I'd of never guessed that possible.
1DI0019711	Yes, but it's still quite a shock.
1DI0019712	I won it? Are you sure?
1DI0019713	Oh man, I can't believe it. I won't let the voters down, I promise!
1DI0019714	I can't believe my ears.
1DI0019715	I didn't win it, huh? Well, there'll always be other elections.
1DI0019716	There'll always be other elections.
1DI0019717	Dave won it I'm sure.
1DI0019718	Rosie won, huh? She better not try and boss me around, that's for damn sure.
1DI0019719	I knew I'd win it.
1DI0019720	Now I just got to name this place after me.
1DI0019721	Who needs it. I'd prefer to be second in command anyway.
1DI0019723	Why, did Dave get too old?
1DI0019724	Did Dave win it again? I'd have voted for him if they'd let me.
1DI0019725	Did Dave win it again? I voted for him you know.
1DI0019726	Rosie's going to be the new leader? What will Dave do?
1DI0019727	He actually won?
1DI0019728	Already did my part.
1DI0019729	You're right, I'll go right now.
1DI0019730	I went and voted.
1DI0019731	I guess you're right, I'll go right now.
1DI0019732	But I did already!
1DI0019733	Oh no, Dave sent you to tell me that didn't he? I'll go right away I promise.
1DI0019734	I'm so sorry, I'll go right away I promise.
1DI0019735	Who the hell made you the boss?
1DI0019736	Anyway, I did it already.
1DI0019737	Fine, I'll get it out of the way.
1DI0019738	Of course I voted. I was the first to vote. Now I'm just waiting for the rest of the votes to come in.
1DI0019739	Oh, yes. Everything here is from Dave's adventures in the Wasteland, before he founded the Republic.
1DI0019740	Just for you, I'll start the our right now!
1DI0019742	I give a tour every day starting around 2pm. You should stop by then!
1DI0019743	Well, good for you then.
1DI0019745	Sure, honey.
1DI0019746	Oh, great.
1DI0019747	How very Dave-like.
1DI0019749	Alright.
1DI0019752	Alright sure, why not. The people have a tendency to wait until the last minute to vote, but I'd just like to get it over with.
1DI0019753	I'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today so I cinch the victory.
1DI0019754	Not that I have anything to worry about. The people know who their leader is in this Republic.
1DI0019755	I told you before: I'll spare a few caps if you just tell each of the adults to get over to the voting booth sometime today.
1DI0019756	There's Jessica, Rosie, Bob, and Shawna. I already voted.
1DI0019757	Then you are hereby exiled from the Republic of Dave.
1DI0019758	Leave within 24 hours, or I will have you executed by firing squad.
1DI0019759	The Republic of Dave does not recognize the rights of Mirelurks or the sovereignty of any Mirelurk nation.
1DI0019760	Your asylum is hereby revoked. You have 24-hours to leave the Republic of Dave or face execution.
1DI0019761	My assistance? Hmm... I suppose I can spare a few caps from the Department of Foreign Relations budget. Here.
1DI0019762	In a few years, I might annex your village to the Republic of Dave. Until then, you are free to exist in my fair nation as a refugee.
1DI0019763	Interesting... um... well, the Republic of Dave is glad to welcome a former Vault citizen to our fair nation.
1DI0019764	You hereby are granted asylum within the Republic of Dave. Just don't get on my bad side, refugee.
1DI0019765	Well, the Republic of Dave is the only true sovereign nation in the Wasteland. The only really civilized place left in the world.
1DI0019766	One day, all wastelanders will be citizens in the republic, and know the greatness of their president.
1DI0019767	We have plenty of food and water here, and the compound is fairly safe. I'm glad the children can be raised here, away from the Wasteland.
1DI0019768	I'd like to see more trading done with the local caravans, but Dave's afraid their outside influence could weaken the Republic.
1DI0019769	Dave is a great leader. He's going to bring civilization back to the Wasteland. One day, they'll say it all started here.
1DI0019770	Dave is in charge. When he's not around, I'm in charge. If you want anything else, go to the Museum of Dave on the left side of the compound.
1DI0019771	The Republic of Dave offers a rich history rivaling that of the great nations before the war.
1DI0019772	President Daddy is awesome! He buys all sorts of neat toys that we get to play with!
1DI0019773	I want to be like Shawna when I grow up. She's smart, just like mommy! Course, daddy is smarter. Like, way smarter.
1DI0019774	I don't like mommy number two. What's wrong with just one mommy? But President Daddy says he needs two mommies...
1DI0019775	Everyone says that daddy is the best man, ever ever. I don't know, but that's what Shawna says, so I guess it's true.
1DI0019776	That's right. As president, I am head of the Department of Tourist Rights, the Office of Immigrant Affairs, and the Bureau of Davelike Activities.
1DI0019777	My proudest duty, second to the presidency, is commander-and-chief of the Army of Dave--the most ruthless military in the Wasteland.
1DI0019778	That's President Dave to you, Wastelander. Call him by his full name, or we'll shoot you.
1DI0019779	He takes care of all of us, even that selfish Rosie and her brats. My children will be a lot nicer than hers.
1DI0019780	Dave is a good man. He looks after all the children and makes sure they have plenty to do. He's bought a lot of toys, not that he'd admit it.
1DI0019781	He has our Shawna teach classes to the younger ones. She's over at the Museum of Dave to the west of the Republic.
1DI0019782	Dave made me Second-Commander of the Army of Dave, and that means I get a gun. Don't make me have to use it.
1DI0019783	President Dave is the savior of the Wasteland, bringing peace and order to the savages man has brought upon himself.
1DI0019784	If you would like to learn more, please stop by the Museum of Dave's official tour at 2 PM.
1DI0019785	He's my daddy! Whenever we play republic, I get to play as Dave!
1DI0019786	Watch, watch! "I am sorry sir, but I am afraid that the Bureau of Davelike Activities has ordered your execution!"
1DI0019787	Aren't I good? Huh?
1DI0019788	He's my daddy. He and mommy number one fight sometimes, probably cause of mommy number two.
1DI0019789	Daddy! President Daddy to you! <giggles>
1DI0019790	Daddy? He's not so bad. Shawna says he's the most important man to ever walk the Wastes.
1DI0019791	I don't know about that. The Wastes are awfully big.
1DI0019792	Of course. As President of the Republic, I have a mandate to repopulate the Wasteland.
1DI0019793	Well, yes. Dave and I were married when he was wandering the Wasteland, before inheriting the republic from his father Tom.
1DI0019794	After Ralph was born, Dave said that the President of the Republic needed to repopulate the Wasteland. So now, we have a second wife. <sigh>
1DI0019795	First wife! Rosie is the second wife, since she's the oldest and not good for anything anymore!
1DI0019796	Dave revised the restrictive marriage laws of the Kingdom of Tom shortly after the Republic was formed.
1DI0019797	Multiple marriages is now considered one of the great free freedoms of the Republic of Dave.
1DI0019798	Yes he does, and they're both pains in my ass. Always got to keep them in line or else they get all teary.
1DI0019799	I have one mommy. The other lady is Jessica. She's pretty, but she's mean.
1DI0019800	Uh huh. Mommy number one and mommy number two.
1DI0019801	I like mommy number one better. She's been my mommy longer.
1DI0019802	That's what President Daddy says, but I only remember having the one mommy before.
1DI0019803	Uh huh. Doesn't everybody?
1DI0019804	Not much to say really. Dave was my husband for many, many years.
1DI0019805	Not much to say really. I'm Dave's wife, or first wife I guess. I've lived here for many years now.
1DI0019806	Years ago, I freed these poor people from the wrath of Tom, former monarch of the Kingdom of Tom.
1DI0019807	Afterwards, the people naturally elected me as their president, and the Republic of Dave was formed.
1DI0019808	All I have to say is Dave is my husband. Mine, do you understand? I don't care what Rosie has to say about it.
1DI0019809	Just because Rosie used to be this big leader out in the Wasteland, she thinks she's better than me. She even ordered Dave around once!
1DI0019810	All you need to know is that I'm second-in-command next to Dave, so don't bother me.
1DI0019811	And don't talk to Rosie or Jessica either. Those are Dave's wives and they have work they need to do.
1DI0019812	Me? I just run the museum and teach classes to the little ones. You know, truth, justice, and the will of Dave...
1DI0019813	I'm gonna be president when I grow up!
1DI0019814	Dave's my daddy! He's the bestest daddy ever!
1DI0019815	I like to play with the toys in the museum, but Shawna always yells at me.
1DI0019816	President Daddy says I sleep too much, but I don't sleep much at all!
1DI0019817	So, I'll just get started on the tour of the museum then.
1DI0019818	To my far right is the baby carriage that our great leader slept in as a newborn baby. Unlike most babies, he never cried and his poop didn't stink.
1DI0019819	Dave had 8 siblings and made his own baseball team. The team was so good, in fact, the Wasteland team was so scared it never showed up to compete.
1DI0019820	The briefcase is the very one Dave took with him when he became fed up with the poor ways that his father ran the nation.
1DI0019821	Dave brought back many items from the Wasteland. It was artifacts like these that amassed the Republic's great wealth.
1DI0019822	Dave collects many war collectibles, including holotapes and war weaponry.
1DI0019823	This globe represents the whole planet that Dave traversed. Don't let its size fool you, the world is at least fifty times bigger than this.
1DI0019824	I don't know who put that tire there.
1DI0019825	These weapons were used against the USA before the bombs fell. Dave probably acquired these when he walked to China.
1DI0019826	Dave is a world-renowned marksman, known for shooting an apple out of the hand of a Raider from across the Potomac.
1DI0019827	Mounted to my left is the very head of the slain Deathclaw that Dave encountered during his quest through the Wastes.
1DI0019828	I know what you're thinking, and no, that's not a Brahmin skull. Brahmin have two heads, so there'd have to be two skulls for it to be Brahmin.
1DI0019829	Please, no touching.
1DI0019830	And that's the tour! I hope you enjoyed it!
1DI0019831	Here's a menu.
1DI0019832	If I must.
1DI0019833	For you, I always offer my best price.
1DI0019834	Straight to the point. I like that.
1DI0019835	What'll you have?
1DI0019836	Commin' up.
1DI0019837	We've got all kinds of chems.
1DI0019838	Need to do some killin' eh?
1DI0019839	Here is our menu, sir.
1DI0019840	Here is our menu, ma'am.
1DI0019841	Let's get high.
1DI0019842	After what you did? Only because I have to.
1DI0019843	Anything for you! You sure fixed Bannon good.
1DI0019844	I've got a little bit of everything.
1DI0019845	Whatchya lookin' for?
1DI0019846	Take a look at our menu.
1DI0019847	Please place your order.
1DI0019849	Let's have a look at it.
1DI0019851	I saw your capture, and a little cleverness allowed me to follow your captors. I only wish I could have arrived sooner to aid your escape!
1DI0019852	As I owe you my freedom, I felt it was only fair that I return the favor. After all, I know no-one else in this world.
1DI0019853	You were my rescuer and my only connection to this world, so I felt compelled to see you safe.
1DI0019854	If this is what you think of me, perhaps I should not have bothered. But I know no-one else in this world.
1DI0019855	Yes... and a most fascinating one at that. This technology is amazing.
1DI0019856	Imagine the evil that can be eliminated with such tools!
1DI0019857	I appreciate the offer, but I must decline. I have an entire world to explore, and I must not be delayed any further.
1DI0019858	I have read about a great museum of history to the south. Perhaps I will head there.
1DI0019859	Goodbye, my friend. Perhaps I will join you in the future, if your goals are virtuous enough to draw me away.
1DI0019861	It seems I didn't know you as well as I had thought. My mistake.
1DI0019862	I've read about a museum of history in the south. Perhaps I can learn more about the world there, without facing such enmity.
1DI0019863	I will take my leave of you. Goodbye, my rescuer.
1DI0019864	Not this time, muties!
1DI0019866	Affirmative! Engaging!
1DI0019867	Ten-four! Going weapons hot!
1DI0019868	Roger that! Firing!
1DI0019870	Commencing attack!
1DI0019871	Target locked! Attack!
1DI0019872	Hot lead outbound, yes sir.
1DI0019873	Lock and load!
1DI0019874	Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.
1DI0019875	I see 'em!
1DI0019876	Yes sir!
1DI0019877	Over there... get 'em!
1DI0019878	Spread out and flank 'em.
1DI0019879	Targets engaged!
1DI0019881	It's go time!
1DI0019882	Kick ass!
1DI0019883	Yeah! Tear them apart!
1DI0019884	Over there! Get 'em!
1DI0019885	Don't let 'em get away!
1DI0019886	Take 'em down!
1DI0019887	Woohoo! I love this shit!
1DI0019889	Flank 'em!
1DI0019890	I've got your back!
1DI0019891	We'll get 'em.
1DI0019893	Where?
1DI0019894	Like I told ya man, I don't fuckin' know where it came from. But it freaks the boys out. Some story from a while back, 'bout a stranger with no name.
1DI0019895	Just... get rid of the damn thing. Ain't no good gonna come from keeping it around. Besides, if it is.. his. Maybe he'll come back for it. Comprende?
1DI0019896	We're back.  Somebody open up the... Hang on, something' ain't right here.
1DI0019897	Who there?
1DI0019898	Humans.
1DI0019899	Humans who?
1DI0019900	Kill the humans! Kill them all! Aggghhh!!
1DI0019901	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh... oh... ha ha ha ha ha ha.... That a good one! Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0019902	I'm hungry! I need something to eat. Meat would be good... A Brahmin head, roasted just a bit, with some...
1DI0019903	This is boring.  We should be collecting more humans. We need more of us! The bucketheads have killed too many...
1DI0019904	Have you found green stuff? I haven't found any. Ever. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe we're wasting our time. We could be out killing...
1DI0019905	I need a new gun. I want something that won't break. Something that will shoot forever. One of us had... a Fat Man! I want one of those...
1DI0019906	Wish I had a new weapon. Something good to smash with. Wish I could hold one of those Behemoth clubs. So big! So much crush!
1DI0019907	I was thinking. And it hurt! Hurt my head! But I remembered things. From before... I think I knew a woman. Or maybe, I WAS a woman... Aggh! It hurts!
1DI0019908	I was just wonderin'... What are you doing? Something good? Something fun? Me, I'm bored. Need somebody to kill. Or something to eat...
1DI0019909	I have joke for you. Ready? Knock knock.
1DI0019910	Shut up, you stupid! Leave me alone! All you do is complain!
1DI0019911	I don't know! What do I look like, a human? Talk, talk, talk! That's all you ever do!
1DI0019912	Huh? What are you, some kind of human? Why you care? Shut up and go away!
1DI0019913	Umm... Well... Ahhh... Sure...
1DI0019914	Ha! You talk a lot! Sound funny when you talk, like a stupid human. Ha ha ha ha ha!
1DI0019915	<bark> <bark!>
1DI0019921	<bark!> <bark!> <bark!>
1DI0019922	<bark> <bark> <bark!>
1DI0019925	He owns this building. We get our caps from him, and don't you forget it.
1DI0019926	A very well dressed gentleman, when he bothers to get dressed. He hardly ever leaves his penthouse suite.
1DI0019927	He stays in his penthouse suite most of the time. So long as we pay the rent, he lets us live here.
1DI0019928	He's the landlord, although you hardly ever see him. I had to treat him once for bed sores, if you know what I mean.
1DI0019929	Wait...don't tell him I said that.
1DI0019930	Every day it's the same thing. The man has no imagination with his meals.
1DI0019931	But it's his building, so everyday I make that damned "Iguana Bits sandwich, no salt, with a peeled pear on the side. Send it up to the penthouse."
1DI0019932	He is the right lord and master of Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0019933	Or at least that's what my files say.
1DI0019934	It's impolite for a gentleman to talk about himself. But I'd hope this magnificent tower would speak volumes.
1DI0019935	Righto! When I saw this place jutting up out of the horizon, I knew what I had to do! I hired some muscle and we got this place fixed up right quick.
1DI0019936	I had the great fortune to run into Mr. Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done, doesn't he?
1DI0019937	Then it was a matter of getting the right type of tenants with the right type of assets, and the rest is, as they say, history.
1DI0019938	Yes. The healing art is a rewarding occupation. Is there something I can help you with?
1DI0019939	Your taste in shopping venue is impeccable. How may I assist you?
1DI0019940	Very kind of you to say so. Thank you!
1DI0019941	I see, sir. Very well. May I pour you a drink?
1DI0019942	With my fashion sense and your bottlecaps, there's no limit to what we can do for your image! I can't wait to get started!
1DI0019943	I say! Must you be so caustic? Come now, a lot of work went into turning this husk of a tower into a place people can call home.
1DI0019944	I've had help, of course. Especially in Mr. Burke, an absolute gem of a man. He certainly has a way of getting done what needs to get done.
1DI0019946	Fine. Keep wearing that trashy outfit. I don't care. You probably couldn't afford to upgrade your look anyway. Ah, I could have made you fabulous.
1DI0019947	It isn't cheap to live here. Is there something you want?
1DI0019948	You wouldn't know true value if it slapped you in the face!
1DI0019950	Most people consider mistreating food service providers as an invitation to get a little something unexpected in their meal.
1DI0019951	Of course, I will do nothing of the sort.
1DI0019952	Rubbish! You must be daft. Look around! Where else in the Wasteland have you seen such magnificence, I ask you?
1DI0019955	Look, if you don't care about yourself, then no one else will. And nothing says "I love me" better than a fabulous new look. Am I right? I'm right.
1DI0019956	You should take more interest in your well-being. Carelessness leads to the spread of disease. Is there something you need?
1DI0019957	Just try not to break anything, okay?
1DI0019959	Well. Like I said. Take a seat anywhere, except at Mister Tenpenny's table.
1DI0019960	Fine. Bye.
1DI0019961	Hold on there a minute. Oh all right. I'll let you in, but if Tenpenny hollers because he isn't expecting you, you're dead.
1DI0019962	Unsolicited callers are not generally welcome. Have a nice day. Goodbye.
1DI0019963	Welcome to Tenpenny Tower! Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0019964	Follow me.
1DI0019966	Alright. One moment.
1DI0019968	Yes ma'am.
1DI0019969	Why, anything I want, dear boy. Anything I want... Wasteland safari. Very relaxing.
1DI0019970	Why, anything I want, dear girl. Anything I want... Wasteland safari. Very relaxing.
1DI0019971	It's named after Allistair Tenpenny, who runs this building. Got a bunch of rich guys that pay him to live in it.
1DI0019972	We're here to make sure that people like you don't mess up his deal.
1DI0019973	I'm not a tour guide.
1DI0019974	Some might say Tenpenny Tower is my crowning achievement. But no! No no! My dear boy, it is just the beginning!
1DI0019975	Some might say that Tenpenny Tower is my crowning achievement. But no! No no! My dear girl, it is just the beginning!
1DI0019976	I only carry the finest garments.
1DI0019977	My Boutique has many unique items for the discerning customer.
1DI0019978	What are you in the mood for?
1DI0019979	Enjoy the holiday discount, compliments of Mister Tenpenny!
1DI0019980	And what will our most distinguished guest be having today?
1DI0019981	I have an excellent selection of thirst quenchers.
1DI0019982	I have some first aid supplies I can sell.
1DI0019983	I guess we could do a little trading. Here's what I got.
1DI0019984	Here's what I got.
1DI0019985	I am Cerberus! It is my solemn duty to guard the citizens of Underworld against any and all threats, both foreign and domestic!
1DI0019986	So yes... I'm the guard dog.
1DI0019987	You're standing in front of the Citadel, headquarters to the Brotherhood of Steel. Capital Wasteland detachment.
1DI0019988	What do you need to find?
1DI0019989	I can help with that. What do you need?
1DI0019990	As if we didn't have enough to worry about. Their weapons are better; their Power Armor is better. Is their training better? We'll see.
1DI0019991	So they have Plasma weapons! Bah! It's strong technology, I'll give you that, but limited in modability.
1DI0019992	I've already started removing the compensators on our laser weapons to cut through the black devil Power Armor of theirs.
1DI0019993	We'll drop them like any other meat, don't you worry.
1DI0019994	They're sporting some pretty impressive Power Armor, I'll give them that. The Advanced Mark II.
1DI0019995	But's that all right. With a few modifications, our own armor will more than handle anything they throw at it.
1DI0019996	Quite a few, but most are distinctly unladylike, and unworthy of discussion.
1DI0019997	I will tell you that the Brotherhood has encountered the Enclave before, and their motives were just as sinister then as they are now.
1DI0019998	I've read the reports, seen the initial scans. But I can hardly believe it.
1DI0019999	I figured those radio transmissions were just old recordings. Never figured the Enclave would actually show up, in the flesh.
1DI0020000	But don't worry. Whatever they try, we'll be ready for it. I'll lead the Pride to knock them out tomorrow. If my father permits it.
1DI0020001	They're men. They're born, they live, they die. End of story.
1DI0020002	There's meat under that armor, and meat can be ground
1DI0020003	Man, I don't know. Fighting Uglies is one thing, but we've never gone up against anyone that well trained or organized. Even their tech is better.
1DI0020004	Don't get me wrong. The Pride's in it to win it, and I'll go down shooting if I have to. I just hope I don't have to.
1DI0020005	Killing unarmed civilians... Makes me sick. Come over here, try fighting someone who shoots back. Fucking cowards.
1DI0020006	Honestly? I can't wait to see if one of those helmets can stop a hollow-point round at 100 yards. I'm thinking... not.
1DI0020007	You've seen them, so you know what we know. What more is there to say?
1DI0020008	If we can figure out where they're coming from, we might be able to stop them. If not...
1DI0020009	Foul, detestable beasts. They're like an infestation. We cut them down, and they return, again and again.
1DI0020010	Always so determined to kill or capture. But why?
1DI0020011	They're relentless. Like nothing I've ever seen before. I honestly think they see our Brothers in Power Armor as some kind of... canned meal.
1DI0020012	Some of the... pieces... we've had brought back. Men and women ripped in half. Some pulled through their armor. Just horrible.
1DI0020013	The Brotherhood has been battling Super Mutants for decades. First out West, then in Chicago. Now here.
1DI0020014	But this group of Super Mutants is different, somehow. Physically, yes, but mentally as well. If we knew where they came from, we'd know why.
1DI0020015	Not really, no.
1DI0020016	You know how many Uglies I've killed? More than all of Lyons' Pride combined, that's how many.
1DI0020017	All it takes is a loaded weapon and the will to use it.
1DI0020018	Oh, and a good way to get Ugly blood out of your armor. Little bit of Abraxo and some water -- works like a charm.
1DI0020019	Yeah, the city ruins are crawling with them. They've pretty much overrun all of old D.C.
1DI0020020	Do yourself, and us, a favor and stay as far away from there as humanly possible. Definitely no place for civilians.
1DI0020021	Shoot 'em, they die. Stab 'em, they die. Strangle 'em? They die.
1DI0020022	Hell, I've killed more of those yellow Frankensteins than any other member of the Pride. 'Cept maybe Gallows, with those crazy solo night ops of his.
1DI0020023	Man, nothing dies like an Ugly. I once saw Colvin snipe the leg off of one at 200 yards. Thing pirouetted like a figure skater!
1DI0020024	Why you think I ride these Initiates so hard? I make training hell so fighting those Uglies won't be.
1DI0020025	I can tell you that those heavily armored ones, the Masters? They favor heavy weapons -- Miniguns and Missile Launchers.
1DI0020026	My recommendation -- headshot from a distance. Avoid the meat grinder.
1DI0020027	I received word from Elder Lyons. He says that you have permission to trade with us. Good for you.
1DI0020030	What else would I be doing back here?
1DI0020031	It's the best of the Brotherhood, bar none. No one gets in without my say-so.
1DI0020032	Ah, see, the Brotherhood's one thing, but the Pride... Best of the best. Every damn one of us. Hand picked by Sentinel Lyons herself.
1DI0020033	You my friend, are talking about the most elite fighting force ever assembled within the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0020034	Each of us was handpicked by Sentinel Lyons herself. You can't even realize what an honor that is. Sarah defines combat excellence.
1DI0020035	Sarah appreciates my... methods. I fill a role no one else can.
1DI0020036	We're the most elite tactical unit ever assembled in the Brotherhood of Steel, here or anywhere else. Hell, ain't nothin' Sarah's cubs can't handle.
1DI0020037	But of course! With your father's departure from the vault, and Jonas's untimely demise, the Overseer had to take swift action!
1DI0020038	And so he named me the new vault medical practitioner! A marvelous decision, if I do say so myself! I am fully equipped, after all.
1DI0020039	I'm a sniper with the Pride. Put any mutie bastard within one mile of me and my rifle and, well... pack it up troops. Fight's over.
1DI0020040	Colvin thinks he's a better shot. Man's delusional.
1DI0020041	Me? Heavy weapons. Miniguns, Missile Launchers... If it's bigger than a human and goes boom, I'm all over it.
1DI0020042	Hell, I do it all. Recon, demolition, tactical assault. Guess you could say I'm the Pride's jack of all trades.
1DI0020043	Spec ops. Let's leave it at that.
1DI0020044	Tell you what. You deliver that component to Zimmer and tell him the android is dead, and you can consider yourself a member in good standing.
1DI0020045	I am, and have been since we first found him, well over twenty years ago.
1DI0020046	"Liberty Prime" is the designation we found on file for him. Magnificent, don't you think? At least he will be, once all systems are operational.
1DI0020047	It's the energy consumption. Something that big, with such advanced weapons systems... we just don't have the means to power him. Not yet.
1DI0020048	Ah yes. Everyone asks about the robot. Hard not to, I admit.
1DI0020049	His name is "Liberty Prime." Very patriotic. Built by a very proud nation, during a very desperate time.
1DI0020050	We've had about as much success getting him working as they did. You should speak with Scribe Rothchild. He can tell you more.
1DI0020051	I suppose that I can. The Brotherhood can make use of Wasteland currency to trade.
1DI0020053	Ha! With my eyes closed! And I will, too. But it will cost you... outsider.
1DI0020054	Oh, very well. But make haste!
1DI0020055	Could I? Yes. Will I? No. Go see Peabody or Bowditch.
1DI0020056	Oh, well... You see, I am descended from the great Roger Maxson, founder of our order.
1DI0020057	I am the last of his line. They say my soul was forged from eternal steel, but I don't believe that. I'm really just a normal boy.
1DI0020058	I was sent to the Citadel many years ago, to be fostered by Elder Lyons. But that was before the Western Elders lost, um... faith... in the Elder.
1DI0020059	I really don't know if I'll ever get home. But, well... I kind of like it here. Sentinel Lyons has been very kind to me. She's taught me so much.
1DI0020060	Is that so? And why should I believe that? You ever kill a Ghoul before?
1DI0020061	Is that so? Then I'm sure you can handle yourself out there in the Wasteland just fine. Are you done wasting my time?
1DI0020062	Oh ho! Looks like we got a live one here! I think we better leave this one outside. Good bye, kid. Try not to get eaten by anything out there.
1DI0020063	Listen. Like I've told those Ghouls a thousand times, I can't just let in every drifter that lands at the gate.
1DI0020064	You got a reason to be here, or what?
1DI0020065	You're poor, and stupid. Count your damn purse before you go offering people gifts.
1DI0020066	Tell you what. You manage to scrape together 100 caps, and I'll let you in to look around a little.
1DI0020067	Good luck. Try not to die out there.
1DI0020068	Man you're dumb. Find someone who can teach you how to count to 100, then bring me 100 caps and we'll talk.
1DI0020069	Moron.
1DI0020070	You ain't got 100 caps. You ain't getting in.
1DI0020071	Perhaps you'll fit in around here better than I thought. Alright. I'll take your money. But don't press your luck. I got my eye on you.
1DI0020072	Don't bother Tenpenny or the other residents. If you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction... I'll gut you!
1DI0020073	Ummm. No. Unless by "sugar" you meant to sweeten my day with, say, a gift of 100 caps.
1DI0020074	This ain't a goddamn soup kitchen. Sorry, kid. Go find a ditch to crawl into and stop bothering me.
1DI0020075	But, if you manage to scrape together 100 caps, I might let you in to look around a little.
1DI0020077	Maybe you'll fit in around here better than I thought. All right. I'll take your money. But don't press your luck. I got my eye on you.
1DI0020078	And don't bother Tenpenny or the other residents. If you so much as sneeze in the wrong direction... I'll gut you!
1DI0020079	Then you won't be getting past this gate.
1DI0020080	Goodbye.
1DI0020081	This ain't a theme park, kid. And even if it was, you wouldn't be able to afford the admission. Now bugger off!
1DI0020086	You're not getting in. Stop trying. It's not working. I'm done talking to you.
1DI0020087	Good luck out there!
1DI0020088	You're really not in a position to be threatening me. I'm safe on the other side of this wall, and you are out there, exposed and unsafe.
1DI0020089	You have a lot to learn, kid. I think I'll let the Wasteland teach it to you. Try not to die out there!
1DI0020090	What? No, just those damn Ghouls. Sorry, thought you were one of them.
1DI0020091	Ghoul or not, I must inform you that you are trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. Renters and official business only.
1DI0020092	What? Oh. Sorry 'bout that. I thought you were one of those damned Ghouls looking for a handout.
1DI0020093	You are currently trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. You have some reason to be here?
1DI0020094	Oh? Thought you were that damn Ghoul. Well then. Back to business as usual. Ahem...
1DI0020095	You are trespassing on Allistair Tenpenny's private property. Renters and official business only.
1DI0020096	Hahaha! That's rich. What would a man like Tenpenny want to do with a Waste-rat like you?
1DI0020097	Just a minute. Let's not be hasty. If Tenpenny is interested in what you have to say, I suppose you should get your chance.
1DI0020098	Though, he normally conducts all his business through Mister Burke. If Tenpenny doesn't want to talk to you, then you best leave him alone.
1DI0020099	If you bother Mister Tenpenny or any of his residents, I will be very glad to forcibly show you out. Do we understand each other? Good.
1DI0020100	Nice try kid! I know everyone who lives here, even the new ones. It's my job, and I take my job very seriously.
1DI0020101	It's also my job to deal with anyone I consider a threat to Mister Tenpenny or his property. Feel free to stand there all day. I don't care.
1DI0020102	Nope. Now get the hell out of here.
1DI0020103	Hey, aren't you the one who said we shouldn't call her that? That we should show a little respect to the elderly?
1DI0020104	"Old Lady Dithers"? I thought you were the one who said we should be nice, and refer to her as "Ms. Dithers".
1DI0020105	Oh, stop it. You know I don't trust that woman one bit.
1DI0020106	George, honestly. You know I don't like talking to her.
1DI0020107	Mabel, I meant to ask you. Have you seen the new RobCo catalog? I thought you might be interested, since you don't seem to like your Mr. Handy.
1DI0020108	Oh, Mabel. Did you want to look for a new robot? I know you're not comfortable with yours.
1DI0020109	Timmy Neusbaum left his roller skates in my house again. How many times have I talked to Pat about that?
1DI0020110	I'm annoyed, Martha. Timmy left his roller skates in my house again. He needs to learn to pick up after himself.
1DI0020111	Should I invite the Neusbaums over for Bridge, or will you be down in the basement all night again?
1DI0020112	Hi, Roger. Are you planning on spending the evening down in the basement again?
1DI0020113	Good day to you, sir! Everything going well at home?
1DI0020114	Hi, Roger. How are you? And how's that wife of yours?
1DI0020115	Why, hello there.
1DI0020116	What's the good word?
1DI0020117	Hello there.
1DI0020118	What's going on?
1DI0020119	How are you today?
1DI0020120	It's not funny, George. I'm not joking around.
1DI0020121	That's not the point and you know it. Don't try and change the subject.
1DI0020122	Pat, you know as well as I do that she's where most of our news comes from, one way or another.
1DI0020123	Suddenly you don't have an interest in hearing what's going on in town? I find that hard to believe.
1DI0020124	No, no. I don't like robots. Don't like the one I have, and don't want a new one. If I didn't rely on the thing so much, I'd just get rid of it.
1DI0020125	I don't want a new one. I don't even really want the one I have now... I don't trust it, Martha. Not a bit.
1DI0020126	I suppose so. I haven't really noticed.
1DI0020127	Oh, I... It's not really my place to say. I'm sure they're fine.
1DI0020128	Well that's not safe, is it? Someone could really get hurt. It's a shame Pat doesn't teach him to be more responsible.
1DI0020129	Oh dear. Someone could really get hurt. You'd think Pat would have talked to him about it.
1DI0020130	Yes, of course. I'm fine, Janet's fine. Everything is just fine. And... And you?
1DI0020131	Oh, things are great. Just great. Really.
1DI0020132	How could you... Roger, no. This is not the time for that discussion. Please.
1DI0020133	No. Just... no. Now's not the time, Roger. You should know that.
1DI0020134	Yes, dear. Sorry. Is there a problem?
1DI0020135	Okay, okay. Sorry. What's the problem now?
1DI0020136	Well I'm not going to go running off to hear what she has to say today. Now find something useful to do.
1DI0020137	I don't have to like that she's such a busybody, do I? Now leave me alone about it.
1DI0020138	Roger and Janet seem to be getting along better, don't you think?
1DI0020139	So, what do you think of the Rockwells? Seems like things are better between the two of them now.
1DI0020140	You know there's nothing to worry about, right? It's perfectly safe. They build them so they won't ever hurt their owners.
1DI0020141	Really, Mabel. It's fine. There's no reason to feel uncomfortable. It's just another machine.
1DI0020142	I really wish Pat would do something about it. He's a nice boy, but he's just so messy.
1DI0020143	I don't even know if it's worth trying to talk to Pat. Maybe when she steps on one of his toys and breaks her neck, she'll do something about it.
1DI0020144	Good to hear. I'm glad the two of you are doing well, after everything you've been through.
1DI0020145	That's good. We were worried about you two for a while. You deserve to be happy.
1DI0020146	Bet the Commies in China wish they had it as good as we do, eh?
1DI0020147	Makes you proud to be an American, doesn't it.
1DI0020148	It's one of the great things about living here.
1DI0020149	She's been talking to Timmy again. I want him to stay away from her. She's nuts, and she shouldn't be anywhere near him.
1DI0020150	I saw Timmy talking to her again. I don't want him near her, George. She's crazy, and I don't want it influencing him. You need to say something.
1DI0020151	Ha ha. All right, dear.
1DI0020152	Okay, okay! Just having a little fun.
1DI0020153	Well, maybe you feel that way. I really don't like it. What if something goes wrong?
1DI0020154	Just the same, I don't trust it. I swear it watches me sometimes.
1DI0020155	Well, I know I wouldn't want to live anywhere else.
1DI0020156	I'm certainly grateful for everything we have.
1DI0020157	It's a great time to be alive, isn't it?
1DI0020158	Okay, sorry for bringing it up.
1DI0020159	Right. Sorry. I just thought that maybe... Oh, nevermind.
1DI0020160	Okay, I'll have another chat with him about it. I'm sure he was only being polite.
1DI0020161	All right...  I'll talk to him about it. She's harmless, anyway. Just old and senile.
1DI0020162	Oh Mabel, you worry too much. It's fine.
1DI0020163	It's perfectly safe, I'm sure. Everyone here has one, and no one's ever had a problem.
1DI0020164	Well, if you ever have any thoughts about it... You know, if you want to talk, you just let me know.
1DI0020165	I see. Well, I thought you might have some insight. If you notice anything, or want to talk about it, you let me know, okay?
1DI0020166	I got whatever you need.
1DI0020167	Your misery, my wealth.
1DI0020168	Sure, sure, what do you need?
1DI0020169	Let ol' Uncle Ahzrukhal help you get rid of the pain.
1DI0020170	Why, whatever do you mean? I am a simple barkeep, nothing more.
1DI0020171	Certainly, my friend.
1DI0020172	I must ask that you speak to no one about our transactions.
1DI0020173	Ah, back for more... excellent.
1DI0020174	Ah, an educated consumer. My favorite kind. Yes... yes. I think I can help you.
1DI0020175	Simply step over here, my friend and I'll show you my stock of more... potent goods.
1DI0020176	While there is no law in Underworld, per se, I'd rather not end up at the receiving end of an angry lynch mob.
1DI0020177	There is no shortage of do-gooders around here and it would be just like them to take it upon themselves to interfere in a fair business transaction.
1DI0020178	Honestly. I have something to sell, and you want to buy it, now why is that anyone else's business? Hrm?
1DI0020179	As you wish, my friend...
1DI0020180	Oh, now now now, don't be hasty. I'm sure that we can work out a compromise. Here, step this way and let me show you what I have.
1DI0020183	Honestly. I have something to sell, and you want to buy it, now why is that anyone else' business? Hrm?
1DI0020185	Quiet makes people stop drinking. Turn the radio back on.
1DI0020186	Why would you do that? These people want their music.
1DI0020187	Hey! Leave that alone. If I wanted it off, I'd turn it off.
1DI0020189	Thank you. Now leave it alone.
1DI0020190	Now that's more like it. Music makes the sweet sweet and the bitter all the more bitter.
1DI0020191	Stop messing with that radio.
1DI0020192	Hey, leave that radio alone.
1DI0020193	<static>
1DI0020194	No! Not Gob... I'm... I'm sorry... I need some time alone...
1DI0020195	Oh, that's wonderful news! I'm so glad! if you see him, please tell him that his mother misses him and loves him and that I hope he's happy.
1DI0020196	But, he shouldn't come visit. It's too dangerous. No, no. He should stay put where he is.
1DI0020197	You... you what?
1DI0020198	YOU SON OF A BITCH!
1DI0020199	That's... that's terrible. But at least I know he's alive. So that's something.
1DI0020200	If you get up that way again, tell him that I said that I miss him and that I love him.
1DI0020201	But, he shouldn't try to escape. It's too dangerous. No, no. He should stay put where he is. I couldn't bear the thought of him getting hurt.
1DI0020202	We've been together longer than you've been alive.
1DI0020203	It's just... you know, you think that you're going to be with someone forever, and then you wake up one day and they're gone.
1DI0020204	Where do you do from there?
1DI0020205	That's right. Her and I have been together for... oh... about 60 years now.
1DI0020206	But, things haven't really been the same since Gob left. He was like a son to me. I think Greta was always a little jealous of him...
1DI0020207	Oh, that's such a long story. You couldn't possibly want to hear about that.
1DI0020208	Well, okay... but it's nothing special.
1DI0020209	I was born in 2051, so yes, that makes me a pre-war Ghoul.
1DI0020210	I do... I was in a shelter with my father when the bombs hit. In DC, we had the luxury of getting a warning after the west coast was... gone...
1DI0020211	I was just a little girl then. We couldn't afford a space in one of the Vaults. I remember filing down into that shelter, my father rushing me in.
1DI0020212	He stopped to help this one family, and I looked up and called his name... there was a flash of light, brighter than anything you can imagine.
1DI0020213	I woke up a few hours later. The first thing I did was run up to where my father had been. He... he was gone. But the strangest thing...
1DI0020214	There was his shadow, burned into the wall, so crisp and clear like he was standing next to me. The heat had burned it into the concrete...
1DI0020215	The city was on fire for weeks... maybe months, I don't know. I hid down here in the museum... it was the closest building to the shelter I was in.
1DI0020216	But I could hear what was happening above. People howling like animals. Chaos. Looting, killing, it's like every foul thing inside of them came out.
1DI0020217	It was a nightmare... I... I don't want to talk about it.
1DI0020218	I don't know how it happens. Doctor Barrows says it was radiation. All I know is that people kept showing up here in the museum.
1DI0020219	After things calmed down above ground, we tried to live down here as best we could. After a while, things got strange.
1DI0020220	My skin started to get dry and flake off. Everyone's did. It took a while, months, maybe a year. But sooner or later, everyone ended up like this.
1DI0020221	Some of them went crazy. Some of us just accepted it. After a while, other Ghouls would find their way in here and Underworld just sort of grew.
1DI0020222	No one bothered us down here, and we were happy enough to leave them alone. And once my Greta showed up, it was a good enough life for me.
1DI0020223	You tell the same stories for 200 years, you'll feel pretty uninteresting too.
1DI0020224	See, I knew it. I'm really just a boring old Ghoul, I promise.
1DI0020225	Talk. To. Ahzrukhal.
1DI0020226	I said: Talk to Ahzrukhal.
1DI0020227	Don't make me say it again.
1DI0020228	I don't care.
1DI0020233	Not going to talk about it. Don't ask.
1DI0020234	Not your business.
1DI0020235	I think I can help you out.
1DI0020236	Be careful with these. They're not toys, you know.
1DI0020237	Yes, what do you need?
1DI0020238	Very well. What do you require?
1DI0020239	Oh my God! He shot Ahzrukhal!
1DI0020241	To tell you the truth, hon, I don't really know much about it. All I know is that it used to be some sort of exhibit.
1DI0020242	Something about hell or the afterlife or something. Tulip knows that sort of stuff.
1DI0020243	Not like anyone around here ever buys anything from that shop of hers.
1DI0020244	You're in for a treat, the finest food in DC. Four stars.
1DI0020245	Yep. Get it while it's lukewarm.
1DI0020246	Just don't ask what it's made of. You humans seem to have weak stomachs.
1DI0020247	If you're lucky, maybe it's gone rancid already. MmmmMmmmm...
1DI0020248	The Glowing Ones? That's Ethyl. The other one is Meat. They used to be residents of Underworld.
1DI0020249	Doctor Barrows is studying the link between normal Ghouls, Feral Ghouls, and Glowing Ones.
1DI0020250	His research is truly fascinating.
1DI0020251	Why, you'll want to head on over to the Ninth Circle and talk to Mister Ahzrukhal... he... he... uhhh... what was I saying?
1DI0020252	Oh yeah, the generators, I don't know where they are, you'll have to ask Winthrop.
1DI0020253	Ninth Cir- Circle. Talk to Ahzrukhal. And... bring me back something.
1DI0020255	Why yes! Yes I am! And... PROUD! Proud of it! I mean, if I weren't, I'd probably just spend a lot more time cry... crying... you know?
1DI0020256	Here I am... drunk... falling apart -- liter- literally! I lost my damn finger last week! Doc put it back on though... bless him...
1DI0020257	Yeah... it happens... a lot, actuall.. actually. All the time. But I'm getting' better... I think...
1DI0020258	Just keep an... eye out for 'em... but not my eye, those ain't never fallen out yet...
1DI0020259	Really? You... you're alright... you should buy me a drink some time...
1DI0020260	Now... what were you saying?
1DI0020261	Now... there's no need for tha... that... wait... what were you saying? You wanted to talk to me... about something? What was it?
1DI0020262	Well... what... what... do you want to talk about?
1DI0020263	Who, me? Yeah... yeah... I'm fine. I guess. No... Yeah. I'll be okay. I just... I just need to try not to lose any of my parts this time...
1DI0020264	Doc Barrows says that he's... he's getting' tired of puttin' 'em back on... me. So, you know... if you see any, just bring 'em back.
1DI0020265	You sure? Some... some people make me hurt myself... because it makes 'em laugh...
1DI0020266	Yeah... and I ain't had enough liqu- liquor yet to think you.. you're pretty.
1DI0020267	Me? No, not at all. I'm used to your people. Truth is, I spend most of my time away from Underworld.
1DI0020268	Oh, here and there and everywhere. I've explored all up and down the coast, from the Commonwealth, to the Pitt, all the way down to Crater Banks.
1DI0020269	I also do a fair bit of trading. You see, folks here, they don't have much of a connection to the outside.
1DI0020270	So I move their goods and caps out to the Wastes and bring back in what I trade for 'em.
1DI0020271	Suit yourself. But you're missing out. Do you want something else?
1DI0020272	You too, stranger. I know a lot of people around here don't take kindly to humans wandering around, but I've met a lot of your people in my travels.
1DI0020277	Suit yourself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
1DI0020278	Well... yeah. So? What else do I have to do except get high?
1DI0020279	You think that I need to be sober to cut a Ghoul's hair? Half the work is cutting the skin off.
1DI0020280	These guys don't care how they look anyway. They just humor me.
1DI0020281	Yeah, man! That's what I do! I cut hair!
1DI0020282	I know, I know, you look around here and there ain't a lot of work to show off, right?
1DI0020283	These corpses only got half a head of the stuff, so I never get a chance to work on a full head! C'mon! No charge!
1DI0020284	Oh, c'mon! I don't ever get to work on an actual human!
1DI0020285	I'm good! I promise! I'll take a few puffs and I'll give you the best haircut of your life! No charge or anything! It'll be fun!
1DI0020286	I prefer "stylist" myself, but whatever works for you. Everyone has a gift, you know?
1DI0020287	I used to live in Rivet City. Folks there had enough money for me to do okay. But after I... uh... changed, no one would let me touch them.
1DI0020288	I ended up here. Of course, a Ghoul with a barber shop makes about as much sense as a screen door on a submarine so... fuck it.
1DI0020289	I just took up Jet. At least it passes the time, you know?
1DI0020290	I'm not your "boy", Winthrop. What do you want?
1DI0020291	Oh, look, if it isn't my favorite pain in the ass. What can I do for you, Winthrop?
1DI0020292	Have you fixed that other fridge for me yet? Hrm? No? Than I've got no time for you, Winthrop. We'll talk later.
1DI0020293	No time to talk right now, Winthrop. Come back later.
1DI0020294	It's about Patchwork. You need to stop feeding him booze, Ahzrukhal. The boy can barely stand most of the time, and you just keep serving him.
1DI0020295	I want you to stop giving Patchwork booze when he's already drunk. You're gonna kill the boy.
1DI0020296	He's a big boy, Winthrop. As long as he's got the caps, I'm going to sell him booze. I'm here to make money, not to babysit.
1DI0020297	Stop serving him? This is a bar. How am I supposed to make money if I'm not serving booze? If he's got money, I'll give him whatever he asks for.
1DI0020298	And wouldn't it be a shame if your ventilation went down and all of your customers went to Carol's? Just think about it, Ahzrukhal.
1DI0020299	Sure, sure, you're here to make money, and I fix all of your crap so that you can keep right on making that money. What would happen if I stopped?
1DI0020300	Save your threats, old man. You don't have the balls.
1DI0020301	Don't you threaten me. You wouldn't dare do that, these people would have your head.
1DI0020302	I'm not threatening you, I'm just sayin'. No equipment. No business. Either way, my problem is solved. Think about it. We'll talk later.
1DI0020303	Oh, you'd be surprised. I may be old, but this place'd shut down without me. Just think about what I said, we'll talk later.
1DI0020304	Whoa, whoa there. Take your illness away from me.
1DI0020305	Take a step back, there. I don't want your slime on me. Tell you what, another drink should clear that cough up.
1DI0020306	You should see someone about that cough. In the mean time, keep your distance.
1DI0020307	Sounds like you need some of Akzurkhal's special cough medicine.
1DI0020308	You might want to see Doc Barrows about that cough. But have another drink before you do.
1DI0020309	Shame the doc is dead, he could've done something about that cough. Ah well, just have another drink. It'll go away.
1DI0020310	Poor doc Barrows, you people are falling apart without him, aren't you?
1DI0020311	Yes, friend? What brings you to me today? Come on now... spit it out. I haven't got all day.
1DI0020312	What is it? I'm very busy, you know.
1DI0020313	You seem so nervous... relax. It's only me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
1DI0020314	I was wondering if I could get... you know... one of the special drinks.
1DI0020315	I need some of the special stock. You know, the stuff from behind the counter...
1DI0020316	I'm all out of the stuff you sold me yesterday. I need more. Fast.
1DI0020317	Ah, yes! Of course, of course, my friend. See me later tonight. We'll make sure that you have all the pick-me-ups that you need.
1DI0020318	Shhh, say no more. See me later, I'll make sure that you want for nothing.
1DI0020319	No need to be shy, my friend. I'll make sure that you have everything that you ever need, so long as you have the caps to pay for it, that is.
1DI0020320	Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Ahzrukhal! Thank you so much!
1DI0020321	Oh, Mr. Ahzrukhal! I can't thank you enough! It's... it's been so hard lately...
1DI0020322	I... I'll try to wait. You are good to us, Mr. Ahzrukhal. You really are. Thank you.
1DI0020323	Don't mention it, my friend. It's what I'm here for.
1DI0020324	It's nothing, I simply want to ensure that all my friends in Underworld are as happy as can be.
1DI0020325	No thanks are wanted or asked for, it is my humble duty to ensure that you get what you need.
1DI0020326	Oh, don't worry about me. You just go enjoy your drink.
1DI0020327	No need to worry about me, dear. You just go enjoy your food.
1DI0020328	Oh, don't worry yourself over me. I'm just fine. Go talk to your friends.
1DI0020329	I've been better, but I'm fine. No need to worry.
1DI0020330	Oh, I'm doing alright, I suppose.
1DI0020331	I'm fine, I'm just fine. Thank you for your concern. I'm fine.
1DI0020332	What? Oh, I'm fine, Greta. I'm just fine, miles away, you know?
1DI0020333	Oh, Greta, baby. You don't need to worry about me, I was just lost in my thoughts. You know how it is.
1DI0020334	It's more than that, Carol, you've been moping around here for... I don't know how long. The customers have even started to notice.
1DI0020335	C'mon, Carol. It's me, I can see through you. It's gotten so bad that the customers have started to notice.
1DI0020336	Oh, the customers are fine. So long as they've got you to being them food and drinks, they couldn't care less.
1DI0020337	They don't need to worry about me, Greta, and neither do you. I'll be okay.
1DI0020338	I'm worried about you, that's all. Just think about what I said.
1DI0020339	You know that I can't stop worrying about you. Just think about it, okay?
1DI0020340	What now? Oh, I'm sorry Greta, I didn't see you there... did you need something?
1DI0020341	Hrm? Oh, hey Greta... what were you saying?
1DI0020342	I was saying that you need to get some rest. You're falling asleep up here. You never sleep through a whole night anymore. I hear you getting up.
1DI0020343	<sighs> I was saying that you need to get some rest, Carol. You hardly ever sleep at night, don't think that I haven't noticed.
1DI0020344	Oh, Greta, you worry too much. I'm fine, I'm fine. Just have a lot on my mind. It'll pass. Nothing to worry about.
1DI0020345	There's nothing to worry about, Greta. You're so sweet, always thinking about me. But I'm fine, I promise.
1DI0020346	If you say so, Carol.
1DI0020347	I want to believe you, Carol. I really do.
1DI0020348	Alert status: null. Patrol uninterrupted.
1DI0020349	Threat level alpha. Disturbance level zero.
1DI0020350	No news is good news, eh, Cerberus? What about you, how are you doing?
1DI0020351	Well, that's good. That's good to hear, Cerberus. Anything else going on?
1DI0020352	Unit functional. Patrol priority one.
1DI0020353	Command not parsed. Please restate command.
1DI0020354	<sighs>You're a terrible conversationalist, Cerberus.
1DI0020355	I really need to teach you a thing or two about talking to people.
1DI0020356	You really suck at conversation, robot.
1DI0020357	Unit diagnostics system compiling... diagnostics system ready. Running level 2 diagnostics... complete. Report prepared.
1DI0020358	Unit diagnostics... running... running... complete. Report prepared.
1DI0020359	Well, give the report, you old bucket of bolts. I haven't got all day.
1DI0020360	Well? Do you think I asked just out of curiosity? Give me the report, dammit.
1DI0020361	Unit weapon system 2B ammunition level low. Please service at earliest convenience.
1DI0020362	Unit cognition system experiencing fluctuating contact. Unable to determine source of failure.

1DI0020364	Unit locomotion system contains a class two failure. Currently operable. Failure will escalate to class one with a 47% probability.
1DI0020365	Dammit. I thought I fixed that. No time now, resume your patrol Cerberus. I'll deal with it later.
1DI0020366	Damn worthless... it never ends with you, does it? Just resume your patrol, I'll take you offline for service later.
1DI0020367	For Christ's sake, that's the fourth time this month. Just go back on patrol, I'm sure you'll be fine.
1DI0020370	I want you to keep a closer eye on these bastards. I caught one of them trying to swipe some booze from the shelf when my back was turned.
1DI0020371	Look, despite all the grunting, I know you're not stupid. You need to start acting like you have half a brain and keep a closer watch on things.
1DI0020372	I'm getting a bit tired of having to do my job and your job. Watch these drunks more carefully. I'm getting sick of my stock disappearing.
1DI0020373	What do I have you here for? To watch the bar, right? So get your thumb out of your ass and start paying attention to what's going on around you.
1DI0020374	Are you blind? Never mind, don't bother grunting a response. You need to watch these assholes better. Some stuff has turned up missing.
1DI0020375	<growls> Whatever.
1DI0020376	<grumbles> Yeah. Sure.
1DI0020377	... got it.
1DI0020380	I don't know how many times I've told you about this. I don't want to have to do it again.
1DI0020381	I'm getting tired of having this conversation. Let's not go through it again. Got me?
1DI0020382	I'm glad we had this little talk.
1DI0020383	You'd best unfuck yourself, Charon. Or I'll just go ahead and "cancel" our contract.
1DI0020384	Good. I'm glad we're clear on that.
1DI0020388	That little chore, the one we talked about yesterday. I trust that it won't be something I have to hear about again, right?
1DI0020389	I gave you an assignment. I don't have to worry about it not being done, do I? You did do what I asked, yes?
1DI0020390	I want to make sure that we're not going to have another disagreement. You did what I asked you to do, didn't you?
1DI0020391	I've got something on my mind, Charon. I had asked you to do something and you never reported back to me. You did it, didn't you?
1DI0020392	Yeah.
1DI0020394	Did it. Done.
1DI0020395	Already done.
1DI0020396	Yep.
1DI0020397	Good. You know how I hate to worry.
1DI0020398	I'm glad to hear it. I knew I could trust you.
1DI0020399	Good, Charon. Good. I know you wouldn't lie to me. You aren't that stupid. Hahahaha!
1DI0020400	That's my boy.
1DI0020401	Good dog. Keep it up and maybe I'll give you a treat.
1DI0020402	Excellent. I'll have another task for you soon.
1DI0020404	Go away.
1DI0020405	Ask Ahzrukhal.
1DI0020406	Go sit down.
1DI0020407	I was just wondering if...
1DI0020408	I just wanted to know...
1DI0020409	It's just that...
1DI0020410	But...
1DI0020412	I. Said. No.
1DI0020413	Leave me alone.
1DI0020414	Go. Away.
1DI0020415	Some people...
1DI0020416	It was just a question...
1DI0020417	Well, sorry...
1DI0020419	All right, all right, I'll just ask Ahzrukhal...
1DI0020420	Ehn. It's okay.
1DI0020421	It's not bad. Not bad at all.
1DI0020422	It's great! This must be that stuff that Quinn brought back.
1DI0020423	Each one is better than the last.
1DI0020424	It's better than that watered-down piss they pour over at Carol's.
1DI0020425	Liquids aren't usually the way I prefer to fly, but it's not bad.
1DI0020426	That's a good drink, there's no denying it.
1DI0020427	Yes, I am, Mr. Ahzrukhal.
1DI0020428	Dude. Harshing the buzz. Minus five points.
1DI0020429	We'd probably all be better off if the Brotherhood came through here and "purged" us.
1DI0020430	Yeah... every time you start feeling good, life kicks you in the ass again.
1DI0020431	Go away, I'm trying to enjoy myself here.
1DI0020432	Well, aren't you a ray of sunshine?
1DI0020433	Yeah. I ordered it yesterday... I found one of Patchwork's fingers in it. I think I'll avoid it.
1DI0020434	Are you kidding? I wouldn't feed that shit to the dog.
1DI0020435	I'd rather drink malted rat piss.
1DI0020436	It's not half bad, I guess.
1DI0020437	I don't even know what good drinks taste like anymore.
1DI0020438	I've forgotten the taste of good liquor.
1DI0020439	Not, not really.
1DI0020441	Not since the last time you asked.
1DI0020442	Uhm... no. Are you okay?
1DI0020443	Yeah, I wonder what it could be...
1DI0020444	Yeah, that's really weird. Oh well, it's gone now.
1DI0020446	I haven't been able to smell anything for about thirty years now.
1DI0020447	Are you joking? I lost my sense of smell before you even crinkled up.
1DI0020448	Yeah... kinda like onions... that's so strange...
1DI0020449	I'm not really ready to talk about it.
1DI0020450	It's... it's been hard. I... I need to go...
1DI0020451	Thank you, I appreciate it. I can't talk about her. Not now.
1DI0020452	I.... I can't talk about it. Not yet.
1DI0020453	This place just isn't the same without her.
1DI0020454	I don't know, maybe it's for the best. Not that I didn't love her, but this life sucks.
1DI0020455	I miss her too.
1DI0020456	She'll be missed.
1DI0020457	Yeah, now that you mention it. I wonder what's going on...
1DI0020458	Haven't noticed, don't care.
1DI0020459	I don't really pay attention. I only come here because I can't stand the Ninth Circle. That place is just nasty. Even I think so.
1DI0020460	Actually, I haven't noticed. At all.
1DI0020469	This place is coming down around our ears.
1DI0020470	Jesus, this place is falling apart.
1DI0020471	Poor Winthrop, the guy really needs some help.
1DI0020472	One mechanic just isn't enough to keep this place going, I guess.
1DI0020473	If I knew how, I'd give Winthrop a hand, but I have no idea how all of this old junk works.
1DI0020474	It a miracle that some of this shit works in the first place. I guess it's just a matter of time...
1DI0020475	What's new with you?
1DI0020477	What's happening?
1DI0020479	Hey, how's it going?
1DI0020480	How're you?
1DI0020481	Hey, have you heard any news?
1DI0020482	Some people are talking, what have you heard?
1DI0020483	I'm starting to get that funny feeling again, have you heard about anything that might be going on?
1DI0020490	Good morning... I think. Is it morning? I can never tell.
1DI0020491	Mornin'.
1DI0020492	Evenin'. Not that you can really tell down here.
1DI0020494	What do you think?
1DI0020495	Are you kidding? I'm a zombie who lives underground. I think you can guess how I am.
1DI0020496	Fucking terrible, but I won't bother you with the details.
1DI0020497	Look at this place. Look at me. How do you think I am?
1DI0020498	About as good as can be expected.
1DI0020499	I can't complain. Actually, I can, but I won't.
1DI0020500	I'm alright, I suppose.
1DI0020501	Meh. Been better.
1DI0020502	It's been quiet... too quiet.
1DI0020503	It's been too quiet.
1DI0020504	I haven't heard a damn thing.
1DI0020505	I never know what's going on.
1DI0020506	It's been quiet lately. At least, it's been quiet around me.
1DI0020507	Nobody tells me anything.
1DI0020508	Nothing at all.
1DI0020510	I'm still a Ghoul. That's what's happening.
1DI0020511	I'm keeping it together. You know how it is.
1DI0020512	Other than that thing with the Radroaches the other day, nothing at all.
1DI0020515	Sure hon, what do you need?
1DI0020516	Yeah, no problem. What's your poison?
1DI0020517	Of course, what's up?
1DI0020518	No problem, drunky. What do you need?
1DI0020519	That's my job, what do you need?
1DI0020520	No problem at all. What can I get for you?
1DI0020521	That's what I'm here for.
1DI0020522	Give me a beer.
1DI0020523	Beer.
1DI0020524	I'll take a scotch.
1DI0020525	Scotch, straight up. In fact, just give me the bottle.
1DI0020526	If you've got any more of that scotch laying around, I'll take some of that.
1DI0020527	Bring me some of that whisky, you know, the stuff that Quinn got from that guy up north.
1DI0020528	Bring me something brown and alcoholic.
1DI0020529	Kentucky straight. You remember Kentucky? Nah, you're too young.
1DI0020530	How about some of that whiskey?
1DI0020531	I'll take some of that vodka, if you have it.
1DI0020532	I really don't care, just make sure it has liquor in it.
1DI0020533	Bring me something warm and painful.
1DI0020534	I don't care, really. Whatever takes the pain away.
1DI0020535	Sure, if you don't mind waiting a few minutes.
1DI0020536	We just got some more in, I'll grab that for you in a minute.
1DI0020537	I think we can do that.
1DI0020538	Sure, no problem. I'll get it for you in a second.
1DI0020539	One more, comin' up.
1DI0020540	Sure, no problem.
1DI0020541	You're really going for a record, aren't you?
1DI0020542	Sure, no problem... drunk...
1DI0020543	Alright, but if you pass out, I'm just going to roll you into the fire.
1DI0020544	You should take it easy on this stuff. You know that you get all drippy when you're drunk.
1DI0020545	Yeah, no problem.
1DI0020546	You got it.
1DI0020547	I'll just be here sobering up until you get back.
1DI0020548	Relief can't come soon enough.
1DI0020549	Thank you, Greta.
1DI0020550	Thanks, Greta.
1DI0020551	Hungry again? What do you need?
1DI0020552	Everyone's gotta eat, I suppose. What'll you have?
1DI0020553	Just can't get enough, can you?
1DI0020554	Get it while it's lukewarm.
1DI0020555	Yeah, hon, what do you need?
1DI0020557	Yeah, sure, what do you need?
1DI0020559	Sure, kitchen's open. What do you want?
1DI0020560	No refunds if you don't keep it down this time. Now, what can I get you?
1DI0020561	Got any more of that Squirrel-on-a-Stick?
1DI0020562	I'll take some of those Squirrel Bits, if you have any more.
1DI0020563	You got any of Carol's special Squirrel Stew?
1DI0020564	You ever wonder where all those iguanas come from? I do. I guess it don't matter, 'cause they sure are tasty. You got any?
1DI0020565	I could really go for some Iguana. You got any left?
1DI0020566	Doc says I should eat more Mutfruit. You guys got any?
1DI0020567	You got any of those Mutfruits that Quinn brought back?
1DI0020568	Sure could go for some squirrel, if you have any more.
1DI0020569	Hrm... I haven't had noodles for a long time, you still makin' those?
1DI0020570	I could go for some noodles. You got any?
1DI0020571	I'm not sure, I'll go check.
1DI0020572	Sit tight, I'll find out for you as soon as I can.
1DI0020573	I'll go have a look.
1DI0020574	I can go find out for you.
1DI0020575	Yeah... sure. It's your stomach. I'll go find out.
1DI0020576	You must be feeling brave. I'll go have a look.
1DI0020577	Wow. Well, okay. I'll go have a look.
1DI0020578	Oh, awesome. Thank you, Greta. I'm starving.
1DI0020581	I'll try not to starve before you get back.
1DI0020583	Not this again. Look, I've been telling you every day for ten years, if you don't like it, go make your own damn food.
1DI0020584	If you don't like what we have, Crowley, you can always go hunt rats in the tunnels with the ferals.
1DI0020585	If I thought there was a chance that it would be better than this slop, I'd do that. But as it stands, this is my only option.
1DI0020586	Very funny, Greta. I'd happily prepare my own meals if I could ever get anything was wasn't moldy, rotten, or still squirming.
1DI0020587	Well then. What'll it be, Crowley?
1DI0020588	Looks like you're stuck eating our slop then. Now what do you want?
1DI0020589	Well then, what are you complaining about? Oh, I forgot, you're a bitter bastard. Just tell me what you want to eat.
1DI0020590	Fine. I suppose I can choke down some of the squirrel stew.
1DI0020591	Very well, bring me some of that disgusting iguana.
1DI0020592	<sigh> Fine. I'll have the... squirrel. Cooked, please.
1DI0020593	See? I knew you'd come around.
1DI0020594	Sure. I'll get it to you as soon as I can.
1DI0020596	Huh? Oh! Hey Winthrop! How're... how're you? I didn't see- see you there! What's up?
1DI0020597	What... what do you mean? I'm not... I'm not... I'm not even drunk right now!
1DI0020598	C'mon, I'm worried that I'm going to find you dead one of these days. Listen to yourself. You can barely talk. You're a mess, man.
1DI0020599	This is what I mean, Patches. You're a mess. I'm worried about you, man. I really am. You're falling apart.
1DI0020600	Oh... I get it! Ha! Like my name, right? Good 'ol... good ol' Patchwork, always leaving hit bits around town...
1DI0020601	Hahaha! That's... that's funny! Did I ever tell you about how I got my name?
1DI0020602	Alright, I can't even talk to you about this right now. Let's just deal with it later.
1DI0020603	Never mind, man. Let's just talk about this later.
1DI0020604	Oh, okay. Maybe.. maybe we can get a drink after you're done working!
1DI0020605	Okay... bye Winthrop! Let's get a drink later and... and hang out...
1DI0020606	No time to talk now, Winthrop. Too busy.
1DI0020607	Hello, Winthrop. Have a seat, I'll be with you in a minute.
1DI0020608	Welcome! Sit. Drink. Pay.
1DI0020609	Get yourself another drink, you look entirely too sober.
1DI0020610	My friend, you are not drinking nearly enough.
1DI0020611	If you're sober enough to say hello, you're far too sober.
1DI0020612	Less talking, more drinking.
1DI0020613	You look like someone who needs another drink.
1DI0020614	And a hello to you.
1DI0020615	And a hello to you, sir.
1DI0020616	And a hello to you, ma'am.
1DI0020617	Scanning... target identified as "Patchwork". Hello, Patchwork. I trust that all is well with you.
1DI0020618	Scanning... target identified as "Patchwork". Hello, Patchwork. How are you?
1DI0020619	Scanning... target identified as "Winthrop". Hello, Winthrop. How are you?
1DI0020620	Scanning... target identified as "Winthrop". Hello, Winthrop. Que pasa?
1DI0020621	Scanning... target identified as "Winthrop". Hello, Winthrop. How is you- you- your wife?
1DI0020622	Hey, Greta. How's my girl?
1DI0020623	Hello, Greta. You always manage to make me feel a little better.
1DI0020624	Good morning... I think. Is it morning?
1DI0020625	If you need anything, just ask Greta.
1DI0020626	Hello. How is everything?
1DI0020627	Hi there, enjoying yourself?
1DI0020628	I hope that everything is staying where it should be, Patchwork.
1DI0020629	Stop by the clinic, Patchwork. Greta found one of your fingers over in Carol's Place.
1DI0020630	Hello, hello.
1DI0020631	No time to talk now, stop by the clinic.
1DI0020632	Come by the clinic some time, you're overdue for a sewing.
1DI0020633	Hey, hon. I haven't seen you in here in a while.
1DI0020634	Long time, no see.
1DI0020635	Do you ever leave here?
1DI0020636	Yes, yes, hello. We covered that already.
1DI0020637	Yeah, hello. Whatever.
1DI0020638	Yes, yes, hello... I don't know why everyone around here insists on being so damned friendly.
1DI0020639	Can't you see that I'm busy? Leave me alone.
1DI0020640	I'd be much better off if you people would just leave me alone.
1DI0020641	Why, aren't we just the friendliest bunch of walking corpses that you ever did see?
1DI0020642	Oh, please.
1DI0020643	Yeah, I'm okay, Winthrop.
1DI0020644	I'm doin' alright, Winthrop. Just having a rough day, you know?
1DI0020645	Oh hey, Winthrop. Yeah, I'm alright, I just.. err... dropped something around here. Don't worry about me, it'll turn up.
1DI0020646	Oh, not bad. Not bad at all. Everything's where it should be... for now.
1DI0020647	Yep. Keepin' my bits to myself for the time bein'.
1DI0020648	Oh, hello. I'm alright. Still in one piece. Well, except for that one that got away... but I'll find it. No worries.
1DI0020649	Haven't lost anything permanently. Not yet.
1DI0020650	Hey, hello! I just got back! Good to see you!
1DI0020651	Remind me to sit you down and tell you about some of the things that I've seen.
1DI0020652	I'm back! And you wouldn't believe some of the things that happened to me this time. But I can't talk now. Maybe later?
1DI0020653	Hey there, long time, no see! I've got some good stories to tell you later!
1DI0020655	Hey, good to see you! Are you here to buy something?
1DI0020656	Hey there, you should check out the new stuff I have at the store.
1DI0020657	No time, no time. Everything around here is always busted. Can't ever get a break.
1DI0020658	Nope. Not now. Too busy.
1DI0020659	Hooo, sorry. No time to talk. The air circulation system is busted again.
1DI0020660	I can't talk right now, the work never ends around here.
1DI0020661	Hey, do you know how to reroute a fan belt? You know, never mind. I'll do it myself.
1DI0020662	Hey, you.
1DI0020663	That ain't what ... I asked you, stupid... stupid robot.
1DI0020664	I'm doin' fine... fine indeed. How are you? ... I said how are you? What? Are you ignoring me? Stupid asshole robot...
1DI0020665	She's dead, you damn fool robot. Thanks for reminding me.
1DI0020666	She's dead, you know that. Lousy old data tapes...
1DI0020667	Yes, yes, everything is fine.
1DI0020668	Oh, it's great. Everything is perfect. Greta takes good care of us.
1DI0020669	No, not really. To tell you the truth, everyone around here who wants a gun already has one.
1DI0020670	I spend most of my time sitting here reading old stuff I find around here. You end up learning a lot of interesting things that way!
1DI0020671	Well... we spend it at Carol's. Or the Ninth Circle, but I don't like it there.
1DI0020672	The rest we give to Quinn to trade for stuff we need whenever he goes out.
1DI0020673	Well, yeah. There's a lot of old pamphlets and stuff down here. I've pretty much read it all.
1DI0020674	It used to be part of the Museum of History. The exhibit that used to be here was focused on what happens after death: hell and whatnot.
1DI0020675	A lot of it was focused on this old book called "Paradise Lost." It's about a guy who goes to Hell. Pretty interesting stuff.
1DI0020676	I found a big box of copies of the book in one of the back rooms. Here, take one. Nobody around here wants 'em.
1DI0020679	You should read the copy I gave you.
1DI0020680	At first it was just a couple people after the war. This was one of the only places that wasn't falling down or on fire after the bombs fell.
1DI0020681	I think that Carol is actually one of the few that were here then.
1DI0020682	But, over the years, word got around. There had been Ghouls living in little pockets all around. Not really so much anymore.
1DI0020683	Most of them either went feral or ended up here. I'm sure there are still a few out there, but anyone with any sense is in Underworld.
1DI0020684	Not really. The Super Mutants leave us alone. I guess whatever they do that turns people like them doesn't work on us.
1DI0020685	The Brotherhood of Steel will fire on us if we're out in the open, but they don't bother us down here.
1DI0020686	We've had some Raiders and Slavers poke their heads in, but we've got Charon and Cerberus and everyone else to take care of them.
1DI0020687	I guess when it comes down to it, being this far out of everyone's way is a good deal for us.
1DI0020688	Come back any time! It's... kind of lonely down here.
1DI0020689	Yeah, we're a whole city of 'em, actually... wait, you know Gob?
1DI0020690	Yep, I am. Remember: stop by Carol's and let Gob's mom know how he's doin'.
1DI0020691	Now tell me, how is it that you ended up down here in Ghoul central without knowing what a Ghoul is? Huh?
1DI0020692	You know, never mind. I'm a Ghoul. Everyone down here: Ghouls. That's what we are. And before you ask "what's a Ghoul", lemme tell you.
1DI0020693	We're not the walking dead, despite the rotten flesh and the smell. We're mutants... sort of. At least, I think we are.
1DI0020694	You got wax in your ears? We're Ghouls -- mutants with rotting flesh. It's not a big deal, I got used to it. So will you.
1DI0020695	You know, nevermind. I'm a Ghoul. Everyone down here: Ghouls. That's what we are. And before you ask "what's a Ghoul", lemme tell you.
1DI0020697	Smoothskin? You know, because your skin is so smooth... and tasty...
1DI0020698	Relax! I'm just kidding! But I had you going, didn't I?
1DI0020699	You're in Underworld, smoothskin. It's the only safe place for we Ghouls in D.C. We're here, out of sight and out of mind.
1DI0020700	The mutants leave us alone and the Slavers usually don't come this far into the city, so it's not bad.
1DI0020701	Really, the Brotherhood of Steel is the only thing we have to worry about... so long as we don't leave Underworld, that is.
1DI0020702	Bastards. They don't seem to be able to tell us apart from the Super Mutants. Or, maybe they just don't care. They see us and shoot on sight.
1DI0020703	And least they have the common courtesy to miss most of the time. Still... bigots.
1DI0020704	That's right. And so long as you don't bother us, we won't bother you. Feel free to come and go, trade, sleep, whatever.
1DI0020705	Just make sure that you leave whatever trouble is following you at the door, because we don't want it.
1DI0020706	So, enjoy your stay, smoothskin.
1DI0020707	Enjoy your stay. Just... try and keep from shooting up the place.
1DI0020708	We've got a nice little deal going down here. We'd like to keep it nice.
1DI0020709	Megaton! Way up there? I always did wonder what happened to that boy. When he disappeared, I just figured it was the Super Mutants what got him.
1DI0020710	Good to know that he's doin' okay. You should stop by and see his ma over at Carol's place. She'll be happy to hear some news about him.
1DI0020711	You mean... he's a slave? Oh, that's terrible... even still, you should stop by Carol's Place and let his ma know that he's still alive.
1DI0020712	She'll be happy to hear it, even if he's not doing well.
1DI0020713	Me? I keep every hunk of old rusted pre-war garbage around here in operating condition.
1DI0020714	We've got lights, water, and ventilation all running off the old crap they used to keep this place going for the tourists.
1DI0020715	I've managed to keep it going so far, but... well, I'm not sure how long I can keep it up.
1DI0020719	We've scavenged just about all of the scrap metal from all of the places we can safely get to.
1DI0020720	We're scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Hell, not before long, I'm gonna have to disassemble poor ol' Cerberus for parts.
1DI0020721	Hey, you get around, don't you? Tell you what, you bring me back any Scrap Metal you find out there and I'll trade you whatever I can.
1DI0020722	We can work out a trade. We've got some stuff around here that we don't need, but a smoothskin like you might make use of it.
1DI0020723	Well, alright. That's good to hear, stranger. Just come on back to me when you've gathered some Scrap Metal.
1DI0020724	You'll find it just about anywhere -- on junked robots, in old buildings, you name it.
1DI0020725	That's a shame, stranger. A real shame. Let me know if you change your mind, we'll still need the parts.
1DI0020726	Well, we got Stimpaks, but the Doc keeps us healed up, so we don't really need 'em. So I could trade one of those for five bits of Scrap Metal.
1DI0020727	We also got us a TON of RadAway and Rad-X. I mean, what good is it to us? But I'll trade you either one for five bits of scrap. Your choice.
1DI0020728	What? What are you talking about? Do nothing?
1DI0020729	You... you wouldn't dare. I've got... I mean... I'll call for help.
1DI0020734	Haha! You go ahead and try it, stranger. I'll have Cerberus over here to tear your arms off before you even draw.
1DI0020735	Look, you're cute, but you're not the first Waster to threaten me and you won't be the last. Just clear out of town. We don't need your type here.
1DI0020736	Fine, Fine, you asshole. I offered you a fair trade, and this is how it is? Here, take it. Take it all and get the fuck out.
1DI0020737	I never want to lay my eyes on you again, you miserable bastard.
1DI0020738	This is the last mistake you'll ever make! Help! Someone help me!
1DI0020739	You've got a strange way of joking, stranger.
1DI0020740	I was saying that I need spare parts to fix the junk around here, and I'm willing to trade for 'em.
1DI0020741	Hey, you asked. Don't blame me if you don't like what you hear.
1DI0020742	Oh? Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to trade some scrap?
1DI0020743	They why are we even talking about this? I'm very busy, you know.
1DI0020744	I'll trade you five bits of Scrap Metal for a Stimpak, a pack of Radway, or a dose of Rad-X. Easy deal.
1DI0020745	You have? Good. Excellent! We need those parts something awful. This place is falling apart.
1DI0020746	Just come on back and talk to me when you have some parts to trade, we'll work out a deal.
1DI0020747	Oh, good, the vents are rattling again. I need to get up there and take care of it. What do you have?
1DI0020748	And not a moment too soon.
1DI0020749	Really? Great! I can finally get around to patching up the heaters.
1DI0020750	Ten parts, eh? Alright, what do you want in trade?
1DI0020751	Fifteen? Well, alright! A deal's a deal, so what do you want in return?
1DI0020752	Twenty! That's great! I knew this'd work out! Just tell me what you want in return for the parts.
1DI0020753	I didn't expect you to bring back so much! That'll set me up for quite some time. So, what'd you have in mind for payment?
1DI0020754	Alright, sounds good. What to you want for 'em?
1DI0020755	For every five bits of Scrap Metal you give me, I'll give you a Stimpak, some RadAway, or a dose of Rad-X. I need scrap, you need goods. We both win.
1DI0020756	Okay, then. Your call. Let me know when you do.
1DI0020757	Alright, five bits of Scrap Metal for one dose of RadAway. That's a done deal.
1DI0020758	Alright, ten bits of Scrap Metal for two doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
1DI0020759	Alright, fifteen bits of Scrap Metal for three doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
1DI0020760	Alright, twenty bits of Scrap Metal for four doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
1DI0020761	Alright, twenty-five bits of Scrap Metal for five doses of RadAway. That's a done deal.
1DI0020762	Five bits of Scrap Metal for me, one Stimpak for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0020763	Ten bits of Scrap Metal for me, two Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0020764	Fifteen bits of Scrap Metal for me, three Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0020765	Twenty bits of Scrap Metal for me, four Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0020766	Twenty-Five bits of Scrap Metal for me, five Stimpaks for you -- it's been a pleasure doing business.
1DI0020767	One for you, five for me. Use it in good health.
1DI0020768	Two for you, ten for me. Use 'em in good health.
1DI0020769	Three for you, fifteen for me. Use 'em in good health.
1DI0020770	Four for you, twenty for me. Use 'em in good health.
1DI0020771	Five for you, twenty-five for me. Use 'em in good health.
1DI0020772	Can you pay me? Then I can repair your stuff.
1DI0020773	No problem at all, smoothskin. So long as you're payin'
1DI0020774	Just make it quick, I've got a ton of things to do today.

1DI0020786	Well, here we are. Nestled all safe and snug inside Vault 101. It's so cold down here. Colder still with Catherine gone...
1DI0020787	Oh, Catherine.... I so wish you were here with me. How the hell am I supposed to do this by myself? Live down in this hole. Take care of our child...
1DI0020788	But this is our life now, so I guess I'd better get used to it. The Overseer who runs the place is an overbearing bully, but I've dealt with worse.

1DI0020800	You got balls. Real big ones. I'll assume you're kidding 'cause no one shit talks me and lives.
1DI0020801	We Ghouls are just like the rest of you: Shit out of luck and doing our best to make it.
1DI0020802	Sure, whatever you say. You pretentious two-faced asshole.
1DI0020803	Maybe I misjudged. Pardons. So yeah, people treat us like shit. But it just makes us stronger.
1DI0020804	Otherwise we ain't no different than anyone else that had the misfortune to live past infancy.
1DI0020805	Uh-huh? Fine, whatever. Being a Ghoul ain't anything worse than any other thing somebody's got to deal with.
1DI0020806	Like your stupidity, for example. You can't help it. You were born stupid, or dropped on your head as a kid.
1DI0020807	Either way it ain't nothing you can change. So you deal with it.
1DI0020808	Uh-huh. Didn't think so.
1DI0020809	Right. I thought so. I'm warning you. I don't take shit from no one.
1DI0020810	Listen good. I'll say this only once. I can respect a man's privacy. But I don't put up with bullshit.
1DI0020811	Keep to yourself and we'll be fine. Cause any trouble for me or mine, and I'll end you. We understand each other?
1DI0020812	Oh...  my... I guess... I was just trying to be nice. Am I babbling again? I tend to do that when I'm nervous.
1DI0020813	Oh - you don't make me nervous. I mean, Roy says not to show weakness...
1DI0020814	Have you met Roy? He's killed lots of people before.  I'm his gal. He protects me. So better not try anything.
1DI0020815	It's your own funeral then. Just remember that when you die, you die alone. Then you just rot until some jackal comes and snacks on you.
1DI0020816	Harmless? Well, you're lucky I don't stick you and take your shit. Watch yourself, we don't take kindly to strangers, 'specially sweet-talking ones.
1DI0020817	I wouldn't want to see anyone get hurt. You must be pretty tough to get past all the ferals. They tend to leave us alone, but someone like you...
1DI0020818	Am I babbling again? Roy tells me I shouldn't do that.
1DI0020819	Just passing through? That's no way to live your life. You need a purpose. A goal.
1DI0020820	It's the only thing that keeps you from realizing how meaningless this shit-filled existence really is.
1DI0020821	Not much to say? That's good. It'll keep you out of trouble. Be warned: don't cause me or mine no problems, or I'll end you.
1DI0020822	Oh, all right then. Kinda shy aren't you? I don't mind that. It's nice to have someone to talk to who listens, you know...
1DI0020823	Am I babbling again? I tend to do that when I'm nervous...
1DI0020824	Apathy is the death of the soul. It's better to be angry as hell! It keeps things interesting anyway.
1DI0020825	Oh yeah? Is he expecting you? Well then, run along. It's not wise to keep Roy waiting. Has a bit of temper that one. You watch yourself.
1DI0020826	So you you killed a bunch of Feral Ghouls. Is that supposed to sound impressive?
1DI0020827	I got no compassion left for those mindless freaks. But they were a nice deterrent keeping out smoothskin bastards like yourself.
1DI0020828	You mean... you don't want anything for it? I don't have any caps or anything...
1DI0020829	I can just have it? For free?
1DI0020830	You... are you serious? I can't offer anything in exchange, you know?
1DI0020832	I've been drinking whatever I can find, but I can't do it anymore. I need purified water.
1DI0020833	Please... if you find any...
1DI0020834	Please, if you find some... please...
1DI0020835	I knew it was too good to be true... there are no good souls in the Wasteland.
1DI0020836	Go. Just leave me alone to die...
1DI0020837	I... I understand. You have to look out for yourself.
1DI0020838	Just leave me...
1DI0020839	Really? Seriously? My God. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll never forget this!
1DI0020840	Water... precious water... thank you! You're a saint!
1DI0020841	My... thank you. Thank you so much. You've saved my life. Bless you.
1DI0020842	Oh... I guess that's understandable. Got to watch out for numero uno and all.
1DI0020846	You need to drink more. Ha, ha!
1DI0020847	Isn't it obvious? You've run the failsafe, disrupted everything. I have no power over you.
1DI0020848	There's the door. Go.
1DI0020849	Good. I'm getting tired of flapping jaw with you, clown shoes.
1DI0020850	I think I'll flap my balls against Cherry's ass instead! Oh, yeah!
1DI0020851	Motherfucking right you have! He should have known better than to send some clown shoes of an assassin to take me out.
1DI0020852	You mean like hitting on me?
1DI0020853	No. Most of them are polite. Even the ones like Diego that I'd want to flirt with seem to ignore me.
1DI0020854	Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Red. Super fine. Super duper fine. That Wastelander saved me!
1DI0020855	Fine. Fine. I'm all... fine. Super fine.
1DI0020856	Yeah, so did I! You ever think about helping me! Huh!? Asshole!
1DI0020857	I'm having a great time, here, Timebomb. But is everyone always this glum?
1DI0020858	Great, Red. Hey, can I stop by the clinic later? I wanted your help picking my new nickname. You know, for Big Town.
1DI0020859	Come on, Flash. I'm not a little kid anymore. You can stop calling me Sticky.
1DI0020860	Aww, quit it. I'm not a kid anymore! Call me by my real name, would ya?
1DI0020861	Well, you could help ME by resetting the barricades.
1DI0020862	The alignments are all wrong, the walls are too short, and you're stupid-looking.
1DI0020863	Why? Because I'm short? Who are you calling short!?
1DI0020864	Little? Who you calling little! I was running this town long before you guys showed up!
1DI0020865	That sounds fine, Timebomb. Just take it easy when I bring out the surgical tools. I've never heard anyone scream that loud before.
1DI0020866	Not right now, Sticky. I'm a little busy. Can we talk later?
1DI0020867	I'm not sure everyone would agree with you, Shorty. And besides, don't you think the barricades are high enough for you?
1DI0020868	No thanks, Kimba. Could you check in on Pappy, though? He's about as happy as a dead Brahmin lately.
1DI0020869	Pappy, I told you last time and the time before that. It's a scratch. You're not going to die.
1DI0020870	That takes forever, Shorty. Several hours at least.
1DI0020871	I swear it's infected, Red. I think you might need to amputate.
1DI0020872	Do you know how to use it?
1DI0020873	Everyone eventually finds their place in town, Sticky. Don't worry about it.
1DI0020874	Shorty, you were never mayor, remember? The other kids would just pick you up and throw you.
1DI0020875	That's great, Flash. Amazing how you could do that with only 10 bullets.
1DI0020876	We can keep moving the barricades back. That seems to help.
1DI0020877	Hey, Pappy.
1DI0020878	A one-half mile radius? What does that even mean?
1DI0020879	Maybe they'll be scared off by your makeup first.
1DI0020880	Me and my new gun haven't seen anything, Pappy.
1DI0020881	Eh. You people and your demands. "Pay attention on patrol. Set up the barricades. Stop sleeping during your patrol!"
1DI0020882	There ain't much to tell. I used to live out in the Wastes. I was a real bastard back then. But I've put all that behind me.
1DI0020883	Whatever, kid. Whatever.
1DI0020885	When we're done, I may just string you up from your precious purifier.
1DI0020886	Clearly we need to revise our strategy...
1DI0020887	Don't worry, Herbert, he'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
1DI0020888	Don't worry, Herbert, she'll be back. Ha! I love that one... gets me every time.
1DI0020889	See you later... well, maybe not if you do what I've asked.
1DI0020890	Oh okay... I guess me and Bob will see you again soon.
1DI0020891	If you want to go on alone, it's your call.
1DI0020892	Just... don't stir up too much trouble down here, okay? You may be used to the outside, but this is all the world some of us have.
1DI0020894	Yeah, sure, no problem at all.
1DI0020895	No problem, but I'm not going to use any of my stock for parts.
1DI0020896	Yeah, lemme see what you have.
1DI0020897	It started as an idea, really. Remember the Bible passage your mother loved so much?
1DI0020898	Free, clean water for everyone. What a difference it could make in the lives of everyone here in the Wastes.
1DI0020899	Over time, that idea took the form of a purifier. Not like the one in the Vault, though.
1DI0020900	This one was gigantic, capable of purifying millions of gallons of water at once.
1DI0020901	We used the old Jefferson Memorial for the location, right on DC's Tidal Basin. Someday soon, I hope you'll see it work.
1DI0020902	You better get started then. Hurry up! I don't like to wait.
1DI0020903	What are you implying?
1DI0020904	Oh, some other time Sticky. I have plans tonight. How about tomorrow?
1DI0020905	Yeah. We keep moving until there's no space left. Then, it's game over.
1DI0020906	The settlement is so small now. How long are we going to last?
1DI0020907	The barricades should be fine, for now.
1DI0020908	You don't seem to understand. This gun is bad-ass. Yeah!
1DI0020909	Well, I still think it looks pretty bad.
1DI0020910	Stupid looking? What's that got to do with it? And who are you to say that the walls are too short... Shorty?
1DI0020911	That's funny, I thought we were an autonomous collective.
1DI0020912	Oh, that? Come on Red, Pappy's never been happy.
1DI0020913	Yes? What would you like to know?
1DI0020914	You're the only one who can end it. You must end it, don't you see? You're the only one who can disable the Failsafe!
1DI0020915	You can't fool me. You know I'm right... You know none of this is real.
1DI0020916	I'm telling you, this can all end if you find it...
1DI0020917	In the year before you were born, things became difficult.
1DI0020918	There had always been something of a "mutant problem" in the city, but it became worse. They attacked more frequently, and more aggressively.
1DI0020919	Support for the project eroded as time went on, when we couldn't produce any significant results. Progress came to a halt. And then you were born.
1DI0020920	Your mother and I had talked about what to do when that time came, but then I... We lost her, and I had to make a decision. I chose to leave.
1DI0020921	From what I understand, things happened quickly after that. It became too dangerous for the others to stay, and so the project was abandoned.
1DI0020922	Doctor Li and her team left for what became Rivet City, and Project Purity has sat waiting ever since.
1DI0020923	Oh, it's not the past of the city that I dwell upon, but the future of its inhabitants.
1DI0020924	But if you're interested, I believe Miss Weatherly would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
1DI0020926	So? Who cares about that old coot, or his pathetic story? It's people like me that have turned his little "science station" into someplace great.
1DI0020927	Why, I practically set this whole place up. When I got here twelve years ago, it was just a handful of dead-enders squatting in a rusted-out rowboat.
1DI0020928	Now I'm on the council, and with my leadership, we're the strongest settlement in the Wastes!
1DI0020929	Of course, a few of those dead-enders still stick around, but who'd want to leave?
1DI0020930	Well, I could tell you all about my hotel, but I'm sure I don't know anything about how Rivet City itself got started.
1DI0020931	I mean, you hear rumors, and you make guesses, but I really couldn't say I know for sure. And I'd hate to lead you down the wrong path.
1DI0020932	History? What, not enough shit around here already, you need to dig up more?
1DI0020933	Don't know if it ever had an official start. It's just been here forever, stuck in the river and full of assholes.
1DI0020934	Oh, I really wouldn't know. I mean, long as I can remember, she's just been here, soaking up all the repairs and attention we can give her.
1DI0020935	I grabbed a wrench and joined in the reconstruction pretty much first thing out of the womb, but I never really cared about the politics.
1DI0020936	What? I have better things to do than yak about those back-stabbers up topside. Now get going!
1DI0020937	I could tell you all about the science lab, but even though I was here near the start, I can't really help with the details of how it all worked out.
1DI0020938	It all seems like a lifetime ago, and I'm afraid I've had a lot of things on my mind since those early days.
1DI0020939	I don't exactly have time to worry about the history around here, now do I? I've got to worry about what's happening on it now.
1DI0020940	'Fraid I can't help you, pal. Been here for years, but all I know about the history is that it's a safe place to settle down.
1DI0020941	Maybe Bannon can help you out. He sure acts like he knows it all.
1DI0020943	History? Fuck if I know. Hell, fuck if I care.
1DI0020944	Get away. I've got enough to deal with without you wasting my time.
1DI0020945	Yeah, dad built it to fight off the Mirelurks! And mom - she's, like, the Mirelurk queen!
1DI0020946	Yeah, dad built it to fight off the Mirelurks! And that's why they're all gone, now!
1DI0020947	James says his dad built it, but I don't know. I think he's making stuff up.
1DI0020948	James used to say his dad built it. He always used to come up with the best stories.
1DI0020949	Hmm... Despite all my time working here, I've got no clue. Seagrave Holmes is about the only person I know who's more familiar with the place.
1DI0020950	Born and raised on the hangar deck, but don't hold that against him. He can't help where he came from, and his heart's in the right place.
1DI0020951	Y'know, as long as I've been working on this place, and I still really don't have any idea how it got started!
1DI0020952	Oh, I don't know about that. For all I know, it's had survivors on it since the war. I'm just thankful it's here!
1DI0020953	Maybe if you ask Bannon. He's been simply wonderful on the council, so I'm sure he'd be glad to help with your question.
1DI0020955	If it hasn't got to do with the science quarters, I'm probably not the one to ask. And Doctor Li's so busy, you really shouldn't disturb her work.
1DI0020956	If it hasn't got to do with the science quarters, I'm probably not the one to ask. I hardly ever get out, now that Doctor Li's gone.
1DI0020957	Oh, I'd like to help, I really would. But I don't know the first thing about this place's history.
1DI0020958	Don't let my age fool you; I may have been around for a while, but I didn't spend all that time here!
1DI0020959	Sorry, but I don't really know much about it. More worried about what's going wrong with the here and now, see?
1DI0020960	Huh? History? What history? No history here, man.
1DI0020961	Huh? History? What history? No history here, girl.
1DI0020962	Well, I don't really know, to tell the truth. How does any city get started, really?
1DI0020963	But I've heard Bannon talk about how he was responsible for its success, so I'd ask him about it.
1DI0020965	I know a lot of places opened up when they got the hydroponics bay working, but that's hardly the start of it all, is it?
1DI0020966	Actually, Vera Weatherly might know more. She's always here and talking with folks, so if anyone's picked up a story or two, it'd be her.
1DI0020967	I hardly even get out of the galley, so I really can't say I know much, there.
1DI0020969	I heard the place was settled by mercenaries who used to scavenge DC. But I don't really know.
1DI0020970	Dude, I only just got here, myself. Ain't nothing I could tell you.
1DI0020971	Lady, I only just got here, myself. Ain't nothing I could tell you.
1DI0020972	I... I don't really know anything about that. I'd appreciate being left alone, please.
1DI0020973	Why bother? There's never anything good in the past.
1DI0020974	Just leave that sort of thing alone.
1DI0020976	I can give you a history of every fight in this place, but a history of the city? I got nothing.
1DI0020977	Belle's probably heard stories, but be careful asking about them. People like their privacy, y'know? Otherwise, you might end up as history.
1DI0020979	Can't help you with the history, honey.
1DI0020980	No. No, you can't.
1DI0020981	It's funny, now that you ask... I can tell you all about the Capital, but I really haven't got any idea about Rivet City itself.
1DI0020982	I can't see how important it is compared to the Capital's history, but maybe Bannon might know something. He's in the governing council, after all.
1DI0020984	Frankly, it sounds just you're thinking too small, when you could ask about the much more important history of the capital!
1DI0020986	But if you're interested, I believe Miss Weatherly or Mr Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
1DI0020988	But if you're interested, I believe Mr Bannon would be glad to speak with you on the subject.
1DI0020989	I heard tell the place used to be run by Raiders, until someone cleared the whole place out. But I don't really know for sure.
1DI0020990	Looks to me like a giant boat ran aground and a bunch of savages moved in. History lesson over.
1DI0020991	No, thank you. Please leave Mr Zimmer and myself alone.
1DI0020992	No, thank you. Please leave me alone.
1DI0020993	Do I look like someone who cares?
1DI0020998	We're already headed there. Just stay quiet and follow me.
1DI0020999	<sighs> Okay. Hope no one asks too many questions.
1DI0021000	As chance would have it, she was one of the first people to talk about life outside the vault after you left. No surprise; she always did like you.
1DI0021001	I hope you can talk some sense into her... or maybe the two of you can come up with some other plan? Just be careful about it.
1DI0021002	This is a town full of peace-loving Ghouls, so check your bigotry at the door. They're just like humans! They feel, they hurt, they bleed...
1DI0021003	They deserve the same love and respect as any human, and don't you forget it!
1DI0021004	At least, that's what they programmed me to say.
1DI0021005	Personally, I think they're a bunch of rotting zombie maggot farms, and I'd send them all back to hell if I could. Damn, this combat inhibitor!
1DI0021006	He was developed as a super weapon, back in the days before the war. The first joint operation between RobCo and General Atomics International.
1DI0021007	Apparently, he was meant to help liberate Alaska from the Chinese, but was never completed. They were forced to go in without him.
1DI0021008	They won, but suffered heavy losses. If we can get him up and running, well... I think you get the idea.
1DI0021009	Y... You're asking me what I think of the Enclave?
1DI0021010	Well... The Brotherhood of Steel has actually faced the Enclave before. Back West. More than thirty years ago, according to our chronicles.
1DI0021011	Judging from those records, I'd say their soldiers are outfitted in Advanced Power Armor Mark II. It's... pretty strong. Better than our Power Armor.
1DI0021012	And some of their technology is amazing! Vertibirds! Plasma weapons that can turn a man to goo!
1DI0021013	Does... that help?
1DI0021014	Come on! Here you are in the Mall of our nation's fine capital, taking in the sights, visiting the monuments!
1DI0021015	Face it. You're a tourist.
1DI0021016	Why yes, we do. How much would you like to donate?
1DI0021017	Certainly, child. How much help can we expect from you?
1DI0021018	Help us, and we in turn help Megaton. How much would you like to donate?
1DI0021019	I understand that you have reason to question a good many things I've told you over the years.
1DI0021020	But your mother... I've never lied to you about what happened. Not once.
1DI0021021	She died giving birth to you. It was a difficult time... She was so eager to meet you, to make a place for you in the world.
1DI0021022	If nothing else, please believe that she loved you very much.
1DI0021024	We're already headed there. Can't you smell the fire and brimstone?
1DI0021025	You sure you know what you're doing?
1DI0021026	On second thought, maybe I don't want to know. Just follow me.
1DI0021027	I hope you know what you're doing. I don't think he's going to be happy to see you.
1DI0021028	Follow close to me, and I'll escort you down to him.
1DI0021029	Do I ever! I've got the schematics for something called a Rock-It Launcher. I sell all the components, too, so you can make the weapon yourself.
1DI0021030	Don't worry about ammo! This baby shoots all the junk you might find out there in the Wasteland. Ashtrays, teddy bears... you name it!
1DI0021031	In fact, if you ever need to make any custom weapons, feel free to use my workbench, here in the shop. All you need is the schematics and parts!
1DI0021032	We've got two things to do in this town: suck and die. No one ever makes it in this place. You won't find any stores to loot here.
1DI0021033	Now that Red's here, she'll open the clinic back up. Bother her.
1DI0021034	No. Red used to run a medical clinic, but Super Mutants captured her in the last attack.
1DI0021035	There aren't many of us left to run stores or anything like that. You could stop by Red's clinic if you need stitching up.
1DI0021036	Red used to run the clinic, but she ... she's gone.
1DI0021037	Look, the only place to go is the town hall, and that's just a meeting spot for us. There aren't any traders or anything around here.
1DI0021038	Red's back, so she's running the clinic again. I go there all the time. Get my wounds treated from fighting. Yeah.
1DI0021039	I wander around town to find chalk and makeup sometimes. Not like there's anyplace to buy stuff.
1DI0021040	Red's clinic has some sharp knives and lighters. Too bad Red is always there, helping "these" people.
1DI0021041	I guess adults don't go to stores that much. That must be why there isn't anything here. Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
1DI0021042	Yep. As long as you've still got the ass to sit down on, I can fix you up. I'm also in the market for medical supplies.
1DI0021043	Hey, I'm not your personal tour guide! Besides, there's nothing to do in Big Town. Super Mutants tore everything apart.
1DI0021044	If only Red were here, then there would be a doctor to go to. You'll just have to make do without.
1DI0021045	Well, you've seen the clinic. Red's the smart one in Bigtown. I'd ask her.
1DI0021046	Red should have been here, but she probably got dragged off by the mutants. Damn it! DAMN IT!
1DI0021047	Red was the only one in town that dealt with outsiders. Now she's dead. Argh! It's so unfair! Damn it!
1DI0021048	There's nothing here but the stench of death, and the threat of attack looming over every sunset.
1DI0021049	The injured wind up in Red's Clinic. There's always so much red on the doctor, and it's not from her fabric.
1DI0021051	Yeah, you're telling me. Everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. The Super Mutants and Slavers seem to take turns beating the crap out of us.
1DI0021052	There's no way for us to fight back, so we just keep building barricades around town.
1DI0021053	Now we've been pushed back all the way. Nowhere left to run now.
1DI0021054	Whenever those... things come, they grab a few people instead of killing them. No one knows what happens after that. No one wants to know.
1DI0021055	There's... there's always so much blood after they come. And then someone has to... move the bodies...
1DI0021056	I wish it were. When I'm gone, I'll be sure to haunt this place ... <sigh>
1DI0021057	Nah, no way. Bigtown is a great place to be! I bet I could live over there, in that building with all the bullet holes and burn marks. Cool!
1DI0021058	Just ask everyone else in town. I'm sure they'll tell you how great it is to be here, all grownup!
1DI0021059	Oh, just grand, can't you tell? People are always dying to visit here and bring back "souvenirs."
1DI0021060	I used to pay off or trick the Slavers into leaving us alone. Not that it stops them much.
1DI0021061	Those Mutants are the real problem. Too big to shoot down and too single-minded to outwit. They just keep coming.
1DI0021062	You've seen those Super Mutants and their ... appetite. There's no way Bigtown will survive with them around.
1DI0021063	I remember screaming and gunfire. One of those big, hulking things shot at me. That's all I can think of.
1DI0021064	Two very angry types of movements. Slow, lumbering, powerful movements and jerky, erratic, excitable movements. Both coming for the kill.
1DI0021065	Most of us came from Little Lamplight. We got too old, so they kicked us out. Brats.
1DI0021066	Always heard stories about how great Big Town was, where the grownups go. But there's nothing here except death and sand.
1DI0021067	Oh, Little Lamplight is where most of us came from. Red and Pappy and Flash and Bittercup. We used to play together, when we were kids.
1DI0021068	Then we got old, and we had to leave. Those are the rules. So we packed up and headed here, like we were supposed to.
1DI0021069	No one told us it would be like this. We never have fun anymore, and most of us ... most of us are dead.
1DI0021070	We all used to live in a place called Little Lamplight, but they have a rule about age. You reach sixteen, and you're out.
1DI0021071	Didn't matter, though, because you'd just pack your things and head to Bigtown. All the adults go there, and there's plenty to eat.
1DI0021072	"Plenty to eat" alright, if you like eating bullets. I've lost count of how many times I've been shot at.
1DI0021073	Whoa, that was a long time ago. I'm not sure when, but everyone who grows up in Lamplight ends up here. Not too many of us left.
1DI0021074	Bigtown? A fairy-tale really. The Lamplighters who turn sixteen aren't allowed to stay in the caves, but they have to go somewhere.
1DI0021075	And to encourage people to leave, they invented Bigtown: the "great grownup place" that you got to go to when you became an adult.
1DI0021076	I think you can see how true those stories were.
1DI0021077	From the look of things, I'd say a Super Mutant sat down in a ditch one day and shat out this town.
1DI0021078	I dragged myself here from Lamplight. I didn't believe all the stories about Bigtown, but I wasn't about to let everyone else go there without me.
1DI0021079	A few dozen attacks on the town later, and here I am. Almost an ingredient in a Super Mutant chile cook-off.
1DI0021080	Well, I don't know. I guess the grownups built it when they got sick of little brats always hanging around them. I bet that's it!
1DI0021081	Sometimes you'll see small, tired dots on the horizon instead of angry, anxious ones. Those are settlers who come here from Lamplight. Poor fools.
1DI0021085	Alright, now stand still. This'll only take a second.
1DI0021086	Here, bite down on this. It'll help with the pain.
1DI0021090	This is going to hurt, so you'd better not start crying.
1DI0021091	You may want to look away. I don't want you throwing up, on top of all this.
1DI0021095	You should come back and see me when you have enough money for the supplies.
1DI0021097	Then why are you bothering me?
1DI0021098	Then stop wasting my time.
1DI0021100	Fine. Less of my supplies you're using up.
1DI0021102	Plannin' on goin' out and getting' shot up, eh?
1DI0021103	Yeah? What do you need?
1DI0021104	Not quite as good as that vault stuff you're used to, but it'll do you.
1DI0021105	Yeah. Enjoy. Dick ...
1DI0021106	Anything for you, friend!
1DI0021108	I used to make Gob take care of this, but what do you need?
1DI0021109	I guess now that Gob's gone, someone has to keep you drunks wet.
1DI0021110	Sorry, hon. The noodle stand is closed. If you want something, ask Leo in the restaurant.
1DI0021111	Here, take a look.
1DI0021112	Hey, I won't say it's all fresh, but it'll keep you going.
1DI0021113	Have a look, most of it's edible -- some of it even tastes good!
1DI0021114	What did I tell you? Not here. Hit me up when I'm away from the restaurant.
1DI0021115	What'll it be?
1DI0021116	Yeah, sure thing.
1DI0021117	What am I gonna say? No? You've got me over a barrel.
1DI0021118	Nothing. I'm... I'm not doing anything. Leave me alone!
1DI0021119	Sure thing, my man.
1DI0021120	Sure thing, little lady.
1DI0021121	Sorry, I'm closed. Come back tomorrow and we'll talk.
1DI0021122	I get a lot more done now that I'm not working on that book. I guess that's something, and that ought to earn you a discount, huh?
1DI0021124	Okay, fine.
1DI0021127	Absolutely!
1DI0021129	No problem at all. I'll take care of you until that lazy zombie wakes up to do his job.
1DI0021130	Tell it to Gob, he'll get you whatever you need.
1DI0021131	Then you need to talk to Gob. Don't worry, he doesn't drip into the drinks... much.
1DI0021132	Outside of Megaton? Any place other than here sounds like heaven to me. Fuck this place.
1DI0021133	If it weren't for you Wasteland types coming through with your caps, I'd be out of here in a second. Assuming that I could convince Jenny and Leo.
1DI0021134	All I know is that I spent too much time out there and beyond that, I ain't gonna talk about it.
1DI0021135	The Wasteland? Why the hell would you want to go out there? Listen to me, lass, Megaton has everything you could possibly need. Why go anywhere else?
1DI0021136	The Wasteland? Why the hell would you want to go out there? Listen to me, lad, Megaton has everything you could possibly need. Why go anywhere else?
1DI0021137	In my youth, I traveled quite a bit. But... that was a different life. I assume that you are seeking information and advice, yes?
1DI0021138	The only advice that I can offer is this: you will find no wealth in the Wasteland greater than that which you will find within yourself.
1DI0021139	Bask in Atom's Glow, and you will understand.
1DI0021140	None of your fucking business.
1DI0021141	I've said just about all I'm going to say about that.
1DI0021142	I spent a lot of time out there and I've left a lot of ghosts in my path. Some of them, well... they're coming a bit close to catching up to me.
1DI0021143	It's called "The Wasteland" for a reason. But there are settlements, too, spread all around. The human race is stubborn like that.
1DI0021144	To the south you got Rivet City, but don't bother going to D.C. The place is a warzone.
1DI0021145	The Vault you grew up in had its own water purification system. Clean water was never a worry. Out here, things are different.
1DI0021146	Water out here is never clean, and almost always irradiated. It's barely able to sustain any kind of normal life.
1DI0021147	If we can change that, humanity has a real chance at rebuilding. Starting over.
1DI0021148	Yes, yes. Best that you go now, before anything happens to you.
1DI0021149	I must insist that you take the vial with you. Leaving it here is... inadvisable.
1DI0021150	Good, good. Of course I'll know if you manage to succeed in our little mission. I'll be watching you...
1DI0021151	I'm afraid that's not possible. Not until you've taken the vial.
1DI0021152	Well, I can't blame you. I'll change the passwords behind you, and we'll figure out a way to work things out for ourselves.
1DI0021153	We've made it on our own for this long. I'm sure this'll blow over in time, too.
1DI0021154	Best of luck to you out there, kid. Don't worry about us.
1DI0021155	Communist! She's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
1DI0021156	Communist! He's a Communist! Everyone come quick!
1DI0021157	Daddy Dave! Help us! Please!
1DI0021158	Dave! Dave!
1DI0021159	Get Daddy Dave! Invader! Invader!
1DI0021160	Someone help! Invader! Invader!
1DI0021161	Let's see what the Army of Dave has to say about that, invader!
1DI0021162	Negatory! I have been programmed to remain on premises at all times! In the event of hostilities, I will respond with deadly force!
1DI0021163	Go Underworld! Go Ghouls! Yay!
1DI0021164	...damn this pansy zombie programming...
1DI0021165	Um, actually... no. I'm afraid I've been... What's the human term? Ah yes. "Fired."
1DI0021166	I've been reassigned to cleaning detail. My first duty is, somewhat ironically, cleaning the clinic! Ah, but surgery was fun while it lasted...
1DI0021167	Oh yes! I've studied them quite a bit since I've been here!
1DI0021168	They're not all the same, you know. Besides the regular ones, there are also Brutes. And after them, the Masters -- they're really tough.
1DI0021169	But the worst of all? The Behemoth! He's a giant! I saw one once, outside the Citadel walls. Sooo scary.
1DI0021170	The Super Mutants are all over the city ruins, but Elder Lyons doesn't think they're actually from there, or we would have found their home by now.
1DI0021171	It kind of seems like they're looking for something, but we're not really sure what that is.
1DI0021172	If any of the armor fails to protect your life, I'll give you a full refund.
1DI0021173	Take a look, it all works.
1DI0021174	Sure thing, human.
1DI0021176	Since you kept me from wasting my time on that book, I had a chance to refine my repair process a bit.
1DI0021177	Sure, fine. Whatever.
1DI0021178	It's nice to be doing something useful.
1DI0021179	Okay, let me scrape the brahmin poop off my hands.
1DI0021180	If you've got the caps, I've got the skill.
1DI0021181	Unless it's a steaming pile of slag, I'd say yes.
1DI0021182	You got caps for me? Then there ain't no problem.
1DI0021183	You're leaving us? You're leaving me?
1DI0021184	I guess what my father said was right. Now that you've been out there, you stopped caring about anyone but yourself.
1DI0021185	We don't need your help. We'll take care of ourselves. You can just get out, and never come back!
1DI0021187	I guess what the Overseer said was right. Now that you've been out there, you stopped caring about anyone but yourself.
1DI0021189	That should save us all some trouble. Now get moving, before I decide to make an example of you.
1DI0021190	As I always suspected. You never cared about the Vault. Now that you've been outside, you're nothing more than a ignorant savage.
1DI0021191	But by all means, feel free to see yourself out. I'm sure you know the way.
1DI0021192	Why, it's a place to settle down and raise a family. Of course, we don't just let anyone in here. The home owners association is very clear on that.
1DI0021193	Besides, there's no room! As amazing as Andale is, is it any wonder that all the houses would be full of happy families?
1DI0021194	Andale: greatest place there is. We win town of the year every year, we've got no end of food, and no troubles at all.
1DI0021195	Yep, there's no better place to raise a family.
1DI0021196	Oh, so you can just make fun of us again? No, thank you.
1DI0021197	It's the best little town there is. We don't have a care in the world here. I mean, honestly, what more do you need to know?
1DI0021198	Oh, well, no one ever asks me MY opinion about anything, but I love it here.
1DI0021199	It's swell! Except... I wish there were more kids. And my dad says that I'm gonna have to marry smelly ol' Jenny Wilson some day.
1DI0021200	He keeps saying stuff to my mom about keeping the families going, and how when him and Mr. Wilson were brothers, they didn't want to get married.
1DI0021201	It's weird... that means that Mr. Wilson is my uncle and Jenny is... something. I don't know. It seems weird to marry her.
1DI0021202	If this means more stuff for Butch, I'm all for it.
1DI0021204	You're always welcome to take whatever you want, lover.
1DI0021205	Sure, gimme whatever you got.
1DI0021206	Yes, by all means, let's.
1DI0021207	RL-3 comes equipped with everything a good soldier needs! But your RL-3 can assist in carrying equipment, if needed.
1DI0021208	In the words of Elder Theis: "A Brother well equipped is a Brother keeping to his duty."
1DI0021209	But... why?
1DI0021210	What a coincidence! I was thinking just the same thing!
1DI0021211	I expected nothing less from you.
1DI0021214	But I could! I know I'm ready! I mean, it would be scary, but... It's not fair that I have to sit inside while the knights go on patrol!
1DI0021215	I did go out one time, you know! Sarah... Um... Sentinel Lyons took me out. Just to show me. I killed a Super Mutant, too! I swear!
1DI0021216	I, um... I also sort of shot Sarah. But just a little! It was just a flesh wound...
1DI0021217	It's the only place in the Capital Wasteland where my people can escape the misery of the world above.
1DI0021218	And that misery, well... it makes a man like me very happy. And very, very wealthy.
1DI0021219	I've been here since we founded the town. Before that, well, life out in the Wastes wasn't very pleasant for us.
1DI0021220	But, so long as we stay down here, we can live our lives as people -- not monsters. I think things are better this way for everyone.
1DI0021221	It's a place for Ghouls. Here we're just people, not monsters.
1DI0021222	There are too many places where a Ghoul can't get a fair shake.
1DI0021223	It's a place for Ghouls, not humans.
1DI0021224	We don't especially like humans.
1DI0021225	What can YOU tell ME about... wait... what?
1DI0021226	We were driven underground... hrm... almost fifty years ago now. Between the Super Mutants, the beasts, and you crazy humans, it's not safe up there.
1DI0021227	So we stay down here, out of sight and out of trouble. We get a few smoothskins every so often, but most of us don't trust 'em.
1DI0021228	You're not gonna give us more reasons not to be trusting, are you?
1DI0021229	Which one, the original Brotherhood out West, or the shit that Lyons turned it into out here?
1DI0021230	I used to like serving with them, I really did. But, you know, the technology has to come first.
1DI0021231	Elder Lyons was nice and all, but we don't rescue technology by being nice.
1DI0021232	He was wasting my time, and my Pop didn't raise me to have my time wasted. So when Casdin left to continue the mission, I followed.
1DI0021233	You mean, apart from the fact that they ditched their mission and went native?
1DI0021234	Sure, I bet you don't mind them being cuddly with the locals, but when we came out here, we had a mission to do, damnit.
1DI0021235	But now they're wasting their time protecting yahoos like you, while Ahab Lyons is off chasing his Super Mutant white whale.
1DI0021236	Oh yes, I can. In fact, I suspect I could write several texts on the various details of the Brotherhood.
1DI0021237	But I suspect you're in a hurry, so what particulars would you like to know?
1DI0021238	Yeah yeah, very funny.
1DI0021239	Are you certain that this is what you wish?
1DI0021240	Wait... what? Why?
1DI0021242	What? Are you serious?
1DI0021243	Are you certain?
1DI0021244	I think I may have misheard that order.
1DI0021246	Okay, where are you going?
1DI0021247	Well, where to?
1DI0021248	I should be able to do that.
1DI0021249	I dunno. I still get lost sometimes. Things are really big.
1DI0021250	No. Scram.
1DI0021251	Where to, man?
1DI0021252	To where, man?
1DI0021253	Where? I've been just about everywhere down here, so I can get you to anywhere down here.
1DI0021254	Where to, mungo?
1DI0021255	What do I look like, your tour guide?
1DI0021256	Heh... well... there's this and that. I keep myself busy. But, really, that's none of your business is it?
1DI0021257	It's a hole. A dead end. So why I do stay? Well... it's a hole that makes me money.
1DI0021258	Megaton is the best little town you'll find in the Capital Wasteland. Don't let anyone tell you different.
1DI0021259	Strong walls, strong people, and strong booze. We've got everything you need to make a life these days.
1DI0021260	Megaton is the best little town in the Wasteland. Don't let anyone tell you different.
1DI0021261	Stay the fuck out of my business, don't go where you don't belong, and buy your drinks here. That's all you need to know.
1DI0021262	Megaton -- Atom's sacred village. He has chosen this place for the site of his shrine and we have been called.
1DI0021263	Outsiders ask us "why did you build a town around a bomb"? To them, I say: The bomb brings the promise of Division and the gift of the Glow.
1DI0021264	The bomb is us. The bomb is Atom. And thus, we are Atom -- awaiting the day in which each of us gives birth to a trillion new lives.
1DI0021265	I have to say, of all the rat infested hellholes that I've lived in, this one is the least hellish.
1DI0021266	Some people hate this place, but I guess it's their right, what the hell do they want out of life? Food, shelter and safety. Works for me.
1DI0021268	Yeah... I'm not really interested in chitchatting with you. Buy something or leave me alone.
1DI0021269	What's to tell? We're alive, so we've got nothing to complain about, right? And hell, I've got a restaurant! So I have it better than most!
1DI0021270	What can I tell you about Megaton? Well, that fucking bomb is killing us all slowly. How's that for a piece of information?
1DI0021271	Me?  I deal with the caravan suppliers. I used to ride with those guys, so they cut me some good deals. Helps keep the town supplied.
1DI0021272	But more importantly, I take care of Maggie. Of course, she's getting' a little old to have Billy lookin' over her shoulder all the time...
1DI0021273	I keep these yokels knee deep in booze and poon. They keep me knee deep in caps. It's a fair trade, if you ask me.
1DI0021274	I'm the town doc. If it's cut, I sew it up. If it's infected, I cut it off.
1DI0021275	Me? I don't do a damn thing. Well, unless you count staying piss drunk and making Moriarty rich as something.
1DI0021276	Sure, I'm the best shot in town with a rifle, so everyone comes running to ol' Jericho when the Raiders show up.
1DI0021277	But between raids, they're content to take my money and drag me home when I've had too much. Hahaha!
1DI0021278	I take care of the water purification plant. This old rusted hunk keeps us in clean water... for now.
1DI0021279	I take care of the water purification plant. That old rusted hunk keeps us in clean water... for now.
1DI0021280	Moriarty pisses in his still -- crazy bastard thinks it's hilarious. Besides, you'll get your throat cut in that pit. You're much better off here.
1DI0021281	Hey, maybe I'll put that on the sign out front: "The Brass Lantern: Cleaner, safer, and less likely to have piss in the drinks".
1DI0021282	People've been sayin' that there's somethin' wrong with the water purifier. But Ol' Walter's been keepin' that thing runnin' for decades.
1DI0021283	I'm not worried. No reason it'd pick now to go down for good... would it?
1DI0021284	I own a saloon, kid. Rumors are part and parcel. So I'll give you this one for free...
1DI0021285	Not sure if you've met her, but Lucy West, that pretty young thing? She's afraid. Of what, of who, I couldn't say. But you can feel the fear on her.
1DI0021286	News? My friend, I take effort not to be involved in such worldly business. Earthly pursuits distract from Atom.
1DI0021287	Of course... now that you mentioned it, I've noticed that Moira has hired a mercenary to protect her goods -- the man never sleeps. So they say.
1DI0021288	I already told you about the Stahl boy's drug problem. You said you wanted to help.
1DI0021289	That's about all the confidences I'm going to break for you, stranger.
1DI0021290	A doctor doesn't talk about his patients. At least not to strangers, he doesn't.
1DI0021291	I ain't heard much. Truth be told, I don't really ever leave the Lantern. Too much work, too few hours in the day, y'know?
1DI0021292	Remember what I told you, kid: Moriarty keeps his money locked up right next to his bed.
1DI0021293	A little drinkin' money might loosen my lips a bit. Give it a try. See what happens.
1DI0021294	Hey, I'm not much of a mudslinger. I don't like to spread stuff around, you know what I mean? Everybody has their secrets. Let's keep them that way.
1DI0021295	I'm sorry, I just haven't been paying any attention at all since Nathan died.
1DI0021296	There's only one thing that concerns me in this town these days: what my damn fool husband is doing.
1DI0021297	He wanders around here all day and all night, preaching about the Enclave and tryin' to get parts for his guns.
1DI0021298	I'm not sure who's the bigger fool, him or me. After all, I married him.
1DI0021299	I'm not one to gossip, but I do know a few things. For instance, did you hear that Lucas wants someone to disarm our bomb?
1DI0021300	Imagine the blasphemy! I can't believe it! I mean, I don't believe it. He would never do that to us.
1DI0021301	Sure, you got the purifier working right again, but if it runs out of water to pump then we're still screwed.
1DI0021302	Well, people've been sayin' that the water purifier's about to go. Honestly, I'll tell you what I tell them.
1DI0021303	I've been keeping that wreck going for thirty-five years and this is the first time I've ever had a problem I couldn't fix.
1DI0021304	I couldn't tell you, really. I'd talk to Manya if you care that much. She's lived in Megaton longer than anyone.
1DI0021305	It used to be that you could ask Manya just about anything. Now that she's gone, I don't know what to tell you...
1DI0021306	I keep asking you about that, but you never listen. Next time, I'm just going to thrust a hammer and nails into your hands.
1DI0021307	Um, Yeah. Yeah, they are.
1DI0021308	Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Just a bit jumpy lately.
1DI0021309	Painful, I guess.
1DI0021310	That's all right, Shorty. I'm sure you can do that by yourself.
1DI0021311	I'm still recovering. That Wastelander saved my life!
1DI0021312	Ah, but that sounds boring! I know --  think of something cooler, and I'll come back later.
1DI0021313	Oh, okay. I'll just ask you again later, all right?
1DI0021314	Oh, yeah, sure, okay. Later, then!
1DI0021315	Shorty, I just got here, but I know you're not in charge.
1DI0021316	Oh, that's... uh... I mean... sure! Tomorrow, then!
1DI0021317	Oh <sigh>, hey Pappy. Uh, nice to see you. I'm, uh, I'm just going to walk over there where it's less depressing
1DI0021318	Life was cruel then, and it's cruel now.
1DI0021319	I don't question my greatness, and neither should you.
1DI0021320	You're damn right you do!  'Cause I'm the only one who can really keep this town safe.
1DI0021321	Hey, me and shortness go a long way back, so shut up!
1DI0021322	No we aren't. This is a dictatorship! Run by ME!
1DI0021323	Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
1DI0021324	I don't even know what to do you with, Bittercup.
1DI0021325	Can't, there's no room on my clothes for more blood. Seriously, Pappy, it's a scratch. You'll be fine.
1DI0021326	Well, I'm glad you're okay. Stop by the clinic in a few days for a checkup.
1DI0021327	Well, Pappy, when the arm falls off and you're rolling on the ground in agony, I'll come take a look at it.
1DI0021328	No thanks, Kimba.
1DI0021329	Sure Flash, but leave the gun at home this time. There is no way to officially diagnose a weapon as "awesome."
1DI0021330	I don't know what good it will do, but thanks Timebomb. I'll ask you about it later.
1DI0021331	I can't believe you just said that. Just go away. Bother someone else.
1DI0021332	How about I don't do that, and you go away.
1DI0021333	Terrible. Same as the last time you asked.
1DI0021334	I don't know about that, but Big Town isn't much better. Hell, it's worse. Much worse.
1DI0021335	No sense worrying about them now. We live in Big Town, remember? We're on our own.
1DI0021336	That just means they're getting ready. They'll come for us, I know it.
1DI0021337	We're doomed. Doomed.
1DI0021338	Don't worry about it, Timebomb. Just try not to strain yourself, okay?
1DI0021339	Oh, I wouldn't worry about him. He's been like that since Lamplight. He'll be fine.
1DI0021340	You're welcome, Red. Sorry I couldn't do anything more than wash bandages.
1DI0021341	Whatever, Sticky.
1DI0021342	You're right.
1DI0021343	I don't know, Pappy. I just don't know.
1DI0021344	I'm sorry, Pappy, but what else can we do? I miss Lamplight.
1DI0021345	That's, um, that's great Timebomb. Well, I'm glad you're all right.
1DI0021346	Oh yeah. "I'll never be mayor. Everyone hates me," he used to say.
1DI0021347	Ease into it, Timebomb. I can handle the town myself while you're recovering.
1DI0021348	Some other time, Sticky. I've got better things to do then babysit you.
1DI0021349	Just fine, Red. I'll stop by the clinic later. And yes, the gun is coming with me.
1DI0021350	Don't worry, Kimba. If any Muties or Raiders are out there, my new gun and I will be like "pop-pop" you're dead!
1DI0021351	I'm not calling you short, Shorty! Oh wait... I think I just did!
1DI0021352	Whoa, whoa. Calm down. Nevermind.
1DI0021354	I know, isn't it? Bang-Bang! Yeah!
1DI0021355	Only your complete and utter lack of importance.
1DI0021356	Jerk. I'm glad we broke up.
1DI0021357	Please... help me.
1DI0021358	Please... God... I just need water.
1DI0021360	That's a damned shame.
1DI0021361	About time. I got better things to do.
1DI0021362	Good. I was tired of this conversation.
1DI0021363	Good work.
1DI0021364	You can do it. Just aim and shoot.
1DI0021365	Come on. Let's go.
1DI0021366	Happy birthday, honey.
1DI0021367	Happy birthday, son.
1DI0021368	Thanks. I'll send him right down.
1DI0021369	Thanks. I'll send her right down.
1DI0021370	Who wants to go around all day being called a "Vault Dweller"? Sometimes I think you really are as dumb as you look.
1DI0021371	Jeez, Wally. Who's the head of the gang, you or me? No way.
1DI0021372	Nice try. But shouldn't it be "The Big Cheese and Wally"? And why do you always have to get your name in there?
1DI0021373	We're not naming ourselves after you. Drop it, all right?
1DI0021374	Well at least it doesn't have your name in it somewhere. Which makes it better than any of your other ideas.
1DI0021375	I never said I didn't like it. I just haven't made up my mind yet, okay?
1DI0021376	Paul, you really are as dumb as you look, aren't you? Sounds like a washing machine or something.
1DI0021377	Shut up, Paul. Ha ha ha! Look at his face.
1DI0021378	That's not bad... Wait, didn't you just say that a minute ago? Come on, dummy, we need new ideas!
1DI0021379	I'll tell you one person who's not going to be in it. You! Ha ha ha. Just kidding, Paul. No I wasn't. Yes I was. Psych! Ha ha ha.
1DI0021380	Go ahead and punk out if you want. Me and Wally will find somebody else to be in our gang.
1DI0021381	Hmm. Grease Weasels. Pretty good. But is a weasel scary, or just goofy? They've got teeth and everything, right?
1DI0021382	I said I'd think about it. Come on, we need some new ones.
1DI0021383	Shut up and let me think a minute.
1DI0021384	Well... I don't know. I've got to think about it.
1DI0021385	Oh, never mind. I can't believe my mom made me come to this stupid party.
1DI0021386	Buck up, Butch. You always have good ideas.
1DI0021387	I'm trying, Butch. I just can't think of anything right now.
1DI0021388	Don't worry about it, Butch. You'll think of something. I know you will.
1DI0021389	You guys crack me up.
1DI0021390	This party is worse than the Atrium on Founder's Day...
1DI0021391	Whatever. Can we talk about something else already?
1DI0021393	Good, good. I'll know when you've completed your task. At that point, we can begin rebuilding this shattered world. Good luck.
1DI0021394	Yes, please do.
1DI0021395	No way. Not on my watch. GUARDS!
1DI0021396	Farewell, my friend. I suspect we may meet again.
1DI0021397	I won't be long.
1DI0021398	This place... so familiar.
1DI0021399	The G.E.C.K. lies ahead. Follow me.
1DI0021400	Come, let's continue.
1DI0021401	Get outta here.
1DI0021402	Fine, go.
1DI0021403	Don't screw up, okay?
1DI0021404	The Citadel is our only chance now. We have to make it there.
1DI0021405	I am sorry to be causing problems.
1DI0021407	We must keep moving.
1DI0021408	I really don't want to die down here.
1DI0021410	Thank you, Janice.
1DI0021411	Farewell.
1DI0021413	Keep up the good work, son.
1DI0021414	Keep up the good work, honey.
1DI0021415	I'll see you when you get back.
1DI0021416	Good luck, son.
1DI0021417	Good luck, honey.
1DI0021418	Be careful, okay?
1DI0021419	Good luck.
1DI0021420	Keep your hands to yourself in here. This equipment is fragile.
1DI0021421	Just stay out of my way, okay?
1DI0021422	Be careful, sweetie.
1DI0021423	Be careful, son.
1DI0021424	Take care, son. Now, get out of here. And good luck.
1DI0021425	Take care, sweetie. Now, get out of here. And good luck.
1DI0021426	I hate you!
1DI0021427	You, too. Thanks again for your help.
1DI0021428	You've got to help me.
1DI0021429	Much later! Tunnel Snakes rule!
1DI0021430	Get out of here, kid.
1DI0021431	I'll expect to see you in class, Freddie. No excuses. Run along now, son.
1DI0021432	Whatever you say, Mr. Brotch.
1DI0021433	You have lots of work to do!
1DI0021434	Mabel's waiting for you.
1DI0021435	I look forward to seeing how you deal with this.
1DI0021436	Tell Timmy I said hi!
1DI0021437	Run along now.
1DI0021438	Betty... It's him. I know. He knows I know.
1DI0021439	It's the only thing that can save us.
1DI0021440	You can do it. I know you can.
1DI0021441	Just a chance to sleep. That's all I ask.
1DI0021443	Right. Sure, thanks for asking. Well, I'll see you later.
1DI0021444	Okay, yeah. Thanks for asking. I'll catch up with you later.
1DI0021445	Bye bye!
1DI0021446	Have a great day!
1DI0021447	Take care now!
1DI0021448	Good luck. I'll try to meet up with you after you get the Vault door open.
1DI0021449	All right. We better get back to it. Be careful.
1DI0021450	Yeah. Give me a shout if you see anything.
1DI0021451	I guess it's back to roach patrol.
1DI0021452	I am holding still. It's your old, palsied hands that are shaking.
1DI0021453	Don't blame me for your incompetence. Why, I remember George used to have the lightest touch. Those were the days...
1DI0021454	I don't believe you. I expect we'll be here for hours.
1DI0021455	Ouch! Do you have any idea what you're doing back there?
1DI0021456	That is not the servo-motor switch. To the left... left, I said!
1DI0021457	I think you just made it worse. Should I do this myself?
1DI0021458	I think I'd rather just stay broken than submit to any further indignity.
1DI0021459	Good luck. I need to take a look at poor Andy over here. His old gears just aren't up to this kind of excitement.
1DI0021460	You take care of yourself now.
1DI0021461	Oh... okay. Thank you, Stevie. It's so dark...
1DI0021462	Regulate.
1DI0021463	Do not let this world taint you.
1DI0021464	Stay righteous.
1DI0021465	Hard work pays off!
1DI0021466	Do good work out there, we're counting on you!
1DI0021468	Watch yourself out there.
1DI0021469	Good luck finding your father.
1DI0021470	Brotherhood of Steel forever, man!
1DI0021471	Have fun out there, okay?
1DI0021472	Take care. It's a big Wasteland -- but you know that better than me, right?
1DI0021473	Good luck with that research!
1DI0021474	Try not to die!
1DI0021475	The info you're bringing back is great. Looking forward to more!
1DI0021476	Keep up the great research, super-assistant!
1DI0021477	Good hunting out there.
1DI0021478	Stay sharp.
1DI0021479	Sure, fine. Get going.
1DI0021480	Get a move on.
1DI0021481	Then get moving.
1DI0021482	Of course you do.
1DI0021483	Take care of yourself.
1DI0021484	Okay. See ya later, pal!
1DI0021485	That's right. And don't come back!
1DI0021486	Don't blow us up, now.
1DI0021487	Don't fool around with that bomb unless you know what you're doing.
1DI0021488	Good luck. Careful around that bomb.
1DI0021489	Time is wasting.
1DI0021490	You'll live just long enough to regret your error in judgment.
1DI0021491	Do it! Detonate the bomb and together we'll usher in a new age of prosperity!
1DI0021493	Next time I see the Family, there's gonna be hell to pay.
1DI0021494	Just watch yourself. I've got an itchy trigger finger.
1DI0021495	Adios.
1DI0021500	Come back to us anytime. The Family considers you a friend.
1DI0021501	You are free to roam the common area of our home as our guest.
1DI0021502	Yeah... goodbye.
1DI0021503	Sure. Go. Just like everyone else.
1DI0021504	Good, now get out!
1DI0021505	Bye bye! Come back soon!
1DI0021506	I understand. Goodbye.
1DI0021507	Guess I'll see you around.
1DI0021508	Bye, sweetie!
1DI0021509	It was good talking to you.
1DI0021510	Just remember I got my eyes on you. We all do.
1DI0021511	Say it ain't so!
1DI0021512	Good luck in the Museum. Bring me back something and I'll let you get a closer look at the Memorial.
1DI0021513	Sure. Silas will tell them you're allowed up there.
1DI0021514	I have big plans for Hannibal when I get my hands on him.
1DI0021515	Don't let me stop you.
1DI0021516	Don't be a stranger.
1DI0021521	May the spirit of the great Lincoln protect you.
1DI0021522	<grunt> Right.
1DI0021523	Nothing but gray rocks. Just a lot of gray rocks...
1DI0021524	Yeah. Get me a thousand rounds of 5.56. You're a useless puke, Bill. Get away from me.
1DI0021525	I don't know, Caleb. Ammo is tight. I shouldn't use it up like that.
1DI0021526	Hmph. I suppose that little shit isn't totally useless. I'll grab it before I turn in tonight.
1DI0021527	I've been reading about Abraham Lincoln. He was a very great man, Bill. A very great man.
1DI0021528	I don't think that would be a good idea, Caleb. How about we talk about it tomorrow morning? Maybe during your lesson.
1DI0021529	Just the ones I already gave him. There might be some in the museum though.
1DI0021530	I hate guns. Besides, the pen is mightier than the sword. Or the assault rifle.
1DI0021531	Bless you, ma'am.
1DI0021532	Bless you, sir.
1DI0021533	It's good of you to say so, miss Alejandra.
1DI0021534	Terribly sorry, sir. It's what we got the most of. I can try frying it instead of boiling it if you like.
1DI0021535	Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
1DI0021536	Yes, ma'am. Begging your pardon, ma'am.
1DI0021537	I've got work to do.
1DI0021538	When I get time. Maybe once or twice a week. I'll try to do better.
1DI0021539	I need more steel rods. At least as long as your arm. I'll take as many of them as you can find, and don't mind the rust.
1DI0021540	Sure thing, Hannibal.
1DI0021541	Thank you, Simone. I just wish the words were going as well.
1DI0021542	Good luck against those Super Mutants.
1DI0021543	I hope we can make it to the Memorial by sundown.
1DI0021544	I don't think so. Don't worry. We're well armed, and soon we'll have a new home, safe from them.
1DI0021545	Simone and I will go hunting soon. Probably tomorrow.
1DI0021546	Don't worry, Caleb. Alejandra will find a reference for you. Once we are in our new home, maybe we'll find something there.
1DI0021547	Next time don't waste the ammo. Wait for it to get closer.
1DI0021548	We're not waiting here for long.
1DI0021549	If you're not back soon, we're outta here!
1DI0021550	I'm not sure I like that idea. If you're not back soon, I'm leaving.
1DI0021551	I'm not waiting here for long.
1DI0021552	Careful of the Mutants!
1DI0021554	We need to get out of here! Move it!
1DI0021555	If those Muties try to take me again, I'll give THEM something to worry about for a change!
1DI0021556	Keep an eye out for Muties!
1DI0021558	If the Mutants get you, come back and haunt me.
1DI0021559	I'm worried about Red!
1DI0021560	Big Town's not exactly what I though it would be. If you ever need a side kick, let me know!
1DI0021561	I'm so tired of being frightened all the time!
1DI0021563	Well, then, get going! I'm busy plotting!
1DI0021564	At last, I can be done with your distracting prattle.
1DI0021565	Stay wary, citizen. And keep your laser handy!
1DI0021566	Stay safe, brave citizen.
1DI0021567	Good luck with those two troublemakers.
1DI0021568	Say hi to the Mechanist for me!
1DI0021570	Yes, I should say that you do.
1DI0021571	Take a look around if you want, but please be quick. You may have left, but this is the only world we know, and we need your help.
1DI0021572	Please, convince the Overseer to stop the lockdown. We're all counting on you.
1DI0021574	Well, okay. Just be careful down here. The Vault's changed, I tell you.
1DI0021575	Catch you later. Maybe.
1DI0021577	Watch yourself down here.
1DI0021578	Oh, please be careful.
1DI0021580	Yeah, right.
1DI0021581	Will do. You too.
1DI0021582	I'll keep talking with them. Who else am I gonna hang out with?
1DI0021583	Man, way to be a buzzkill.
1DI0021584	Come on, cheer up. Paul wouldn't want you moping around like that.
1DI0021585	I have no doubt that we shall. No doubt at all.
1DI0021586	We certainly shall. In time, everything will be solved.
1DI0021587	Harrumph.
1DI0021588	He's not listening to me. But there's someone else who might be able to convince him. We'll see.
1DI0021589	Sure you will, Butch. Sure you will.
1DI0021590	I'll keep myself safe if you do the same, Amata.
1DI0021591	That'd be fun, like a slumber party!
1DI0021592	Don't be silly, Susie.
1DI0021593	Well, just be careful, okay?
1DI0021594	All right, dear. Just don't get into any trouble.
1DI0021595	You can't go! After all that, you're not giving me the Stradivarius?
1DI0021596	Please! I must have that violin!
1DI0021597	I'm getting so excited I could scream!
1DI0021598	Looks like a long hike to Vault 92. Be careful!
1DI0021599	Watch yourself out there!
1DI0021600	Be careful, I don't want to be responsible for getting you killed.
1DI0021601	No! Don't go!
1DI0021602	Oh, please stay. There's so much more to tell.
1DI0021604	Have a wonderful and productive day.
1DI0021605	Sure thing, honey.
1DI0021606	Hey if this thing with Sierra doesn't work out...
1DI0021607	Baby, I hate it when you leave, but I love watching you go.
1DI0021608	Just remember, only one that's gonna' lay a finger on her is me. Got it?
1DI0021609	Good, then stop gawking and get me some Quantum.
1DI0021610	Just watch your ass around Sierra. She's mine.
1DI0021611	Good luck! Watch out for meanies!
1DI0021612	Hurry back, maybe I'll make some of my legendary Quantum Sorbet!
1DI0021613	That's okay, take your time and don't break the bottles!
1DI0021614	Be careful out there, sweetie!
1DI0021615	I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait!
1DI0021616	Awww, sorry you got to go.
1DI0021617	No Ranger will leave here alive!
1DI0021618	The roof will run red with their blood!
1DI0021619	Attack come soon. Wait 'til then.
1DI0021620	I'll crush the Rangers with my bare hands!
1DI0021621	Soon it will be our time.
1DI0021622	Ha ha ha ha ha.
1DI0021623	Keep eye open for more.
1DI0021624	Sure enough.
1DI0021625	Yep, no problem.
1DI0021626	Kick ass.
1DI0021628	Watch your ass, kid.
1DI0021629	Don't worry. Me 'n Eugene's got your back.
1DI0021630	Watch yourself... I don't wanna lose another man.
1DI0021631	Stay frosty.
1DI0021632	Let's get a move on.
1DI0021633	Get that fission battery then double time it back here!
1DI0021634	Watch yourself, those ruins are bad ass.
1DI0021635	Take it easy... I don't want to lose you too.
1DI0021636	Careful out there.
1DI0021637	Ah well... two steps back, one forward as they say!
1DI0021638	Now, let's see. Where did I go wrong...
1DI0021639	Let's see... genetic sequence A28. Yes, this will be the one...
1DI0021640	Finally, a chance to recant my mistake! How marvelous!
1DI0021641	Much to do... so much to do...
1DI0021642	Be ever vigilant... those from the genus Solenopsis are not to be trifled with.
1DI0021643	I have important calculations to attend to. Good day.
1DI0021644	This work is quite delicate... please leave me to it.
1DI0021645	I would ask if you'd keep the interruptions to a minimum.
1DI0021646	I wish I was tough like you!
1DI0021647	I wish you could stay here with me in Grayditch.
1DI0021648	You're pretty swell for a grownup!
1DI0021649	Stomp those stupid Ants!
1DI0021650	Kill those ants dead!
1DI0021651	Now I can never go home!
1DI0021652	If you look around enough in Grayditch you might find some useful stuff people left behind.
1DI0021653	Please be careful, I don't want you to die either.
1DI0021654	Sigh. I just wish things would go back to how they used to be.
1DI0021655	Be careful or those things might getcha.
1DI0021656	Give me liberty, or give me death!
1DI0021657	I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country!
1DI0021658	There never was a good war or a bad peace.
1DI0021659	I've not yet begun to fight!
1DI0021660	I'm right behind you.
1DI0021661	Rivet City here we come!
1DI0021662	Keep your eyes on the mission, and off my ass please.
1DI0021663	I'm ready. Lead on.
1DI0021664	Just watch yourself, 'cause I'm not dragging your corpse back to Rivet City.
1DI0021665	I am getting so drunk when we get paid for this.
1DI0021666	Stay focused and we may just get through this.
1DI0021667	Come on, less gawking and more walking.
1DI0021668	I got your back.
1DI0021669	This is pointless.
1DI0021671	I hope next time I see you, the Declaration will be in hand.
1DI0021672	Remember, treat the document with care. It's a fragile piece of our history.
1DI0021673	Be careful, the Archives are infested with who knows what.
1DI0021674	Remember, donations are always welcome.
1DI0021675	Remember, bring me back anything interesting you find.
1DI0021676	Very well, be careful out there.
1DI0021677	Come on, let's hurry up and get to Big Town!
1DI0021678	Why won't you just take me to Big Town?
1DI0021679	Sure thing, man!
1DI0021680	And I shall follow.
1DI0021682	Whatever you say, honey.
1DI0021686	Yeah, let's get to the action.
1DI0021688	It is my hope that we will speak again soon.
1DI0021689	Lead on!
1DI0021691	Stay strong, my friend.
1DI0021692	Come back if you need something.
1DI0021693	Take care, now.
1DI0021694	You stay safe.
1DI0021696	Hurry up. Those bigots got big comeuppance waiting for them. I mean to give it to them soon. Now get!
1DI0021697	Hurry!
1DI0021698	Watch your back. And don't trust that Roy Phillips for a second.
1DI0021699	It's dark in those tunnels. Shoot first, and ask questions later.
1DI0021700	You know what you need to do.
1DI0021701	Thanks again for saving my life at the police station.
1DI0021702	I showed you my new gun already, didn't I?
1DI0021703	Have a crappy - ah what the hell! Have a good one!
1DI0021704	Don't be a stranger!
1DI0021705	Remember: If you ever need a side kick, I'm your man!
1DI0021706	Go kick some ass!
1DI0021707	Thanks again for everything!
1DI0021708	I like you.
1DI0021709	Yes! They're all dead! And I have the keys. The keys to the...are you still here? Get lost. I have a trip to plan.
1DI0021710	Finally, I have the keys. Your job is done and you've been paid, so move along. I have a trip to plan.
1DI0021711	Well, they may not all be dead, but I have the keys. I should have hired a better mercenary. Run along. I have a trip to plan.
1DI0021712	Don't keep me waiting.
1DI0021713	Watch yourself out there, the Wasteland is no place to be messing around.
1DI0021714	Safe travels.
1DI0021715	Come back soon.
1DI0021716	Thanks for keeping an old lady company.
1DI0021717	Come on back soon, I may have some stuff for ya'.
1DI0021718	Yep, take it easy.
1DI0021720	Don't be a stranger, it's nice to have company.
1DI0021721	I'm certain our paths will cross again.
1DI0021722	Sigh. Alone again...
1DI0021723	Just get the hell away from me.
1DI0021724	Oh! Okay. Well, anytime you find yourself back in Megaton, be sure and look me up.
1DI0021725	Sounds good. Come back and visit me sometime.
1DI0021726	Goodbye. It's always nice to speak to you.
1DI0021727	What are you staring at me for then?
1DI0021728	Bye bye now!
1DI0021729	Sure thing, don't let me keep you.
1DI0021730	All right, see you later.
1DI0021731	I'm sure we'll meet again.
1DI0021732	Whatever floats your boat, sweetcheeks.
1DI0021736	Fine, I don't care.
1DI0021738	Bye bye, now.
1DI0021741	See ya, mister!
1DI0021742	See ya, lady!
1DI0021743	Now, was it five parts per milliliter or was it six? Hmmm...
1DI0021744	Hope you find what your looking for.
1DI0021745	Door's always open for you. Come back anytime.
1DI0021747	If you need us, you know where we are.
1DI0021748	Adios, kid.
1DI0021749	Kick some Mutie ass for me, kid!
1DI0021750	See you again.
1DI0021751	Come on back soon.
1DI0021752	I hope to see you again. I've very much enjoyed our chat together.
1DI0021753	I'm glad you stopped by to see me.
1DI0021754	Please, come and see me again.
1DI0021755	Keep your head low.
1DI0021756	You watch out for 'guai! They're all over!
1DI0021757	We'll see y'all real soon!
1DI0021758	Y'all come back now, y'hea'?
1DI0021759	Then leave. We'll do just fine without you.
1DI0021761	Try and be more careful about when you sneak up on people.
1DI0021762	Walk in steel.
1DI0021763	Stick to the shadows.
1DI0021764	Remember: One shot. One kill.
1DI0021765	Move silently.
1DI0021766	If you'll excuse me, I need to go show these fish how to shoot straight.
1DI0021767	Back to it.
1DI0021768	Damn Initiates...
1DI0021769	And so we part.
1DI0021770	Hooah, soldier.
1DI0021771	Stay safe, stranger.
1DI0021772	Stand strong.
1DI0021773	Never back down.
1DI0021774	Strength in Steel, friend.
1DI0021775	Unit deactivating. This troop is hitting the rack!
1DI0021776	Back to work.
1DI0021778	Until next time.
1DI0021779	In the Elder's name.
1DI0021780	Go with peace and knowledge.
1DI0021781	I look forward to our next meeting.
1DI0021782	Don't hurry back.
1DI0021783	And so you go.
1DI0021784	In my father's name, I bid you farewell.
1DI0021785	Stay strong.
1DI0021787	May we speak again soon.
1DI0021789	Steel walk with you.
1DI0021791	Steel be with you.
1DI0021792	Yeah, best get on your way.
1DI0021793	Give 'em hell!
1DI0021794	Get going.
1DI0021795	Oh. Okay then. Have a nice one.
1DI0021797	Be good.
1DI0021798	Take care!
1DI0021799	Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
1DI0021800	Take no prisoners!
1DI0021802	Go live your life, kid.
1DI0021803	Live it up while it lasts.
1DI0021804	Parting is such sweet sorrow
1DI0021805	Don't cause any trouble.
1DI0021806	Mind yourself, now.
1DI0021807	Right-o. Run along now.
1DI0021808	Good day.
1DI0021809	Cheerio.
1DI0021811	Bu-bye!
1DI0021812	There's no helping some people, is there?
1DI0021813	Ta-ta!
1DI0021814	I still got my eye on you.
1DI0021815	Watch yourself.
1DI0021816	Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0021817	Don't get hurt out here.
1DI0021818	Try not to break anything important.
1DI0021819	Remember: Just say no to drugs. Unless I prescribe them.
1DI0021820	Nice chit-chatting with you.
1DI0021823	Go get 'em!
1DI0021824	Go make a name for yourself!
1DI0021825	Don't forget to have a little fun out there!
1DI0021826	Later comrade.
1DI0021827	Until next time, comrade.
1DI0021828	Good travels to you, comrade.
1DI0021829	Charming!
1DI0021830	Pleasant day to you, dear.
1DI0021831	Until next we meet!
1DI0021832	Have a good one!
1DI0021833	Don't be a stranger to the cafe!
1DI0021834	Bon appetite!
1DI0021835	Right on!
1DI0021836	Cheers!
1DI0021837	Oh... you're leaving now? Okay. Bye-bye.
1DI0021838	You're a real charmer!
1DI0021840	Bye, dear.
1DI0021841	Later, then.
1DI0021842	Yeah, goodbye.
1DI0021843	Sure. See ya.
1DI0021844	Oh, all right. See you!
1DI0021848	I'm afraid I can't stop and chit chat.
1DI0021849	You're welcome back anytime. The Brotherhood never forgets its allies.
1DI0021850	Just stay out of our way and everything will be fine.
1DI0021851	Drop back in anytime, pal. We could use the company!
1DI0021852	Okay. Just make sure not to interfere with our operations.
1DI0021853	Be careful out there.
1DI0021855	Anytime you need a place to crash, duck in here. Be glad to provide.
1DI0021856	Right on, right on. Keep your radio tuned to GNR for the real gospel.
1DI0021857	Whatever. I need to get back to work.
1DI0021858	Yeah, catch you later.
1DI0021860	Later, gator.
1DI0021861	Easy, man.
1DI0021863	A little bit of caps for so much information... think about it.
1DI0021864	Careful in D.C. now. Those Super-Mutants can be a prickly bunch. Heh heh heh heh heh.
1DI0021865	Now, get the fuck out of my face.
1DI0021866	And so now we part.
1DI0021868	I await our next meeting with bated breath.
1DI0021869	I wish you well on your path.
1DI0021870	Walk in the Glow.
1DI0021871	Rays shower you, child.
1DI0021872	Try to be careful.
1DI0021873	Yeah. Bye.
1DI0021874	Try not to hurt yourself.
1DI0021877	Don't hit me!
1DI0021878	Sorry!
1DI0021879	Good luck finding your dad.
1DI0021881	Have a good one, stranger.
1DI0021882	Remember us if you need something!
1DI0021883	Are we finished now? Good.
1DI0021885	Whatever you say, kid.
1DI0021886	See ya!
1DI0021887	Come back soon!
1DI0021888	Remember: I'll buy whatever you're selling!
1DI0021889	Talk to you later, buddy.
1DI0021890	Anytime.
1DI0021894	Mind your manners, now.
1DI0021895	See y'all later.
1DI0021896	Bye, mister!
1DI0021897	Bye, lady!
1DI0021898	Come back if you need something, honey.
1DI0021899	It's been nice.
1DI0021900	Send Nathan home if you see him.
1DI0021902	Atom's light be with you, sweet child.
1DI0021903	Farewell, sweet child.
1DI0021904	Take care.
1DI0021905	God bless The Enclave.
1DI0021906	Take care of yourself, hon.
1DI0021907	Gotcha.
1DI0021908	Well, back to work.
1DI0021913	Yessir, Mr. Moriarty. More drunk customers, coming up!
1DI0021914	Go!
1DI0021915	Jesus give me strength...
1DI0021916	Okay, son. Okay.
1DI0021917	I know, I know, sweetheart. Now you run along, okay? Billy's got some thinkin' to do.
1DI0021918	Hey, would you look at the time! Sorry sweetheart, I've got, um... somethin' to do...
1DI0021919	It's why you love me, Nova dear.
1DI0021920	Awww... No one loves you more, sweet lass. And don't you ever think any differently. Now quit yammering and get back to doing what you do, hmmm?
1DI0021921	Well then. Until next time.
1DI0021922	He he. You know, dad, for a sheriff, you're kind of a goofball.
1DI0021923	Heh, yeah, well... If that's what you need to tell yourself, go for it. He he he he.
1DI0021924	Yeah, we'll see. I'd just watch your fucking step around here, pal. There's a lot of ways to have an accident. Now... you have yourself a good day.
1DI0021925	Good answer. Now, fuck off.
1DI0021926	I'm watching you, outsider. You try anything, and I'll be there.
1DI0021927	Ha! I'm just fuckin' with you! Ha ha ha! I got you good! Now go... before you make me mad.
1DI0021928	You got it, buddy.
1DI0021929	You're the best, Billy!
1DI0021930	Thank you, Billy. I just... thanks.
1DI0021931	You're quite welcome, Nathan dear.
1DI0021932	You're welcome, you testy old fool. I swear, Nathan, one of these days you're going to give yourself a heart attack, just like Doc Church said....
1DI0021934	Okay, okay, I know, I know...
1DI0021935	Well... damn it. I ain't about to go out lookin' for one myself! Ah well... you have a good one, Moira.
1DI0021936	Ah, damn. Oh well. Thanks, Moira.
1DI0021937	God, you can be such an asshole sometimes, Colin. Don't worry, the "princess" will serve her king. Happy now?
1DI0021938	I hear you, all right? Loud and clear. I'll make daddy proud.
1DI0021939	I'll talk to you later, hon.
1DI0021940	Okay, Gobbie. Bye.
1DI0021941	Please don't make it any harder than it has to be, Jericho.
1DI0021942	I'll tell you what, I'll give you an extra ten minutes next time. On me. Just don't let Colin know...
1DI0021943	Well, I suppose that's goodbye then. Come again anytime.
1DI0021944	Thank you for coming to Gary's Galley.
1DI0021945	Then go.
1DI0021947	I'll be right here when you get thirsty.
1DI0021949	Don't let the door hit you on the ass.
1DI0021951	I'm sure you'll be back soon.
1DI0021953	Duty calls.
1DI0021954	Later, dude.
1DI0021955	God bless you.
1DI0021956	Yes, yes. I have things to do too.
1DI0021958	Saint Monica bless you.
1DI0021959	If you need more ammo, this is where to get it.
1DI0021961	And I have work to do.
1DI0021962	Carry on, then.
1DI0021965	So long.
1DI0021967	I'll just stay here. Alone.
1DI0021968	Yeah. Me too.
1DI0021969	Next time be more careful. I don't want to accidentally shoot you.
1DI0021970	Don't let your guard down.
1DI0021974	Come back soon. We've always got a lot of ammo in stock.
1DI0021975	So do I.
1DI0021976	Like I care.
1DI0021977	Your loss, sugar. Come see me again sometime.
1DI0021981	Come back... please.
1DI0021982	Come back if you need something. Not like I'm going anywhere.
1DI0021983	Wha... huh? I don't get it.
1DI0021984	Y'all come back real soon.
1DI0021985	I'll tell Mr. Eulogy that we talked.
1DI0021986	You'd better go before he sees you.
1DI0021987	Yeah. Come back when you've got more injuries. And some more caps.
1DI0021988	Paradise Falls is here if you need it.
1DI0021989	<belches>
1DI0021990	Yeah, just behave yourself. The boys up there don't fuck around.
1DI0021991	Go, then.
1DI0021992	Please... if you get to Underworld, let them know that I'm okay.
1DI0021993	Hey, man. Come back any time.
1DI0021994	Told you: there's nothing exciting down here.
1DI0021995	It's only a matter of time now.
1DI0021996	Come back when you are ready to drink, little man.
1DI0021997	Come back when you are ready to drink, little girl.
1DI0021998	Thanks. Hopefully, it'll just be skinned knees and bloody noses, today.
1DI0021999	Don't get too hurt out there.
1DI0022000	Come back anytime you'd like to sit in.
1DI0022001	Stay sharp!
1DI0022002	About time, man. This mold isn't getting any tastier.
1DI0022003	Keep an eye out.
1DI0022004	Bye-bye, Vault Dweller!
1DI0022005	Bye-bye, Mungo!
1DI0022006	Bye-bye!
1DI0022007	Oh, thank goodness you gave me permission. Jerk.
1DI0022009	Come on back when you've got more stuff to trade!
1DI0022010	See ya around!
1DI0022011	See ya about!
1DI0022012	Okay, see you next time, mister!
1DI0022013	Okay, see you next time, miss!
1DI0022014	Okay, see you next time, bye bye!
1DI0022015	Bye!
1DI0022017	I'll try!
1DI0022018	Bye, then!
1DI0022019	Well then, see you later, Lucy.
1DI0022020	Yeah, fine, scram.
1DI0022021	Yeah, sure, whatever.
1DI0022022	Yeah, that's nice, scram.
1DI0022023	Just fucking go, okay?
1DI0022024	Not for a while, I hope.
1DI0022025	Don't let the door hit you on the way out, mungo.
1DI0022026	Not if I shoot you first, you won't.
1DI0022028	All right, bye.
1DI0022029	Okay, bye bye!
1DI0022032	Roger that.
1DI0022034	Oh, anytime.
1DI0022035	Come back later. I mean, don't come back later. See if I care.
1DI0022036	Watch out for Muties and Raiders.
1DI0022037	If you see anyone from Lamplight, tell them to be careful.
1DI0022038	We're doomed and so are you if you stick around.
1DI0022039	Don't get yourself hurt. I have enough red on my clothes already.
1DI0022040	Stay clear of mutants. Especially the big, hungry ones.
1DI0022041	All right, I'll just be here doing grown-up stuff.
1DI0022042	Be careful out there. You don't want to end up on that table in Red's clinic.
1DI0022043	Don't be distracted by the size. Stay calm; shoot straight.
1DI0022044	Don't let the door hit you on the ass, clown shoes. Hah ha!
1DI0022045	Don't let the door hit your sweet, sweet ass. Hah ha!
1DI0022046	Take care, sugar.
1DI0022047	Bye, bye, honey.
1DI0022049	Remember that the Department of Tourist Rights only guarantees your safety for 24 hours. After that time, you will be executed.
1DI0022050	Very well. Goodbye, Ambassador.
1DI0022051	You are safe here so long as you obey me, refugee.
1DI0022052	All spies say that.
1DI0022053	Goodbye. Take care of yourself.
1DI0022054	Stay away from Dave. He's mine.
1DI0022055	You're safe as long as Dave says so.
1DI0022056	Come back and visit the museum anytime!
1DI0022057	Just don't bother me. I've got stuff to do for Dave.
1DI0022058	I have to go practice my Dave impression, anyway.
1DI0022059	Goodbye, Miss Not-Mommy.
1DI0022060	Goodbye, Mister Not-Dave.
1DI0022061	That's what Dave always says.
1DI0022062	Hurray for the Republic! <giggles>
1DI0022063	So long, Bill...
1DI0022064	So long, Jack...
1DI0022065	So long, Jenny...
1DI0022066	So long, Junior...
1DI0022067	So long, Karen...
1DI0022068	So long, Linda...
1DI0022069	So long, Martha...
1DI0022070	So long, Mr. Harris...
1DI0022071	So long, Tuck...
1DI0022072	We'll catch you later!
1DI0022073	Come back and see us soon!
1DI0022074	Hey, you have a great day!
1DI0022075	You should really stop by for dinner sometime.
1DI0022076	I'll tell Linda and Junior that you said hello!
1DI0022077	C'mon back anytime! We look forward to having you!
1DI0022079	Talk to you later!
1DI0022080	If you see Junior, tell him that I said hi!
1DI0022081	So long!
1DI0022082	Dad says that I shouldn't want to leave Andale, but I do!
1DI0022083	Gosh, I wish I could go with you!
1DI0022084	Goodbye now!
1DI0022086	I really look forward to preparing you for dinner sometime!
1DI0022087	Really, don't be such a stranger.
1DI0022088	C'mon back to our home anytime!
1DI0022089	We'll see you again, won't we?
1DI0022090	We'll see you real soon!
1DI0022091	Get out! Get out while you can!
1DI0022092	Run, stranger! Run!
1DI0022093	Go, get out of here before they get you too!
1DI0022094	So long, buddy.
1DI0022095	We'll catch you later.
1DI0022096	Till next time, sightseer.
1DI0022097	Come back anytime.
1DI0022098	Feel free to lay your troubles at my doorstep. Just bring some caps with you when you do.
1DI0022099	Everyone's got troubles, and everyone brings 'em to me.
1DI0022100	There are no worries that can't be left behind with the help of a little alcohol.
1DI0022101	Drink until she's pretty! Ha Ha Ha Ha! Sorry... Ghoul joke. I guess you wouldn't get it.
1DI0022102	You come back real soon now!
1DI0022103	You're not bad... for a human.
1DI0022104	Don't let these people get to you.
1DI0022105	Closing dialog system.
1DI0022106	Resuming patrol.
1DI0022107	Come back if you need anything.
1DI0022108	You be careful now.
1DI0022109	Let me know if you have any of that Scrap Metal to sell!
1DI0022110	You'll be back.
1DI0022111	Come back when you're hungry.
1DI0022112	What? Not full yet?
1DI0022113	You humans have such weak stomachs.
1DI0022114	... ... bye ...
1DI0022115	<hic> ... see you later... <burp>
1DI0022116	Oh! Hello! Wait... what?
1DI0022117	Remember: no charge!
1DI0022118	Come back soon! ...please.
1DI0022119	Let me know if you need something.
1DI0022120	Keep your skills sharp and your eyes peeled, alright?
1DI0022121	Until we meet again, keep yourself alive out there!
1DI0022122	Good luck out there. And maybe next time, you'll find something interesting for me, huh?
1DI0022123	See you out on the road, huh?
1DI0022124	Stay safe on the path you travel.
1DI0022125	Walk well, friend.
1DI0022126	See you next time you need that special little something.
1DI0022127	Cheers, pal. Watch yourself out there.
1DI0022128	Be back soon! And bring more caps!
1DI0022134	See you next time!
1DI0022135	I suppose there's no chance for a nice conversation today, is there.
1DI0022136	Yes, well... I guess there's always tomorrow.
1DI0022137	Well... Good talking with you, boy, as always.
1DI0022138	I'm fine, okay?
1DI0022139	I'll, umm... I'll just be over here.
1DI0022140	Umm... okay. Bye.
1DI0022141	If you insist, Derek. If you wanna talk later, I'm around.
1DI0022142	You're the boss, man. We can talk about it later, if you want.
1DI0022143	Sounds like a good plan.
1DI0022144	You know you can rely on me for that.
1DI0022145	Umm... Yes, sir. I mean, Dominic.
1DI0022146	Okay... if you insist.
1DI0022147	Good. See you later. And you better show up!
1DI0022148	You'd better believe it.
1DI0022149	I mean it.
1DI0022150	Great! I'll see you later, Machete!
1DI0022151	No problem, Machete. See you later.
1DI0022152	Umm... Yes, miss.
1DI0022153	Find human time.
1DI0022154	I leave now.
1DI0022155	I hate this place.
1DI0022156	Bored, bored, bored.
1DI0022157	Must go find human.
1DI0022158	Need more meat. I go now.
1DI0022159	I'm leaving now.
1DI0022160	Patrol not fun.
1DI0022161	Hungry I go find food.
1DI0022162	Back to work!
1DI0022163	Goodbye Outsider, and good luck.
1DI0022164	Have no fear, Outsider. I know you'll make a wise decision.
1DI0022165	Speak to me when you are ready to be purified, but don't keep the Great One waiting.
1DI0022166	This way, Outsider. Come along now.
1DI0022167	Goodbye, Outsider.
1DI0022168	I trust we'll speak again, Outsider.
1DI0022169	May the Great One bless you.
1DI0022170	May the sap of His wisdom sustain you.
1DI0022171	May your spirit rest in His branches.
1DI0022172	Farewell, Outsider.
1DI0022173	May you remain under the canopy of His protection.
1DI0022174	I will. We've become pretty close and he's beginning to talk to me, so I think it's a good sign.
1DI0022175	You can be such an asshole sometimes.
1DI0022176	See ya later!
1DI0022177	Okay, I'm sorry Vancie. I'll be a good girl.
1DI0022178	You are the biggest jerk ever! Humph!
1DI0022180	It's the least I can do, Vance. You give so much and rarely receive. I'm glad I'm here to help.
1DI0022181	You have a lot to learn about dealing with people.
1DI0022183	You've made my day. I promise to never let you down!
1DI0022184	Screw you! Jerk!
1DI0022185	Well, see you around I guess.
1DI0022186	All right, all right. Don't get your nuts in a twist.
1DI0022187	Whatever. You'll come see me again when you need something.
1DI0022188	You have yourself a fine day, sir.
1DI0022189	You have yourself a fine day, madame.
1DI0022190	If there's anything you require further feel free to ask, sir.
1DI0022191	If there's anything you require further feel free to ask, madame.
1DI0022192	I'll be sure and tidy up while you're away, sir.
1DI0022193	I'll be sure and tidy up while you're away, madame.
1DI0022194	Yep, do what you gotta do.
1DI0022195	Thanks for the disk. Maybe we'll cross sticks again some day.
1DI0022196	Of course, of course! Don't let me keep you!
1DI0022197	You never any fun.
1DI0022198	Ah, nevermind! Talk with you is... stupid.
1DI0022199	Ah, I'm done talkin' to you anyway.
1DI0022200	Bah! I'm gonna go back to doin'... what I was doin'...
1DI0022201	Forget it! You too dumb to talk to.
1DI0022202	See you around, mister.
1DI0022203	Okay, miss. See you around.
1DI0022204	Okay, bye.
1DI0022205	Yeah, me too.
1DI0022206	Bye-bye.
1DI0022207	See you later, alligator.
1DI0022210	See you.
1DI0022211	Yeah. See you.
1DI0022216	I uh... don't feel so good.
1DI0022217	Am I drunk? I think I'm drunk... Do I seem drunk to you?
1DI0022218	Whoa!!! Is it me, or is the world spinning?
1DI0022220	I don't want to be a slave! I was just confused before! Take it off!
1DI0022221	Please! You got to let me go!
1DI0022222	I'm begging you! Let me go!
1DI0022223	You enjoy being a "recruiter" for Paradise Falls, eh? Here's another collar and some caps.
1DI0022224	The slaves keep rolling in. Keep this up and you're going to be rich! Here's your caps and another collar.
1DI0022225	Tallied the last slave you sent us. You're pretty good at the slaving thing. Keep it up! Here's another collar and pile of caps.
1DI0022226	Keep it up. We all make a ton of caps on every slave you send to us. Here's your cut and another collar.
1DI0022227	You idiot! Your slave's dead. You ruined perfectly good merchandise. I monitor the collars, you know. You need to be more careful!
1DI0022228	Do you want another collar and try again? You'll have to buy it. I'm not going to subsidize your screwups.
1DI0022229	Idiot. You don't make money on dead slaves. You want to buy another collar and try again?
1DI0022230	Alright, that should do it. You need anything else?
1DI0022231	And we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you need anything else?
1DI0022232	All better now, you big baby. Can I get back to work now?
1DI0022235	Okay, you should be fine, and ready to run off and play.
1DI0022236	I'll say this; it's easier to work on a mungo, since you're a lot bigger. Easier to find a vein, at least.
1DI0022237	Good as new. Now, watch yourself out there, all right?
1DI0022238	Now next time, try to be where the bullets aren't.
1DI0022239	There you go. All better, you big baby. You need anything else?
1DI0022240	That should keep you going for a bit longer.
1DI0022241	Medical procedure complete. Further instructions?
1DI0022242	Feel better? You should, that was the good stuff. Need anything else?
1DI0022243	See, that wasn't so bad. Anything else I can do for you?
1DI0022244	You're all set. Are we done here?
1DI0022245	What... who? You mean... are you for real? I'm safe?
1DI0022246	I... I need to get out of here! Here, take these supplies. It's all I have, but they'll only slow me down.
1DI0022247	Thank you! Whoever you are, thank you! The... things they talked about doing to me...
1DI0022248	Look, I don't have anything to offer you except these supplies. I don't know why they didn't take it.
1DI0022249	I'm... I'm alive! I can't believe it! I'm alive!
1DI0022250	Here, I managed to hide this stuff before they tied me up. You take it, it's the best I can do to thank you...
1DI0022251	My... thank you! Thank you so much! I thought I was dead for sure!
1DI0022252	Here, I managed to hide these supplies before they tied me up. You take them, it's the best I can do to thank you...
1DI0022253	Oh my God! I thought I was dead! You saved me!
1DI0022254	They dropped this stuff... Why don't you take it? It's all I have.
1DI0022255	You've helped me so much, it seems wrong to ask, but can you spare any more water?
1DI0022256	I'll never forget you. Thank you for your help.
1DI0022257	I hate to ask but... do you have any more water?
1DI0022258	You've saved my life. Thank you, stranger. I hate to ask you this, but times are hard...
1DI0022259	Can you spare any more water?
1DI0022260	Just leave me to die in peace.
1DI0022261	Just go away. I'd like to die without you standing over me gloating.
1DI0022262	Oh, thank God. Someone new! I need water! Please! Water!
1DI0022263	Can you help me? I need water... purified water... please...
1DI0022264	Please... do you have any water? I'm so thirsty...
1DI0022265	Please! Please help me... I need water! I'm dying!
1DI0022266	All four of the VIP targets Eulogy wants are dead. Great. Good job moron. I'm sure you had something to do with that.
1DI0022267	Well, you can keep sending slaves my way if you want to continue splitting the commission. But I'm not vouching for you with the Paradise crew.
1DI0022268	Thanks to you, we finally have that sniper, Arkansas, in a collar! You have no idea how many good men that prick put into the dirt.
1DI0022269	I'm tempted not to sell him, just so we can torment him. Use him for target practice or something. Hehehe.
1DI0022270	Here's another collar. Keep those hoochies rolling in and you'll be rich in no time.
1DI0022271	How the hell'd you get old queen Flak, into that collar?! I'm surprised you're still alive!
1DI0022272	We need to keep a close eye on that one, though. He knows our system too well.
1DI0022273	He sold us out to get into Rivet City. We'll never forget that. And now we'll make sure he never forgets it, either.
1DI0022274	Here's another collar. Keep herding the swine in here and you'll have more bottle caps than you'll know what to do with.
1DI0022275	I've been wanting to get Red in here for a long time. I have a little something special planned for her.
1DI0022276	Take another collar, and keep those puppies coming!
1DI0022277	Susan thought she could just up and leave, huh? We showed her different, didn't we?
1DI0022278	She'll think twice about slitting one of our throats now that she's collared! We'll need to come up with something extra special for her.
1DI0022279	Here's another collar. You're a welcome addition to our little operation here.
1DI0022280	Hold it right there. Nobody's allowed into Paradise Falls except on Slaver business. And I get to decide what qualifies as Slaver business.
1DI0022281	You didn't really think you could just sneak into Paradise Falls did you?
1DI0022282	You again? What do you want?
1DI0022283	What the hell do YOU want?! You got a death wish?
1DI0022284	Do I look like someone who wants to be your friend? Are you a moron? Why do you keep coming around? Piss off already!
1DI0022285	Unless, have you changed your mind? Do you want to take me up on the offer  of employment?
1DI0022286	You're back?! Do you have a death wish?
1DI0022287	I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough. Piss off. Go. Walk. Leave. You don't belong here. Au revoir. Don't let the door hit you in the ass.
1DI0022288	Are you deaf? Get the hell out of here. You don't belong in this town.
1DI0022289	I thought I told you to piss off. I did, didn't I? So piss off.
1DI0022291	State your business in Rivet City.
1DI0022292	Please be seated in the nearest available Tranquility Lounger. Thank you for your cooperation.
1DI0022293	Please take a seat in the Tranquility Lounger.
1DI0022294	Welcome to Vault 112, Resident! According to sensors, you have arrived 202.3 years behind schedule.
1DI0022295	Please re-dress in your Vault-Tec issued Vault suit before proceeding. If you have misplaced your suit, I am authorized to distribute a new one.
1DI0022296	Once dressed, please proceed down the stairs to the main floor so that you may enter your assigned Tranquility Lounger.
1DI0022297	Please dress in your Vault 112 suit. Remove all other articles of clothing to prevent damage to the equipment.
1DI0022298	Thank you for your cooperation.
1DI0022301	I've already told you everything I know. I don't understand why you're still here.
1DI0022302	Look, this is a restricted area. I'm tired of telling you people...
1DI0022303	I... It's you. My heavens, you look so much like him...
1DI0022304	You're James' son, aren't you? What are you doing here?
1DI0022307	You're James' daughter, aren't you? What are you doing here?
1DI0022308	Good work! That's one less Radroach to deal with.
1DI0022309	Let's get a picture together. Capture the moment.
1DI0022310	Having trouble with that Radroach?
1DI0022311	Something wrong? That Radroach is still over there.
1DI0022312	Well, what do you think? You can come down here and shoot any time you want.
1DI0022313	Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. Here are some more BBs.
1DI0022314	If you're having trouble, try crouching to steady your aim.
1DI0022315	Go ahead. Try out your new gun on those targets over there.
1DI0022316	Come on. We'll show you the place.
1DI0022317	Are you ready for your surprise?
1DI0022318	Hey, that was Jonas on the intercom. He and I have been cooking up a little surprise present.
1DI0022319	Jonas is waiting for you downstairs on the Reactor Level. Go ahead, I don't think anyone will mind if you slip out for a few minutes.
1DI0022320	Just be patient. You don't want to ruin the surprise, do you? Go ahead, Jonas is waiting!
1DI0022321	Are you all right? Is Butch giving you a hard time again?
1DI0022322	Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday boy.
1DI0022323	Having a good time? It wasn't easy keeping this a secret! Now go on, I'm sure everyone else would like a chance to talk to the birthday girl.
1DI0022324	Hey there, pal. Having fun?
1DI0022325	Hi, honey. Having fun?
1DI0022326	I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, son. Now go on and enjoy your party!
1DI0022327	I can't believe you're 10 already. Your mother would have been proud of you, honey. Now go on and enjoy your party!
1DI0022328	Listen, once you finish being a good host, I have something I want to show you.
1DI0022329	I hope you appreciate the effort Amata put into this party. She really seems to like you, for some reason.
1DI0022330	Another youth well on his way to becoming a productive vault citizen!
1DI0022331	Another youth well on her way to becoming a productive vault citizen!
1DI0022332	Are you having a nice party? Ten years old, my my my. Seems like only yesterday that your daddy came...
1DI0022333	Goodness, listen to me ramble! You're waiting for your present, aren't you?
1DI0022334	Go ahead, you can eat the sweetroll now. It's your birthday!
1DI0022335	You've grown up into such a fine young man. Your father must be very proud of you.
1DI0022336	You've grown up into such a fine young lady. Your father must be very proud of you.
1DI0022337	I don't have any more presents for you, if that's what you're wondering.
1DI0022338	Go on now, I'm sure you've had quite enough old lady chitchat for one birthday!
1DI0022339	Happy birthday, dearie! My goodness, I hope I didn't miss the party!
1DI0022340	I hope you're having a good party! Did you read your poem yet? You know how to find it in your Pip-Boy, don't you?
1DI0022341	I hope Butch didn't hurt you. Do you want to tell me what that was all about?
1DI0022342	Happy birthday, sonny!
1DI0022343	Happy birthday, missy!
1DI0022344	Sounds like everybody's having a good time in there.
1DI0022345	How do you like that Pip-Boy, son? Fit all right and everything?
1DI0022346	How do you like that there Pip-Boy, miss? Fit all right and everything?
1DI0022347	You let me know if that Pip-Boy ever gives you any trouble.
1DI0022348	I am mortified about the cake mishap. Simply mortified.
1DI0022349	Allow me to wish you happy birthday. I would offer you a piece of cake, but...
1DI0022350	Happy birthday! If you'll excuse me I'll have this cake sliced up for you in a jiffy.
1DI0022351	I'm hungry and that stupid robot destroyed the cake.
1DI0022352	Give me that sweetroll you got from Old Lady Palmer.
1DI0022353	Mmm, that sweetroll was really good. You can tell Old Lady Palmer thanks for me. Ha ha ha!
1DI0022354	So you're a tattletale, too. Just wait. Gomez isn't always going to be around to save your butt.
1DI0022355	You're going to be really sorry you messed with me, punk.
1DI0022356	Nice party, butt-head. Now get lost before I have to make you cry.
1DI0022357	Didn't I tell you to stop bothering us? Shove off, dork.
1DI0022358	My mom made me come to your stupid party, but don't expect me to hang out with you. Get lost, loser.
1DI0022359	Why don't you go play dolls or something with your little friend Amata. No girls allowed.
1DI0022360	Hey, I think your girlfriend Amata is looking for you. K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Ha ha ha.
1DI0022361	This party's pretty good, I guess. For a little kid. Balloons. Party hats...
1DI0022362	Not as cool as my party though. Remember how my dad got Andy to do magic tricks? And we all played Hunt the Mutant in the Atrium?
1DI0022363	Oh, right... you weren't invited to my party. Too bad, man. It was really fun.
1DI0022364	Why are you still hanging around?
1DI0022365	Hey, uh, thanks for inviting me. Really cool party and everything.
1DI0022366	I know that, uh, Butch and I give you a hard time, but you don't take that seriously, right?
1DI0022367	Anyway, uh, happy birthday and everything. I better get back to, you know...
1DI0022368	Get lost, butt-breath.
1DI0022369	What's Butch's problem anyway? I can't believe he tried to start a fight at your own birthday party. What a jerk.
1DI0022370	Butch is such an idiot. Just ignore him.
1DI0022371	What happened with Butch? He looked awfully pleased with himself, which usually means something bad happened to somebody.
1DI0022372	What'd Butch want? I thought you were in trouble there for a second.
1DI0022373	Happy birthday! We really surprised you, didn't we?
1DI0022374	Ha ha. Your dad was afraid you were onto us. But I told him not to worry. You're so easy to fool.
1DI0022375	Having fun, I hope?
1DI0022377	Go on, mingle!
1DI0022378	Isn't this great?
1DI0022379	Oh, hey, it's Jonas. Happy birthday! Sorry I couldn't be at your party. Listen, would you put your dad on?
1DI0022380	Can you put your dad on, please?
1DI0022381	What are you doing down here, young man? I thought kids weren't allowed down on the Reactor Level.
1DI0022382	What are you doing down here, young lady? I thought kids weren't allowed down on the Reactor Level.
1DI0022383	Your dad is waiting to give you your present. Or should we just keep it?
1DI0022384	Happy birthday, buddy. I hope you have fun with it.
1DI0022385	Happy birthday, darlin'. I hope you have fun with it.
1DI0022386	Go on, shoot something for me!
1DI0022387	Stand next to your dad and I'll get a nice picture of you and your new BB gun.
1DI0022388	There's no time to discuss it. Someone needs to activate the purifier now... Please!
1DI0022389	Well, that takes care of that.
1DI0022390	By now the Pride should be mopping up whatever opposition is left outside.
1DI0022391	Let's get this room secured.
1DI0022392	It's time for fighting, not for talking.
1DI0022393	If you're going to put the code in, hurry up and do it. Otherwise this place explodes, and everyone in the Wasteland is in danger.
1DI0022394	You have to give me that code. If you won't turn this thing on, you have to at least let me do it.
1DI0022395	Look, there's nothing more to be said. Cycle the airlock so I can get this over with.
1DI0022396	Get out of here as soon as you can. Get back to the Citadel where it's safe.
1DI0022397	Well, so much for celebrating.
1DI0022398	One of us is going to have to go in there and turn the damned thing on. And whoever does it isn't coming back out.
1DI0022399	Not exactly how I imagined going out, you know?
1DI0022400	So, what should we do? Draw straws?
1DI0022401	You're just going to let him leave like that?
1DI0022402	I can't believe you, of all people, would show mercy on him.
1DI0022403	The real kicker is that the boys outside will probably cut him down as soon as he opens the door.
1DI0022404	Now let's get this place locked down.
1DI0022405	I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you'd let him just walk away. It's amazing the world hasn't beaten that out of you.
1DI0022406	You'd just better hope it doesn't come back to bite you.
1DI0022409	I'll go along with it, but I don't like it.
1DI0022410	Let's get this room secured, and we'll call in the team.
1DI0022411	Let's make sure this area is locked down before we do anything else.
1DI0022412	You've already won. Allow me to leave with some dignity.
1DI0022413	You again.
1DI0022414	I can't say I'm surprised. You and your ilk seem hell-bent on destroying everything our government has worked to achieve.
1DI0022415	There's nothing to stop me from killing you this time. Let's end this.
1DI0022416	Let's get inside. Be careful -- they're probably pretty well dug-in. They've got to know we're coming by now.
1DI0022417	Stay sharp, and stick close to me until we're in the Control Room.
1DI0022418	Head for the control room, and keep your head down.
1DI0022419	Look, if we make it to the purifier we can chat then. Now's not exactly a good time.
1DI0022420	Are you ready now? We can't afford to keep standing around like this.
1DI0022421	Before we get started, I wanted to let you know that my father and I have been talking.
1DI0022422	The Pride and I have decided that after all you've survived, you've done enough to be an honorary member of Lyon's Pride.
1DI0022423	So congratulations. Membership comes with some privileges, including our Power Armor. You want the full suit, or the Recon armor?
1DI0022424	Please, I have much work to do. Talk to Sarah about your role in the assault.
1DI0022425	You're reporting to Sarah from here on out. Don't let her down.
1DI0022426	I'm sure you'll understand that there's far too much to be done right now. I've no time for chatting.
1DI0022427	I guess you'd better be on your way... Sorry for the uhh, for the interruption.
1DI0022428	They're not who they say they are... Get out while you can, before they get you too!
1DI0022429	If you're supposed to be meeting the President, then go do it. Get away from me.
1DI0022430	High-level functions offline. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Civilian is advised to secure FEV sample and exit the facility immediately.
1DI0022431	High-level functions offline. Self-destruct sequence initiated. Civilian is advised to exit the facility immediately.
1DI0022432	So, you're back. We had feared both you and the G.E.C.K. were lost. Were you successful?
1DI0022434	You're supposed to be in that holding cell. You're not going anywhere!
1DI0022435	There's a full complement of guards in the next room. As soon as I get them, you're going back to your cell. In a body bag, if necessary.
1DI0022436	I think you'd better leave now.
1DI0022437	You... What are you doing here?
1DI0022438	You... You're not supposed to be in here. What are you doing here?
1DI0022439	Ah, face to face at last. It's high time we met.
1DI0022440	I am quite pleased you were able to make it. The trip was not what I had intended, but serves as an adequate test of your abilities.
1DI0022441	You have the vial, and the task set before you. Shouldn't you be on your way now?
1DI0022442	Yes? You still haven't taken the vial yet. As I've said, I'll only allow you to leave once you have it.
1DI0022443	Why do you insist on making things difficult?
1DI0022444	Maybe I should start shooting. How much blood you think you can afford to lose before you tell me what I want to know?
1DI0022445	So, you're awake.
1DI0022446	Let's keep this nice and simple. You're going to tell me the code for that Purifier, and you're going to tell me now.
1DI0022447	No! It's all over me! I can feel it... it's invading my mind!
1DI0022448	Get out of my head! Get the FUCK OUT! Aaaaagh!
1DI0022449	Can't you SEE?! They're all dead! It's all my fault!
1DI0022450	Deciding to retrieve the device yourself was foolish when I was at your disposal, but so be it.
1DI0022451	Well, I'm afraid this is where you and I part company. I'll find my way out of this place, don't worry.
1DI0022452	Maybe we'll meet again somewhere in the Wasteland.
1DI0022453	Yes? What is it?
1DI0022454	As promised, here's the G.E.C.K. I hope it's worth it.
1DI0022457	I'm amazed by your bravado. The G.E.C.K. must be quite valuable to you.
1DI0022458	I advise you to wait for me outside the irradiated area.
1DI0022459	Accompanying me could prove quite fatal to you, my foolish friend.
1DI0022460	Okay. You stay here. Beyond this door, the hallways and chambers are flooded with radiation.
1DI0022461	I'll get the case and bring it right back. Keep your eyes open, many of my lesser-minded brethren are bound to stumble across us.
1DI0022462	What did you need?
1DI0022463	Finally... freedom! True freedom! I cannot thank you enough for this gift.
1DI0022464	You have no idea how long I've pictured this moment in my mind... and it feels far better than I'd imagined.
1DI0022465	Now, for my part of the bargain. Follow me.
1DI0022466	Is there something amiss? The door still seems to be sealed.
1DI0022467	Look, we both know you're here to obtain the G.E.C.K. Why don't we stop this charade and work together?
1DI0022468	It can't be!
1DI0022469	Either you are quite real, or I am going quite mad.
1DI0022470	Could you actually be a pure human?
1DI0022471	Back so soon? What is it now? Come to gawk at the caged animal?
1DI0022472	Thanks for helping us, mungo. You're not so bad for a mungo.
1DI0022473	We're going home now. You watch out, okay?
1DI0022474	Man, that sure was something. You're pretty brave, mungo!
1DI0022475	We can make it from here, no problem. But you watch your back. Those Slaver assholes aren't going to forget about you.
1DI0022476	Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo. We're gonna head back home now.
1DI0022477	I'd think twice about coming back here if I were you. These guys aren't going to forget you, y'know?
1DI0022478	We'll meet you outside, if you can make it!
1DI0022481	Oh geez, mungo! This is crazy!
1DI0022482	We're gonna run for it. You come meet us outside if you make it!
1DI0022483	Man, what a mess! Don't get yourself killed, mungo!
1DI0022484	I already shorted out the fence system so our collars won't blow. I bet they won't even notice.
1DI0022485	We're getting outta here!
1DI0022486	You got the gate, huh? Okay, we're outta here!
1DI0022487	Shoot a couple of those mungo ass-bag Slavers for me, will ya?
1DI0022488	Man, you've made a mess. Go get 'em, mungo! Get that key!
1DI0022489	You go take care of the bad guys. I'll just stay out here, and.... stay out of the way.
1DI0022490	I guess you decided to do this your own way, huh?
1DI0022491	Well, now you've really done it. They're gonna kill you if they can, so you better kill them all first.
1DI0022492	Get the key for the slave pen gate off of the boss mungo, or that Forty asshole. If you can unlock the gate, we'll make a run for it.
1DI0022493	Oh man, they're gonna be mad at you! These Slaver guys are mean!
1DI0022494	Listen, you gotta help us. Me and my friends... We gotta get home. Can you help? Can you get us out of here?
1DI0022495	You gonna help, or what? Squirrel and Penny are still in there.
1DI0022496	Well, I guess that's it. Thanks for getting us out of there, mungo.
1DI0022497	We're going back home now. You ever come out that way, you stop and say hi. I'll tell Mayor not to shoot you okay?
1DI0022500	Not bad, mungo. Not bad at all.
1DI0022501	I told you I had a good plan. It sure worked, didn't it? You ever need anything, you go see MacCready in Lamplight. He'll help you out.
1DI0022502	Thanks, mungo.
1DI0022503	Thanks for getting us out of there. If you ever need anything, you come see us.
1DI0022504	Mayor will be nice to you. I'll make sure of it.
1DI0022505	So you got us out of there, huh?
1DI0022506	Not so bad for a mungo, I guess.
1DI0022507	So, uhh. Thanks and stuff. We're gonna head home soon.
1DI0022508	You need something, sugar?
1DI0022509	What you want?
1DI0022510	Thanks for getting me out of there. I owe you one.
1DI0022511	Now you get back in there and make sure Penny stays safe. I'll try and contact her sometime, if I can. I need to lay low for a while.
1DI0022513	Listen, there are kids in there. You've gotta get them out too, if you can. Just be careful.
1DI0022514	I'm gonna lay low for a while. As soon as they realize I'm gone, they're going to come looking for me. Thanks again.
1DI0022515	I gotta get someplace safe.
1DI0022517	Who the hell are you?
1DI0022518	You again. What are you doing?
1DI0022519	Get outta here! They see me talking to you, I'm dead!
1DI0022520	Is Rory safe yet?
1DI0022521	You're the mungo that helped Sammy and Squirrel, aren't you?
1DI0022522	Well I already told them, I'm not going anywhere. Not without Rory.
1DI0022523	Just leave me alone. I don't care about stupid escape plans. We're stuck here for good.
1DI0022524	So what's the deal, mungo?
1DI0022526	I ain't supposed to say anything. Sammy says so.
1DI0022527	Nice going, mungo. Let's go before they change their minds.
1DI0022528	Sammy says not to talk to you.
1DI0022529	I guess we can go home now. Let's go.
1DI0022530	Well, I guess this is one way to do it. We could've escaped, you know.
1DI0022531	What the hell, lady? We're not going anywhere with you! You don't own us!
1DI0022532	What the hell, mister? We're not going anywhere with you! You don't own us!
1DI0022533	If we're going to leave, then let's get it over with.
1DI0022534	Well, well. The budding entrepreneur returns!
1DI0022535	Now see? This is what I want for the world. For men and women to make their own way, find their own paths to success.
1DI0022536	What can Paradise Falls do for you today?
1DI0022537	You must be our prospective customer. I do hope Paradise Falls can accommodate your needs.
1DI0022538	We make no judgments, no assumptions. We understand that it's a harsh world out there, and you do what you must to make it.
1DI0022539	Now, was there something specific you were interested in?
1DI0022540	...the fuck you lookin' at? Huh?
1DI0022541	I'm busy, so piss off. You got business here, you talk to Eulogy.
1DI0022542	We got a reason to be talkin' I ain't aware of?
1DI0022543	I thought we was pretty clear about our relationship.
1DI0022544	See, here's how it goes: you stay the hell outta my way, and I don't shoot you in the face. Seems clear to me.
1DI0022545	Funny that you're still talkin', when I'm pretty sure I told you to get lost.
1DI0022546	So you gonna take care of that guard, or what?
1DI0022547	My hands are tied here. It's not like I want to be working with a mungo like you, but I got no choice. Come on.
1DI0022548	You're the mungo that's helping us, huh?
1DI0022549	Sammy says you want to know the plan. Well listen up, mungo, because it's a good one. I'm super smart.
1DI0022550	What's up, mungo? You fixed that terminal yet?
1DI0022551	Come on, mungo. You gonna fix that terminal, or what?
1DI0022552	Hey, mister. Can you get us out of here?
1DI0022553	Hey, lady. Can you get us out of here?
1DI0022554	So, you getting us free or what?
1DI0022555	Oh God, mister. You gotta help us. You gotta get us out of here!
1DI0022556	Oh God, lady. You gotta help us. You gotta get us out of here!
1DI0022557	You gotta help. You just gotta.
1DI0022558	I can't keep talking to you, or else he'll shoot me.
1DI0022559	Okay, there you go. The computer is on again. Dunno what good it'll do you.
1DI0022560	I'll get that computer turned on for you.
1DI0022561	You have my condolences. Your father was a good man.
1DI0022562	Please, not now.
1DI0022563	Follow me. I'll show you what I can about Vault 87.
1DI0022564	This map shows the locations of all known Vaults in the local area. Vault 87 has been highlighted for you, there.
1DI0022565	Entrance to Vault 87 will be particularly difficult for you, I'm afraid.
1DI0022566	Did you have any success with that old terminal?
1DI0022567	Ah, you're back. You need something else now?
1DI0022568	Yes? Is there something I can help you with?
1DI0022569	I'm afraid I have other duties to attend to right now. If you find the computer to be helpful, there may be more I can offer.
1DI0022570	May I start by saying that I am sorry for your loss. I was acquainted with your father, many years ago.
1DI0022571	The world has lost one of its few remaining visionaries.
1DI0022572	I... I need to rest. Lie down, or something. This is just too much.
1DI0022573	Rothchild should help you. But don't forget that he's Brotherhood. I've never trusted them. Be careful what you tell them.
1DI0022574	I need to collect my wits, and figure out what to do next. Excuse me.
1DI0022575	Can't you see I'm trying to have a conversation?
1DI0022576	There must be something they can do.
1DI0022577	Come with me. We need to talk to the leaders at once; they have to know what's happened out there.
1DI0022579	I need to speak with Scribe Rothchild and Elder Lyons. They must be told what is going on.
1DI0022580	This ain't a tourist trap. You civilians get topside immediately!
1DI0022581	We need to get this resolved, and fast. We're too exposed like this. We need to keep moving.
1DI0022582	What the hell are we standing around for? If Garza can't make it, then we need to go without him. This is crazy!
1DI0022583	All right, you should be just outside the pipe that's been giving us trouble.
1DI0022584	Now don't worry, this isn't dangerous at all.
1DI0022585	Just get inside and use the manual controls to drain the pipe. That'll break up the debris enough for the filters to function properly.
1DI0022586	Get to the museum level and use the intercom there. I'll talk you through cycling the airlock on the intake pipe.
1DI0022587	There are a few minor repairs still to be made up here in the control room. Why don't you come back here and give me a hand?
1DI0022588	Actually, wait. There's one other thing I need you to do. Janice says there's a blockage in one of the intake pipes.
1DI0022589	It's on your way back; head back up to the museum level and give me a call on the intercom when you get there.
1DI0022590	Well, you've done it. It'll just be a few minutes until we can access the mainframe. Use the intercom so I can tell you where to go next.
1DI0022594	With the fuses in place, you should be able to access the mainframe. No need to come back to the control room; just head right there.
1DI0022595	Great work on the pumps. Hurry back and I'll give you the fuses you'll need.
1DI0022596	How are you holding up? Need directions?
1DI0022597	Everything all right?
1DI0022598	You're doing great out there. Keep it up.
1DI0022599	I better not ever find out that you or your father had something to do with this. If I even think you sold us out...
1DI0022600	This isn't what I had in mind when I came back here.
1DI0022601	Thank God someone else made it out. What the hell is going on? Who are those guys? Did I hear gunshots?
1DI0022602	We'll make it out of here, right? I don't want to die down here.
1DI0022603	After all that, you just kill the man? What is wrong with you?
1DI0022604	You monster! How could you do that to him!
1DI0022605	I am sorry. I cannot continue. I need to rest for a while.
1DI0022606	My heart... All this stress... I was not expecting any of this. I need to rest.
1DI0022607	Now is not a good time to be talking.
1DI0022608	I can't leave Garza here in this condition. We're not going anywhere until he's been helped.
1DI0022609	We can't go any further. We need to stop.
1DI0022611	Don't wander off. We're going to need you.
1DI0022612	We have to make it to the tunnel. Follow me, and stay quiet!
1DI0022613	Didn't your dad tell you about the blockage? I thought you'd be off taking care of that now.
1DI0022614	You really should go fix that blockage before something bad happens.
1DI0022615	Just be careful what you touch in here, okay? The equipment's old enough as it is.
1DI0022616	So you're going to make sure it's safe for us in there? That's really brave of you.
1DI0022617	This is kind of exciting, isn't it? I've always heard Doctor Li talk about Project Purity, but I never thought I'd be going there.
1DI0022618	Well, at least now we're not completely doomed. Thanks for taking care of those beasts.
1DI0022619	I'm sure it's not safe in there, but how safe is it for us to be standing around out here?
1DI0022620	I don't know if I like this. I understand it's important to Doctor Li, but isn't going to Project Purity dangerous?
1DI0022621	I thank you for risking your life to make sure we are safe.
1DI0022622	Now we must worry about mutants as well? Perhaps we should have stayed at Rivet City.
1DI0022623	I am unsure how useful I will be at this Purity Project, but I am happy to do whatever I can to help Doctor Li.
1DI0022625	Listen, I know who you are, okay? Far as I'm concerned, you've got no business being here. So just stay out of my way.
1DI0022626	Yeah, what do you want?
1DI0022627	Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you go worry about whatever it is you're supposed to be doing, and leave me alone.
1DI0022628	Hey there. I hear we have you to thank for getting us up and running again!
1DI0022629	Hey there, little lady. What's going on?
1DI0022630	Hey there, bud. What's going on?
1DI0022631	James... he's gone...
1DI0022632	We have to get out of here. They'll be coming for us next. We've got to evacuate now!
1DI0022633	What is he doing in there?
1DI0022634	I've been hearing good things about you.
1DI0022635	Is it true? Did you really disarm the bomb in Megaton?
1DI0022636	I think we need to talk.
1DI0022637	I've been... hearing things. Things that have happened out there.
1DI0022638	Megaton destroyed... You... You didn't have anything to do with that, did you?
1DI0022639	I know there's a lot going on right now. This is all very sudden.
1DI0022640	I just want you to know that I'm here if you want to talk. You seem troubled, like there's a cloud hanging over you.
1DI0022642	I just wanted to say... I wanted to say that I'm proud of you. You're a good person, and it shows.
1DI0022643	It's essential that you get to the pipes as soon as you can. We can't allow the pressure to build up, or it could be a disaster.
1DI0022644	I'll be here for you when you get back.
1DI0022645	Please, hurry. Once the blockage is cleared up, we'll be in good shape.
1DI0022647	You didn't have to come all the way back here, you know. You could've just gone right to the mainframe.
1DI0022648	Replace those fuses. Otherwise we'll never get the doors open, and there's no chance of getting the mainframe running.
1DI0022649	So the pumps are working, and some of the doors are opened. We're making progress.
1DI0022650	Problem is that the water shorted out a few key fuse boxes. Here, take these fuses and replace the ones that have burnt out.
1DI0022651	Once you get the Flood Control Pumps activated, that'll clear out some of the water and make it easier for us to see what else has gone wrong.
1DI0022652	Let's get to the control room and assess the situation. We can talk more there.
1DI0022653	Are you all right? Is it safe in there?
1DI0022654	We can't accomplish anything until we can get inside, but none of us are particularly capable fighters.
1DI0022655	I hate to ask you to put yourself in harm's way, but you seem to have learned to handle yourself.
1DI0022656	I need you to go in and make sure it's safe for Doctor Li and her crew.
1DI0022657	I still need your help. I can't do this without you, you know.
1DI0022658	Here we are. Where it all began. You remember your mother's favorite passage?
1DI0022659	Revelation 21:6. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life, freely.
1DI0022660	Don't you see? This is what it all means. The water, the purifier. THIS is the water of life. Your mother's dream.
1DI0022661	No point in wasting time. Let's get to work. There's much to be done.
1DI0022662	I'm not trying to put you off, but we need to get to Project Purity. Anything else can wait until later.
1DI0022663	We need to get back to Project Purity. The computer there is our best chance to locate a G.E.C.K.
1DI0022664	Give me a few moments to speak with Madison. Then we can decide on a course of action. Have patience.
1DI0022665	Yeah? You need something?
1DI0022666	You found him! I can't believe it!
1DI0022667	You have my thanks. We would be lost without James.
1DI0022668	What can I do for you?
1DI0022669	My goodness... You must be James' daughter. You look so much like him.
1DI0022670	I'm surprised to see you here. He gave me the impression that you were... somewhere else, and that we wouldn't be seeing you again.
1DI0022671	If you're here to talk to him, I'm afraid he's come and gone. The last I knew, he was headed back to the lab.
1DI0022672	My goodness... You must be James' son. You look so much like him.
1DI0022675	Good to see you again, honey.
1DI0022676	Good to see you again, son.
1DI0022678	I need to reach Madison as soon as possible. Now I can make her see that Project Purity is worth finishing.
1DI0022679	Surely you have someplace better to be than hanging around my classroom?
1DI0022680	They say the G.O.A.T. never lies... According to this, you're slated to be the next vault chaplain. God help us all.
1DI0022681	Well, according to this, you're in line to be trained as a Laundry Cannon Operator. First time for everything, indeed.
1DI0022682	It's nice to know I can still be surprised. Pedicurist! I might have guessed manicurist or even masseuse, but apparently you're a foot person.
1DI0022683	It says here you're perfectly suited for a career as a Waste Management Specialist. A specialist, mind you, not just a dabbler. Congratulations!
1DI0022684	Huh. "Vault Loyalty Inspector"... I thought that had been phased out decades ago. Well, sounds like a job right up your alley, hmm?
1DI0022685	Interesting. "Clinical Test Subject"... sounds like something you should excel at. I guess you and your dad will be working together.
1DI0022686	Looks like the diner's going to get a new Fry Cook. I'll just say this once: hold the mustard, extra pickles. Ha ha ha.
1DI0022687	Thank goodness. We're finally getting a new Jukebox Technician. That thing hasn't worked right since old Joe Palmer passed.
1DI0022688	Well, well. Pip-Boy Programmer, eh? Stanley will finally have someone to talk shop with.
1DI0022689	Huh. I wonder who will be brave enough to be your first customer as the vault's new Tattoo Artist? I promise it won't be me.
1DI0022690	Apparently you're management material. You're going to be trained as a Shift Supervisor.
1DI0022691	Could I be talking to the next Overseer? Stranger things have happened.
1DI0022692	Wow. Wow. Says here you're going to be the vault's Marriage Counselor.
1DI0022693	Almost makes me want to get married, just to be able to avail myself of your services.
1DI0022694	I always thought you'd have a career in professional sports. You're the new vault Little League coach! Congratulations.
1DI0022695	Looks like you'll be putting your ... physical talents to good use as the vault's new Masseuse.
1DI0022696	All set, eh? You shouldn't have had any trouble with this little formality.
1DI0022697	You managed to answer all the questions, I see. That's a good start. Maybe a bit more than I expected given your grades.
1DI0022698	Well, you made it. All set for the G.O.A.T.? Trust me, it really isn't that bad. Just something everybody has to go through.
1DI0022699	Do you mind? I know to you it's just meaningless jabber, but I'm actually trying to teach here.
1DI0022700	Feel free to stick around if you want, but I don't want you disrupting the test.
1DI0022701	As soon as everyone takes their seats we can get started.
1DI0022702	No more excuses from you children! Go in and sit down.
1DI0022703	Buzz off, nosebleed.
1DI0022704	You're all right, kid. See you around.
1DI0022705	We'll talk to your little friend... later. Ha ha ha.
1DI0022706	This isn't over, punk.
1DI0022707	I look like I want to chit-chat, nosebleed? What, you want another beating?
1DI0022708	Hey, look. It's smart mouth. Afraid I ain't got time for your fancy words right now. So beat it.
1DI0022709	Look, I'm not looking to rumble with you. How about we just stay out of each other's business, like usual.
1DI0022710	Yeah? What do you want?
1DI0022711	Don't mess with the Tunnel Snakes.
1DI0022712	What is it, feeb?
1DI0022713	Look, square, I already told you: we got nothin' to say to each other.
1DI0022714	Leave me alone, you little spaz.
1DI0022716	What? What do you want, nerd?
1DI0022717	Oh look, it's Doc's kid. Great. What you do want, nerdboy?
1DI0022718	Oh look, it's Doc's kid. Great. What you do want, nerdgirl?
1DI0022719	You again! What'd I tell you about talking to me, huh? I don't want to catch a case of the nerd from you!
1DI0022720	Hey, hey, hey, sport! It's been a while since you stopped in here to see us! It's the big G.O.A.T. day today, right?
1DI0022721	Good luck with the G.O.A.T., buddy!
1DI0022722	Good luck with the G.O.A.T., cutie!
1DI0022723	Shh. I'm trying to concentrate.
1DI0022724	I heard what you said. Why would you do that? Just leave me alone!
1DI0022725	Thanks for your help, jerk. It's good to know I can count on you when I'm in trouble.
1DI0022726	Thank God that's over. Come on, let's go get some lunch.
1DI0022727	Thanks for getting rid of them. Assholes.
1DI0022728	I don't know why they won't leave me alone. Just because my father is the Overseer, I guess. Idiots.
1DI0022729	Stupid Tunnel Snakes! Immature assholes, if you ask me.
1DI0022730	Why won't they leave me alone? It's not my fault my father's the Overseer. I don't care about their stupid gang!
1DI0022731	Can you talk to them? Maybe Butch will listen to you. Please?
1DI0022732	Go on, now. You've got a G.O.A.T. to take.
1DI0022733	Come on, pal. You're fine, and you know it.
1DI0022734	You're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy.
1DI0022735	So, you need to get to class and take your G.O.A.T. exam. No excuses.
1DI0022736	Come on, honey. You're fine, and you know it.
1DI0022737	You're a perfectly healthy 16-year-old girl.
1DI0022739	<coughs>You'd better stay away... I don't want you to catch what I've got.
1DI0022740	I'm a little worried <coughs> I hope Jonas can take a look at me soon.
1DI0022741	Hey, what did you put for #10?
1DI0022742	Stop bothering me, I've just got to figure out this last one!
1DI0022743	I can't figure out #5. First I think I should listen to my grandmother. But then, isn't killing someone wrong?
1DI0022744	I'm thinking of going with "Overseer" for the last one. What did you put?
1DI0022745	Hey, why don't you have to take the test?
1DI0022746	You nervous? I'm not.
1DI0022747	Shh!
1DI0022748	We're not friends. We're never going to be friends. Got it?
1DI0022749	Right now, I don't pay any attention to you. You really want to keep it that way, okay?
1DI0022750	I hope you weren't just talking to me.
1DI0022751	Mr. Brotch is a big fat liar!
1DI0022752	Do you mind? I'm trying to pay attention.
1DI0022753	Oh. Hi. Why are you talking to me?
1DI0022754	Stand aside, comrade, while we deal with these Imperialist dogs.
1DI0022755	The Henderson estate is in tip-top shape, young master. Have a wonderful day!
1DI0022756	The Henderson estate is in tip-top shape, young miss. Have a wonderful day!
1DI0022758	How could Roger accuse me of something like that? What is wrong with him?
1DI0022759	Why would Roger do such a thing? It doesn't make sense...
1DI0022760	How did it come to this? I just don't understand...
1DI0022761	Daddy..... why.... [crying]
1DI0022762	Mommy..... why.... [crying]
1DI0022764	Do you realize what you've done? You've triggered the Failsafe! Ruined everything! The subjects will die, and I'll be stuck here in this hell! Alone!
1DI0022765	You've ruined everything! EVERYTHING!
1DI0022766	I exist to serve.
1DI0022767	I've given you permission to leave. I suggest you take the opportunity before I change my mind.
1DI0022768	I'm even being so gracious as to allow your father to exit as well. His presence here failed to amuse me some time ago.
1DI0022769	Most enjoyable. Most enjoyable indeed. I haven't felt this exhilarated in years.
1DI0022770	A commendable start, but you still have work to do.
1DI0022771	Quite a clever interpretation of the rules. I'll have to reset the system to restore Martha, but it's well worth the effort.
1DI0022772	You have taken a far greater interest in these little games than your father did. He found the whole thing beneath him.
1DI0022773	Listen, you can't hurt people here, okay?
1DI0022774	At least, not unless I say it's okay. It's against the rules! I can fix it, but you better not do it again.
1DI0022775	Stop hurting people without me telling you to. You're ruining all the fun!
1DI0022776	I'll fix it again, but you're making me sad.
1DI0022777	As amusing as it may be, you cannot simply wander around killing the residents of Tranquility Lane.
1DI0022778	I shall have to reset portions of the system to correct this.
1DI0022779	I can return the people of Tranquility Lane to life, but anything else you have meddled with will stay as it was. Do keep that in mind.
1DI0022780	I believe we've discussed this already. I appreciate the fervor with which you approach things, but indiscriminate killing impedes our fun.
1DI0022781	I shall again reset portions of the system to undo your mistakes.
1DI0022782	What are you doing? I didn't tell you to kill him!
1DI0022783	If I wanted you to kill him, I'd have told you to do that. Gosh, you're slow.
1DI0022784	Lucky for you, you get another chance.
1DI0022785	You shouldn't be here, little one.
1DI0022786	Betty... You need to talk to Betty. She's waiting for you.
1DI0022787	You... You don't belong here. You're not supposed to be here!
1DI0022788	It's not real, none of it! It needs to end... The suffering must end!
1DI0022789	Remember what I told you. The Failsafe. You've got to find it!
1DI0022790	This has to end.
1DI0022791	What... What the hell is this?
1DI0022792	You're doing quite well. Really, this is all terribly amusing. Keep at it...
1DI0022793	You're certainly looking the part. Don't waste time chatting... There's mayhem to be caused!
1DI0022794	Don't you have a few things you should be collecting? Get the knife and the mask from the dog house.
1DI0022795	Appliances certainly can be dangerous, can't they?
1DI0022796	You are most resourceful, and you certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
1DI0022797	And now, we come to the last task that I have for you. Succeed, and you shall be granted whatever you wish.
1DI0022798	A roller skate, on the stairs? Oh my, that is simply inspired.
1DI0022801	Poor Mabel, killed by her own robot. I suspect she never saw that coming.
1DI0022804	Well done, well done!
1DI0022805	You certainly do get results. You have exceeded my expectations.
1DI0022807	I expected more creative results from you. Mabel awaits you for another try.
1DI0022808	I appreciate that you're trying, but so far I am unimpressed with the results. Give it another go.
1DI0022809	Not quite what I had in mind. But you get a chance to try again. Go to it!
1DI0022810	See to it that Mabel meets an untimely, and hopefully gruesome, demise.
1DI0022811	I've told you what I want from you. I want to see some creativity. And I want to see Mabel dead.
1DI0022812	Are you through pouting?
1DI0022813	You have turned out to be quite resourceful, it seems. I am slightly impressed.
1DI0022814	I enjoy your company far more than your father's. He responded quite negatively to my requests.
1DI0022815	So you have achieved your goal. I was hoping for something a bit more dramatic, but persuasion appears to be your strong suit.
1DI0022816	And at least you are cooperative, unlike your father. I was most disappointed when he refused to participate, yet still expected something from me.
1DI0022817	I'm curious to see how you deal with the Rockwells.
1DI0022818	Don't you have something you should be doing now?
1DI0022819	Are we willing to be reasonable now? I ask so very little of you.
1DI0022820	Ha ha! Did you see him crying! What a big baby!
1DI0022821	You have won the game, and so you get a prize. You may ask of me a single question, and I shall answer you.
1DI0022822	You did it, even though you said you wouldn't. You're tricky!
1DI0022823	Murdering Timmy's parent? Very inventive. I approve.
1DI0022824	And with that, you win a prize. You may ask a single question of me, and receive an honest answer.
1DI0022825	You did it! I knew you could!
1DI0022826	And a particularly brutal way to deal with it, at that. Very effective.
1DI0022828	You sure showed him, didn't you?
1DI0022829	I suppose it wasn't the most cerebral way to deal with the situation, but it was definitely effective. Consider the game won.
1DI0022830	And with that, you win a prize. Your prize is one question, which I will answer to the best of my ability.
1DI0022831	And you said you didn't want to play...
1DI0022832	I was hoping for more than fisticuffs, but entertainment has been difficult to come by lately. Consider the game won.
1DI0022834	Decided you want to play after all, huh?
1DI0022835	I had a feeling you'd come around. Your approach was somewhat uninspired, but it'll do.
1DI0022836	Since you won the game, you get a prize. You may ask one question, which I will answer as honestly as possible.
1DI0022837	I thought you didn't want to play. But you went and did it anyway. Good for you! Wasn't it fun?
1DI0022838	A clever approach. I'm not sure I would have considered it. Very encouraging.
1DI0022839	Your reward for winning the game is to ask a single question. I will answer honestly and frankly.
1DI0022840	Yay, you did it! Good job!
1DI0022843	Yay! I knew you could do it!
1DI0022844	Perhaps not the most inventive approach, but persuasion can be quite powerful. Well done.
1DI0022845	And for winning the game, you get a prize. You get to ask one question, and receive an honest answer.
1DI0022846	Timmy's back, so you can try again. Don't take too long, or the game won't be fun anymore.
1DI0022847	You're mean! I hate you!
1DI0022848	Hi there. I'm Timmy. Want to play?
1DI0022849	Hi. Want to play?
1DI0022850	You're supposed to be making Timmy cry. You can do it, I know you can!
1DI0022851	When you win the game, maybe we can talk some more.
1DI0022852	You don't want to play my game, so I don't want to talk to you.
1DI0022853	You don't want to play with me. So I don't want to talk to you, and you're never going to find your daddy. Boo hoo hoo.
1DI0022854	Oh, someone new to play with! What good luck I have lately!
1DI0022855	I was just starting to get bored. Oh, we're going to have so much fun!
1DI0022856	Can we play now? I've been waiting. I've been ever so patient.
1DI0022857	You probably oughta go talk to Betty, kiddo. Don't want to keep her waiting!
1DI0022858	She's out there on the playground, probably looking for you. Run along now.
1DI0022859	Have you talked to Betty? I think she's waiting for you.
1DI0022860	You really shouldn't keep her waiting. She'll probably be on the playground. Run along now.
1DI0022861	Oh, hello there.
1DI0022862	I think you should go speak with Betty. She's waiting for you... On the playground, I think. Best to hurry up.
1DI0022863	Hiya, kid.
1DI0022864	You might want to go talk to Betty before you wander around too much. She's waiting for you.
1DI0022865	Hello there. Good to see you.
1DI0022866	I think Betty is waiting for you on the playground. You'll want to go talk to her.
1DI0022867	Hello there, dear. Beautiful weather we're having, wouldn't you say?
1DI0022868	I think Betty is waiting for you at the playground. You really should go pay her a visit.
1DI0022869	Hey there, sport! Beautiful day, isn't it?
1DI0022870	Say, you should go talk to Betty. She's waiting for you over on the playground. Have fun, sport!
1DI0022871	What can I do for you, sport?
1DI0022872	Hiya, kiddo! What's the good word?
1DI0022873	Hey there, sport. How's it going?
1DI0022874	Hey there, little lady. How's it going?
1DI0022875	Hello, sweetie. How are you?
1DI0022876	Well hi there!
1DI0022877	Good day to you!
1DI0022878	You've saved me. I was afraid I'd be trapped in there forever.
1DI0022879	It's so good to see you, but... What are you DOING here?
1DI0022880	Son... You've saved me. I was afraid I'd be trapped in there forever.
1DI0022882	I guess it's my turn to thank you.
1DI0022883	Anyway, the area's secure, so you're free to talk to Three Dog if you need to.
1DI0022884	By the way, because you helped us I'm going to let you wear that Power Armor. But don't you ever forget where it came from.
1DI0022887	Look, I don't know who you are but you don't belong here.
1DI0022888	The Super Mutants have overrun our brothers at the Galaxy News Radio building, and we're headed there to back them up.
1DI0022889	You can tag along if you want. But keep your head down and try not to do anything... stupid.
1DI0022890	You can follow us as far as GNR. But keep your head down if you don't want it to get blown off.
1DI0022891	No offense, but I'm a little busy saving your ass right now.
1DI0022893	Welcome, friend. My brothers may be gruff but they will lay down their lives for you.
1DI0022894	You don't need to worry. We're the best outfit in the whole Brotherhood of Steel. Just watch what we do to these Uglies.
1DI0022895	Colin Moriarty, at your service! Welcome to Moriarty's! My saloon, my home, my slice of heaven in this backwoods little burg.
1DI0022896	If you've got the caps, I've got your pleasure. Please, sit down, make yourself comfortable. Your troubles are a thing of the past.
1DI0022897	Colin Moriarty. Always pleased to see a new face. But I'm afraid you've had the misfortune to catch me, well... out of me element.
1DI0022898	I'm the owner and proprietor of Moriarty's, you see. The saloon?
1DI0022899	But, please! See for yourself! Come by for a drink or twelve. You and I, oh, we're going to be fast friends. Fast friends!
1DI0022900	What is it I can do for you?
1DI0022901	Ahhh... my new friend. What can I get you? Some sorrows are best buried, and I'm a man that can provide all sorts of tools to bury them.
1DI0022902	And back he comes. So... are you just thirsty, or are you ready to pay me fee? Dear dad's not going to find himself.
1DI0022903	And back she comes. So, are you just thirsty, or are you ready to pay me fee? Dear dad's not going to find himself.
1DI0022904	What's it to be? A few caps to find out where your father went? Or are you going to have a go of it on your own?
1DI0022905	The Wasteland can be such an unforgiving place....
1DI0022906	No luck finding dear old dad? Can't say it surprises me. Wasteland's a big place. Maybe you need a drink.
1DI0022907	You're still standing here, and I can't think why. You know where your father went. Seems to me you ought to be out searching the Wastes.
1DI0022908	I hope you're here to turn yourself in, young man. You're already in enough trouble as it is. Don't make it worse for yourself.
1DI0022909	I hope you're here to turn yourself in, young lady. You're already in enough trouble as it is. Don't make it worse for yourself.
1DI0022910	I have nothing else to say to you.
1DI0022911	Please, just go. I already said everything I had to say.
1DI0022912	I'm waiting to make sure you leave. Now get going.
1DI0022913	Leave me alone. I have to... take care of my father...
1DI0022914	Go on! Before security comes. Be careful out there!
1DI0022915	I'm just waiting for you to leave so I can close the door and go back to pretending my life is perfect.
1DI0022916	There's nothing else for you here. You're an outsider now. You know, the people who are supposed to stay on the other side of this door.
1DI0022917	Please, you need to go before someone comes. Be careful out there.
1DI0022918	I thought you didn't need my help. The door's open. Go through it.
1DI0022919	You told me to get out of your way, so I'm going. Goodbye.
1DI0022920	Don't bother trying to apologize. Just get out of here before it's too late!
1DI0022921	You've got to get out of here. Someone's sure to come see what's going on. Take care!
1DI0022922	Good. You're leaving. I guess you were trying to help me. But you... You didn't have to kill him!
1DI0022923	I didn't think I would make it... My father, he... Officer Mack... I didn't tell them anything, I swear...
1DI0022924	When the warning sirens came on, they all ran out. I guess that was you. I see you got the door open. That's good.
1DI0022925	Were you going to leave without even saying goodbye?
1DI0022926	You did it! You opened the door! My God, I almost didn't believe it was possible.
1DI0022927	My God, what have you done? You killed him! Why would you kill my father?
1DI0022928	Get away from me! I can't talk to you right now.
1DI0022929	Oh my God. I had no idea my father would... I had no choice. Officer Mack, he...
1DI0022930	Here. Take it. I don't want it any more. I don't know what I'd do if still had the gun and my father came looking for me.
1DI0022931	Thank God you came along when you did. I don't know what I might have done...
1DI0022932	Here. Take the gun. I don't want to find out what I'd do if I still had the gun when my father comes looking for me.
1DI0022933	You'd better get out of here. I'll try to meet you at the vault door. If I don't make it... good luck.
1DI0022934	Thank you! I told you my father wasn't himself. I don't know what he might have done if you hadn't come along.
1DI0022936	You need to go. I'll try to meet you by the vault door. Be careful.
1DI0022937	You need to get moving. And be careful -- the security men are everywhere.
1DI0022938	Come on, you've got to wake up!
1DI0022939	Well, look who's come crawling back. What do you want?
1DI0022940	Back again? Did you forget something?
1DI0022941	What are you waiting for? You said you'd help her!
1DI0022942	You coming too? Hey, I could sure use some help. Come on!
1DI0022943	It's no use! I've got to get away from these damned roaches!
1DI0022944	Did you change your mind? Are you going to help my mom after all?
1DI0022945	We did it! My mom's gonna be okay! You're the best friend I've ever had, man!
1DI0022946	Hey, I know it isn't much, but I want you to have my Tunnel Snakes jacket. Go ahead, take it.
1DI0022947	You're the best, man. The best. Everything's gonna be okay now, thanks to you!
1DI0022948	She's dead! She's dead and you could have helped and you didn't. Get away from me!
1DI0022949	Just go away and leave me alone.
1DI0022950	You gotta help me! My mom's trapped in there with the Radroaches!
1DI0022951	You're lucky it was me who found you. The others won't be so forgiving.
1DI0022952	I don't know what you're up to and I don't want to know. Just clear out of here and I'll pretend I never saw you.
1DI0022953	Come on, kid, get out of here before you get us both killed!
1DI0022954	Just keep your hands where I can see them.
1DI0022955	Where did those ... things... come from? Ugh. I need another drink.
1DI0022956	Come on, sit down and have a drink with me.
1DI0022957	God! I could really use a drink right now!
1DI0022958	Me and Andy were in a tight spot there, ain't no mistake. Good thing he loves toasting roaches so much.
1DI0022959	I'm not sure how I could help.
1DI0022960	Those nasty roaches have gotten my circuits in such a frazzle!
1DI0022961	We're getting out of here. Now's our chance!
1DI0022962	Tom wouldn't listen to me. You know how he gets.
1DI0022963	I'm guessing that you've come about the notice. You know, I've heard about you.
1DI0022964	You're not bad people, from what I understand. And the Regulators can always use good folks.
1DI0022965	So, what do you say? You read the notice, and you're here, so I'm guessing that you want to ride with us. Am I right?
1DI0022966	You live the life of a Regulator. You're an example to all.
1DI0022967	Word reaches across the Wastes of your deeds. I am honored to have you among us.
1DI0022968	It's always good to see one of our number here. Have you brought tales and trophies of justice?
1DI0022969	The Regulators welcome you back.
1DI0022970	The unrighteous will be punished.
1DI0022971	We bring law to a lawless land.
1DI0022972	We are justice. We are the law.
1DI0022973	Sonora is our leader. Speak with her.
1DI0022974	Stay true to yourself and to the law. This is the rule of the Regulator.
1DI0022975	Well, hello there. I assume that you've come about the contract that we're offering.
1DI0022976	We're always pleased to see a new associate. Welcome. A most hearty welcome to our little business.
1DI0022977	You may darken our doorstep at any time, so long as you bring me what I ask for.
1DI0022978	Welcome! Welcome back! What do you have for us today?
1DI0022979	Why look who it is! My favorite associate! Have you brought me what I need?
1DI0022980	It's you! We always have time for our favorite employee!
1DI0022981	Speak to Mr. Littlehorn.
1DI0022982	We can't help you. Only Mr. Littlehorn can help you.
1DI0022983	I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you.
1DI0022984	Busy. So busy. Busy busy bee.
1DI0022985	No time. Must work. No time. Must work...
1DI0022986	Too busy. So busy. Never stop...
1DI0022987	Leave me out of that girl's crazy experiments. I don't get paid enough for that.
1DI0022988	I'm just here to make sure nothing goes wrong. With you or her.
1DI0022989	This place is a whole lot quieter, now. Thanks, I guess.
1DI0022990	I got nothing to say to you.
1DI0022991	Could you come back in an hour or two? Even geniuses need their sleep.
1DI0022992	Well, whaddya know? It worked! I mean, I was pretty sure it would, obviously.
1DI0022993	Here, take a few radiation Chems with you. I'm sure you'll run into more in the future.
1DI0022994	Well, you're alive... That's the good news. But there was a little side effect. A teeny, tiny, um, mutation. But it seems to be benign, at least.
1DI0022995	Here, take a few radiation Chems, as my little way of saying, "I'm sorry I twisted your DNA like a kitten with a ball of yarn."
1DI0022996	No mess, no problem! Well, a bit of a mess. But no problem, regardless!
1DI0022997	Here. You know, for next time you get hurt, and I'm not around.
1DI0022998	Okay, I even stitched a little smiley-face in you, to keep up your spirits. It's kind of hard to see from your side, though.
1DI0022999	Here, take this environment suit of mine. It will help with medical tasks, and it should help prevent the effects of exposure, too.
1DI0023000	Hey, I hear you're that stray from the Vault! I haven't seen one of you for years!
1DI0023001	Good to meet you! I'm Moira Brown. I run Craterside Supply, but what I really do is mostly tinkering and research.
1DI0023002	Say, I'm working on a book about the Wasteland -- it'd be great to have the foreword by a vault dweller. Help me out, would you?
1DI0023003	Hey! Is that you?
1DI0023004	Oh, my head's still ringing from that explosion... What happened?
1DI0023005	Hey, new in town? Good to meet you! I'm Moira Brown. I take care of supplies and repairs here, but what I really do is mostly tinkering and research.
1DI0023006	Actually, right now I'm working on a book to help the world. And I could use a bit of help. I can pay you, and it'll be fun!
1DI0023019	Oh, hey! Kinda busy here, but I guess I can talk for a bit. What's up?
1DI0023020	Huh. Did you know the human body can survive without the stomach or spleen? Oh, what's up?
1DI0023021	You know, I think I've found a new way to prepare Radroach meat. Still tastes like old feet, though. Anyway, what's up with you?
1DI0023022	Oh, hey! Watch your step, I think one of my test subjects got loose. But don't worry, it's probably harmless.
1DI0023023	Hey, don't mind the smell. I was just testing a few chemicals, but it's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
1DI0023024	What's up? Anything interesting out there in the wild Wasteland?
1DI0023025	How's it going out there in the Wastes?
1DI0023028	Hey, don't mind the smoke. It's perfectly safe to breathe. Really!
1DI0023030	Oh, hey. What's up?
1DI0023031	Hey, someone who doesn't have a cart for me to fix or a brahmin to wash up. That's a nice change.
1DI0023032	Hope you don't mind the smell of brahmin dung. It's been one of those days.
1DI0023033	Hey. How's the wide, wild Wasteland out there?
1DI0023034	If you're going to get yourself killed out here, you mind doing it further away from our bunker?
1DI0023035	I don't want your corpse stinking up our little patch of heaven.
1DI0023036	Shut up. Kinda busy.
1DI0023037	Back to stare in awe at the Outcasts? Don't you have something better to do, kid?
1DI0023038	Defender Rococo Rockfowl, at your service.
1DI0023039	Might want to watch your head around here, miss.
1DI0023041	Gotta be careful out here, mister.
1DI0023042	Hey. Make it quick, huh?
1DI0023043	I'm Protector Henry Casdin, leader of the Outcasts. This had better be good.
1DI0023044	Normally, I wouldn't be wasting my time talking to a local, but Morgan tells me you can make yourself useful.
1DI0023045	So, interested in collecting technology for us?
1DI0023046	Changed your mind about the job, yet?
1DI0023047	Well, look who it is. What have you got for us, today?
1DI0023048	If it isn't our local scavenger-for-hire. What've you found for us, today?
1DI0023049	Always good to see you. What have you brought for us?
1DI0023050	Ah, good to see you back. What've you got for us today?
1DI0023051	Hold on! You're a new face, and around here, new faces tend to get shot.
1DI0023052	You'd better explain yourself, before I have to ask again, with lead.
1DI0023053	I suggest you get going now, before I start shooting.
1DI0023054	You had your warning.
1DI0023055	You ever make it to Little Lamplight, you come say hi. Okay mungo?
1DI0023056	You should come to Little Lamplight sometime, mungo. You're okay after all.
1DI0023057	If you ever go to Little Lamplight, I'll tell Mayor that you're okay, and he'll let you in, okay Mungo?
1DI0023058	...okay. You got all that? I think you know enough now to at least move around in Power Armor without killing yourself. That's something, right?
1DI0023059	God help us all.
1DI0023060	I thought I told you to get the hell out of here!?! Tenpenny doesn't want your goddamn caps, and I don't want the goddamn headache.
1DI0023061	For the last time... Get your rotting, ugly, goddamn Ghoul ass off Mister Tenpenny's private property!
1DI0023062	You again? I thought I told you to get lost?
1DI0023063	Give me a second. Keep your panties on!
1DI0023064	Just a moment!
1DI0023065	Well, if it isn't "my hero," the guy who sprang me from the Vault! I think I owe this man a drink!
1DI0023066	Well, if it isn't my best gal, the one who sprung me from the Vault! I think I owe this lovely lady a drink!
1DI0023067	How's it hanging?
1DI0023068	Hey, what's the word?
1DI0023069	Stay away from me! This is all your fault!
1DI0023070	Wow, who would have thought I'd run into you out here? It's a small world... but not as small as the Vault, I guess!
1DI0023071	I really do have to get back to the vault. Good to see you again, though.
1DI0023072	What have you done? The Vault is done for!
1DI0023073	What are we going to do now? You've ruined everything!
1DI0023074	This is all your fault! You've ruined the Vault! You'll pay!
1DI0023075	What the hell do you want? I hope you've decided to be more civil.
1DI0023076	No, I'm sorry. I tried to be nice to you and you decided to make fun of me. Well, this old lady doesn't put up with those shenanigans.
1DI0023077	Oh my goodness gracious! Seems like you've been gone forever. Please tell me you have good news.
1DI0023078	No luck yet finding the Soil Stradivarius, eh?
1DI0023079	Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!
1DI0023080	Oh my, it's you. I-I wasn't expecting visitors all the way out here.
1DI0023081	My name's Agatha. What brings you to my home?
1DI0023082	My my my. You certainly do look a little bit worn out from your travels.
1DI0023083	Oh, just look at my terrible manners! I'm Agatha. It's so nice to meet you.
1DI0023084	Now, what brings you all the way out here?
1DI0023085	Have you decided to find me a violin?
1DI0023086	I'm sorry, voice signature not recognized.
1DI0023087	No! I'm not talking to you anymore! You're a jerk and I hate you!
1DI0023088	I hope you found me a place to live.
1DI0023089	It was so weird! All of a sudden the ants went nuts and started fighting each other.
1DI0023090	It was like they were totally crazy! It was really scary, but kinda cool at the same time, ya know what I mean?
1DI0023093	Wow, you've been gone a while. I was kinda worried.
1DI0023094	Come on! Tell me already!
1DI0023095	Did you change your mind or something?
1DI0023096	Those monsters... th-they're gonna' get me.
1DI0023097	What is it, mister?
1DI0023098	What is it, lady?
1DI0023099	Yes, what did you need?
1DI0023100	I've detected some changes within the Queen's Hatchery with my equipment. What's transpired?
1DI0023101	We'll speak when we reach the terminal. Nothing must stand in the way of progress!
1DI0023102	I trust your task is progressing well.
1DI0023103	Well, don't just stand there. You're distracting me. I must calculate the most efficient way to get to my equipment.
1DI0023104	I'm finding your interruptions trying. The slightest mistake because of your distractions and my experiments will be ruined!
1DI0023105	You startled me!
1DI0023106	You really mustn't creep up on people like that.
1DI0023108	You've got the authority to kill Zimmer. None of my people will interfere. What's the hold up?
1DI0023109	Zimmer's dead. I know. Now he's just another bad memory from my past.
1DI0023110	Look, I don't know why you wanted to help me. But you did, and I'll always be grateful for that. Now... it's time for me to get back to my life.
1DI0023111	You again? You better not be here to convince me I'm some kind of robot. I'm warning you. I won't put up with your nonsense.
1DI0023112	I'm a little busy right now. Is there a problem?
1DI0023113	There's nothing more to discuss. Now, run along.
1DI0023114	The sooner you find my property, the sooner I can get out of this slum. Really, how do you people live like this?
1DI0023115	Standing around all day chit-chatting isn't going to help you track down my android. Is it?
1DI0023117	You there! What are you, some kind of lab assistant? No, you look a bit more... weathered.
1DI0023118	Are you by any chance... for hire?
1DI0023119	Ah, I trust you have reconsidered and wish to assist with the retrieval of my android?
1DI0023120	Pretty impressive work for a civilian, bringing the Doctor here in once piece.
1DI0023121	Sarah Lyons, Sentinel and commander of Lyons' Pride. Welcome to the Citadel.
1DI0023122	You just manage to get yourself into all sorts of trouble, don't you?
1DI0023123	Welcome to the Citadel. Not many civilians get to see the place.
1DI0023124	What in the HELL do you think you're doing, mungo?
1DI0023125	Hold it right there, mister!
1DI0023126	Don't take another step, or we'll blow your fucking head off!
1DI0023127	Hold it right there, lady!
1DI0023129	Unless you've got Sammy and the others with you, then get lost!
1DI0023130	You again? I told you to get lost!
1DI0023131	Hey, hey buddy! Hi. Yeah, so listen, thanks and all. Really great job you did there.
1DI0023132	Boy this place is something else, isn't it? Really amazing stuff here.
1DI0023133	Listen, thanks for getting us through that. I'm not stupid; I know we wouldn't have made it without you.
1DI0023134	I'm sorry about your dad, and I'm sorry I've acted like an ass.
1DI0023136	It's good to see you again. I hope that we can return to the purifier soon and finish your father's work.
1DI0023137	In the meantime, it seems that my talents are of use to the Brotherhood. I still don't completely trust them, but I'm willing to look past that.
1DI0023138	If you need something specific, please make it quick. Otherwise, excuse me. I have work to attend to.
1DI0023139	<yawn> What?
1DI0023140	Please excuse me. There is much work to be done.
1DI0023142	Looks like it's all clear. Unlocking outer doors.
1DI0023143	Door's open. Quit buzzing me, willya?
1DI0023144	I'm not opening the door now! Are you crazy?!
1DI0023145	Door stays closed until we finish securing the perimeter.
1DI0023146	Keep your shirt on. I'm not opening the door until the commander gives the all clear.
1DI0023147	Do you mind? We're a little busy at the moment!
1DI0023148	You did it! You disarmed that thing!
1DI0023149	My dad... he... He would have been real happy about that. Thank you.
1DI0023150	He wanted you to have these... a key and the deed to an empty place up behind the Brass Lantern. You can move in there if you want.
1DI0023151	Oh, and talk to Moira at Craterside Supply.  She can help you decorate the place.
1DI0023152	My dad told me about how you're going to disarm the bomb. He gave me some stuff for you for when you get it done...
1DI0023153	Not now!
1DI0023154	I'll be damned! You did it, didn't you? You disarmed that thing!
1DI0023155	Hell, where's my manners? I'm Lucas Simms, mayor and sheriff. And I'm pleased to say, we've had a reward for fixing up that bomb. Here you go!
1DI0023156	Y'know, we could use someone like you living in town. We've got an empty place up behind the Brass Lantern. Here's the key and deed.
1DI0023157	And heck, Moira over at Craterside Supply can even sell you stuff to help fix the place up.
1DI0023158	Name's Lucas Simms, town sheriff. And mayor too, when the need arises.
1DI0023159	You got a weird look about you, boy. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
1DI0023161	You got a weird look about you, girl. The kind that means trouble. I give everyone a fair shake. But if you do anything remotely stupid, you're dead.
1DI0023163	I don't know why, but I like you, boy! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
1DI0023165	I don't know why, but I like you, girl! Something tells me you're all right. So welcome to Megaton! Just holler if you need something.
1DI0023167	I must be getting slow in my old age. Thanks for saving my hide, there.
1DI0023168	Haven't disarmed the bomb yet? That's some serious pre-war hardware. So go easy, okay?
1DI0023169	Don't suppose you've disarmed that bomb?
1DI0023171	Here's your reward. Hell, why don't you move in? Could use someone like you. Got an empty place here you can use. Here's the key and deed.
1DI0023172	It ain't much to look at. But talk with Moira. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
1DI0023174	And all without asking for pay, too. Hell, why don't you move in? Here's the key and deed to an empty house. Consider yourself a Megaton citizen!
1DI0023175	Oh and talk with Moira at Craterside Supply. She's got random odds and ends you might be able to spruce the place up with.
1DI0023176	Well, hey! How's it going? You need something, you just ask. Disarming that bomb, well... that's something I'm not ever likely to forget.
1DI0023177	Well, now... how's my favorite explosives expert doing?
1DI0023179	Savor this moment.
1DI0023180	Shush! You're ruining the moment.
1DI0023181	Wait for my summons. I will send for you after I finish some business in the Wasteland.
1DI0023182	Patience my love. I will send for you in due time.
1DI0023183	Patience.
1DI0023184	So. You're the genius who disarmed the bomb. Weeks of waiting and watching, ruined!
1DI0023185	It's a pity you acted so hastily. In the future, best sleep with one eye open.
1DI0023186	You will come to regret your actions.
1DI0023187	My, my. Just when I had all but given up hope. My dear boy, I am very happy to make your acquaintance. I am Mister Burke.
1DI0023188	And you, well, you are not a resident of this putrescent cesspool. That makes you a rather valuable individual.
1DI0023189	My, my. Just when I had all but given up hope. My dear girl, I am very happy to make your acquaintance. I am Mister Burke.
1DI0023191	You self-righteous little.... Do you have any idea what you've done to my employer's development plan? A word of advice: watch your back.
1DI0023192	You haven't rigged the bomb yet? If it's information you need, get to it. Time is wasting.
1DI0023193	Back again, hmm? Perhaps you've reconsidered my offer?
1DI0023194	The pulse charge is rigged? Excellent! Meet me upstairs at Tenpenny Tower. There you will see a most glorious sight.
1DI0023195	Meet me upstairs at Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0023196	The pulse charge is rigged? Excellent! Excellent!
1DI0023197	Ah. The anticipation is palpable. Isn't it?
1DI0023198	When you have finished savoring the moment, you may have the honor of pressing the button. Oh, and mind your eyes. It'll be brighter than bright.
1DI0023199	The detonator is right over there. You may have the honor. Hit the switch!
1DI0023200	My God... what transcendent beauty... what purifying light....
1DI0023201	Ahem... Allow me to collect myself, as I'm sure you're anxious to collect your payment.
1DI0023202	I've been asked to extend to you an invitation to reside at Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0023203	Here's the key, and deed, to your new master suite. It's on the top floor, first door on your right from the elevator. Enjoy your new accommodations.
1DI0023204	Oh, and if you wish to spruce the place up a bit, speak with Lydia Montenegro in the Boutique le Chic.
1DI0023209	What you did, it was a great thing. That place, those people... necessary sacrifices. Here's to a better future. Here's to Tenpenny Tower!
1DI0023210	Yeah, you're pretty busted up, but you'll live. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
1DI0023211	Yeah, I remember you. What's up?
1DI0023212	Whoa, whoa. Slow down there. This area's off limits to everyone but the Family. Where the hell do you think you're going?
1DI0023213	Yeah? What do you want this time?
1DI0023214	I thought I knew everyone in the Family, but I don't recognize you. You must be one of Vance's new initiates.
1DI0023215	My name's Justin, I'm pretty new here myself.
1DI0023217	Well, well. I haven't had a customer in a while. Last one I had was a bit chewy... know what I mean?
1DI0023218	You gonna gawk all day or are you gonna buy something?
1DI0023219	I don't think I've met you yet. The name's Alan. What did you want?
1DI0023221	Well, well. I'm surprised you don't know me. I'm Brianna. I... take care of the men around here. Well, unmarried ones anyway.
1DI0023223	I don't think we've been properly introduced. I'm Holly... Vance's wife.
1DI0023224	Whatcha need?
1DI0023225	Always a pleasure. What can I do for you?
1DI0023226	I trust your talk with young Ian went well.
1DI0023227	I am quite interested in learning the results of your discussion. Did he come to a decision?
1DI0023228	I hear that you decided to speak to Ian regardless of my warnings.
1DI0023229	Be that as it may, I am still interested in what you conversed about. Did he come to a decision?
1DI0023230	Welcome to our home.
1DI0023231	My people call me Vance. I lead this group of weary travelers and outcasts who need a home.
1DI0023232	And to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?
1DI0023233	You wish to speak to me again?
1DI0023234	Hey there, sweetie!
1DI0023236	Hello? Is this the mailman? Oh I do hope my fall catalog has arrived!
1DI0023237	You must be exhausted from all that walking in this horrible heat. Oh, and hungry too! Sit, please!
1DI0023238	Brailee Ewers is the name. Don't mind my husband Kenneth. He woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning!
1DI0023239	Whatcha' need darling?
1DI0023241	I'm sorry, but my husband told me to say that nobody's here.
1DI0023242	We aren't talking any more. Get out!
1DI0023243	What are you doing in here?
1DI0023244	What the hell are you doing in here?! Get the fuck out!
1DI0023245	Look, I want to be left alone. Can't you tell?
1DI0023247	Yes? Who is it?
1DI0023248	It's nice to see a friendly new face around here. It's been a long time.
1DI0023249	The name's Karen Schenzy.
1DI0023252	Go away! You're not getting in here!
1DI0023253	I thought I told you I didn't want to talk to you any more! I'm not going home and that's it!
1DI0023254	I wanted to thank you one last time for what you've done for me.
1DI0023255	My brain feels like less of a mess now... I think I may be seeing clearly for the first time in years.
1DI0023256	Don't worry about me... I've been through a lot, but I think I'm gonna be okay.
1DI0023257	Thanks again for helping me clear my thoughts.
1DI0023258	I thought I heard guns... what's going on? Who are you?
1DI0023259	Huh? What do you want?
1DI0023260	Yeah? What is it this time?
1DI0023261	I thought I heard guns... what's going on? Who are you? You better tell me right now or I'll call for Vance!
1DI0023262	Well, holy shit! You're back!
1DI0023263	What the hell happened out there?
1DI0023264	There he is... the hero of the day!
1DI0023265	There she is... the heroine of the day!
1DI0023266	How's the search going? Any sign of Ian?
1DI0023267	What did they tell you? Everyone ok?
1DI0023268	Don't you have some houses to be checking?
1DI0023269	Hang on, you're not one of them. I nearly blasted you in two!
1DI0023270	Get over here before they spot you.
1DI0023271	Now, what the hell are you doin' all the way out here?
1DI0023272	You again, huh? What is it now?
1DI0023273	Please tell me you have some good news... I could use it.
1DI0023274	Any word about my brother? I'm worried sick!
1DI0023275	I really appreciate you doing this for me. I'm feeling better already!
1DI0023276	Did you need something else?
1DI0023277	I don't recognize you. New in town or something?
1DI0023278	You still up for that job I was talking about?
1DI0023279	Great job kid! Meet me around front.
1DI0023280	Herbert Dashwood. Damn glad to meet you! Call me Daring. Everyone else does.
1DI0023281	Don't suppose you'll let me finish this drink before killing me? Hmm?
1DI0023282	It's hard to drink with all that screaming.
1DI0023283	Okay fine! Quit pestering me. I know I'm going to bloody die, and I want to do it with a bloody, Bloody Mary in my hand. Is that alright with you?
1DI0023284	I'm busy drinking.
1DI0023285	Die zombie!
1DI0023286	Goddamn it! This is no time to talk!
1DI0023287	Great job kid!
1DI0023288	Here, take this mask. It'll keep you safe from the Ferals. Just don't get too close to them, or they'll sniff you out. Don't forget to PUT IT ON!
1DI0023289	Come on kid. There's killing and maiming going on. We can talk later.
1DI0023291	Are you daft?! Don't stand there. Do something!
1DI0023292	Please! Don't hurt me!
1DI0023293	Oh my God! They're killing everyone!
1DI0023294	Help! Don't kill me!
1DI0023297	Don't just stand their child! Take up the fight!
1DI0023298	Aiiiyeeeeah! Get away from me!
1DI0023299	Find a place to hide, comrade!
1DI0023300	Don't hurt me! Please!
1DI0023302	No!!! Don't!
1DI0023303	Help us! Please!
1DI0023304	Don't hurt me!
1DI0023305	Help us!
1DI0023306	What's the status on those Tenpenny bigots?
1DI0023307	Well kid, what've you accomplished?
1DI0023308	What's the word at Tenpenny, kid?
1DI0023310	What are you looking at?
1DI0023311	I'm really not in the mood, so leave me alone.
1DI0023312	You take care of those Ghouls yet?
1DI0023313	You having trouble with those Ghouls?
1DI0023314	Hmph. Didn't think you had it in you. Guess you proved me wrong. Good job. Knowing those Ghouls are gone takes a load off my mind. Thanks.
1DI0023315	You'll be wanting the reward now, won't you. I suppose you've earned it.
1DI0023316	There's your caps. Contract fulfilled, debt paid. This don't mean we're buddies, alright? Now get going.
1DI0023317	Your constant need to chatter is pressing on my optic nerve.
1DI0023319	You have a curious look about you. I presume you have something interesting to tell me?
1DI0023320	Well, well. What have we here? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Susan Lancaster. Perhaps we can become better acquainted, in the near future?
1DI0023321	Hmm. What have we here? A lost little girl? Do you have permission to be in here? If not, you should leave before it gets ugly.
1DI0023322	Edgar Wellington the second, at your service. Please excuse my demeanor. My wife recently passed away.
1DI0023323	Hold on there... who let YOU in here?
1DI0023324	Edgar Wellington the second. Have you met my wife Millicent?
1DI0023325	Hold on... who let YOU in here?
1DI0023326	Edgar Wellington the second, at your service.
1DI0023328	I am Comrade Cheng, beloved leader of the people, shining servant of the community! How can I help you?
1DI0023329	I'm Michael Hawthorne. Who are you? And more importantly, should I care?
1DI0023330	I loved that stupid man... now that he's gone... I'm lost.
1DI0023331	I can't talk now.
1DI0023332	Introductions are in order. I am Mrs. Edgar Wellington. You may refer to me as Madam or My Lady Wellington.
1DI0023333	My name is Tiffany Cheng. My miserable excuse for a husband, is "comrade" Irving Cheng, and you can tell him I said so.
1DI0023334	Good luck to you, and Godspeed.
1DI0023335	Saints alive! You've done it!
1DI0023336	Quickly, let me have the ink and I will produce the copy of the Declaration of Independence!
1DI0023337	Here you are... a perfect copy. That should give ol' George something to think about.
1DI0023338	What are the next orders from the Congress?
1DI0023339	Have you reached a decision? Will you assist me in forging a copy of the Declaration?
1DI0023340	If you have something to say, be quick about it or begone.
1DI0023344	Screw you! If you think you can get the Declaration by yourself, then have at it.
1DI0023345	I'll be sure and leave flowers on your grave. If they find what's left of your corpse.
1DI0023347	Whew. Say, you're pretty decent in a firefight.
1DI0023348	Well, come to a decision?
1DI0023349	You made enough noise coming in here to wake the dead, for God's sakes!
1DI0023350	Just be ready, the Muties are coming!
1DI0023351	I can't wait to add the Declaration to the Society's collection.
1DI0023352	I'm expecting great things from you!
1DI0023353	What wonderful artifacts have you brought me?
1DI0023354	So, have you decided to become a part of history and triumphantly return with the Declaration of Independence in hand?
1DI0023355	Pleased to meet you. Abraham Washington's the name. I am curator of the Capital Preservation Society.
1DI0023356	If you have time, come take a look at our exhibits.
1DI0023358	Sorry, very busy right now. Come see me at the museum.
1DI0023359	Quite an impressive collection, isn't it? Well don't be shy, have a look around.
1DI0023360	Abraham Washington's the name... curator of this little slice of American History.
1DI0023361	What can I help you with?
1DI0023362	Can't talk now. We've heard Slavers are attacking.
1DI0023363	Go away! Hannibal is waiting for you.
1DI0023364	What are we going to do? Those Slavers have captured the Memorial.
1DI0023365	My feet are sore. It's a long way to the Lincoln Memorial
1DI0023366	Hannibal says you're on our side. My name is Alejandra.
1DI0023367	What? Oh! I didn't see you there. I get that way sometimes when I'm thinking.
1DI0023368	Excuse me, sir. I can't talk now. Slavers could any moment.
1DI0023369	Excuse me, ma'am. I can't talk now. Slavers could any moment.
1DI0023370	I don't talk to strangers. You need to go talk to Hannibal.
1DI0023371	Please, sir. Help us get rid of all those Slavers in the Memorial.
1DI0023372	Please, ma'am. Help us get rid of all those Slavers in the Memorial.
1DI0023373	I hope our brahmin survives this trip.
1DI0023374	My name is Bill. Bill Seward, if you please, sir.
1DI0023375	My name is Bill. Bill Seward, if you please, ma'am.
1DI0023376	Yes, sir. What can I do for you sir?
1DI0023377	Yes, ma'am. What can I do for you ma'am?
1DI0023378	Not now. We can talk after the Slaver attack.
1DI0023379	Don't you be stopping here, mister. You got to talk to Hannibal first.
1DI0023380	Don't you be stopping here, lady. You got to talk to Hannibal first.
1DI0023381	We've got to get those Slavers cleared out of the Memorial.
1DI0023382	I'm sure Hannibal is cooking up a plan.
1DI0023383	This is a glorious day. We will rebuild Lincoln's Memorial. I hope I can reattach his head.
1DI0023385	You're new. I'm Caleb. If you're going to be staying a while, I could use some help.
1DI0023386	You have a picture! And such a large one, too.
1DI0023387	I'll have no problems restoring the Memorial with this. Thank you!
1DI0023388	Make it quick. I've got a lot of work to do.
1DI0023389	Those Slavers are all dead. We must stay vigilant. There may be more of them.
1DI0023390	We got wind that the Slavers are going to attack. We could really use your help in the fight.
1DI0023391	Ah, a visitor. Welcome to the Temple of the Union.
1DI0023392	I'm not going to ask you who you are. For the moment, I don't care.
1DI0023393	We are all escaped slaves. I need your solemn promise not to betray us to Paradise Falls or the Slavers.
1DI0023394	Until I get that, you cannot leave here. So, do I have your word?
1DI0023395	Are you ready to pledge your allegiance?
1DI0023396	Everything is done? I can hardly believe it. We are finally going to realize the dream!
1DI0023397	We'll start out within the hour. We'll meet you at the site.
1DI0023398	I hear you found a great picture for Caleb. Once the Memorial site is safe, we can move there.
1DI0023399	So the Super Mutants are dead? This is wonderful news!
1DI0023400	Now all you have to do is get Caleb his picture and we can begin our journey.
1DI0023401	Slavers! They're holed up in the Memorial.
1DI0023402	In a moment we will charge them. We will have liberty or we will have death! Join with us to defeat evil!
1DI0023403	Those Slavers are still in control of the Memorial.
1DI0023404	Is it time for us to attack yet?
1DI0023405	We made it! The Memorial is really ours! I cannot thank you enough.
1DI0023406	Here, take this. It's a token of our thanks.
1DI0023407	Thanks to you, we are able to make this journey.
1DI0023408	We will rebuild the great Memorial to Lincoln and give hope to slaves everywhere!
1DI0023410	You have been good to your word. You are welcome at the Temple of the Union anytime.
1DI0023411	Take these schematics as a token of our gratitude.
1DI0023412	Ah! It is our newest brother! What can I do for you?
1DI0023413	Ah! It is our newest sister! What can I do for you?
1DI0023414	I'm Leroy Walker, and you're probably wondering about what we're doing here.
1DI0023415	Yeah, I killed them all after telling you not to.
1DI0023416	I just couldn't trust anyone else to do it. I needed to see them dead with my own eyes.
1DI0023417	Anyway, the problem has been taken care of. I can go back to Paradise Falls now.
1DI0023418	I'll make sure they know you're our kind of people. You'll be welcome there any time.
1DI0023419	You just couldn't wait for us, could you? Well, at least they're all dead. Guess I'll go back to Paradise Falls.
1DI0023420	We are just about to wipe out this Temple of the Union. You can join us or not. It makes no difference to me.
1DI0023421	We're preparing for a slave attack. Just stay out of the way.
1DI0023422	So did you find any Lincoln artifacts in the Museum?
1DI0023423	Is there something else?
1DI0023424	Not now. Slavers are out there somewhere, preparing to attack.
1DI0023425	Now, beat it! Hannibal is waiting for you.
1DI0023426	What's your business stranger?
1DI0023427	You again. Don't dawdle. Get in here.
1DI0023428	You ain't supposed to be looking at me, to say nothing of talking to me.
1DI0023430	Goddamn Slavers have the Memorial.
1DI0023431	As soon as Hannibal gives the word, we're going to charge in there and take it from them.
1DI0023432	Stay sharp. The Wasteland is dangerous.
1DI0023433	You don't look like much, stranger. Bet you run from Radroaches.
1DI0023434	I'm Simone Cameron. Don't fuck with me. Hannibal says I can't shoot you, but I ain't trusting you with a gun to my back.
1DI0023435	Are you trying to piss me off?
1DI0023436	That's close enough. What the hell are you doing wandering around here?
1DI0023437	Keep moving. Mister Walker is waiting.
1DI0023438	Oh. You again.
1DI0023440	I heard you're going to help us get those runaways.
1DI0023441	Make it quick. I'm busy.
1DI0023442	You do actually know how to plant mines, right?
1DI0023443	The robots are over in the junkyard, in case you're wondering.
1DI0023444	Are you going to show us how to fix the robots?
1DI0023445	So are you going to ever show us how to be sneaky so we can hide from the Super Mutants?
1DI0023446	I'm getting bored. I thought you were going to teach us something.
1DI0023447	Go on, I'm watching. Show us what to do.
1DI0023448	I'm confused. What am I supposed to be doing? Can you show me?
1DI0023449	We're all watching you waiting to learn something. Well. Get on with it already!
1DI0023450	Go on. I'm paying attention. Show us what to do.
1DI0023451	Well, hotshot. Are you going to teach us something, or just stand there looking stupid?
1DI0023452	Oooh. I can't wait. Show us what to do!
1DI0023453	I'm watching. Go on. Teach us what to do.
1DI0023454	I'm glad to be safely back home!
1DI0023455	Quick! Unlock the door!
1DI0023456	You've got to get this door unlocked!
1DI0023457	You're rescuing me? Let's get the hell out of here!
1DI0023458	You're rescuing Shorty and me?! Thanks! I thought we were goners for sure.
1DI0023459	I think the others are dead... or worse.
1DI0023460	You're rescuing me?! Thanks! I thought we were goners for sure.
1DI0023464	We can talk back at Big Town. Let's get out of here!
1DI0023465	I'll feel better once we're safe.
1DI0023466	Thank God! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
1DI0023467	Come on, you've got to untie me!
1DI0023468	Thanks! Who are you? Never mind, I don't care right now. Let's go get Red and get out of here!
1DI0023469	You lead. I'll follow. Let's go! Move it!
1DI0023470	No more talking! Let's get out of here!
1DI0023472	Who are you? And why do I have the feeling that you have some bad news?
1DI0023473	They're dead. Aren't they?
1DI0023474	Hey! Who are you?
1DI0023475	Thanks for helping us. I just hope we can survive another attack. Probably won't.
1DI0023476	Where's Red?
1DI0023477	Welcome to the Chop Shop. I'm Nurse Graves, Doctor Barrows' assistant.
1DI0023478	Don't let our place's name fool you. The Doctor is very good with injuries, dismemberments, and trauma.
1DI0023479	If you require any Stimpaks or Bloodpacks, let me know.
1DI0023480	And how can we help you today?
1DI0023481	Well, I guess you weren't such a jerk after all.
1DI0023482	Wow, you look like you've been through Hell.
1DI0023483	From what I've heard, sounds like you've been through Hell.
1DI0023484	You look like you've been though Hell.
1DI0023485	Well, I'm still waiting. What's the deal with my men?
1DI0023486	Any other info I can give you?
1DI0023487	Staying in Underworld isn't helping our cause. Make this fast.
1DI0023488	You still here? The Rangers aren't going to last forever if you don't get out there and help them.
1DI0023489	I thought we covered everything. What is it now?
1DI0023490	Get the hell out of my face.
1DI0023491	If you're going to continue to irritate me, I'm not going to be so nice about it.
1DI0023492	What.... Where am I? What happened?
1DI0023493	How long have I been out?
1DI0023494	Yeah? What is it? Ready to help?
1DI0023496	I'm afraid she's going to be out for a while. She's not well at all.
1DI0023497	Don't worry though, I'm sure the rest of Reilly's Rangers will show up soon and take her home.
1DI0023498	Doctor Barrows at your service. What brings you to the Chop Shop?
1DI0023499	Come to lend me a hand I hope. I can always use fresh human samples.
1DI0023500	Yes, what is it now? Please, be brief. I'm quite busy.
1DI0023501	You sure know your shit. Ever consider joining the Rangers? I bet Reilly would love to have you on our team.
1DI0023502	Remember, if you need anything fixed, look me up at the Ranger Compound.
1DI0023503	Move... move!
1DI0023504	Hey there. Donovan at your service. You break it, I fix it.
1DI0023505	What can I do you for?
1DI0023506	Hey man, the Butcher wants to see you. He's right over yonder.
1DI0023507	Did ya see me? Nothing good ole' Eugene and a few hundred rounds of ammo couldn't handle.
1DI0023508	Goodbye. If you're ever in the neighborhood and need some help, just listen for Eugene's rat-a-tat-tat. Ha ha ha!
1DI0023510	Brick's the name, and I call this fine looking roomsweeper Eugene.
1DI0023511	We've had a lot of fun together mowin' down Super Mutants, but I think it's time we get off this roof.
1DI0023513	I think Butcher wants to talk with you and he's callin' the shots. We can talk about me 'n Eugene later.
1DI0023514	Welcome back. It's great to see you again.
1DI0023515	It's been good knowing you. Hope to see you at the Ranger Compound.
1DI0023516	Well, I suppose thanks are in order... and a little something extra for your trouble.
1DI0023517	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound and see if Reilly's back yet. If you make your way there, Reilly will pay you herself.
1DI0023518	If I can ever be of medical assistance or you need some supplies or repairs, let me or Donovan know.
1DI0023519	Again, I'm not sure how to thank you.
1DI0023520	I'm going to head back to Ranger Compound to see if Reilly's back yet. Look me up anytime you're in the neighborhood.
1DI0023522	We'll talk when we get to the exit. Let's roll.
1DI0023523	Back so soon? Are we in luck?
1DI0023524	Hey you! Get your ass over here before you attract every Super Mutant in the building!
1DI0023525	The name's Butcher, I'm the team medic. It's good to see a friendly face.
1DI0023526	Okay, now who the heck are you and when are reinforcements coming?
1DI0023527	So, Mechanist! You've come to throw yourself on the mercy of the Ant Queen?
1DI0023528	Very well! We shall grant you the kindest of our gifts for any human. A swift death!
1DI0023529	At last, I've come to destroy the Mechanist's precious Forge. And no minion of his will stop me!
1DI0023530	Now, face death from the AntAgonizer!
1DI0023531	Please, just leave me alone. I want to leave all of this behind me.
1DI0023532	Who dares interrupt the AntAgonizer? Begone!
1DI0023533	I have no time to waste with you. Far more important matters await the attention of the AntAgonizer!
1DI0023534	At last, you've pried the shell off of that meaty little Mechanist. Give it to me!
1DI0023535	My spies tell me that meddling Mechanist has been removed from the picture. I only wish I had that tin-man's shell to gloat over!
1DI0023536	Bring me the suit of the Mechanist, and then we can talk.
1DI0023537	Excellent. Now, peel that tin-man's suit from his corpse and bring it to me. I wish to examine it more closely.
1DI0023539	You don't have the Mechanist's suit. Don't waste my time until you've brought me that prize!
1DI0023540	So, at last you've penetrated the court of the AntAgonizer, Queen of All Ants!
1DI0023541	Were you sent by that meddling Mechanist? He'll learn that no one can stand before my royal regiment of fighting ants!
1DI0023542	Explain yourself! Why shouldn't I have my pretties kill you where you stand?
1DI0023543	You again! What is it, now?
1DI0023544	Make this fast. I have royal matters to ponder.
1DI0023545	Hahaha! Bow, peasant! Bow before the Ant Queen!
1DI0023546	Aha! Vile AntAgonizer! You've got a lot of moxie, invading my private sanctum! Pretty courageous, for a spineless insect!
1DI0023547	But this is as far as you go. Now it's time to put down the foot of justice and crush your nefarious plans once and for all!
1DI0023548	Vile minion of the AntAgonizer, you and your creepy mistress will face the unbending wrath of the Mechanist!
1DI0023549	Now, face death from the Mechanist!
1DI0023550	Really. Thanks for all your help, but I've got things I have to attend to.
1DI0023551	I'm sorry. Just leave me alone. I've got a lot to think about.
1DI0023552	Can't talk now, citizen! I must be leaving. Be safe!
1DI0023553	Well done! You have defeated the vile AntAgonizer, and you've brought back her suit so that we may destroy the last taint of her villainy!
1DI0023554	Hand it to me, and I'll make sure that no one else can ever bear the mantle of the foul AntAgonizer!
1DI0023555	You had best hand over the AntAgonizer suit. It's too dangerous to let it fall into the wrong hands.
1DI0023556	Excellent work, Mechano-Lad! Now that the vile AntAgonizer is defeated, all that remains is to destroy the shell of her evil.
1DI0023557	Bring me the foul AntAgonizer's armor, and we can do what must be done.
1DI0023558	Excellent work, Mechano-Lass! Now that the vile AntAgonizer is defeated, all that remains is to destroy the shell of her evil.
1DI0023560	My super-spybots tell me that the AntAgonizer has been defeated. I trust I have you to thank for this?
1DI0023561	Congratulations, but I really must make sure her suit is destroyed, lest it fall into even more evil hands.
1DI0023562	Bring me the foul AntAgonizer's armor, and we can talk further. Until then, leave me be.
1DI0023563	I must neutralize the AntAgonizer's suit. When you've removed it from her vile corpse, bring it to me.
1DI0023564	What are you doing in here? How did you get past my defenses? Did the AntAgonizer send you?
1DI0023565	Speak now citizen or I'll be forced to detain you until I can ascertain your true motives!
1DI0023566	Make it fast, citizen. I can't talk long - evil is afoot!
1DI0023567	I trust everything is acceptable, citizen?
1DI0023568	Can't talk now. They're fighting! This is awesome!
1DI0023569	I don't wanna talk to you. You killed my Uncle Roe.
1DI0023570	Go away! I hate you!
1DI0023571	Oh man! Did you see it! Did you see it? The AntAgonizer was all like, "Fear me!" But the Mechanist was all, "Stop, evil-doer!"
1DI0023572	Are you all right? You aren't hurt, are you? I'd like to apologize for the rude welcome. Those two have been a bit of a, um, problem lately.
1DI0023573	Name's Roe. Uncle Roe, to most. Welcome to Canterbury Commons... for what that's worth.
1DI0023574	Whew! You wouldn't believe how much trouble those two have caused in this town. We've been looking for someone to get rid of them for a long time.
1DI0023575	But you just walked in and cleaned up the town, easy as you please! We're in your debt, that's for sure.
1DI0023576	I'm mayor of Canterbury Commons, think of me as your own Uncle Roe. And take this, as our thanks for cleaning up the town.
1DI0023578	But you just walked in, downed one, and drove off the other, easy as you please! That'll be the last we see of them, you can be sure of that!
1DI0023580	Change your mind yet? You willing to help us deal with the AntAgonizer and Mechanist?
1DI0023581	Expulsion Protocol KL-001 in effect. Disengage voice parameters.
1DI0023583	Hello there, fellow employee. I don't believe we've met. I'm your Factory Foreman, Milo. It's a pleasure to meet you.
1DI0023584	Please give me your job posting title and employee registration number for my permanent records.
1DI0023585	Hello again, fellow employee. I still have no record of your posting or employee identification.
1DI0023587	What do you want now? Come to make fun of me again?
1DI0023588	No! You were mean to me! I don't know if I'll ever talk to you again... unless you bring me a Nuka-Cola Quantum.
1DI0023589	If you're here with some Quantum, I have caps with your name on them!
1DI0023590	Please, tell me you have some of the good stuff. I need that Quantum!
1DI0023591	Oh! I hope you're here with some Quantum!
1DI0023592	Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh! Did you find any Quantum?
1DI0023593	Oh! Did you need something else?
1DI0023594	Well? What do you think? Will you take my offer?
1DI0023595	As promised... here is a little pick-me-up. An Ice Cold Nuka-Cola! Just look at the frost on the bottle. So cold and delicious!
1DI0023596	Pardon me... I tend to lose myself when I hold onto a Nuka-Cola.
1DI0023597	Before I get to the little proposition I have for you let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
1DI0023598	So, you ready to hear me out? I have a bit of a proposition for you.
1DI0023599	But before I get to that, let me tell you a little bit about Nuka-Cola Quantum.
1DI0023600	Hang on, the tour's not done yet. Be patient. Your Ice Cold Nuka-Cola is only moments away!
1DI0023601	Sierra Petrovita's the name. Good to see a new face in Girdershade!
1DI0023602	I take it you're here to check out my Nuka-Cola collection and take the tour?
1DI0023603	Are you ready to take the tour of my collection?
1DI0023604	Lemme go, beautiful! I'm gonna' get us some Quantum!
1DI0023605	Bringing me some Quantum I hope?
1DI0023606	My offer still stands. Bring me Quantum, and I'll pay you for it.
1DI0023607	Hey, pal. What were you doing in Sierra's place?
1DI0023608	So, who might you be and what brings you out to our little paradise?
1DI0023609	Unless you want to hear what I have to say, we have nothing to discuss.
1DI0023610	You never should have left, kid. Now, we'll make sure nobody ever leaves again!
1DI0023611	I'm sorry, but you have to leave. Goodbye.
1DI0023612	Our business is finished. Please leave immediately.
1DI0023613	It's a shame you've got to go. But you'll do okay out there, I'm sure.
1DI0023615	Goodbye. We'll miss you.
1DI0023616	Good riddance. Get out.
1DI0023618	Stay out of this!
1DI0023619	Well, I see you've returned.
1DI0023620	Done with the dust and ruins of the Wasteland, are you? Given up looking for daddy? Thought you could just slink back in, like a teen missing curfew?
1DI0023621	Well, that's too bad. You have no future in this Vault. You're tainted.
1DI0023622	You just couldn't let us live in peace, could you? You couldn't have a home, so you decided to destroy ours.
1DI0023623	But I'll see to it that you die first!
1DI0023624	You just couldn't let us live in peace, could you? You couldn't have a home, so you've decided to destroy ours.
1DI0023625	Stop right there! I don't know how you got in here, but... Hold on...
1DI0023626	Wait a minute! It's you! I hardly recognized you with all the dust and grime from out there.
1DI0023627	Guess that explains how you got that door open. You've got more experience with it than most everyone down here combined.
1DI0023628	I guess you can see how bad things are down here. Sorry, where were we going?
1DI0023630	I heard you were leaving us. That's not really true, is it?
1DI0023631	I really shouldn't be seen talking with you, you know. What do you want?
1DI0023632	I've gotta say, it's a shame to see you go. I still remember when you turned ten. Who could have guessed how you'd grow up?
1DI0023633	Hey, if it ain't a fellow Tunnel Snake, slumming it down here with the old crew?
1DI0023634	I thought you'd be out there tearing up the Wasteland and raising Hell!
1DI0023635	But if you've gotta be back, might as well make yourself useful. You gotta help us.
1DI0023636	Damn, look who's come waltzing back into the Vault?
1DI0023637	It takes some real balls coming back here after everything you and your dad screwed up.
1DI0023640	Oh my God, you're back! You got my message and actually came back!
1DI0023641	Oh, thank goodness you're here! I told everyone to wait here for you, that you'd know what to do, but they didn't listen to me.
1DI0023642	With everything they'd been through, they just panicked. But I knew you'd come back.
1DI0023643	I knew you'd know what was happening. You do, don't you?
1DI0023644	I'll keep looking for the others. Good luck with everything.
1DI0023645	Did you think I was joking? You murderer!
1DI0023646	You've already made your point with us. What else is there to say?
1DI0023647	It sounds like you've already abandoned us. Did you change your mind, or are you just here to make fun of us?
1DI0023648	I hope you're making your farewells, because we don't have much to say, otherwise.
1DI0023649	I... I just heard. The Overseer... My father is dead.
1DI0023650	What's more, some of the people are saying I should be the new Overseer. It's all so sudden.
1DI0023651	I just heard what you did. It was terrible, but... I guess it had to be done.
1DI0023653	I... I just heard. My father says he's stepping down as Overseer. He won't tell me why, but I have to assume it's something you said to him.
1DI0023654	I hope you're making progress with my father. I can't imagine anyone else who could convince him we should venture outside.
1DI0023655	I hope you're making progress with the Overseer. I can't imagine anyone else who could convince him we should venture outside.
1DI0023657	Well, look at who came crawling back home?
1DI0023658	What's the matter? Homesick? Outside not everything it was cracked up to be? Or was it just that Daddy didn't want you anymore?
1DI0023659	Too bad. You're not wanted here. You're scum.
1DI0023660	Can't you just leave me and my Vault to die in peace?
1DI0023661	You know what? I changed my mind. Playtime's over, kid.
1DI0023662	Aren't you supposed to be leaving?
1DI0023664	I just heard about your so-called "solution." I've got to admit, I didn't think you'd do it.
1DI0023665	But, hey, you've solved my problems, and gave me an easy place to pin the blame. I guess I owe you my thanks.
1DI0023666	I just heard about your so-called "solution." I should have you killed where you stand.
1DI0023667	But obviously, we simply can't kill a Wasteland monster like you. The best we can do is offer you a sacrifice to send you on your way.
1DI0023668	At least with you gone, our home can return to some semblance of peace, even if it came at a tragic cost.
1DI0023669	I hear you talked some sense into that rabble, and convinced them to give up on their nonsense. All without bloodshed, no less.
1DI0023670	Good thing, too. We can't afford to lose any more of the breeding pool. I guess I owe you something in the way of thanks.
1DI0023671	I hear that you've had a little chat with our rebellious elements. It seems I underestimated your persuasive skills.
1DI0023672	I applaud your restraint. Violence only weakens our community, and now is no time for weakness.
1DI0023673	Once again, there is a firm hand in control, and all will be well in Vault 101. I suppose you'll want some sort of payment for your aid.
1DI0023674	I told you to leave me here. This is my fate for failing the people of my Vault.
1DI0023675	Now go! See if you can keep a few of them alive out there!
1DI0023678	Ah, another patient! What's it to be, eh? Appendectomy? Tonsillectomy?
1DI0023679	Hysterectomy?
1DI0023680	Back again, hmm? Here to watch the master work?
1DI0023681	Oh, it's good to see you're back from outside. It can be dangerous out there for someone your age.
1DI0023682	It's been a while, kid. I guess the G.O.A.T. couldn't have predicted how you'd turn out, could it?
1DI0023683	Remind me to add a question about rescuing your teacher from the Vault jail. If the Vault ever goes back to normal, that is...
1DI0023684	By the way, while I was in there, I heard some worrying things from the guards.
1DI0023685	Well, if it isn't my star pupil.
1DI0023686	You're back, again?
1DI0023687	Can't you just leave us alone?
1DI0023688	I don't know that I should be talking with you.
1DI0023689	Oh boy, are you in trouble.
1DI0023690	Oh, look. The bad seed is back.
1DI0023691	You got a lot to answer for, kid.
1DI0023692	I sure didn't expect you to show your face here again.
1DI0023693	Don't you know enough to stay away?
1DI0023694	Wow, you're back!
1DI0023695	Hey, good to see you again!
1DI0023696	You're alive!
1DI0023697	Well, now... If it isn't the little villain from the vault. We've been looking for you. Someone's put quite a price on your head.
1DI0023698	What? You think you can walk around the Wasteland doing the evil that you do and there isn't going to be someone who takes notice?
1DI0023699	And now it's time for you to die.
1DI0023700	Well, now... If it isn't the little saint from the vault. We've been looking for you. Someone's put quite a price on your head.
1DI0023701	What? You think you can walk around the Wasteland doing the things that you do and there isn't going to be someone who takes notice?
1DI0023702	Such a shame. I hear that you could have been something useful. Ah well. Time to die.
1DI0023704	Finally. Got you in my sights.
1DI0023705	You won't get away this time.
1DI0023708	You should be proud of your accomplishment.
1DI0023709	Alright. Let's go.
1DI0023710	Talk to-
1DI0023711	Wow! What luck!
1DI0023712	I'm Sticky. Forget these little kids. I'll take you to Big Town where the mungos -- err, I mean, where the grownups live. I'm headed there now.
1DI0023713	Hey mungo. This is an A B conversation so C your way out.
1DI0023714	Are you sure you know where you're going? I mean... you look kinda like you might be lost?
1DI0023716	I can't wait to get to Big Town!
1DI0023717	You want to go to Big Town? Of course you do!
1DI0023718	Yeah! I made it to Big Town! Big Town! Hurray! Now I just need to find Red.
1DI0023719	So, it looks like you decided to do things their way. How come?
1DI0023720	See Herbert? Now that's a nice person for you. Why can't you be more like that!
1DI0023721	Look, Herbert, he's back. I told you!
1DI0023722	Look, Herbert, she's back. I told you!
1DI0023723	Glad to see you're finally awake. I can't believe they made you do that stupid ceremony.
1DI0023724	They listen when I talk, but they don't hear... know what I mean?
1DI0023725	Birch's word is the law. You must leave Oasis at once.
1DI0023726	You big dummy! Now we gotta wait for another Outsider!
1DI0023727	I'm afraid you're no longer welcome in His home. Please begone.
1DI0023728	Was it too much to ask to expect some civility from you? Bah. Get out of my sight.
1DI0023729	I'm afraid you're no longer welcome here. If you come back, we have orders to shoot.
1DI0023730	By insulting the Tree Father, you've insulted us all. You are no longer a guest here. I'd advise you to leave immediately.
1DI0023731	I thought I was quite clear. Leave or we will be forced to take action!
1DI0023732	How could this happen to us? Where did we go wrong?
1DI0023733	It's over... all over.
1DI0023734	This can't be! It just can't! How could He leave us?
1DI0023735	Our god lives no more.
1DI0023736	I can't believe He's gone. He meant everything to me.
1DI0023737	He's dead... the Great One is dead!
1DI0023738	I've just seen Tree Father and Leaf Mother Laurel enter the Grove. This worries me.
1DI0023739	Our leaders speak with the Great One. I hope nothing's wrong.
1DI0023740	Tree Father and Leaf Mother are conferring with the Great One. Something important must be happening.
1DI0023741	Something here is different. I can feel it.
1DI0023742	I feel a change in the air, I wonder what it could be?
1DI0023743	Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bloomseer Poplar, soothsayer and healer of Oasis.
1DI0023744	It brings me great honor to welcome you.
1DI0023745	You have more questions for me perhaps?
1DI0023746	Go away, you big meanie!
1DI0023747	So you're the Outsider huh? You seem nice to me!
1DI0023748	Hiya!
1DI0023749	Branchtender Cypress at your service. Welcome to our little home.
1DI0023750	Ah, Outsider. So nice to see you again.
1DI0023751	It's very nice to meet you, Outsider. I'm Branchtender Linden.
1DI0023752	Good to speak to you again.
1DI0023753	Yes, what can I do for you on this beautiful day?
1DI0023754	Have you changed your mind, Outsider? Do you want to speak with Tree Father Birch?
1DI0023755	How could you do this to us? How could you take him away from us?
1DI0023756	Any chance the Wasteland had for recovery someday is now gone.
1DI0023757	Please, I wish to be alone right now.
1DI0023758	You've done a great deed this day, my friend.
1DI0023759	The gifts the Great One has bestowed upon us will now take mere decades to breach the confines of Oasis instead of centuries.
1DI0023760	The choice you made disturbs me, Outsider. Why you chose to side with my husband when it's quite clear Oasis could have benefited all eludes me.
1DI0023761	No matter. What's done is done, and I'll still do the best that I can to find a way to spread his influence throughout the Wasteland.
1DI0023762	You have questions for me, Outsider?
1DI0023763	I love Birch, but sometimes I think he doesn't see the big picture.
1DI0023764	The spreading of His influence is not a curse, it's a great miracle... a benefit meant for the entire Wasteland!
1DI0023765	The Great One is dead. Slain by your hand. Don't worry, I hold no grudge towards you.
1DI0023766	You'll have to forgive my people at a time like this, Outsider. They aren't used to being so lost.
1DI0023767	And for once, I don't have the words to help them.
1DI0023768	The choice you made disturbs me, Outsider. Why you chose to side with my wife when it's quite clear Oasis would be in peril eludes me.
1DI0023769	No matter. What's done is done, and I'll still do the best that I can keeping Him safe from those that seek to harm Him.
1DI0023770	You've done a great deed this day, my friend. You've ensured the safety of the Great One and the inhabitants of Oasis.
1DI0023771	Yes, Outsider? What is it?
1DI0023772	I know why you're here and despite what my wife thinks, I know you'll do what's best for Oasis.
1DI0023773	After all, He chose you and He would never want to put us in harm's way.
1DI0023774	What's wrong? Why are you leaving?
1DI0023775	As soon as the rest of the Treeminders are in place, we'll begin.
1DI0023776	What is it you wish to talk about, my friend?
1DI0023777	You have no idea how overjoyed I am to see you! Normally Outsiders are forbidden inside Oasis, but He has made an exception.
1DI0023778	We will speak once we've arrived in the Pavilion. Not to worry, all will be explained.
1DI0023779	I'm so glad you're here. It's been a while since anyone's visited us, and He's been waiting for someone like yourself to arrive.
1DI0023780	If you wouldn't mind following me, I'll bring you right to Him.
1DI0023781	Outsider! You have arrived! Please, come closer... I have something of the utmost urgency to speak to you about!
1DI0023782	Do hurry, He doesn't like to be kept waiting!
1DI0023783	It's not wise to keep the Great One waiting.
1DI0023784	Now is the time for an audience with Him. We can talk later.
1DI0023785	We aren't permitted to speak until the Ceremony has completed.
1DI0023786	We'll speak after you meet the Great One.
1DI0023787	Prepare yourself to meet Him, Outsider. It will change your life.
1DI0023788	The Ceremony of Purification has begun. Rejoice!
1DI0023789	No more words. The Ceremony begins.
1DI0023790	Take your place, Outsider. The Ceremony is about to begin.
1DI0023791	Rejoice, the Great One wishes to see you!
1DI0023792	You are welcome amongst us, Outsider.
1DI0023793	Revel, Outsider, for he has chosen you!
1DI0023794	Like the Great One Himself, we welcome you with outstretched arms.
1DI0023795	Welcome to Oasis, Outsider. We hope you'll find peace among us.
1DI0023796	We're very pleased to see you, Outsider. Welcome!
1DI0023797	Welcome, Outsider!
1DI0023798	Think you can take charge of the gang by getting rid of me?
1DI0023799	Hey, man. Can I come with you again? This place sucks.
1DI0023800	About time you got back. I got a full clip and an empty flask. Time we fixed that, huh?
1DI0023802	What's the story, my fellow Tunnel Snake?
1DI0023803	You got something to say to the Butch-man?
1DI0023804	Physical violence on your part invalidates our contract.
1DI0023805	You return. Shall I join you once again?
1DI0023807	I don't like the look of this place.
1DI0023810	Oh, it's been too long since I got to play rough.
1DI0023811	Oh! You came back! Do you want me to back you up, lover?
1DI0023812	Can we go yet?
1DI0023813	Can I do something for you? Or... to you?
1DI0023814	Yes, lover?
1DI0023815	Bottlecap for your thoughts.
1DI0023823	Oh, fuck no. I don't take that shit from anyone. You're dead!
1DI0023824	What the fuck, man? I've been standing here forever!
1DI0023826	What're we standing around here for when there's plenty of action around?
1DI0023827	Yeah, kid? What do you need?
1DI0023828	Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'. Boo hoo. Megaton blew up.
1DI0023829	These fuckers deserved what they got.
1DI0023830	Now, can we get out of here? Or should I just keep waiting next to this stinking hole?
1DI0023831	Can we get out of here? Or should I just keep waiting next to this stinking hole?
1DI0023832	Yeah? What the fuck do you want now?
1DI0023833	It saddens me that it has come to this. Farewell, my friend.
1DI0023834	I had hoped you'd return. What now?
1DI0023835	You have something to say?
1DI0023836	What have you got on your mind?
1DI0023837	Something troubling you, my friend?
1DI0023839	RL-3 regrets to inform that you are obviously unfit to command, sir!
1DI0023840	RL-3 is pleased to see you, sir! Is there a mission to undertake?
1DI0023841	RL-3 is ready for another tour of duty, sir!
1DI0023842	RL-3 is ready for duty, sir!
1DI0023843	Yes, commander?
1DI0023844	By your command, sir!
1DI0023845	I am disappointed that things have come to this.
1DI0023846	It is well to see you again. Shall we continue?
1DI0023847	Yes? What do you require?
1DI0023848	Vigilance is necessary in this location. Be on your guard, my friend.
1DI0023849	There is a foul stench on the wind. Let us not tarry for long.
1DI0023850	And so you return. It is good to see you hale. How my I help you, my friend?
1DI0023851	I had a feeling you would return. Is it further assistance that you seek?
1DI0023852	A3-21... awaiting initialization protocol parameters...
1DI0023853	Look, no offense, but I've got some heavy things to think about. Just go tell Zimmer I'm waiting for him.
1DI0023854	Look. I appreciate you're helping with Zimmer, but I really just want to put this all behind me. So I'm going to pretend none of that happened.
1DI0023855	Now, is there something I can help you with citizen?
1DI0023856	You've been rather busy lately. Asking questions. "Investigating." So, is that it? You're some kind of investigator? A detective for hire?
1DI0023857	Or do you have some kind of personal grudge against an innocent android who simply wants to be left alone? Please, tell me. I'd really like to know.
1DI0023859	You did a good thing, delivering that component to Zimmer. Telling him the android was dead. For that, I'm going entrust you with some information.
1DI0023860	The android's transformation was done by a man named Pinkerton, here in Rivet City. He's hidden down in the broken fore section of the ship.
1DI0023861	You'll need to swim to reach him, but if you're inclined, Pinkerton can perform a facial reconstruction on you as well.
1DI0023862	It won't disguise your identity, but you'll be able to experience life in a new skin, and truly understand... that we're all human on the inside.
1DI0023863	We'd best not be seen speaking with each other further. If you want a new face, see Pinkerton, down in the flooded fore section  of the carrier.
1DI0023867	Our dealings are done. I must ready myself for the journey back to the Commonwealth. Now if you don't mind...
1DI0023870	We did it! You did it! You helped us defeat the Mutants! We'll all feel safer now! Thank you so much!
1DI0023871	Alright! Yeah! We sure showed those Mutants didn't we!
1DI0023872	I got to admit I didn't think you were one of the good ones. But, what the hell - THANKS! Things might not be so bad after all!
1DI0023873	Nah, who am I kidding? There's still plenty of things out there that want to kill us.
1DI0023874	At least I didn't die today. I got you to thank for that. So, thanks!
1DI0023875	I think I'm going to build a little shrine to you. All I need is some incense sticks and candles.
1DI0023876	I was starting to think that Big Town wasn't a very good place to live... but now I think we can do it! Thanks to you!
1DI0023877	We got those Mutants good, didn't we?!
1DI0023878	I'm starting to feel safe for the first time in a long time. Thanks to you!
1DI0023879	I got a lot to thank you for... I don't know how do it. Here... take this. It's always given me good luck.
1DI0023880	What are you looking at? You'd think you'd never seen a Ghoul up close before.
1DI0023881	What the hell did you wake me up for, smoothskin? What are you staring at? You think you'd never seen a Ghoul up close before.
1DI0023882	What now? You're starting to piss me off. Are you one of them Ghoul haters?
1DI0023883	Back again, eh? Changed your mind? I still need to know if you have any problems with killing.
1DI0023884	I thought you weren't interested in what I had to say?
1DI0023885	Do you have those keys yet?
1DI0023886	Are they all dead yet? Did you bring me any proof?
1DI0023887	Is Tenpenny dead? God, I hope so.
1DI0023888	Don't you have something to do?
1DI0023889	How did you get past the guard? What do you want?
1DI0023890	I haven't heard anything about Mister Crowley recently. So what could you possibly want?
1DI0023891	Dude, you got your key. What do you want now?
1DI0023892	Do you need more than that gift?
1DI0023893	Here's the key. He never even noticed.
1DI0023894	You've got your god damn key. Isn't that enough?
1DI0023896	Back in Arefu, eh? Good to see you again.
1DI0023897	How the heck are ya'?
1DI0023898	Hey there!
1DI0023899	Don't mind Brailee... she's in la la land again.
1DI0023900	I'm glad I was wrong about you. Welcome back.
1DI0023901	I heard about your little killing spree in Arefu. Get the hell away from me.
1DI0023902	Look... I'd just rather not speak with you right now. Sorry.
1DI0023903	Get the fucking hell out of my sight. I never want to speak to you ever again.
1DI0023904	Hello there, nice to see you.
1DI0023905	The Family only kills what it consumes. Your murders in Arefu were for sport!
1DI0023906	So you're Evan King's killer, eh? You don't look so tough to me.
1DI0023907	We heard about Arefu... nice going, asshole!
1DI0023908	Thanks for setting me straight on everything.
1DI0023909	Always a pleasure to receive you in Meresti. What brings you down here today?
1DI0023911	So, what do you need?
1DI0023913	Hiya kid!
1DI0023914	Hey, welcome back.
1DI0023916	You're a real hero the way you handled the Ghouls.
1DI0023917	I was worried about those Ghouls. Now I can get back to worrying about important things, like what color to dye my hair. Thanks for everything!
1DI0023918	You're amazing. The way you handled those Ghouls. Good show!
1DI0023919	Guess we can try living with the Ghouls.
1DI0023920	I hope those Ghouls try to get along with us civilized people.
1DI0023921	Hello, hello!
1DI0023922	I'm mighty appreciative of your straightening things out. Perhaps next time I go on safari I'll take you along.
1DI0023923	Is there something you require?
1DI0023924	Good job taking care of our little problem. Now if you'll excuse me...
1DI0023925	Thank you for dealing with those Ghouls. You're a real hero.
1DI0023926	Thanks for helping those Ghouls. They really aren't so bad.
1DI0023928	Hey... you're the one that got rid of those Ghouls. Or was that someone else...? No, it WAS you!
1DI0023929	Hey... you're the one with the Ghoul friends... well I guess they're our friends now, too.
1DI0023930	Hey... I know you! Cheers!
1DI0023931	Good job removing our little pest problem!
1DI0023932	Hello friend!
1DI0023933	I have nothing to say to you. Except this: Watch your back!
1DI0023934	Hrmph.
1DI0023936	You did it! You got rid of those vile creatures! Good show!
1DI0023938	You'll get yours soon enough.
1DI0023939	Goodbye!
1DI0023940	Hello friend. Thanks for handling those Ghouls.
1DI0023941	Hello friend. Ghoul physiology is fascinating!
1DI0023943	Those Ghouls wont be bothering us anymore, will they?
1DI0023945	Come to pour salt into the wound? Well, I won't stand for it!
1DI0023946	Zombie-lover!
1DI0023947	Things have been perfectly fabulous since you exterminated that filthy vermin!
1DI0023948	Fabulous!
1DI0023949	You think I want to talk to you?
1DI0023950	You've ruined my life!
1DI0023951	Comrade! Hero of the people! Hello!
1DI0023952	Hey comrade! Those Ghoul's seem like a real community, hey? Adversity must have made them strong.
1DI0023953	Greetings hero-comrade!
1DI0023954	You're all my husband talks about now. Do you have any idea how annoying that is?
1DI0023955	I miss my husband. He would have really liked you I think.
1DI0023957	Hey! I'm sure glad to have you around. That Gustavo's a real loser compared to you!
1DI0023959	Take a real good look, because you won't be getting any of this!
1DI0023960	Hah! I'm doing just fine, no thanks to you!
1DI0023962	You're a lot tougher than you look, kid.
1DI0023963	Glad to see you were able to convince these people to open their minds a little. Those Ghouls will liven things up around here for a long time!
1DI0023964	Hello fellow adventurer!
1DI0023965	Haha! Look at this mess. We'll have it cleaned up soon. Then it will be a Ghoul haven.
1DI0023966	Ha ha! Hey there bud. Thanks again for helping us get in here!
1DI0023967	Hey there bud!
1DI0023968	Well, it'll take a little elbow grease but then this place will be a true home!
1DI0023969	Oh, hello there! Can't thank you enough!
1DI0023970	Hi again!
1DI0023971	Bastards. Could have done it the easy way and just let us live here with them. Oh well. Guess we better get started with the clean up.
1DI0023972	Hey kid. I was wrong about you. Good job!
1DI0023973	Hey kid, how's it going?
1DI0023974	Must admit, you did good soldier. I'm glad to have you around.
1DI0023975	Don't know how you did it. I'd never allow those zombies room and board. But as long as Tenpenny keeps paying me I'll stay.
1DI0023977	Good job handling those zombies!
1DI0023978	What's up? Kill any more zombies lately?
1DI0023979	Hey soldier!
1DI0023980	What brings you by Rivet City today?
1DI0023981	You had your chance... you blew it.
1DI0023983	I have no interest in talking to you.
1DI0023984	Well, well, well. If it isn't the greatest American hero... or Abraham Washington's greatest anyway.
1DI0023985	I figured we'd bump into each other again. What brings you all the way out to Ghoulsville?
1DI0023986	So, what can I help with?
1DI0023988	Our abolitionist hero!
1DI0023989	Life is much better for us here than it was in the Wasteland. We're better armed and better fed.
1DI0023990	I am most honored to see you again, sir.
1DI0023991	I am most honored to see you again, ma'am.
1DI0023992	You've come to see us! How sweet.
1DI0023993	Thanks to you, we're rebuilding the Memorial.
1DI0023994	It's great to see you again.
1DI0023995	The slaves know their place now, thanks to you.
1DI0023996	Hey there! Got anything good for me?
1DI0023997	I can't believe they're all dead. I just can't...
1DI0023998	I really don't feel like talking right now. Please leave.
1DI0023999	Look, our contract is done. There's nothing else for you here... okay?
1DI0024000	I thought we might see you again.
1DI0024001	So, you're back. What did you want?
1DI0024002	Well all right! You're back!
1DI0024003	There you go, good as new.
1DI0024004	You made it! Great! Need patching up?
1DI0024005	Looks like you pulled my fat out of the fire again. Thanks.
1DI0024006	Damn, I could have used your help with those uglies.
1DI0024007	Sorry, gotta get back to the Compound. Come by and visit us when you want to offload some of that data.
1DI0024008	Uh oh, you're back. Something need fixing?
1DI0024009	There you go! I hope you like it.
1DI0024010	Oh good, you came back to visit!
1DI0024011	Yay! You're back!
1DI0024012	Hiya! Whatcha doing back here?
1DI0024013	Sorry... need to be alone for a while.
1DI0024014	Get away from me! They'll find me next!
1DI0024015	Hey there, hot stuff.
1DI0024017	Well, hello there. You look like you could use a rest.
1DI0024019	Mmmm-hmmm. What's that you're carrying? Is it something else to taunt me with?
1DI0024020	I told you to get the hell out and I meant it!
1DI0024021	Sit down a spell and relax.
1DI0024022	You're a sight for these old eyes.
1DI0024023	Well, well. Look who the cat dragged in.
1DI0024024	Please don't hurt me.
1DI0024025	You're the bad man that hurts people, aren't you?
1DI0024026	You're the bad lady that hurts people, aren't you?
1DI0024027	I remember you. You're mean.
1DI0024028	What do you want, meanie?
1DI0024029	You shouldn't take things that don't belong to you.
1DI0024030	You're bad. I don't think I should talk to you.
1DI0024031	Do you like being bad? Or is it just you can't help it?
1DI0024032	I bet you're so bad because your mom didn't love you.
1DI0024033	I've heard of you. You're one of the good guys!
1DI0024034	It makes me feel safer knowing you're around.
1DI0024035	You're my hero, mister. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
1DI0024036	You're my hero, ma'am. I want to be just like you when I grow up.
1DI0024037	So what, you here to make fun of me or something?
1DI0024038	I can't believe you sold me to Slavers! Why would you do that to me?
1DI0024039	Well, you can... you can just GO TO HELL. That's right. I said it and I mean it. I never wanna talk to you again. Like ever!
1DI0024040	What's the matter with you? Leave me alone!
1DI0024041	Get away from me! I never wanna see you again!
1DI0024042	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Paradise Falls!
1DI0024043	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Rivet City!
1DI0024044	I got a lot of stuff to get together. Can't wait to get to Little Lamplight!
1DI0024045	Checking up on me or something?
1DI0024046	Your arrival is most unexpected, but not entirely unwelcome.
1DI0024048	Well, well, well! Look who it is Bob! It's our new friend!
1DI0024049	Hey! My second best friend in the whole wide world!
1DI0024050	Hiya.
1DI0024051	I'm very happy to see you again, savior of Oasis.
1DI0024052	What is it, Outsider?
1DI0024053	Ah, it's nice to have the pleasure of your company again.
1DI0024054	What is it you need, Outsider?
1DI0024055	Well, well... if it isn't our old friend! Good to see you!
1DI0024057	Welcome back, my good friend!
1DI0024058	Yes, Outsider?
1DI0024059	Goodness, it's wonderful to speak to you again!
1DI0024060	What is it now, Outsider?
1DI0024061	Yes, my friend? What can I do for you now?
1DI0024063	You did me a great favor with those keys. How do you like my new armor? Those keys led me right to it.
1DI0024064	You stole what was rightfully mine! Get lost.
1DI0024065	You did me a great favor with those keys. I know just how to use them.
1DI0024066	Thanks for not croaking me, dude.
1DI0024067	Hey! It's my favorite wanker! I so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain. Hah ha!
1DI0024068	Hey! It's my favorite bitch assassin! Hah ha! I so fucking glad I talked you out of putting a bullet in my brain!
1DI0024069	I presume you are still honoring our previous arrangement? I enjoy being alive, at least for the moment.
1DI0024070	The AntAgonizer! You're the awesomest person ever, ever! Can I have your autograph?
1DI0024071	The Mechanist! You're the awesomest person ever, ever! Can I have your autograph?
1DI0024072	Goodbye, AntAgonizer! I have to go home now!
1DI0024073	Goodbye, Mechanist! I have to go home now!
1DI0024074	I'm heading back to Rivet City to get more supplies to sell to Big Town. They bought out my entire stock!
1DI0024075	I'm headed to Big Town. There's good money to be made there. They ordered a ton of supplies, and now that it's safe, I'm heading up there!
1DI0024076	I'm headed to Big Town. There's good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of high power explosives!
1DI0024077	I'm headed to Big Town. There's good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of robot parts!
1DI0024078	I'm headed to Big Town. There's good money to be made there. They ordered a few Stealth Boys.
1DI0024079	I'm headed to Big Town. There's good money to be made there. They ordered a bunch of firepower.
1DI0024080	I'm heading up to Big Town to see what's left for the taking. I heard everyone up there was either killed or dragged off by Super Mutants.
1DI0024081	Finders keepers, am I right? Ha Ha...
1DI0024082	Go away. I've had enough of your "help" already.
1DI0024083	Hey, what happened with the robot?
1DI0024084	Oh, hey there. Do you need something?
1DI0024085	Thanks for your help, friend. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come along.
1DI0024086	Hello, again. How about that robot, huh?
1DI0024087	Thank God... water... I'm out. You've got to give me some water or I'm done for...
1DI0024088	Water... please...
1DI0024089	I can't travel yet, but I'll be back on my feet soon, thanks to you. I never expected help from a stranger in the Wasteland.
1DI0024090	Good to see you again, friend!
1DI0024091	We could use some help here! It came out of nowhere!
1DI0024092	That thing would have killed us all without your help. Thanks.
1DI0024093	Listen, you may as well take this map. That's where we were headed, but that Deathclaw cured me of my itch for Wasteland adventure.
1DI0024094	You'll stay out of this if you know what's good for you. We found that water and we're keeping it.
1DI0024095	I hope you're not here for that water. Because we're leaving with it, and my mama never taught me to share.
1DI0024096	Thanks for the help. A deal's a deal. Here's your water.
1DI0024097	You've got what you came for. Why don't you move on? I'm not looking for any new friends at the moment.
1DI0024098	Watch out! That scorpion won't let us near the water!
1DI0024099	That thing won't let us near the water!
1DI0024100	Help yourself to the water. You earned it.
1DI0024101	Uh, hey. I'm outta here... so... see ya.
1DI0024102	Er, uh, hold it right there, pal. You're giving me everything you own. Um, now.
1DI0024103	Er, uh, hold it right there, sister. You're giving me everything you own. Um, now.
1DI0024104	I save your ass in the rotunda and you take the caps and glory, huh?
1DI0024105	I'm not about to let you go bragging to anyone about retrieving the Declaration and leaving me in the dust.
1DI0024106	It's alive! The Wasteland is reborn!
1DI0024107	Those Raiders strapped me with explosives! You've got to help me!
1DI0024108	Got to get away! They're burning everything!
1DI0024109	Grayditch... it's burning... burning!
1DI0024110	Make him shut up! Please, just make him shut up!
1DI0024111	It's... it's so quiet...
1DI0024112	Hold it! This area is under the authority of the Brotherhood of Steel. Leave immediately.
1DI0024113	Was I not clear enough? Leave. Now.
1DI0024114	I have no time for you, Wastelander. Go.
1DI0024115	Welcome back. Have you been successful in your search for books?
1DI0024116	You've returned. Have you brought me any books?
1DI0024117	You've saved my life. I am in your debt.
1DI0024118	I am forever in your debt. Thank you.
1DI0024119	We're almost to the door, don't stop now!
1DI0024120	Keep going, we're almost outside!
1DI0024121	Thank God someone's come! You have to help me! Please!
1DI0024122	Stay on point. We will back you up. It's the least we can offer you.
1DI0024123	Lead on. We will ensure your safe passage through Falls Church.
1DI0024124	You have our thanks, stranger. We could not have recovered our ward without your aid.
1DI0024125	Good. He is safe. The Brotherhood are men of their word and so, here is your payment. Spend it well.
1DI0024126	Farewell, mercenary. May you find honor in your travels.
1DI0024127	Excellent. The Initiate is safely returned to us. You have the thanks of the Brotherhood, my friend.
1DI0024128	We cannot offer you much in return, but know that you may travel through Falls Church under our protection.
1DI0024129	What do you mean he's dead? What kind of a lousy merc are you?
1DI0024130	Damned worthless merc! You can't even pull off a simple rescue op?
1DI0024131	He's gone... damn. It just all happened so fast. Poor kid.
1DI0024132	We just weren't fast enough to save him. Damn.
1DI0024133	Don't be so anxious, merc. Get our man, then you'll get your payday.
1DI0024134	He's up ahead, in that building! Don't stop!
1DI0024135	Go! Go! Go!
1DI0024136	Move out!
1DI0024137	Go find your fortune somewhere else, merc. We'll take care of this ourselves.
1DI0024138	If you're not going to help, just stay out of the way.
1DI0024139	Stranger, I thank you for your aid. We must press forward, if you are willing to aid us, you are welcome to join us.
1DI0024140	Speak with Paladin Hoss.
1DI0024141	Well lookit this! We got us a wanderer all the way out here in Will'im's Wharf! You mus' got some import'int bus'ness out here to be wandrin' around.
1DI0024142	But, 'taint none of my beeswax what yer doin'. But if yer interested in tradin', maybe we can help each other.
1DI0024143	You again! Y'all interested in tradin' this time?
1DI0024144	'Lurks ain't got ya yet, I see. You need some tradin'?
1DI0024145	Watch out, there's a 'Guai den to the north. I'd steer clear of it if I were you.
1DI0024146	Be very very quiet. They can hear you coming a mile away.
1DI0024147	You've got some serious stones walking through here by yourself.
1DI0024148	Shh! You're gonna scare away the 'Guai.
1DI0024149	You showed up at a bad time, stranger. This position is being overrun.
1DI0024150	I suggest that you head out of here while the Muties are focused on us.
1DI0024151	Why are you still here? I said go!
1DI0024152	Jesus, they just came out of nowhere...
1DI0024153	They nearly wiped us out... so many of them... but the Brotherhood survives!
1DI0024154	We don't have a radio... no way to call for help...
1DI0024155	I thought I was about to be written into the scrolls, but we live to fight another day.
1DI0024156	Let there be no doubt: the might of the Brotherhood prevails.
1DI0024157	So long as my brothers stand by my side, there can be no defeat.
1DI0024161	Hey. We grabbed this on our last mission. Thought you might like it.
1DI0024162	A badass like you, you deserve a cut of everything around here. Take it. It's yours.
1DI0024163	Check this out. Me and a couple of the boys thought you could use a cut of the loot we picked up.
1DI0024164	Greetings, fellow survivor! Another fine day in the Wastes, isn't it?
1DI0024165	Greetings, fellow survivor! The great work of rebuilding humanity must go forward!
1DI0024166	Another Wasteland survivor, huh? Sorry, but I don't got enough to share. Get your own copy of the book and do your own hunting!
1DI0024167	Glad to see a friendly face out here.
1DI0024168	I swear, that damn book nearly ended me.
1DI0024169	Whew! I thought I was a goner. You saved my life. Here, take this. It's the least I can do.
1DI0024170	I'm afraid you're just bringing in too many slaves for us to keep up. Now Eulogy is pissed at us for not being as good as you.
1DI0024171	First rule of competition: you can't lose if your competitor is dead. So long, fucker.
1DI0024172	The hell do you want? We're busy.
1DI0024173	Can I interest you in an extremely rare refreshment?
1DI0024174	Look, I have business to get back to, so if you don't mind...
1DI0024175	Quit gawking, smoothskin! We're headed over to Tenpenny Tower. We Ghouls own that place now. You smoothskins aren't allowed to live there anymore.
1DI0024176	Quit gawking smoothskin! We're on our way to Tenpenny Tower. You know anything about the tower?
1DI0024177	We're done being oppressed by you smoothskins.
1DI0024178	I was on my way to Megaton to do some trading when I heard somebody blew the place right off the map. Jesus.
1DI0024179	Don't even think about it. That Enclave tech is mine, fair and square.
1DI0024180	Help yourself. I don't think messing with the Enclave is a good idea.
1DI0024181	I don't know about you, but those Enclave Eyebots give me the creeps.
1DI0024182	You see these all over nowadays. I wonder what it means.
1DI0024183	That'll make for some nice, juicy steaks. If you like ant, that is.
1DI0024184	There's nothing better than fresh dog, don't you think? We'll be happy to set you up with something if you're hungry.
1DI0024185	A bit gamey for my taste, but there's some folks that like a nice bit of Mole Rat. If you like it fresh, I'm selling...
1DI0024186	Nasty brute, but tasty once you get the fur off.
1DI0024187	Hello, stranger. I'm Tinker Joe, premier supplier of robotic parts and service throughout the DC Wasteland.
1DI0024188	Remember me? Tinker Joe, at your service. Robots for sale, robots serviced while you wait. Interested?
1DI0024189	Yes? Did you need something else?
1DI0024190	I am not for sale. I am only a demonstration model. Tinker Joe will be glad to handle any of your robotic needs. Have a nice day.
1DI0024191	Damned shame about those slaves. Would've fetched us a nice pile of caps at Paradise Falls.
1DI0024192	Hey, we're looking for some slaves that ran off. Seen 'em? They can't have gone far.
1DI0024193	We got away from the Slavers who were taking us to Paradise Falls, but they said our collars were explosive. Blow our heads off if we ran.
1DI0024194	Do you think you can get this thing off of me before it's too late?
1DI0024195	Thanks for not attacking us. Most people don't tolerate Ghouls.
1DI0024196	Please, help me! You've got to get this collar off of me!
1DI0024197	Please... won't you help me?
1DI0024198	Come on. Help me get this collar off. Please.
1DI0024199	Thank God you saved me!
1DI0024200	I'm heading to the Temple of the Union. They take care of escaped slaves.
1DI0024201	Maybe you could tell any other slaves you meet about it.
1DI0024202	You saved me from those bastards. I won't forget it.
1DI0024203	Hey... hey, man. You need something? A little fix, maybe? Some Jet? I got Jet. Psycho too. Take a look!
1DI0024204	What do you need? I can get you a fix. Anything you want. Cheap, too! Check it out!
1DI0024205	No students in Hall without Pass.  Visitors must sign in at Administration.
1DI0024206	Finally! Free!
1DI0024207	I have to get out of here!
1DI0024208	Please! Help us!
1DI0024209	There's no point...
1DI0024210	Why bother?
1DI0024211	Where could we go even if we did escape? We'd just die in the Wasteland.
1DI0024212	There's a bomb strapped to me! You've got to disarm it, quick!
1DI0024213	Help me! I'm wired with explosives!
1DI0024214	Help! This bomb is about to go off!
1DI0024215	Thanks! You saved my life!
1DI0024216	This is surprising. Another of my kind, who does not follow the mindless killing way.
1DI0024217	You haven't shot at me yet. That's different.
1DI0024218	Are you afraid of me? I understand. All of my brothers you've met have been savage killers.
1DI0024219	I try to think I am different from them, but maybe I'm only fooling myself. Maybe there is no escaping my inborn nature.
1DI0024220	You are friends with another of my brothers? I am astounded! I thought I was the only one who wanted more from life.
1DI0024221	Ah, my little friend. Our paths cross once again. I have wandered far since we last spoke.
1DI0024222	I didn't mean to come this way, actually, but some bleeders... ah, excuse me, some humans have been chasing me.
1DI0024223	I am glad to see you, little one. I hope your life has been happy since we last spoke.
1DI0024224	Hello, little brother. Good to see you again.
1DI0024225	Hello, little sister. Good to see you again.
1DI0024226	I'm so glad you came back to see me.
1DI0024227	I always enjoy our little chats. How can I help you?
1DI0024228	Have you heard? A man named Hannibal Hamlin is gathering all the escaped slaves at a safe place called the Temple of the Union!
1DI0024229	Finally, people are standing up against the Slavers! We're on our way to join Hannibal's cause!
1DI0024230	Thanks again for your help. For Freedom!
1DI0024231	We have a dangerous journey ahead of us. What did you need?
1DI0024232	Thanks, friend. That was a narrow shave and no mistake. Probably would have eaten us or whatever those damned things do to people.
1DI0024233	Listen, we got some water we can spare. Go ahead, you earned it.
1DI0024234	Whew. Thanks for the help. I thought I was a goner.
1DI0024235	You probably saved my life. Here, take this. You look like you may need it more than I will.
1DI0024236	Where'd he come from? If you hadn't come along, that ugly brute probably would've eaten me, or dragged me off to wherever.
1DI0024237	Here, take this. It's the least I can do.
1DI0024238	Thanks, stranger. That thing would probably have killed me if it wasn't for you.
1DI0024239	I wish I had more, but I want you to have this. And I won't take no for an answer.
1DI0024240	You don't usually see those damned Super Mutants out so far from D.C. Good thing there was only one of them.
1DI0024241	Salutations, Commander! Sergeant RL-3, Gutsy-class robotic soldier, reporting for duty!
1DI0024244	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new man in my life.
1DI0024245	You're looking for a bodyguard, and I'm looking for a body. Sounds like we're going to have some fun times, lover.
1DI0024246	My name's Clover. I hear you're the new woman in my life.
1DI0024248	My friend! I see I've found you at last!
1DI0024249	I knew you had survived, and I had hoped to assist in your rescue to repay my debt to you.
1DI0024250	Ah! That's it. Tenpenny promised me safety and security. And that damn useless Gustavo lets thieves run amok. This is the last straw. I'm leaving.
1DI0024251	Oooh! I can't believe it. With all of Gustavo's goons running around, they still let thieves come into my store and take things!
1DI0024252	I thought I was safe here. That's it, I'm leaving. I'll try my luck elsewhere.
1DI0024253	There must be somewhere safe out there.
1DI0024254	Where will I go?
1DI0024256	Who the hell are you?! Where did you come from?! Did Moriarty send you?!
1DI0024257	Here... you've done so much for us. I want you to have this. It's all I have to offer you...
1DI0024258	All of us here thank you for everything you've done. For us... for the Wastes. We pooled together and got you this.
1DI0024259	It's the best we could do. Please take it, with our thanks.
1DI0024260	I wish there were more people like you in the world.
1DI0024261	I want you to have this. I hope it helps keep you safe.
1DI0024262	Who is this? You're not authorized to use this intercom!
1DI0024263	The time for talk is over. Now, you must act. Go to the purifier. Make your father proud!
1DI0024264	It's time to show the Enclave who they're dealing with. Now let's move out!
1DI0024267	Project Purity is as good as ours!
1DI0024268	You! You're back! We... We all thought... you know.
1DI0024269	Look, Elder Lyons and the others are assembled in the lab. There's talk of assaulting the purifier. You'd better get down there right away.
1DI0024270	Glad to see you're still in one piece. You're just in time for the action. Best get to the lab and talk with Elder Lyons.
1DI0024271	You're back! Listen, something's happening. You need to get to the lab and talk to Elder Lyons right away!
1DI0024272	It's good to see you back. But you'd better get to the lab right away, and report to Elder Lyons.
1DI0024273	Great to see you, but have you spoken to Elder Lyons? He's here in the lab level, near the robot.
1DI0024274	You need to report to Elder Lyons A.S.A.P. He's over by the robot.
1DI0024275	Zzzzzz...
1DI0024276	I'm sorry, but I really don't have time to talk right now. Perhaps Scribe Jameson could help you?
1DI0024277	The Enclave seems to have developed advanced plasma-based weaponry. I need to analyze our Power Armor...
1DI0024278	What I wouldn't do to get my hands on one of those Enclave vertibirds...
1DI0024279	All this time spent acquiring technology, and we look like cavemen next to the Enclave. That is not acceptable.
1DI0024280	Super Mutants, Enclave -- they all bleed the same. No worries.
1DI0024281	Welcome to the Citadel. Just remember -- you're a guest in our home. I expect you to behave yourself.
1DI0024282	Welcome to the Citadel, friend of Steel.
1DI0024283	You ever seen a Super Mutant's head explode? Hell of a mess.
1DI0024284	I hear those Enclave soldiers are equipped with Plasma weapons. Lucky bastards.
1DI0024285	I will serve the Citadel and Elder Lyons until my dying breath. Is there any better life?
1DI0024286	Long live Elder Lyons!
1DI0024288	Hail to you, son of James.
1DI0024289	Hail to you, daughter of James.
1DI0024290	Ah, it's good to see you again.
1DI0024291	What the -- goddammit! Didn't anyone ever teach you not to creep up on people during a live fire exercise?
1DI0024292	What are you thinking? [Sighs] Anyway, I am Knight Captain Dusk, in service of Steel. If you require anything, simply ask.
1DI0024293	Hail to you, stranger. I am Knight Captain Dusk, in service of Steel. If you require anything, simply ask.
1DI0024294	I'm sorry, what part of "I'm done with you" didn't you understand? Leave me alone, Waster.
1DI0024295	Did I stutter? Get out of my face.
1DI0024296	What? Can you not see that I'm concentrating here? You're gonna get your head blown off if you aren't careful. What do you want anyway?
1DI0024297	Do you really think it's wise to interrupt a sniper with a loaded rifle in her hand in the middle of a live fire drill?
1DI0024298	What's so important anyway?
1DI0024299	Dammit! What's wrong with you? This is a firing range, not a nursery -- it's dangerous here. What do you want?
1DI0024300	You holdin' it together, stranger? I see you're still in one piece. That's a good start, eh?
1DI0024301	Still alive, I see. You're doing better than most Wasters that end up in the city.
1DI0024302	Each day we make it to the end's a good one, eh? What do you need?
1DI0024306	Speak.
1DI0024307	Quartermaster Durga here, stranger. I have to say, I'm not sure what you're doing in my armory.
1DI0024308	We run a tight ship and unless Elder Lyons says so, we don't trade with outsiders.
1DI0024309	Quartermaster out.
1DI0024310	Look, I told you. The Brotherhood doesn't trade with outsiders. If you want permission, you'll need to speak with Elder Lyons.
1DI0024311	You again? Was I not clear the first time? I'm under order not to trade with outsiders for supplies. These orders come directly from Elder Lyons.
1DI0024312	If you've got a problem with that, talk to him. Quartermaster out.
1DI0024315	Quartermaster here. What do you need?
1DI0024316	Glad to see you and that egghead Li made it here in one piece. I heard what happened at that purifier. Hell of thing.
1DI0024317	'can I do for you, kid?
1DI0024318	Good to see you in one piece, partner. What can I do for you?
1DI0024320	Initiate! You got a lot of nerve interrupt... Oh, my apologies, stranger. I thought you were one of these worthless Initiates.
1DI0024321	I swear, these kids'd be lost without me here to powder their asses.
1DI0024322	I swear, these kids couldn't hit a barn door. Talk to me, say something to get my mind of these sorry ass recruits.
1DI0024323	These kids couldn't hit the ass end of a Behemoth at five paces. You should get in there and show 'em a thing or two, eh? That'd be a laugh.
1DI0024324	Oh, good. Something to distract me. I swear, if I have to watch these kids miss targets for one more minute...
1DI0024325	Hail. Name's Greg -- Greg Bear. Most of the guys just call me Kodiak.
1DI0024326	Heard about that mess over at the purifier. Don't you worry -- you're safe here.
1DI0024327	Hail, friend.
1DI0024328	I bend my knee to the might of Steel.
1DI0024329	How can I help, friend?
1DI0024330	Hrm? Yes, hello. I've heard about you. We don't get many strangers here in the Citadel, especially those who walk about unescorted.
1DI0024331	I am Scribe Bowditch. If you require something, simply ask.
1DI0024332	How may a serve you, friend of Steel?
1DI0024333	Hail, outsider. I am Scribe Jameson.
1DI0024334	Word of your ordeal has spread. I am truly sorry for the loss of your father. But if I can help you in any way, please let me know.
1DI0024335	"Knowledge is the beginning of wisdom, not the end of it." One of my favorite quotes. Its author has been lost to us.
1DI0024336	How can I help you, outsider?
1DI0024337	I came across something interesting: "The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery."
1DI0024338	Quite true, don't you think?
1DI0024339	"If we value the pursuit of knowledge, we must be free to follow wherever that search may lead us."
1DI0024340	I found that in an ancient book. The words of wisdom of one of the greatest men of the former civilzation.
1DI0024341	The Elder sent word of your arrival.  I am Scribe Peabody. Welcome, et. cetera...
1DI0024342	Now, I'm really very busy. Is there something you needed?
1DI0024343	What do you want, outsider?
1DI0024344	Yes? Can I help you? I'm very busy.
1DI0024345	Yes, what is it?
1DI0024346	How can I help you? Be quick about it.
1DI0024347	H... hail to you, stranger. I am Squire Maxson, loyal servant of steel. It is... an honor to make your acquaintance.
1DI0024348	H... hail to you.
1DI0024349	Greet... greetings to you.
1DI0024350	We've said all that we have to say to one another.
1DI0024351	I will not have James disgraced by anyone, including his ungrateful child.
1DI0024352	Now get out of my sight.
1DI0024353	Hail to you. By the traction of hospitality and on the word of Elder Lyons, I welcome you to the Citadel.
1DI0024354	I am Star Paladin Cross, Keeper of the ARM, and Seneschal to Elder Lyons.
1DI0024355	And, I am honored to say, I was acquainted with your father. Now, what may I do to help you?
1DI0024356	Good evening. What do you require of me?
1DI0024357	I salute you, warrior. You walk among us, but apart from us. How may I aid you?
1DI0024358	What? Huh? I'm sorry... I'm just an Initiate.
1DI0024359	Uhm... I don't think that Paladin Gunny would be very happy if he saw me talking to an outsider.
1DI0024360	Go away! You're going to get me chewed out!
1DI0024361	Please state the nature of the medical emergency.
1DI0024362	Stand down, civilian.
1DI0024363	Please address any questions to Paladin Bael.
1DI0024364	You're making me edgy. Back off.
1DI0024365	If there's an issue, you should speak to my superior, Paladin Bael.
1DI0024366	Name's Paladin Bael. What do you need, civilian?
1DI0024368	State your business, and be quick about it.
1DI0024369	What do you need, civilian?
1DI0024370	What aid can I offer you, outsider?
1DI0024371	I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Give me the Naughty Nightwear!
1DI0024372	Yeah, yeah. Just keep on walkin'.
1DI0024373	So, what did ya bring me?
1DI0024374	So what's the deal. You gonna get me some Sugar Bombs or what?
1DI0024375	You're n..not here to try and steal my secrets are you?
1DI0024376	Get away from me, smoothskin.
1DI0024377	You lookin' for a problem?
1DI0024378	The hell you looking at, smoothskin?
1DI0024379	I like these guys, they let me play with their pucks.
1DI0024380	Hey, I may be just a Winger now, but I'll make Centre soon.
1DI0024381	Sorry, we've got practice. Maybe we'll cross sticks again one day.
1DI0024382	Hold it right there! What are you doing here?
1DI0024383	You there. Hold it. Who the hell are you?
1DI0024384	Ho chum! What's the word?
1DI0024385	You're brave to keep bothering me. Or stupid.
1DI0024386	Oh. Hello. I'm Bessie Lynn. I... I don't think you should be down here. Did you talk to Roy?
1DI0024387	I hope you know what you're doing. You could get in a lot of trouble by coming around uninvited.
1DI0024388	Oh... hello there.
1DI0024389	Will this take long? I ... I have things to do.
1DI0024390	What are you doing here? It's not safe for your kind around here.
1DI0024391	Hello. What is it?
1DI0024392	What the hell do you want?
1DI0024393	Tenpenny Tower is a wonderful place to live, isn't it?
1DI0024394	We are safe from the Wasteland in here.
1DI0024395	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Roy Phillips and his tower.
1DI0024396	I would surely have perished if it wasn't for Mister Tenpenny and his tower.
1DI0024397	So, Crowley is dead, eh?
1DI0024398	Here's your pay. Now, don't spend it all in one place, unless that place is Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0024399	Fancy that! A visitor. I seldom get visitors. Which is a tiresome shame because I'm usually relentlessly bored out of my right mind!
1DI0024400	All these confounded people fluster about like I'm made of eggshells and about to fall to pieces at any moment. I'm surprised they even let you in.
1DI0024401	So what do you think of my fine tower here? It's quite the jewel of the Wasteland isn't it? I daresay I'm quite proud of it myself.
1DI0024402	Heigh ho!
1DI0024403	This better be important.
1DI0024405	You got something to say?
1DI0024406	Welcome to New Urban Apparel. I carry the finest in pre-war clothes. Hurry up, lets get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
1DI0024407	Those clothes are atrocious. You should stop by my shop, New Urban Apparel, and freshen up that look. Upgrade to fabulous!
1DI0024408	I'm always glad to see a customer, especially if they are dressed so hideously. Seriously, we have to get you a new wardrobe.
1DI0024409	Ah, ready for a fresh look? Good.
1DI0024410	How can you be helped today?
1DI0024411	You must be here to update that old look of yours. Let me help. I have just the thing!
1DI0024412	Hurry up, lets get you out of those old rags and into something fabulous!
1DI0024413	I take it this is a social call, and not business?
1DI0024414	This is the Tenpenny Wellness Clinic, and I am Doctor Banfield. I keep the residents healthy.
1DI0024415	I'm off duty. Come back when...ah, what the hell. Let's just get it over with. I'm Doctor Banfield, what do you need?
1DI0024416	You look hurt. It's a good thing you've come in.
1DI0024417	Welcome back to the Wellness Clinic.
1DI0024418	I really hope you aren't hurt. The Clinic is closed and I'd really hate to have to open it up at this hour.
1DI0024419	I remember you. To what do I owe the pleasure?
1DI0024420	Yes? Can I help you?
1DI0024421	Get into any adventures recently?
1DI0024422	You remind me of myself... back when I was a young adventurer.
1DI0024423	Good to see you again, Comrade.
1DI0024424	Welcome to Boutique le Chic. I am Lydia Montenegro, proprietor. Here you'll find only the best, with a price tag you can boast about to your friends!
1DI0024425	I am Lydia Montenegro. I'm sure you've heard of me and my shop, Boutique le Chic? No? Obviously you don't travel in the right circles.
1DI0024426	I can't talk now, visit me at the Boutique during business hours.
1DI0024427	I see my Boutique has proved to be an irresistible lure. Welcome back.
1DI0024428	Back for the best?
1DI0024429	Shopping at le Chic proves you have great taste!
1DI0024430	This better not be a waste of my time.
1DI0024431	New here? Pick any table, except that one in the corner. That's Mr. Tenpenny's table. Nobody sits there. Except him, of course.
1DI0024432	Welcome to Cafe Beau Monde! Gourmet meals and service with a smile!
1DI0024434	Have a seat. I'll get to you in a minute.
1DI0024435	You're new around here. I'm Margaret Primrose. I run the Cafe Beau Monde. Stop by sometime.
1DI0024437	I know you. You're that guy. You know, the one that...whatever.
1DI0024438	I know you. You're that girl. You know, the one that...whatever.
1DI0024439	You may speak to me. And please, don't be tedious.
1DI0024440	Yes? You wish to speak to me? Whatever for?
1DI0024441	I don't suppose there is someone else for you to talk to?
1DI0024442	Are all young people ill-bred these days?
1DI0024443	Welcome to the Federalist Lounge. I'm Shakes. Wet your whistle?
1DI0024444	Happy Holidays! Care for drink?
1DI0024445	A very special welcome to you, sir!
1DI0024446	A very special welcome to you, ma'am!
1DI0024447	Care to wet your whistle?
1DI0024448	Hey there! Is there something I can do for you?
1DI0024449	Make it quick, missy.
1DI0024450	Keep it short. I'm rather busy avoiding my husband.
1DI0024452	Ah yes. Mister Burke is expecting you. He is waiting for you on the balcony.
1DI0024453	Mister Tenpenny isn't taking callers.
1DI0024454	I'm on duty. Can't talk. Direct your security concerns to Chief Gustavo directly.
1DI0024455	I'm not here for your entertainment.
1DI0024456	Hey, I've been wanting to talk to you. Leo told me what you said to him. You know, about his problem.
1DI0024457	I just wanted to say thank you. I know I can be rough, but my little brother means the world to me and you may have saved his life.
1DI0024458	If there's anything that I can ever help you with, just let me know.
1DI0024459	Hey there, Leo's been doing a lot better. I think we have you to thank for that. How can I help you?
1DI0024460	Leo's tickets have stopped coming up short ever since he gave up the chems. Me and my wallet both thank you. What can we do for you?
1DI0024461	Can't a man eat in peace? Go talk to Jenny or Leo if you need something.
1DI0024462	Look, I need to balance these books. If you'd like to order some food, please talk to Jenny or Leo.
1DI0024463	Yep. Still balancing the books. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
1DI0024464	You again. Is there something exciting about watching me? Look: Go talk to Jenny or Leo.
1DI0024465	Hmm? Oh. I'm afraid I'm quite busy right now. If it's food you're after, talk to Jenny or Leo. Otherwise, I can't help you.
1DI0024466	You again? Go Bother Jenny or Leo, will you?
1DI0024467	Hooo weee! Look at you! Now I haven't seen one of those Vault jumpsuits in, wow, a LONG time.  Pretty damn good condition, too!
1DI0024468	Name's Billy Creel. You call me Billy, all right? I know Megaton looks more like a boneyard than a town, but it ain't all bad.
1DI0024469	Take me and Maggie, for instance. We make do just fine. I trade the stuff I scavenge, and she helps keep me on the straight and narrow. He he he.
1DI0024470	Well hot damn! Someone new! Always a pleasure!
1DI0024473	Look, bud. It'd be best if you just drift on by and leave us alone.
1DI0024474	Hey, man. What's going on?
1DI0024475	Well now, if it ain't our local terror. You behave yourself this time, you hear?
1DI0024476	I don't care what you do to these yokels, you just keep your brand of trouble far away from me.
1DI0024477	Colin Moriarty, at your service! Welcome to Moriarty's! My saloon, my home, my little slice of heaven in this godforsaken little town!
1DI0024478	If you've got the caps, I've got your pleasure. Please, sit down, make yourself comfortable -- your troubles are a thing of the past.
1DI0024479	Colin Moriarty. Always pleased to see a new face around here. I'm afraid you've had the misfortune to catch me, well... out of my element.
1DI0024480	I'm the owner and proprietor of Moriarty's, you see. My saloon, my home, my little slice of heaven in this godforsaken little town!
1DI0024481	But, I already know your face from that little stunt you pulled the other day. But no worries, all are welcome here.
1DI0024484	But, please! Please! See for yourself! Come by for a drink or three. You and I... you and I are going to get along just fine.
1DI0024485	Hello, hello. What is it I can do for you?
1DI0024487	And back he comes. So... are you just thirsty, or are you ready to pay my fee? Dear dad's not going to find himself.
1DI0024488	And back she comes. So, are you just thirsty, or are you ready to pay my fee? Dear dad's not going to find himself.
1DI0024493	If it isn't my favorite vault baby! What can I do for you?
1DI0024494	And look who it is! What can this humble barkeep do for you?
1DI0024495	Who have we here? Could it be? A new addition to our humble little community? Dear child, welcome! Welcome to Megaton!
1DI0024496	I am Confessor Cromwell, prophet of Atom and father of the undying Glow. Please child, come to the Church any time. Any time at all!
1DI0024497	I apologize, but I cannot talk now. Perhaps you'd like to take a seat and enjoy the sermon?
1DI0024498	Yes? Oh, I apologize. I was just... contemplating why Atom, in his wisdom, chose to take my dear Maya to his glow before her time.
1DI0024499	These are questions that none of us can answer in this life. Now, how may I help you?
1DI0024500	It is so good to see you again, dear child! Remember, the Church of the Children of Atom is always here for you. Salvation IS attainable!
1DI0024501	Have yourself a nice visit, partner.
1DI0024502	Howdy, pard-ner. My name is Deputy Steel. How may I assist you?
1DI0024503	Howdy ma'am, my name is Deputy Steel. How may I assist you?
1DI0024504	Initiating conversation system... Well hello, pilgrim.
1DI0024505	I'm Doc Church and I run this clinic. Now, before you go askin' me for help, you'd better know the rules. Rule one: don't bother me.
1DI0024506	If you do bother me, you better be damn near dead. I'm busy enough takin' care of people I actually like.
1DI0024507	Follow my rule, I'll keep you patched up, I'll keep getting' paid, and we'll get along just fine.
1DI0024508	Boy, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
1DI0024509	Girl, you're glowin' like a goddamn reactor core. You need help?
1DI0024510	Looks like you went and got yourself irradiated. Too bad for you, I'm off duty. Stop by the clinic in the morning.
1DI0024511	What the hell are you standin' there bleedin' on my floor for? If you need help, then ask for it, dammit!
1DI0024512	You came in here on your own power, so you must not be busted up too bad.
1DI0024513	You'd best have cancer because from the looks of you, you're breaking rule number one right now.
1DI0024514	For Christ's sake, you don't look sick and you sure as hell don't look dead, so why are you bothering me?
1DI0024515	The Doctor is off duty. Go away.
1DI0024516	Don't shoot! Please! Just tell me what you want!
1DI0024517	Hey smoothskin, do you need something? A drink, maybe? Anything? Anything at all?
1DI0024518	<sigh>What'll it be?
1DI0024519	Oh, it's you. Would you like to slap me around before you drink? I'm told that it's a lot of fun.
1DI0024520	Oh good. If it isn't my favorite smoothskin.
1DI0024521	Hey, pal. What do you need?
1DI0024522	Good to see you again! Need a drink?
1DI0024523	Oh, man... I'm glad to see you. Moriarty's been especially nasty lately and I need a friendly face.
1DI0024524	Dad used to say... oh, never mind...
1DI0024525	Dad usually doesn't like when I talk to strangers.
1DI0024526	Be careful, mister. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
1DI0024527	Be careful, lady. My dad is right over there. Try anything, and I'll yell for him.
1DI0024528	Now I KNOW I've never seen you in Megaton before. Let me guess -- just passing through, right?
1DI0024529	We get people tryin' to settle down here all the time. Anyway, if you're hungry, you came to the right place. What can I get you?
1DI0024531	We get people tryin' to settle down here all the time, but you don't look like the type. Anyway...
1DI0024532	Hey. What can I get you?
1DI0024533	So what'll it be today? We've got some noodles. And the Brahmin steak is pretty good, too.
1DI0024534	So what's it going to be?
1DI0024535	Sorry man, I'm off the clock. Noodle time is over.
1DI0024536	Sorry girl, I'm off the clock. Noodle time is over.
1DI0024537	Oh, hey. Look, I'm not working right now.
1DI0024538	The noodle stand is closed right now. If you need something, talk to Leo.
1DI0024539	Oh, look. Another one of your pampered vault assholes. Look here, vault asshole -- I don't like you. Stay clear of me and we'll have no trouble.
1DI0024540	Oh, look. Another one of you Wasteland assholes. Look here, asshole -- I don't like you. Stay clear of me and we'll have no trouble.
1DI0024541	Long time, no see. You takin' care of yourself out there?
1DI0024542	Been a while. You need something?
1DI0024544	Yeah? You want something?
1DI0024545	This'd better be good. I'm in no mood for your shit.
1DI0024546	Say what's on your mind then get out of my face.
1DI0024547	How may I assist you?
1DI0024548	Hi there! I'm Moira, it's a pleasure to meet you! I run Craterside Supply.
1DI0024549	If there's anything you need, anything at all, I probably got it layin' around in here somewhere. Don't be afraid to ask!
1DI0024550	Hey, you! What do you need?
1DI0024551	Have you seen a radiphlange anywhere around here? I could really use one... ah, nevermind. What can I get you?
1DI0024552	Good to see you! Did you bring me any junk?
1DI0024553	Well goddamn. You're new, right? I've got to admit, the outfit's a little weird, but that's okay, that's okay. Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure!
1DI0024554	Well goddamn. You're new, right?  Name's Leo Stahl. It's a pleasure! It's a pleasure! Yeah!
1DI0024555	<sighs>It's you. I was hoping that you'd have moved on. What do you want?
1DI0024556	Goddammit. Can't you leave me alone? What do you want?
1DI0024557	Look, if you're going to tell on me, do it. Otherwise, tell me what you want and then get out of here.
1DI0024558	Hey hey! Nice to see you! Everything okay? You doing all right? You need something? Come on, talk to me!
1DI0024559	Alright! Good to see you again? What's new? Feel like having a drink? C'mon, let's talk!
1DI0024560	Hey there, buddy! Good to see you!
1DI0024561	Heya! How's it going?
1DI0024562	You pull another stunt like you did, and you're finished in this town. Do you understand?
1DI0024563	Now what do you want?
1DI0024566	Good to see you're staying out of trouble.
1DI0024567	Got my eye on you. Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0024568	Staying out of trouble, I hope? Don't want to have to waste good bullets on your sorry hide.
1DI0024570	Hi, I'm Maggie. I live with Billy. Billy Creel. Do you know him? He's not my dad or anything, but he takes care of me now. Anyway, I should go. Bye.
1DI0024571	Hi, I'm Maggie. I live with Billy. Billy Creel. Well... I used to. He died. Now... <sob> ... I need to go...
1DI0024572	I probably shouldn't be talking to you. Billy always said that I get too friendly with people I don't know. I miss him...
1DI0024573	I probably shouldn't be talking to you. Billy says I get too friendly with people I don't know. He says it's dangerous.
1DI0024574	Hi there! How are you?
1DI0024575	Well hey there, stranger! I'm Manya. The old coot wandering around here is my husband, Nathan.
1DI0024576	If there's anything we can help you with, ask me. Don't ask Nathan, he'll just blabber at you about the damned Enclave all day.
1DI0024577	Oh... hello, stranger. I'm sorry. I was just thinking about Nathan, my husband. He passed not too long ago.
1DI0024578	I guess I'm not really over it. I'm not sure if I ever will be. Look, you have a good day, I need to go.
1DI0024579	I'm sorry. I was just thinking about Nathan. It's been so quiet around here since he passed...
1DI0024580	What do you need, honey?
1DI0024581	If you see Nathan, tell that man to get his ass back home.
1DI0024582	You seen Nathan anywhere around here?
1DI0024583	Hello, sweet child. Hello. I don't believe we've met. I'm Mother Maya, prophet of the Atom and embracer of the universal Light.
1DI0024584	Remember, sweet child, that as children of Atom, the fabric of the universe itself is ours to weave. So welcome to Megaton, and peace be with you.
1DI0024585	Sweet child, now is not the time for talk. But you should join us now in our hour of prayer. Simply close thine eyes and bask in Atom's glow.
1DI0024586	Well hello again, sweet child. Is all well with you? Remember, stay in the Glow and let all things take their course.
1DI0024587	We meet again, sweet child. I hope you're finding our town agreeable? In darkness, in doubt, go ye to the bomb. Find Atom, and find truth.
1DI0024588	Oh my, it divides my heart to see you again, sweet child. And what may Mother Maya do for you today?
1DI0024589	Huh? Oh... I'm sorry. I was thinking about Manya. Things ain't been the same since she passed...
1DI0024590	Ha! Look at this! New blood! Tell me boy, you ever hear of the Enclave? The last remnant of the good ol' USA, they are!
1DI0024591	Now, I don't know you from Adam, but I got you pegged for a patriot and any patriot worth his salt is gonna toss his gun in for the Enclave.
1DI0024592	Any day now, they're gonna roll up here and then this nightmare'll be over for good! But listen to me ramble -- I'm Nathan. What can I do for you?
1DI0024593	Ha! Look at this! New blood! Tell me girl, you ever hear of the Enclave? The last remnant of the good ol' USA, they are!
1DI0024594	Now, I don't know you from Adam, but I got you pegged for a patriot and any patriot worth her salt is gonna toss her gun in for the Enclave.
1DI0024596	Where's that wife of mine got to anyway...
1DI0024597	Have you seen my wife anywhere around here?
1DI0024598	Greetings, citizen!
1DI0024599	Be all you can be. Support the Enclave.
1DI0024600	Well, hello there, Miss Dangerous. What can I do for you?
1DI0024601	Well, hello there Mister Dangerous. What can I do for you?
1DI0024602	Hi there. I'm Nova. New to Megaton, huh? Do yourself a favor and keep walking. Some of us stay for a few days... and then it's five years later...
1DI0024603	Hey, baby. What do you need?
1DI0024604	What is it, hon?
1DI0024605	Listen, I'm working right now. So make it quick, okay?
1DI0024606	The more time I spend talking to you, the less I'm spending watching for Raiders.
1DI0024607	How the hell did you get up here anyway?
1DI0024608	<grumbles> ... huh? Yeah? What is it?
1DI0024611	I'm just here to guard the goods. That's all.
1DI0024612	I'm here to watch over this stuff. Only touch what you've paid for, and we'll have no problem.
1DI0024613	I've got my eye on you.
1DI0024614	This place is so much better than Moriarty's. That place is just filled with scum.
1DI0024615	Pull up a chair if you want.
1DI0024616	Hey there, stranger. Talk to Leo if you need something.
1DI0024617	Always good to see a new face.
1DI0024618	Leo's a nice guy, a bit twitchy, but nice.
1DI0024619	Don't mind Andy, he's just a busy guy.
1DI0024620	Hello, Child. Have you come to bask in Atom's glow?
1DI0024621	Speak to the Confessor or the Mother if you wish to know more.
1DI0024622	Close your eyes, and feel Atom's glow...
1DI0024623	The Confessor is truly the chosen of Atom.
1DI0024624	Even those who are not dedicated Children of Atom may bask in his glow.
1DI0024625	It's been so peaceful in here since Moriarty got killed.
1DI0024626	Talk to Gob if you need something.
1DI0024627	Can't I just drink in peace?
1DI0024628	I'm in the mood to drink, not to talk.
1DI0024630	It's not that kind of bar, stranger.
1DI0024631	You looking to trade, stranger? Check out Craterside Supply.
1DI0024632	If you need to buy something, Moira up in Craterside Supply can help you. Watch out though, she's... different.
1DI0024633	Whatever you want, I don't have it.
1DI0024634	Leave me alone! Someone might see us!
1DI0024635	Don't let the people around here fool you with their hippie crap. They've got water they won't share with anyone. Nice, huh?
1DI0024636	What? Why are you being so friendly? Go away!
1DI0024637	...can't even afford some damn squirrel stew...
1DI0024638	Look, I don't want to be rude, but I don't trust strangers.
1DI0024639	[grumbles]... should've stayed in Rivet City... traveled through the Wasteland for this place...
1DI0024640	I hope they let me buy a house here some day.
1DI0024641	*whistles*... dammit! You made me mess up the song!
1DI0024642	Where did you come from? ...not like it matters.
1DI0024643	I don't want any trouble.
1DI0024644	What? No! Go away!
1DI0024645	Take it up with someone else.
1DI0024646	I came to this place looking for water, but they're only selling to residents.
1DI0024647	[coughs] ... sorry... not now.
1DI0024648	Sorry, I'm a little busy right now. Maybe we can talk later, okay?
1DI0024649	The people here get really paranoid when they see outsiders chatting to each other. Keep that in mind.
1DI0024650	Sorry, can't talk now.
1DI0024651	We've got nothing to say to each other.
1DI0024652	Welcome to Rivet City. Please wait while the bridge extends.
1DI0024653	Welcome to Rivet City.
1DI0024654	I...uh, I don't get visitors very often. My name is Abraham Washington. This is my Capital Preservation Society.
1DI0024655	Welcome to...uh...the Capital Preservation Society.
1DI0024656	What...uh, what can I do for you?
1DI0024657	Hi. I'm Angela. My dad runs Gary's Galley. If you want anything to eat, talk to him.
1DI0024658	Hi. I'm Angela. I run Gary's Galley. Let me know when you are ready to order.
1DI0024659	Have you heard? I'm getting married!
1DI0024660	Welcome to Gary's Galley. Can I take your order?
1DI0024661	Yes, sir?
1DI0024662	Yes, ma'am?
1DI0024663	Lay a hand on Doctor Zimmer, and I'll snap your neck like a chicken bone.
1DI0024664	That's close enough. Keep your hands where I can see them.
1DI0024665	The market is closing soon. You'd better make it quick.
1DI0024666	The council has a report that C.J. Young is missing. Have you seen her?
1DI0024667	Welcome to Potomac Attire. I am Bannon, proprietor and City Council member.
1DI0024668	I carry discriminating attire for discriminating customers.
1DI0024669	We haven't met. I'm Bannon, proprietor of Potomac Attire, and City Council member.
1DI0024670	You should stop by my shop. What you're wearing is dreadful.
1DI0024671	I heard that Danvers found a letter from Slavers in Seagrave's room.
1DI0024672	That will teach that bastard to mess with me.
1DI0024673	I think you've earned a permanent discount here.
1DI0024674	You told Danvers that I was trying to blackmail Seagrave.
1DI0024675	Thanks to you, they've suspended council meeting and are probably going to censure me.
1DI0024676	I can't ban you from my shop, but they can't tell me what to charge.
1DI0024677	Welcome to Potomac Attire.
1DI0024678	I think I've seen you in here before. When you're ready to buy, just let me know.
1DI0024679	Have you found anything you like?
1DI0024680	Is this interruption really necessary?
1DI0024681	I'm Belle Bonny, and this is the Muddy Rudder.
1DI0024682	I'll tell you what I tell all the fresh meat. Don't start anything down here or I'll have Brock kick your ass.
1DI0024684	I'll tell you what I tell all the fresh meat. Don't start anything down here or I'll have to kick your ass.
1DI0024685	You're a new one. I'm Belle Bonny of the Muddy Rudder. Make it quick.
1DI0024687	I'm Brock, the bouncer. I take care of the troublemakers. You aren't going to be a troublemaker, are you?
1DI0024688	Don't tell me your problems.
1DI0024689	I can't talk right now. My daughter, C.J. is missing.
1DI0024690	If you see her, please send her home right away.
1DI0024691	This place won't clean itself. That's my job.
1DI0024692	Look, I'm busy.
1DI0024693	This is A Quick Fix. I mean that's the name of our shop. Paulie and mine that is. My name is Cindy. Cindy Cantelli.
1DI0024694	This is A Quick Fix. I mean that's the name of the shop. My name is Cindy. Cindy Cantelli.
1DI0024695	Nice to see you again. Are you looking for a quick fix?
1DI0024696	Made up your mind yet?
1DI0024697	I'm Cindy. I mean, Cindy Cantelli. I'm a quick fix. I mean, I run A Quick Fix. Anyway, you were saying?
1DI0024698	Oh! It's you. I mean, hi there.
1DI0024699	Will you take me home, mister? I'm scared.
1DI0024700	Will you take me home, ma'am? I'm scared.
1DI0024701	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
1DI0024702	Yes, miss.
1DI0024703	Maybe you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Commander Danvers, assistant chief of security.
1DI0024704	Maybe you don't know who you're talking to. I'm Chief Danvers, head of Rivet City security.
1DI0024706	Ted Strayer. You can chill with me if you want, dude.
1DI0024707	Whoa! What's the rush, dude?
1DI0024708	I'm Diego, the acolyte for Saint Monica's.
1DI0024709	I'm Diego,the new priest for Saint Monica's.
1DI0024710	Have you seen Angela? I need to ask her something about our wedding.
1DI0024711	Oh...nevermind. I just remembered. Sorry. I'm so scatterbrained these days. What was it you wanted again?
1DI0024712	God bless you and keep you safe.
1DI0024713	Hmmm? Oh! Do you need something?
1DI0024714	You're in the Rivet City Clinic. I'm Doctor Preston.
1DI0024715	I'm eating right now. If you're hurt, I'll be back in the clinic shortly.
1DI0024716	You're wounded. Let me bandage that.
1DI0024717	You don't look hurt. What can I do for you?
1DI0024718	I am Father Clifford. This is Saint Monica's church.
1DI0024719	I am Father Clifford of Saint Monica's church.
1DI0024720	Can this wait? I'm very busy planning a wedding.
1DI0024721	May Saint Monica bless you.
1DI0024722	It's almost closing time. I'd get out of here if I was you.
1DI0024723	This here is Flak and Shrapnel's gun shop. Pretty catchy, huh? Take a look around. If you see anything you like, I'll be right over here.
1DI0024724	Decided to check out the shop, eh? If you want any of this shit, just holler.
1DI0024725	Made up your mind?
1DI0024726	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that peashooter, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
1DI0024727	I'm Flak. If you want something better than that stick of yours, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
1DI0024728	I'm Flak. If you want a decent weapon, stop by Flak and Shrapnel's.
1DI0024730	Let me introduce myself. I am Gary Staley gourmet chef and gourmand. I'll be preparing your meal.
1DI0024731	My specialty is Mirelurk Cakes. Although the iguana is very popular too.
1DI0024732	I'm Gary. Gary Staley. If you ever get hungry, stop by Gary's Galley.
1DI0024733	Ah! I knew you wouldn't be able to stay away from my cuisine for long.
1DI0024734	How may I serve you?
1DI0024735	Make it quick. I'm on a tight schedule.
1DI0024736	Is there a problem?
1DI0024737	This isn't a good time. My daugher, C.J. is missing.
1DI0024738	If you hear anything, please let me know right away.
1DI0024739	This place could use a few more people willing to work. Everything is falling apart and I'm the only one willing to fix it.
1DI0024740	I'm busy. I've got a lot of repairs to make.
1DI0024742	I'm scared. Will you take me home? Take me to my Mom.
1DI0024743	I'm scared. Will you take me home?
1DI0024744	What's your problem, mister?
1DI0024745	What's your problem, lady?
1DI0024746	I'm Janice Kaplinski, chief botanist. What do you need?
1DI0024747	Be careful around these fruits and vegetables. They're worth more to us than you are.
1DI0024748	You need me? For what?
1DI0024749	Well? Are you going to help me or turn me over to the Slaver?
1DI0024750	Stay away from me. What do you want? Are you one of them?
1DI0024752	I heard Sister is dead. Thank God!
1DI0024753	I'd rather be alone just now.
1DI0024754	Welcome to the Weatherly. Mister Buckingham at your service.
1DI0024756	Haven't run into you before. You probably wouldn't remember me anyway. I'm Mister Lopez.
1DI0024757	I wish I had the courage to end it all.
1DI0024758	I'm just taking things one day at a time.
1DI0024760	Haven't seen you in here before. Do you need a fix? I might have what you need. You can always come see Paulie to get what you need.
1DI0024761	Who are you? Got any Psycho? I could really use a fix, but I'm broke.
1DI0024762	Ha ha! I run the chem shop, but I'm broke and can't buy chems!
1DI0024763	Looking for a fix?
1DI0024764	Make it quick, will ya? I'm coming down and I gotta get my fix.
1DI0024765	How the hell did you get in here? Hmph. I suppose you can't be all that bad if you made it this far without dying.
1DI0024766	This is the part where you tell me what the hell you are doing bothering an old man who obviously wants to be left alone.... Get on with it already!
1DI0024767	Stay sharp. They're everywhere.
1DI0024768	Sir, yes sir! Private Jones reporting!
1DI0024769	Sir, yes sir!
1DI0024770	You'd better get out of here. The guards are going to close up soon.
1DI0024771	Howdy. I'm Seagrave. Seagrave Holmes. I have a little of just about everything here.
1DI0024772	You must be new. I'm Seagrave. If you've got anything you want to unload, stop by my shop, Rivet City Supply.
1DI0024773	Hey! I heard that Bannon got caught trying to frame me.
1DI0024774	I also heard you ratted him out. I think you've earned a true, blue friendship discount.
1DI0024775	You sneak into my room, steal my property, and then tell the world about it.
1DI0024776	I'd ban you from my shop if they'd let me. Instead I'll just have to settle for ripping you off.
1DI0024777	Take a look around. I got all kinds of stuff in here.
1DI0024778	The shop's closed right now. Is there anything else I can do for you?
1DI0024779	Can't you see I'm eating? What do you want?
1DI0024780	Hey, you. Have you seen C.J. Young? We have a report that she is missing.
1DI0024781	I'm on duty. Make it quick.
1DI0024782	We're going to close soon. You'd better get out of here.
1DI0024783	They call me Shrapnel. I run this place. Got the best damn armament you'll ever see.
1DI0024784	Don't know you, don't care. Keep it short.
1DI0024785	If you want any of this shit, just say so. Otherwise keep your fingers the hell away from the triggers. I don't want no accidents.
1DI0024786	What's your beef?
1DI0024787	They call me Sister. Don't ask.
1DI0024788	You're bothering me. You don't want to bother me.
1DI0024789	I'm Tammy. Have you seen my good for nothing son lately?
1DI0024790	The little shit is usually up to no good.
1DI0024791	I'm Tammy. Just leave me alone, okay.
1DI0024793	Hey, good lookin'. How come you haven't bought me a drink yet?
1DI0024794	Shit. Just what this hole needs. Another woman.
1DI0024795	Either buy me a drink, or take your skanky ass somewhere else.
1DI0024796	Buy a girl a drink, sailor?
1DI0024797	Unless you're going to buy me a round, get lost.
1DI0024798	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel. I am your hostess, Vera Weatherly.
1DI0024799	Charmed to meet you. I am Vera Weatherly of the Weatherly Hotel.
1DI0024800	Welcome back, ma'am.
1DI0024801	Welcome back, sir.
1DI0024802	Nice to see you again.
1DI0024803	I have yet to make your acquaintance. My name is Zimmer.
1DI0024804	Are you in need of assistance?
1DI0024805	What is it? Can't you see that I'm watching the guards?
1DI0024806	What do you want? Make it quick, you're blocking my view!
1DI0024807	Oh... hey! What do you need, young fellow?
1DI0024808	Oh... hey! What do you need, young lady?
1DI0024809	What... huh? Me? You're talking to me? Yes? What do you need?
1DI0024810	Hey, want to see something funny? All I need is some booze, and I'll show you!
1DI0024811	Hey... hey! You wanna hear a song? See a dance? Just gimme some booze, I'll make it happen!
1DI0024812	Why, look at what we have here. Some fresh meat, right out of the Wastes!
1DI0024813	You just wanna go ahead and jump into the pen with the others, or should I beat you senseless and drag you there myself?
1DI0024814	Aww, look at you! You're such a cute lil' varmint.
1DI0024815	You'd best stop lookin' at me like that before I spit you up and chew you out.
1DI0024816	I miss Eulogy...
1DI0024817	Anything that I have to say, Mr. Eulogy can say for me.
1DI0024818	Mr. Eulogy don't like me talking to the johnnies without his permission.
1DI0024819	What do you want, square?
1DI0024820	To tell you the truth, I'm glad that fool is dead.
1DI0024821	Eulogy handles the business.
1DI0024822	What? Do you see something you like?
1DI0024823	Look, nothing personal, but if you need something, talk to the clown in the hat.
1DI0024824	Keep staring and I'll start charging.
1DI0024825	You're a mess. I hope you brought a lot of money with you.
1DI0024826	Are you just going to bleed on me, or are you going to pay me to fix you?
1DI0024827	I love the sight of a limping Waster. You just look like a walking pile of caps to me.
1DI0024828	Well now, look at you limping in here like that. Did you bring some caps for Auntie Cutter?
1DI0024829	You look like you've seen better days. A few caps'll fix that up for you.
1DI0024830	Been in a few fights, have we? Well, that's why they pay me the big bucks...
1DI0024831	Ain't nothing that I love more than an injured Slaver with more caps than sense. Hopefully, you fall into that category.
1DI0024832	You look alright to me. Are you here for some supplies?
1DI0024833	Hello there, my dear. What can Eulogy do for you today?
1DI0024834	Just let me know if you need anything, and I'll do whatever I can to procure it.
1DI0024835	If it's business you're here to discuss, I'm all ears.
1DI0024836	What can I do for you? Paradise Falls is always open for business.
1DI0024837	Something I can help you with?
1DI0024838	<sighs>I'm sure that whatever you have to say is absolutely vital. So let's hear it.
1DI0024839	What. Do. You. Want?
1DI0024840	Look. I told you. My name's Forty. I'm not inclined to change it, so unless you've got something good to say, you'd best make it fast.
1DI0024841	Jotun.
1DI0024845	This place is terrible! Please! You've got to help us!
1DI0024846	You need guns, I got guns. You need armor? Got that too. So long as you got the caps for 'em.
1DI0024847	Guns, guns, and more guns. What do you need?
1DI0024848	What? I guard the gate. That's all. What the fuck do you want from me?
1DI0024849	Hey. Talk fast, they hate it when I talk to customers.
1DI0024850	Haha! Hello! I am Ymir!
1DI0024851	Haha! Good to see you again, little man! Have you come to drink with me?
1DI0024852	Haha! Good to see you again, little girl! Have you come to drink with me?
1DI0024853	Hey sorry, man. Let me get out of your way!
1DI0024854	Whoa there. Easy, killer. I'm movin', I'm movin'!
1DI0024855	Heard about you. You're some pretty slick shit.
1DI0024856	Respect.
1DI0024857	You look like a damn fool in that Vault Suit.
1DI0024858	Nice! Did you get that monkey suit from the Brotherhood?
1DI0024859	Sorry, bro. Got nothin' to say to you.
1DI0024860	Sorry, chica. Got nothin' to say to you.
1DI0024861	Keep walkin'.
1DI0024862	I can't believe that Grouse let you in here.
1DI0024863	Don't think I won't throw your ass in the pens with the rest of the meat.
1DI0024864	You don't exactly look like you belong here.
1DI0024865	Okay, seriously. Leave me alone.
1DI0024866	*sniff* Smells like meat. Move on.
1DI0024867	You're new. And you're too big to be a resident. Who are you?
1DI0024868	Who are you? What are you doing in here?
1DI0024869	Got yourself a boo-boo?
1DI0024870	What sort of scrape did you get yourself into, this time?
1DI0024871	Got yourself another few scrapes?
1DI0024873	Well, here's something I don't see every day. A new face in Little Lamplight!
1DI0024874	A bit big for one of our kids, but you seem all right. What's your story down here?
1DI0024875	Well, now here's something new. What's a grown-up like you doing in Little Lamplight?
1DI0024876	Don't tell me MacCready's going soft on us!
1DI0024877	Is there something you'd like to learn?
1DI0024879	Great, RJ let in another pair of choppers to eat up all our food.
1DI0024880	Well, as long as you don't give me any crap about how I prepare your grub, I guess you'll be okay.
1DI0024881	So, tell me: what do you think of cave fungus in watery mushroom sauce?
1DI0024882	Okay, RJ had better have had a good reason to let you in.
1DI0024883	Because right now, all I'm seeing is a mungo who's here to take our food and screw us over.
1DI0024884	Come on and get your grub!
1DI0024885	Ready for some fine roast beast served in a creamy ginger sauce?
1DI0024886	Yeah, I'll bet you are! Too bad it's still fungus chunks for us all!
1DI0024887	Feed's on! Get it while it's... food.
1DI0024889	Hewwo, I'm Biwwy. Wewcome to Wittwe Wampwight!
1DI0024890	Hey, you wook wike you'we handy with a weapon. I got kicked off the scav team, so I guess I don't need mine anymowe.
1DI0024891	Wanna buy my wazer wifle? Five hundwed caps, and it's aww youws!
1DI0024892	Hewwo, mistaw.
1DI0024893	Hewwo, miss.
1DI0024894	I'm going on an adventure!
1DI0024895	Whoa. You're big. You must be the biggest kid here!
1DI0024896	I'm the littlest kid. My real name's Betty. But mostly, I get called Bumble.
1DI0024897	What're you called, big kid?
1DI0024898	Whoa. I've never seen a mungo so close.
1DI0024899	Are you a Raider? Or a Slaver? Or a Mutant?
1DI0024900	'Cause if you are, I'm supposed to go hide 'cause I'm too young to use a gun yet.
1DI0024901	Uh oh. Now what?
1DI0024902	You want to talk to me?
1DI0024903	Just leave me alone, okay?
1DI0024904	I hate you! Go away!
1DI0024905	I don't want to talk with you!
1DI0024906	Hey, new kid. I don't know if anyone told you yet, but let me set the record straight.
1DI0024907	I'm Princess. When you're around me, I'm in charge. You shut up and do what I say, because I'm boss around here. That clear?
1DI0024908	Now, who're you?
1DI0024909	What the hell is RJ thinking, letting a damned mungo like you in here?
1DI0024910	So, who're you working with? Raiders? Slavers? Mutants?
1DI0024911	Answer up, mungo!
1DI0024912	Well, look who's here. What's up, mungo?
1DI0024913	Well, if it isn't the magnificent mungo. What now?
1DI0024914	New in town, huh? If MacCready let you in, that's good enough for me.
1DI0024915	Well, enough with formalities: who are you, and how'd you get MacCready to let you in here?
1DI0024916	Whoa, are we letting mungos in, now? Didn't hear any shots, so I'm guessing you're not here to raid us.
1DI0024917	And if you're not here to raid us, you might just have brought something cool for us, see? So who are you, and how'd you get let in?
1DI0024918	Hey, picked up anything out there?
1DI0024919	Anything you'd like to get off your hands?
1DI0024920	Got something to say?
1DI0024921	New in town, huh? Well, if MacCready let you in, that's a good sign.
1DI0024922	I'm Knock Knock, and I take care of 'keeping the peace' down here. Or, at least the morale.
1DI0024923	So, who're you? You going to cause any trouble?
1DI0024924	Hey, are we letting mungos in, now? Didn't hear a scuffle, so I'm guessing you're some sort of guest?
1DI0024925	So, what's so cool about you, fancypants? Must be a pretty good reason for you to get let in, see?
1DI0024926	Hey did you hear the one about the ridiculous mungo who...
1DI0024927	Oh wait. Um. Never mind.
1DI0024928	How're things treating you?
1DI0024929	Heard anything good?
1DI0024930	Wow, you're big. I mean, bigger than most people down here. I mean, bigger than most people down here that we don't shoot for being down here.
1DI0024931	So, how'd you get down here without getting shot? Am I supposed to shoot you? Because, you know, I'd rather not, but if I'm supposed to, then okay.
1DI0024932	The mayor said it's okay for you to be in here, right? Because mungos aren't allowed in here unless the mayor says so. So are you an okay mungo?
1DI0024933	Because if you aren't an okay mungo, that means we should stop you, and that means I have to get my gun from lockdown so stay here okay?
1DI0024934	Hey there. You have any Nuka-Cola? Even just a bit? Can I have some? Be your best friend. Honest. Totally. Not even kidding!
1DI0024935	Oh hey, hi. You again, huh? I thought maybe you'd be blown up or shot or something by now, but I guess not. Not yet, anyway.
1DI0024936	Hey, hi! Hi, lady. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
1DI0024937	Hey, hi! Hi, mister. Hey there. What's going on? Anything new? You have any good stories? What about Nuka-Cola, you have any of that? Huh, huh?
1DI0024938	Thanks again for saving me. You're the best!
1DI0024939	Well, you and my brother are tied for the best, at least. But that's still really good!
1DI0024940	Thanks for getting me back. I really missed my brother.
1DI0024941	Everyone calls you a mungo, but I think you're an okay mungo.
1DI0024943	Something happening?
1DI0024945	Thanks for getting us back here. We woulda got out before long, but you did really help.
1DI0024946	So, uh, thanks.
1DI0024947	We didn't need any mungo's help getting outta there, you know?
1DI0024948	But you did it, so, uh, thanks.
1DI0024949	But that means I gotta go back to guarding the back gate with Princess. Ugh.
1DI0024950	Yeah, mister?
1DI0024951	Yeah, miss?
1DI0024952	Yeah, mungo?
1DI0024954	Wow, am I glad to be back. If it weren't for you, I think we'd have died back there!
1DI0024955	So, thanks for the help! If anyone asks me, you're an official kid!
1DI0024956	Wow, thanks for the help out there. If it weren't for you, I'd be a goner, for sure!
1DI0024957	Far as I'm concerned, you're welcome in here anytime! Of course, it isn't really up to me.
1DI0024959	Oh, hey!
1DI0024960	Is everything okay?
1DI0024961	Is something wrong?
1DI0024962	Look, I don't let just any son of a bitch into my town. I'm taking a risk making an exception for you.
1DI0024963	So you're welcome in my town, at least until you start screwing up. Once that bullshit starts, you're out on your own again!
1DI0024964	Look, I don't let just any bitch into my town, and I'm taking a risk making an exception for you.
1DI0024966	Okay, so you get in, but I got my eye on you.
1DI0024967	You don't make trouble in here, got it? I ain't having no shit-butts making trouble.
1DI0024968	Yeah? You got something to say?
1DI0024969	How do I have to solve your bullshit problem, today?
1DI0024970	Like my town so much you had to come congratulate me personally, right? Happens all the time - caps and ammo are the preferred way to show your love.
1DI0024971	So, what sort of trouble are you getting yourself into, now?
1DI0024972	What do you want, mungo?
1DI0024973	What now, mungo?
1DI0024974	Why are you still pestering me, you moron?
1DI0024975	Okay, what the hell is wrong with you, mungo? This had better be important!
1DI0024976	Did you get hit in the head? You have to pester me every time a stray thought happens to wander into that hollowed out melon you call a skull?
1DI0024977	Oh, what now? You come to me to talk about how nice my damned cave is? Maybe a little small talk about local soil erosion or some bullshit?
1DI0024978	No, you know what? You can go take a hike, you insane mutant-fucker. Get out of my town!
1DI0024979	Whoa, a mungo down here, just walking around!
1DI0024980	Hey, new kid! Try and catch me!
1DI0024981	Tag, you're it!
1DI0024982	Aw, man! I'm it!
1DI0024983	No way, that didn't count!
1DI0024984	Stay away, mungo, I don't wanna catch old from you!
1DI0024985	Thanks for getting Penny and Squirrel back. And Sammy too, I guess.
1DI0024986	Mungo, mungo, smells like dung-o!
1DI0024987	Gosh, you're big.
1DI0024988	Nice as the weather is out here, how about you bring me a kid, so I can get back to Paradise Falls?
1DI0024989	Just waiting for you to bring me a new friend.
1DI0024990	Pleased to meet you. I'm Knight Dillon. If there's anything you need here, I'll try and help.
1DI0024991	Hello again.
1DI0024992	Knight Finley at your service. What can I do for you?
1DI0024993	What is it you needed?
1DI0024994	Welcome to the Galaxy News Radio Outpost. I'm Sergeant Wilks, and I'm in charge here. What brings you into the D.C. area?
1DI0024995	What else can I help you with?
1DI0024996	Sorry, I'm on guard duty. Wouldn't want this place to get overrun with Super Mutants.
1DI0024997	Sentinel Lyons calls the shots around here. If you need anything, she can probably help you.
1DI0024998	Bring on some more Super Mutants! I'm not finished with them yet!
1DI0024999	Babysitting this place is no picnic, I can tell you that.
1DI0025000	Thanks for your help. We'll take any we can get.
1DI0025001	If you need something, talk to one of the Knights. They can help you.
1DI0025003	Hey, all right! The Hero of the Wasteland returns!
1DI0025004	You got the dish! I knew the Good Fight could count on you!
1DI0025005	Now, get that sucker over to the Washington Monument pronto and I'll get to singing your praises!
1DI0025006	No use hanging around the station. Get the dish to the top of the Washington Monument as soon as possible.
1DI0025007	You look like someone with about a million questions. Lay 'em on me.
1DI0025008	What else can Three Dog do for you?
1DI0025009	I've told you the score, all you need to do is play the game. You in?
1DI0025010	So, you ready to make a deal? Or are you just trying to get another look at my strikingly handsome face?
1DI0025011	The look on your face says it all. You're wondering who the heck this guy is and why you should care. Well, prepare to be enlightened.
1DI0025012	I am Three Dog -- jockey of discs and teller of truths. Lord and master over the finest radio station to grace the Wastes -- Galaxy News Radio.
1DI0025013	And you, well... I know who you are. Heard about you leavin' that Vault, travelin' the unknown. Just like dear old Dad, hmm? Met him already...
1DI0025014	So, you came back. That's good. The Good Fight can always use another soldier.
1DI0025015	You came to visit! You'll never guess what I found out in the Wastes, when I was supposed to be patrolling.
1DI0025016	Here. This is for you.
1DI0025017	Oh, hi there! I'm Bittercup.
1DI0025018	Oh, hey... I was just trying to think of a word that rhymes with "gloom"... hrm...
1DI0025019	Yep. Still not dead. Unfortunately...
1DI0025020	God, life is such a hassle, you know?
1DI0025021	Hey. Don't get any bright ideas about trying anything. We may not look it, but every one of us is a trained killer.
1DI0025022	Oh, who am I kidding? Look, we're in trouble here. If you want to help, great. If not, just please don't kill anyone while you're here.
1DI0025023	I heard how you helped out Timebomb. I'm not sure why you did it, but thanks.  I only hope that he lives long enough to appreciate your help.
1DI0025024	Now, did you need something?
1DI0025026	What do you need, stranger?
1DI0025027	I'm on patrol here, what do you want?
1DI0025028	The more time I spend talking to you, the less time I'm watching for raids.
1DI0025029	Wha-? Jesus. I'm on the lookout here, don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
1DI0025030	A visitor? Who'd want to visit this hell hole? I bet you're here to rape and pillage us. Aren't you? Aren't you?!
1DI0025031	Not that it matters. We're all Super Mutant snacks anyway.
1DI0025032	Unless you're here to help us, fuck off.
1DI0025033	You got a problem?
1DI0025036	Hrm? What? Oh... I'm sorry. My patient just passed away. He... he was my friend. I'm just... I'm a little out of it.
1DI0025037	I'll be alright though. What did you need?
1DI0025038	You remember my patient, Timebomb? He died. As far as I can tell, his injuries were just too much. I did my best, but... it wasn't enough.
1DI0025040	So, it turns out, Timebomb died. So I guess you were right. Still, he was my friend, and I had to try...
1DI0025042	Wow. I can't believe that you were able to help Timebomb. And here I was sure that you were ready to just let him die. I guess I had you wrong.
1DI0025043	He still can't fight, but if we survive for a bit longer, he should be back into it soon enough.
1DI0025044	Look, you're a better doc than me, that's pretty obvious. But if you need healing, I'll do it for you no charge.
1DI0025045	Wow. I can't believe that you were able to help Timebomb. I thought he was done for.
1DI0025049	What's up? Are you hurt?
1DI0025050	Woa, looks like you've seen some action. Do you need help?
1DI0025051	Are you hurt? You don't look hurt. What do you need?
1DI0025052	Hey, pal. What's up?
1DI0025053	Things are looking good here, bud.
1DI0025054	Your fly's open! Haha, made ya look!
1DI0025055	Heya! Whaddaya need?
1DI0025056	Damn... what... what happened?
1DI0025057	Hey. Thanks again, man. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
1DI0025058	Anything for you, man. What do you need?
1DI0025059	Hey, it's good to see you. Is there something I can do for you? Anything?
1DI0025060	Welcome to Big Town. Not that there's much of a town left. Those Super Mutants keep kidnapping people.
1DI0025061	Hi there. Um, can I help you?
1DI0025062	You need something?
1DI0025063	They're out there. I can feel it. Uh, what? You? I gave you the welcoming speech.
1DI0025064	Watch the Wastes. Keep track of movement. Uh, what? Did you need something?
1DI0025065	Oh, baby! Let me get you something special. How about a Dukov surprise? Hah ha!
1DI0025066	Nevermind. You need a drink. Cherry! Need some fucking booze over here!
1DI0025067	Hello sweet cheeks! What can old Dukov do for you?
1DI0025068	Nevermind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
1DI0025069	Have you seen Cherry? I think the bitch ran out on me.
1DI0025073	Nevermind. You need a drink. Fantasia! I'm thirsty over here!
1DI0025075	Nevermind. You need a drink. My women are gone, so help yourself.
1DI0025076	Whatcha need? How about a drink? No? Suit yourself.
1DI0025077	Yeah, yeah, you're my hero. Don't let it go to your head. Seriously though, thank you for getting me away from Dukov.
1DI0025078	So that prick Dukov is dead. Can't say I'll miss him.
1DI0025079	Even so, I'm going to need someone to protect me. A girl can't survive by herself in the Wasteland.
1DI0025080	Hey, good looking. I'm Cherry. Can I do anything for you?
1DI0025082	Hi, sweetie. I'm Cherry. What can I do for you?
1DI0025083	Hi, sugar. I'm Cherry. Do yourself a favor. Watch yourself with Dukov. He's all hands.
1DI0025084	He's dead! I'm going to miss the old lecher. We had some real fun times.
1DI0025085	Who's going to look after me now?
1DI0025086	Oh, my! Aren't you a stud. I'm Fantasia. If you need something, just let me know.
1DI0025087	Hi there, fella. I'm Fantasia. Can I help you?
1DI0025088	Hello, honey. I'm Fantasia. You're not going to be staying long, are you?
1DI0025089	President Rosie? What's happening around here anyway?
1DI0025090	Rosie? As President? You've got to be kidding me...
1DI0025091	Well, now. President Bob. How do you like that? Boy, things are gonna change around here. First step: get rid of all this "Dave" shit.
1DI0025092	The Kingdom of Bob! Or maybe Bobtopia! I'll have to give it some thought.
1DI0025093	But I guess you want something, don't you? Tell you what... Dave kept some old junk in that safe of his... I mean MY office. The code is 1138.
1DI0025094	Take whatever you want out of there. Consider it a gift from your kind and loving President Bob.
1DI0025095	Maybe we need a flag? One with my picture on it. That could be pretty cool.
1DI0025097	First things first, we're gonna have to open up the Museum of Bob.
1DI0025098	I've got nothing to say to you, stranger.
1DI0025099	C'mon. Make it fast. I got chores.
1DI0025100	Yes? What is it? C'mon, I don't have all day.
1DI0025101	This is the new Republic of Dave! Go away!
1DI0025102	By the order of the new Republic of Dave, I order you to go away! This is your last warning!
1DI0025103	I warned you!
1DI0025104	I guess you're wondering where I'm going. I'm off to annex Old Olney and forge the New Republic of Dave! Don't try to stop me!
1DI0025105	Ah, you're back. So, have you brought a gift for the President? Which is it? The rifle or the money?
1DI0025106	We have nothing more to talk about. Leave my republic within 24 hours or you will be executed for treason.
1DI0025107	Breach! How did you make it in here without an escort? Only a master spy could be so skilled! Are you a spy?
1DI0025108	You are, aren't you? Come on now, confess! Have you been sent to spy on the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025109	I am Dave, President of the Republic of Dave. You will address me as "Mister President" or I will have you executed.
1DI0025110	Now, are you applying for citizenship, asylum, or just vacationing in the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025111	Hmmm. You look familiar. No matter. We never hold prior meetings against tourists.
1DI0025114	Oh, look at this, the spy has returned to gather intelligence. You'll get nothing from me, spy. What do you want?
1DI0025115	Out with it, Ambassador. This Republic isn't going to run itself.
1DI0025116	Yes? What can President Dave do for you?
1DI0025117	Stop right there, mister!  Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025118	Stop right there, lady!  Whatcha think you're doing in the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025119	Whatcha want, Stranger?
1DI0025120	Come on! I have to take you to Daddy!
1DI0025121	Dave says you're okay? Fine.
1DI0025122	It's kind of late to be entering the Republic.
1DI0025123	Can't you come back later?
1DI0025125	Hey, you. Stop! What do you want from the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025126	What do you want from us?
1DI0025128	Hey, who are you?  What do you want from the Republic of Dave?
1DI0025130	Did Dave say it was okay for you to be here?
1DI0025131	Well now... who could have ever thought? Me! President! Things are really going to be different around here.
1DI0025132	Listen, I can't thank you enough. You convinced that that I could do this, and you were right. I want you to have something.
1DI0025133	Dave kept some big weapon or something locked up in the safe in his office. The code is 1138.
1DI0025134	It's yours if you want it. We don't need it anymore.
1DI0025135	I just can't thank you enough!
1DI0025136	Things are going to be different around here!
1DI0025137	Bob as president? I don't know how I feel about that...
1DI0025138	President Bob. Well, that's a change. I don't know if it's a change for the better though...
1DI0025139	I heard that Dave allowed you to stay. Well, welcome stranger. Just be mindful of the children.
1DI0025140	Who are you?  Is it okay for you to be here?
1DI0025143	So Dave gave you the okay, huh?  Well, welcome then.
1DI0025144	I run the Museum of Dave, where the children of the Republic can learn about their heritage.
1DI0025145	I have nothing more to say to you. You are the most un-Dave-like person I've ever met!
1DI0025146	Something you need?
1DI0025147	Dave doesn't like us talking to strangers.
1DI0025148	President Daddy says that people from outside the Republic are bad.
1DI0025149	Are you really from the Wasteland? Wooooow!
1DI0025150	Well, hi there! Welcome to Andale! I'm Willy Wilson, though folks just call me Bill. Is there anything I can do for you?
1DI0025151	Well, hello again! How can the Wilson clan help you today?
1DI0025152	Hooeee, smell that air! Ain't nothing like it, is there?
1DI0025153	And what can I do for you on this fine day?
1DI0025154	By God, it's another fine day in Andale!
1DI0025155	Hey there, stranger. I've got something that I want to talk to you about.
1DI0025156	I couldn't help but notice that you were poking around in Bill's shed.
1DI0025157	So, did you find what you were looking for in there?
1DI0025159	I couldn't help but notice that you're poking around in my basement.
1DI0025160	So, be honest now, You wouldn't know anything about that would you?
1DI0025161	Hello there, fellah! Good to meet you! Name's Smith, Jack Smith. Welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
1DI0025162	Hello there, young lady! Good to meet you! Name's Smith, Jack Smith. Welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
1DI0025163	Hello there, stranger! Good to meet you! Name's Jack Smith. I hear you've already met my wife. Sweet lady, isn't she?
1DI0025164	But anyway, welcome to Andale, the best little town in Virginia!
1DI0025165	Hey there, good to see you again!
1DI0025166	Afternoon, friend!
1DI0025167	Look at this weather, can you believe it?
1DI0025168	It's so weird... our parents went on a trip and aren't coming back. Do you think they're dead or something?
1DI0025169	Wouldn't Mr. Harris tell us if they were?
1DI0025170	Mr Harris is nice to us, but he doesn't read the stories the same way that my daddy did.
1DI0025171	We're eating all sorts of different food now. Before, we always just ate my mom's meat pies.
1DI0025172	Hi! Welcome to Andale! I'm Jenny! You should probably talk to my dad, he likes to welcome all the new visitors!
1DI0025173	Hi, again! How're you doing?
1DI0025174	I'm not really sure what happened. Mr. Harris said that our parents went away, and they won't be back.
1DI0025175	He says that he'll tell me more about it when I'm older but... I miss my mom and dad...
1DI0025176	Mr. Harris is a lot like my dad. I never knew that he could be so nice.
1DI0025177	You're new here, aren't you? Wow! I never get a chance to talk to the new people! Dad always takes care of them before I get a chance.
1DI0025178	Hello again! Have you been out having adventures?
1DI0025179	I wish I was like you, instead of stuck here in boring ol' Andale.
1DI0025180	Oh man, I'm so jealous, you get to go out and do stuff outside of town and you probably don't even have a bedtime.
1DI0025181	Well, hello! Welcome to Andale! Winner of the best town in the USA contest!
1DI0025182	Oh. It's you again. Well, I don't want to be rude, so what do you want?
1DI0025183	Oh. Hello. Do you need something, or are you here to tell me about your incredibly nice underground vault again?
1DI0025184	Hmph. Well, I'm not as rude as you, so I'll politely ask you what you need.
1DI0025185	Hello again! Stick around for a while, I'm thinking about making some meat cookies later! Isn't that exciting!
1DI0025186	I'm so happy to see you! What do you need?
1DI0025187	I'm a little busy right now, but never too busy for a friend! What did you want to talk about?
1DI0025188	Why, hello there. I'd heard there was someone new coming. How can our little family help you?
1DI0025189	Hello again! You know, I actually missed you! And I barely know who you are!
1DI0025190	It's so good to see you again. Honestly, I get a little bored around here... don't tell Bill!
1DI0025191	Busy busy busy, a wife's work is never done!
1DI0025192	I saw what happened out there, stranger. Those people may have been my family but... it had to be done.
1DI0025193	I was like them for so many years... it's... I can't even talk about it.
1DI0025194	The only thing that I can do is try to raise these kids and make Andale into a decent place.
1DI0025195	This is such an ugly place... so many bad memories. But we're trying.
1DI0025196	I'm not sure why you'd come back here, but I'm glad to see you.
1DI0025197	Little by little, each day, I'm trying to clean up the mess my family left.
1DI0025198	Wha- how? How did you get in here? What are you doing in this town? Get out! Get out while you can!
1DI0025199	Get out of here! Run!
1DI0025200	They're crazy! Crazy I tell you!
1DI0025201	Get out of town while you still can!
1DI0025202	Another human with a death wish... Welcome to the Mall, tourist.
1DI0025203	What's up, tourist?
1DI0025204	Atten-shun! Civilian on deck!
1DI0025205	We need to have us a little talk. You keep your gun in your holster when you're in my town.
1DI0025206	Otherwise, we're going to have a problem. And Charon solves my problems for me. Understand?
1DI0025207	Now... how can I help you?
1DI0025208	Well now, lookee here. We got us a smoothskin that I ain't ever seen before. I'm Ahzrukhal, and this... this is the Ninth Circle.
1DI0025209	Folks got problems, and I got liquor to sell to 'em... well, liquor and a few other pick me ups. You need anything, you just let me know.
1DI0025210	Ghoul, human... I don't care. The caps all spend the same.
1DI0025211	Back for more, eh? What can I get for you?
1DI0025212	Don't you look absolutely... miserable. Pull up a stool and lay down a few caps, tell Uncle Akzrukhal all about it...
1DI0025213	What? Oh... I'm sorry... I was just thinking about my poor Gob. Did you need something?
1DI0025214	Poor Gob. I know it's not your problem, but... I'm sorry. Do you need something?
1DI0025215	First Gob goes to see the world, and now Greta is dead... everyone I love leaves me, it seems.
1DI0025216	Yeah, what is it- Oh! Oh my! Someone new! I'm so sorry, you must think me terribly rude! Welcome! Welcome to Carol's Place! I'm Carol.
1DI0025217	It's not much, I know, but it's mine! So, if you need anything, just let me know. Greta will get you any food you want, and I handle the rooms.
1DI0025218	It's so good to have someone new here, even if it is an ugly ol' smoothskin! I'm kidding! I'm just kiddin! Don't make that face! You'll love it here.
1DI0025221	It's so good to have someone new here, especially a pretty young smoothskin like yourself! I hope you like it here!
1DI0025222	Oh, I just love to see your pretty face smiling at me. What do you need, honey?
1DI0025223	Oh, I was just telling Greta "that pretty young smoothskin hasn't been around in a while", and here you are!
1DI0025224	Oh, hello again! Do you need anything, darling?
1DI0025225	Well, hello. It's always good to see a customer. What do you need?
1DI0025226	See, I knew you'd be back.
1DI0025227	Oh, hello again! Do you need anything?
1DI0025228	Scanning... target non-hostile.
1DI0025229	Scanning... Target is armed. Code Yellow.
1DI0025230	Unit running Patrol Scheme Delta-Seven.
1DI0025231	Unit running Patrol Scheme Alpha-Four.
1DI0025232	Talk to Ahzrukhal.
1DI0025233	No. Go talk to Ahzurkhal.
1DI0025234	Goddammit! Why did you tell Carol that Gob was dead? You couldn't have kept that to yourself?
1DI0025235	You know, not everyone needs to hear the truth about everything. She was perfectly fine thinking that he'd found happiness out there.
1DI0025236	Just... order something and get away from me.
1DI0025237	Sorry. I'm on a break. I'll be back in a bit if you need some food.
1DI0025238	Oh look. It's everyone's favorite bearer of bad news.
1DI0025239	Oh, hey. It's you. Did you bring some good news for us?
1DI0025240	Hey. I say you over there talking to Carol. She's friendly, isn't she? But don't you get any ideas about her. Got it? Good.
1DI0025241	Now, do you want something to eat?
1DI0025242	Mornin', hon. What'll it be?
1DI0025243	If you want something to eat, you should order it quick, hon. The stew just stopped moving.
1DI0025244	You need somethin', hon?
1DI0025245	Why the hell did you wake me up?
1DI0025246	Oh, you again.
1DI0025247	... ... huh? ... Ah! Jesus Christ! Don't... don't sneak up on me like that, the last fella... the last fella to do that damn near lost my arm.
1DI0025248	You're new here, yeah... you must be, since you're actually talking to... talking to me... I'm Patchwork... or just "Patches" if... if you like that.
1DI0025249	I'm...  shit.... I forget.
1DI0025250	Oh! Hey! It's you! ... have we met?
1DI0025251	... ... uh oh... <burp>... just gimme a second here... <burp>.. okay, swallowed it before it... before it got out. What do you need?
1DI0025252	I... I think I'm less drunk than... I was... Nope. Nope. There it is.
1DI0025253	Oh, why hello there. Pleasure to meet you! I'm Quinn.
1DI0025254	Sorry sorry! So busy!
1DI0025255	Just couldn't stay away from us, could you?
1DI0025256	Oh, hello, my boy! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
1DI0025257	Oh, hello, my girl! You've come back for more stories from ol' Quinn, have you?
1DI0025258	Oh... OH! Hey! Look at that! A human! With hair! Hey... you think we can do something about that?
1DI0025259	I just sharpened the knives! Have a seat and we'll give you a new look!
1DI0025260	Good to see you again! You ready for some more of the ol' snip-snip?
1DI0025261	Hey! You here for a cut? Maybe a buzz? Mohawk? C'mon! Something!
1DI0025262	Oh... a human... well, hello. Welcome to Underworld Outfitters! It's... it's been so long since I had a customer!
1DI0025263	You're back! Uhm... wow! You're really back! What do you need?
1DI0025264	You came back! Do you need something?
1DI0025265	I've got just the thing for you, do you want to see it? Please say yes...
1DI0025266	Oh, well would you look at that? We got us a smoothskin visitor! Hoooeeee, we ain't seen one of your type in a long time.
1DI0025267	What? You come to try to steal from me again? Just get out of my face.
1DI0025268	Didn't you hear me? Leave us alone.
1DI0025269	Well, hello again. You need something, smoothskin?
1DI0025270	How's Underworld been treatin' you so far, smoothskin?
1DI0025271	Well look who's back. What can I do you for, smoothskin?
1DI0025273	Holy shit! What happened?
1DI0025274	What the fuck happened?
1DI0025275	It's so weird here without Azhrukhal.
1DI0025276	I still can't believe that Charon shot Ahzrukhal. I never saw that one coming.
1DI0025277	You know, Ahzrukhal was a bastard, but I kind of miss him...
1DI0025278	Did you see that? Charon just shot Ahzrukhal!
1DI0025279	There are a lot more of us down here than there are of you, smoothskin. You just behave yourself.
1DI0025280	I hope you don't mind the smell, I know how sensitive you humans can be.
1DI0025281	That's humans for you, always so goddamn friendly.
1DI0025282	We don't get a lot of your kind down here.
1DI0025283	What makes you think that we've got something to say to one another?
1DI0025284	What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?
1DI0025286	Just stumbled into town? You sure picked a fine day for it, with the crazies out there. Here, have a drink on the house. Welcome to Canterbury.
1DI0025287	I'm Joe Porter. I make sure folks around here can get a meal when they need it.
1DI0025289	Newcomer to town, huh? Well, I'm Dominic D'Ellsadro, and welcome to Canterbury Commons. Try to ignore the idiots in the costumes.
1DI0025290	Popular activities around town are trading, listening to Roe yap, and burying thieves in unmarked graves.
1DI0025291	Course, we ran out of thieves to bury long ago. Saw to it myself. Might be a dead art, unless you're planning on stealing anything.
1DI0025292	Staying out of trouble? Good, good.
1DI0025293	Ah, new in town? Welcome to Canterbury Commons, home of traders, home of caravaners, and most of all, home of excellent bargains!
1DI0025294	I'm Ernest Roe, but feel free to think of me as your jolly old Uncle Roe. What brings you to my fine, little town? Here for business, or pleasure?
1DI0025295	With all of that fighting, I never got to give you the official welcome to the town, did I?
1DI0025296	Welcome to Canterbury Commons, home of traders, caravaners, and most of all, of excellent bargains! Here for business or pleasure?
1DI0025297	What can old Uncle Roe do for you, today?
1DI0025299	Oh, um, hey. You're new here, right? I'm Derek. I do odd jobs around town, nothing important.
1DI0025300	You'd probably rather talk to my uncle, Ernest Roe. He can give you the official welcome and everything.
1DI0025301	Umm, yes?
1DI0025302	Ah, a fellow student on the path of the Wasteland! Welcome to my humble caravan. Please relax, for we are in a place of safety!
1DI0025303	The type of safety that can only be ensured by an abundance of weaponry, both wicked and awesome. All of which, can be yours, for the right price!
1DI0025304	I hear you're my mysterious investor! With your help, I've collected quite a few toys for myself. But what good are toys if they aren't played with?
1DI0025305	Thanks to you I have so many, I could hardly play with them all. So, I present to you a prize of the collection, a micro-nuke. Enjoy it in safety!
1DI0025306	A wanderer without a weapon doesn't last long out there. Pick up the best now, while you still can!
1DI0025307	Here to shop? Have a look!
1DI0025308	Welcome, sir or madam, to Crazy Wolfgang's Traveling Junk Store! The Depot of Detritus, the Shop of Slop, and the Caravan of Crap!
1DI0025309	Now, what odds and ends can I, the Craziest of all possible Wolfgangs offer to you?
1DI0025310	I hear you're the one who's so deeply invested in my junk. Not as deeply as me, of course, but who is, really?
1DI0025311	I picked up some Stealth Boys the other day, and they seemed like just the way to thank you for your investment. Kudos!
1DI0025312	A friend with deep pockets is a friend indeed! Welcome to my shop!
1DI0025313	Hey, hey! Looking to buy?
1DI0025314	Ah, welcome weary traveler! You look like a traveler in need of relaxation and the finest of chemical assistance.
1DI0025315	Well, wander no more, my good friend, for I am Doc Hoff, procurer of the finest of medical goods and chemical assistance. Now, how may I help you?
1DI0025316	My investor arrives at last. This line of work doesn't allow for much sentiment, but how could I not offer you some material token of my thanks?
1DI0025317	In that case, here. The gift of health - rarely given in this day and age, but all too often taken...
1DI0025318	Looking for your fix? You came to the right man.
1DI0025319	Here to see the good doctor? Excellent.
1DI0025320	Welcome, welcome! My name is Crow, and I travel the land, offering vestments of protection. And you are fortunate I found you in time!
1DI0025321	You bear the look of one who is haunted, but I am proud to say that my wares can protect you from even the cruel claws of death itself. Have a look.
1DI0025322	And here you are! The spirits have blessed me with many gifts, but you have given the more marketable gift of monetary investment.
1DI0025323	Please accept this offering - a mask and helmet made from the hide of the wisest spirits of the wind. May it benefit you as fully as it has myself.
1DI0025324	Searching for a friend out in the Wastes? No one is more reliable than a cold, hard skin of steel.
1DI0025325	Here to acquire a new mantle of metal or mesh? If you have the caps, I have the merchandise.
1DI0025326	I'm just here to protect the merchandise.
1DI0025327	Keep it on the level, and everything'll be fine.
1DI0025328	Looking to trade?
1DI0025329	Looking for that special something?
1DI0025330	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Godfrey, your personal robotic butler.
1DI0025331	I am here to look after your needs and to keep you happy and entertained.
1DI0025333	Allow me to introduce myself. I am Wadsworth, your personal robotic butler.
1DI0025336	Good morning, sir.
1DI0025338	Good morning, madame.
1DI0025340	Good evening, sir.
1DI0025342	Good evening, madame.
1DI0025344	Lemme guess... you said something dumb and now Birch wants you outta Oasis. Wonderful.
1DI0025345	You better get a move on before they really get mad and hunt you down.
1DI0025346	Oh great. Now you got yourself kicked out of here.
1DI0025347	Looks like I'll have to find someone else to help me. You better get outta here... these guys will get pretty cross if you stick around.
1DI0025348	I can't believe you'd kill those innocent people like that. And I thought I was a monster!
1DI0025349	If I could move, I would show you a thing or two, but Bob has me stuck here.
1DI0025350	Those people you killed were some of the most peaceful people in the Wasteland!
1DI0025351	How could you do that to them?
1DI0025352	Leave me alone! Me and Bob have better things to do than speak to a murderer!
1DI0025353	Now go away and never come back!
1DI0025354	How dare you come into Oasis and shoot up the place!
1DI0025355	Even Bob is mad at you, and he never gets mad except when I don't stop calling him Herbert!
1DI0025356	Hey man, relax. We can do business.
1DI0025357	There rest of these guys around here might not want anything to do with you, but I got no problem with you... well, not with your caps at least.
1DI0025358	Shh. Not too loud. I don't really want people to know that we're doin' business.
1DI0025360	Hey, good to see you again. What do you need?
1DI0025361	I'm not in the mood for you, asshole.
1DI0025362	Go away, bleeder!
1DI0025363	Do not interfere with security operations.
1DI0025364	I'm sorry, but I am not at liberty to chat right now.
1DI0025365	Protect and serve.
1DI0025366	What is it now? Sir.
1DI0025367	What is it now? Ma'am.
1DI0025368	Do I look like I have time for idle chitchat?
1DI0025369	No time to talk to your type, local.
1DI0025370	Why don't you go bother the Brotherhood or something?
1DI0025371	Hey local, shouldn't you be banging rocks together, or something?
1DI0025372	Don't push your luck out here.
1DI0025373	Keep an eye out for those locals.
1DI0025374	Nothing to see here, outsider.
1DI0025375	We've got this area locked down.
1DI0025376	Keep moving, Wastelander.
1DI0025377	Move along, outsider.
1DI0025380	Hi there, mister. You need something?
1DI0025381	Hi there, miss. Can I help you with something?
1DI0025382	Hello again. Did you need something else?
1DI0025384	I doubt I can help you. I'm just a kid, you know.
1DI0025385	You don't seem to take a hint. Get out of my face.
1DI0025386	I'll mind my business, you mind yours.
1DI0025387	I've got nothing to say to you. Best move on.
1DI0025388	I'm not looking for trouble, or conversation either.
1DI0025389	Jesus, you really can't take a hint, can you?
1DI0025390	Let me be blunt. Go away.
1DI0025391	I don't know you, you don't know me. Let's keep it that way.
1DI0025392	How about you just mind your own business, okay?
1DI0025396	Where do you think you're going, asshole?
1DI0025397	You looking to get yourself killed?
1DI0025398	You ain't allowed up there. Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0025399	You don't seem to be taking me seriously.
1DI0025400	Nobody just walks into Paradise Falls. I ain't warning you again.
1DI0025401	This is stupid! We shouldn't be in here, and you know it!
1DI0025402	Son, we should NOT be in here.
1DI0025403	Honey, we should NOT be in here.
1DI0025404	We should leave.
1DI0025405	We should go.
1DI0025406	Let's get out of here.
1DI0025407	We shouldn't be here.
1DI0025408	That's close enough. The memorial is off limits.
1DI0025409	No-one is allowed in the memorial.
1DI0025410	Stay away from our water!
1DI0025412	A man's home is his castle!
1DI0025413	It's mine, I tell you!
1DI0025414	Quit following me!
1DI0025415	I get dibs! Back off or it's getting ugly!
1DI0025416	Them spoils is mine! You can't have 'em!
1DI0025417	Back off. Find your own robot to salvage.
1DI0025418	This is mine. I found it and you can't have it.
1DI0025419	Get away from that! Finders keepers. I'm warning you...
1DI0025420	I'm not looking for trouble, but if you don't back off I'm not afraid to defend what's mine.
1DI0025421	Don't push your luck, stranger. Leave now and I won't have to hurt you.
1DI0025422	Back off smooth-skin, unless you're looking for a fight.
1DI0025423	We'd be more than happy to kill you smoothskin!
1DI0025424	Unauthorized access! Exit the armory immediately!
1DI0025425	Unauthorized access detected! Activating weapons!
1DI0025426	The Market is closing. Time for you to leave.

1DI0025473	You're not allowed to be here.
1DI0025474	Get out of here. You're not allowed.

1DI0025479	Last warning. Get out of here.
1DI0025480	You'd better get out of here.
1DI0025481	I told you to leave. You'd better listen.
1DI0025482	You don't belong here.
1DI0025484	You'd better get out of here if you know what's good for you.
1DI0025485	Please... I'm dying. I need water...
1DI0025486	Please. Water... help me...
1DI0025487	Please help me. Please?
1DI0025488	Slaver business only, remember? Now get out of here before I decide to use you for target practice.
1DI0025489	Friendly warning... we tend to shoot first and just never ask questions.
1DI0025490	Where do you think you're going?
1DI0025491	You trying to get yourself shot or something?
1DI0025492	Good work!
1DI0025493	You can do this.
1DI0025494	Here we are!
1DI0025495	Good, you're here!
1DI0025496	Go on. Jonas is waiting for you downstairs.
1DI0025497	How's it going, sweetheart?
1DI0025498	How's it going, pal?
1DI0025499	So what do you think we should call our gang? It's got to be totally killer, though.
1DI0025500	Come on, Wally. You always have good ideas.
1DI0025501	Show us how smart you are, Wally. What should we call ourselves?
1DI0025502	Hey, Paul, your hobby's open. Whoa, that's your hobby? Ha ha ha ha! Now quick, give me an idea for what to name our gang.
1DI0025503	Um. What about the "Tunnel Rats"? Or aren't rats tough enough?
1DI0025504	Hmm. Snakes are cool, right? The Vault Snakes! What do you guys think?
1DI0025505	Maybe... the Vault Rats? You guys like that?
1DI0025506	Come on, you guys can do better than that. We need a good name!
1DI0025507	You guys are dumb. Somebody's got to have a better idea than those.
1DI0025508	Ah man, you got a Pipboy. I wish I was ten.
1DI0025509	Thanks for inviting me to your party.
1DI0025510	What are you looking at, dork-face?
1DI0025511	Hey there, butt-breath! Ha ha ha.
1DI0025512	Nice Pip-Boy. What is that, one of the 3000A models? What a piece of junk. I think you have to wind it up every morning.
1DI0025513	Look Butch, I don't think his puny arm is strong enough to lift that Pip-Boy.
1DI0025514	Look Butch, I don't think her puny arm is strong enough to lift that Pip-Boy.
1DI0025515	Buzz off, pipsqueak.
1DI0025516	Hey, happy birthday, nosebleed. Ha ha ha.
1DI0025517	I didn't bring you a present, if that's what you're wondering.
1DI0025518	Just because I came to your party doesn't mean I have to talk to you.
1DI0025520	Hey there, ten years old today, right? Happy birthday.
1DI0025521	Shouldn't you be in the diner at your party?
1DI0025522	Having fun?
1DI0025523	Wow, the Pip-Boy really makes you look all grown up.
1DI0025524	Come on, try to look like you're enjoying yourself!
1DI0025525	Sorry about Butch... Your Dad said we had to invite him.
1DI0025526	Happy birthday, dearie!
1DI0025527	How are you enjoying the party, Mrs. Palmer? I helped with the decorations, you know.
1DI0025528	Thank you for coming, Ms. Beatrice. I hope you're having a nice time.
1DI0025529	Do you think we surprised him?
1DI0025530	Do you think we surprised her?
1DI0025531	Daddy, I told you not to act all official. I know you were joking, but I'm not sure anyone else did.
1DI0025532	Thanks for coming, Stanley, I know you were busy with the water purifier. Everything's fine, I hope?
1DI0025533	Hi, Stevie. Great party, huh?
1DI0025534	Hello, Officer Gomez. I'm glad you could make it.
1DI0025535	Fun party, huh?
1DI0025536	Thanks for coming. Are you having fun?
1DI0025537	Are you having a nice time?
1DI0025538	Nice to see the kids having a good time, isn't it?
1DI0025539	Thanks for coming. It means a lot to both of us.
1DI0025540	Have you heard about Freddie Gomez?
1DI0025541	Did you see his Pip-Boy? What a clunker!
1DI0025542	Did you see her Pip-Boy? What a clunker!
1DI0025543	Enjoying yourself?
1DI0025544	Nice party.
1DI0025546	Don't do this. Please tell me the code.
1DI0025548	Get inside!
1DI0025549	Head for the Control Room.
1DI0025550	Run while you can!
1DI0025551	All dead! They're all dead!
1DI0025552	Get it away! My mind, it's burning!
1DI0025553	No, no! Under my skin! It's under my skin!
1DI0025554	Get out! Go away!
1DI0025555	Here's the G.E.C.K. Our bargain is complete.
1DI0025556	I suggest you remain outside the lab area. The radiation leak is severe.
1DI0025557	It's good to walk these halls again.
1DI0025558	Many of my stupider brethren are about. Be cautious.
1DI0025559	We still have some distance to cover. Stay close.
1DI0025560	Free! I'm finally free!
1DI0025561	You're the best mungo ever!
1DI0025562	I just want Rory to be safe...
1DI0025563	Ha ha! We're outta that shitbox!
1DI0025564	We're free!
1DI0025565	Hey hey, mungo! We're getting' outta here, right?
1DI0025566	What is going on up there?
1DI0025567	I don't want to die down here...
1DI0025569	We have to keep moving.
1DI0025570	We can't stop now. We need to keep going.
1DI0025571	Have you found any medical supplies?
1DI0025572	We need to escape while we can.
1DI0025573	Did you need something?
1DI0025574	Are you all right, Madison?
1DI0025575	Janice, I have something for you.
1DI0025576	Janice, a moment please.
1DI0025577	Is everything all right?
1DI0025578	Hello, honey.
1DI0025579	Hello, son.
1DI0025585	Careful! The floor may still be a bit wet over here. Wouldn't want you to slip and crack your skull open, now would we?
1DI0025586	Good morning to you, sir!
1DI0025587	Good morning to you, miss!
1DI0025588	Good morning! Stopped in to see the old man before class, eh?
1DI0025589	Good luck on the G.O.A.T.
1DI0025590	Morning, pal.
1DI0025591	Back off.
1DI0025592	Snake life forever.
1DI0025593	Hey, honey.
1DI0025594	Hey, pal.
1DI0025595	She is looking a little heavy.
1DI0025596	Back off, kid. This is Tunnel Snake business.
1DI0025597	I've got other things to do.
1DI0025600	Why don't you go hang out with your new friends?
1DI0025601	Thank God that's over.
1DI0025602	Get these idiots away from me!
1DI0025603	Go ahead and take a seat so we can start.
1DI0025604	You did fine. You should celebrate with your friends.
1DI0025605	All finished?
1DI0025609	Shouldn't you be leaving now?
1DI0025611	The Pint-Sized Slasher returns!
1DI0025612	Oh, Mabel. Always good for a laugh.
1DI0025613	Poor Janet and Roger.
1DI0025614	I'm waiting to see how you handle the Rockwells...
1DI0025615	You won the game!
1DI0025616	Have you gone to see Timmy yet?
1DI0025617	Not real... Not real...
1DI0025618	It's in there. Has to be. Has to be in there.
1DI0025619	You. You can find it. You're not supposed to be here. He can't stop you.
1DI0025620	George, I thought I told you to have a talk with Timmy about Old Lady Dithers.
1DI0025621	George, have you spoken to your son about Old Lady Dithers?
1DI0025622	What's the latest gossip from Mabel?
1DI0025623	So, heard anything good from Mabel lately?
1DI0025624	Hi, Martha.
1DI0025625	Say, Martha...
1DI0025626	Hi, Mabel. How's it going?
1DI0025627	How are you, Mabel?
1DI0025628	Janet... You think maybe we should have a talk about children?
1DI0025629	Listen, honey. Do you think maybe it's time we talk about having kids?
1DI0025630	Hello, dear.
1DI0025631	Hi, honey.
1DI0025632	Good day, George.
1DI0025633	Good to see you, George!
1DI0025634	Hi, Mommy.
1DI0025635	Hi, Daddy.
1DI0025637	Hello, Ms. Dithers.
1DI0025638	Hi, Mabel.
1DI0025639	Hi, Janet.
1DI0025640	Hi, Roger.
1DI0025641	Hi, Pat.
1DI0025642	Hi, George.
1DI0025645	Good day!
1DI0025647	Beautiful day, isn't it?
1DI0025650	Good afternoon!
1DI0025651	Good day to you, young miss!
1DI0025652	Good day to you, young master!
1DI0025653	This would go easier if you'd just surrender.
1DI0025654	You're just making this harder on yourself.
1DI0025655	The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, it seems.
1DI0025656	I never saw you.
1DI0025657	Better not let anyone else see you, son.
1DI0025658	Better not let anyone else see you, missy.
1DI0025659	You were never here.
1DI0025660	Hey, Chief. Any news?
1DI0025661	Hey, John. Anything?
1DI0025662	What's up, Stevie? Anything to report?
1DI0025663	Hi Herman. Seen anything?
1DI0025664	Anything to report?
1DI0025665	You got anything?
1DI0025666	Ah, young sir! How very good to see you again. I do suppose you're looking for your father the doctor.
1DI0025667	Ah, young madame! Very good to see you again. I do suppose you're looking for your father the doctor.
1DI0025668	Tsk tsk tsk. I'm afraid you've missed him. I believe he's gone topside for a spot of fresh air! Should be back any moment, I'd imagine!
1DI0025669	You're the one everybody's looking for, right? Well it's none of my business. Your dad always took good care of us.
1DI0025670	You oughtn't be wandering around down here alone. It isn't safe, you know.
1DI0025671	This Vault's been going to pot ever since that young Alphonse took over.
1DI0025672	Just hold still. Your left stablizer's been knocked loose.
1DI0025673	If you keep turning like that I'm going to crack your casing.
1DI0025674	I've almost got it.
1DI0025675	Ah, I think I've found the problem.
1DI0025676	Don't be such an old woman. Just a few more adjustments and you'll be as good as new.
1DI0025677	Try it now. I think I've got it this time.
1DI0025678	Mom, are you crazy? What are you doing? Are you okay?
1DI0025679	Come on, Mom, it's not safe out here.
1DI0025681	We are the law.
1DI0025682	Stay on the right side of the law.
1DI0025683	Always good to see a new face in the fight.
1DI0025684	You should talk to Sonora.
1DI0025685	Well, hello there. I heard we might be getting a new recruit.
1DI0025686	Let your heart guide your hand.
1DI0025687	May your powder stay dry.
1DI0025688	Good to see you again, partner.
1DI0025689	We are pleased to see you again.
1DI0025690	And what do you have for us today?
1DI0025691	If it isn't our old friend...
1DI0025692	So good to see you. Are you ready to deal?
1DI0025693	Come in, come in...
1DI0025694	Ah, yes. We've been waiting for you...
1DI0025696	Lookin's free, the rest will cost ya.
1DI0025697	Got something on your mind?
1DI0025698	Don't look at me like that.
1DI0025699	Got a problem?
1DI0025700	Welcome to Moriarty's Saloon.
1DI0025701	Looking for a drink? You've come to the right place.
1DI0025702	S'matter? Never seen a Ghoul before?
1DI0025703	Yeah, what the hell do you want?
1DI0025704	You want something or you just looking to get your ass beat?
1DI0025705	This better be important. I'm a busy man.
1DI0025706	So, what is it now?
1DI0025707	If you need something from me, spill it.
1DI0025708	Information I got... but it'll cost you.
1DI0025709	Well... well. Look at what we have here.
1DI0025710	Fight the Good Fight, brother.
1DI0025711	Fight the Good Fight, sister.
1DI0025712	If you're here to help, you got Three Dog's ears.
1DI0025713	Don't worry, the Three Dog doesn't bite.
1DI0025714	You're safe up here, no worries.
1DI0025715	Welcome to the eyes and ears of D.C.
1DI0025717	Was there something else you needed?
1DI0025718	What else do you want from me?
1DI0025719	Father and son, side by side. This is the way it should be.
1DI0025720	My God, can you believe the devastation out here? That's why our work is so important.
1DI0025721	I'm glad I've got you watching my back. I'm not quite sure I'm cut out for all this excitement. Not anymore.
1DI0025722	Come on, let's keep moving.
1DI0025723	Not much farther. We'll be at Rivet City before you know it.
1DI0025724	What a sight we must be! If only your mother could see us now...
1DI0025725	Let me guess. The dog's coming with us, yes?
1DI0025726	That was some nice shooting. Taking out a Behemoth single-handed!
1DI0025727	Shit, that was a close one.
1DI0025730	Hey! Over here!
1DI0025731	Been busy testing?
1DI0025732	How's the field research going?
1DI0025733	Hey! Book's coming along well, thanks to you. What's next?
1DI0025734	There's my super-assistant! What's up?
1DI0025735	Casdin said you're clear.
1DI0025736	Stay in line, and you'll be okay.
1DI0025737	Don't start anything and you'll be fine. Um, probably.
1DI0025738	Keep that tech coming, and we'll make it worth your while.
1DI0025739	Leave us alone!
1DI0025740	Get out!
1DI0025741	Who do we have here?
1DI0025742	Excellent.
1DI0025743	You're not going to ask me to hold your hand through this are you?
1DI0025744	Yes? Are you having trouble with your little assignment? Do I need to find someone else?
1DI0025746	We're all still breathing. So I know you didn't screw up. You got something on your mind?
1DI0025747	Were you just kidding 'bout disarming that thing?
1DI0025748	You looking for the mayor or the sheriff?
1DI0025749	Get the heck out of my face!
1DI0025751	What's going on out there?
1DI0025752	Huh? How'd you get in here?
1DI0025753	What is it now?
1DI0025755	You're back! Oh my gosh!
1DI0025756	Don't you have a letter to deliver?
1DI0025757	Hey there, glad you're back.
1DI0025758	A traveler, eh?
1DI0025759	Ah, you've returned.
1DI0025760	It appears we have a lot to speak about.
1DI0025761	Welcome to Meresti, human.
1DI0025762	You wish to speak with me?
1DI0025763	I take it you found the place.
1DI0025764	I'm surprised to see you... thought you'd run for the hills.
1DI0025765	I hope you killed every last one of those bastards.
1DI0025766	You're back already? What do you have for me?
1DI0025767	Please tell me you've found something.
1DI0025768	I hope you got some good news tucked away for me.
1DI0025769	Well, is everyone okay?
1DI0025771	I've never seen you around here before.
1DI0025772	Please don't take Ian away from us.
1DI0025773	Human or not, I don't care. You got caps, I got stuff.
1DI0025774	Anything you need, I got it.
1DI0025775	I'll be at my store later. Catch me there in the Common Area.
1DI0025776	You new here too?
1DI0025777	Oh, hey there.
1DI0025778	You got the cash, I got the time.
1DI0025779	Howdy, handsome.
1DI0025780	Howdy, cutie.
1DI0025781	Hello there, stranger.
1DI0025783	Oh, it's you again. What's up?
1DI0025784	What the hell are you doing in here?
1DI0025785	Wasn't I clear the last time you were here?
1DI0025786	I've got nothing to say until Hannibal says you're okay.
1DI0025787	I hope you succeed, stranger. I can't wait to set up a school for freed slaves.
1DI0025788	Dinner was...well...I was able to finish it.
1DI0025789	Caleb, have you been practicing your reading?
1DI0025790	Do you think the Slavers know where we are?
1DI0025791	Is everything quiet out there?
1DI0025792	Four Score! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
1DI0025793	You are truly a good person. So many others refused to help us.
1DI0025794	Good day, sir.
1DI0025795	Good day, ma'am.
1DI0025796	Hello, ma'am. How goes your studying today?
1DI0025797	Pardon my intrusion, sir. Is there anything you'll be needing today?
1DI0025798	Excuse me, sir. Our food is running low. Three days, maybe four at best.
1DI0025799	Begging your pardon, ma'am. Is there anything you need?
1DI0025800	Good dog, Four Score. You love Bill just as he is, don't you? You don't go judging a man like them others.
1DI0025801	Go talk to Hannibal, stranger.
1DI0025802	Thanks for the picture. It's given me a lot to do.
1DI0025803	I've almost finished that book, Alejandra. Maybe you could tell me what it means tonight. By the fire. Together. Alone.
1DI0025804	Can we have something other than iguana tonight? Anything?
1DI0025805	The head is done, but I'm still trying to fix the saying. I wish I had a better picture.
1DI0025806	I'd still like to learn how to shoot, Simone. Will you have time tomorrow?
1DI0025807	Hey, Four Score. I don't have time to play fetch today. Go bother Bill.
1DI0025808	You don't look like a runaway.
1DI0025809	We are grateful for any help you can give us.
1DI0025810	Have you found any references to Lincoln's Memorial? Caleb is still struggling with the translation.
1DI0025811	Bill, I have some sewing for you. Look in my room.
1DI0025812	Tomorrow take a break from the Lincoln work. We need the crumbling wall fixed.
1DI0025813	Bill found some ammo yesterday. Only a clip and a half, but it's better than nothing.
1DI0025814	Come, boy. If you're good today, I'll give you a treat.
1DI0025815	Well, who do we have here?
1DI0025816	You'd like Paradise Falls. Help me out and I'll take you there.
1DI0025818	I wish those runaways would show up. I hate this waiting.
1DI0025820	Stop gawking. You don't want to piss of Mister Walker.
1DI0025821	You'd fetch a pretty penny.
1DI0025822	I'm keeping an eye on you.
1DI0025823	I suppose you aren't as bad as I thought. Most Wastelanders wouldn't have agreed to help us.
1DI0025825	You should get your face out of those books and learn how to shoot before somebody puts a collar back on you.
1DI0025826	Out of my way, puke.
1DI0025827	Lincoln's head looks good, Caleb. You should be proud.
1DI0025828	Thought I saw a Super Mutant out past the road. I took a shot at it, and it ran away.
1DI0025829	Out of my way, mutt.
1DI0025830	Come on, let me loose!
1DI0025831	Time to go yet?
1DI0025832	How'd you get in here?!
1DI0025833	We should get out of here, don't you think?
1DI0025834	You can't leave me here!
1DI0025835	You are in the presence of ant royalty!
1DI0025836	Yes, citizen?
1DI0025837	Whatever you can do to help our town, we'd appreciate it.
1DI0025838	We appreciate you taking care of our town's little problem.
1DI0025839	Any luck finding those two troublemakers, yet?
1DI0025840	When you find those two costumed idiots, put a bullet in their heads for me.
1DI0025841	For your safety, please stand clear.
1DI0025842	I'll make it right... they'll see.
1DI0025843	Back to the drawing board.
1DI0025844	Sigh. Time to start back at square one.
1DI0025845	You wish to add something to my hypothesis?
1DI0025846	I suppose I could answer a few more queries.
1DI0025847	How else may I assist you in your endeavors?
1DI0025848	Oh my!
1DI0025849	Where did I go wrong? I must run more tests.
1DI0025850	Hmmm, carry the one... no, wait. That's just what it's expecting me to do!
1DI0025851	Shhhh, quiet please. Science is in progress!
1DI0025852	Holy moley! You actually came back like you said you would! Did you find me a home?
1DI0025853	The ants! They're all dead! Every single one of 'em!
1DI0025854	Wow! Are you the one that made all these ants do that?!
1DI0025855	I'm glad you came back, mister.
1DI0025856	I'm glad you came back, lady.
1DI0025857	I hope you have good news for me, I really do!
1DI0025858	Hey! You're back! Any word? Any news?!
1DI0025859	Oh, you decided to come back, huh?
1DI0025860	Th-those... those...those...
1DI0025861	Yeah, whatcha' need mister?
1DI0025862	Yeah, whatcha' need lady?
1DI0025863	Nothing new, sir.
1DI0025864	Sir, people are mostly staying quiet.
1DI0025865	Security check, people. Everything all right?
1DI0025866	Everyone sticking to curfew down here? Good.
1DI0025867	Everything all right down here?
1DI0025868	Standard check-in. Things okay?
1DI0025869	All quiet down here, right?
1DI0025870	Overseer's glad to see everyone staying so calm down here.
1DI0025871	Good, you made it.
1DI0025872	Glad to see you here.
1DI0025873	Hey, look. Another rebel.
1DI0025874	Good to see another rebel.
1DI0025875	Hey, how's the gang holding up?
1DI0025876	Still representing the gang? Good to see, man.
1DI0025877	Is the place secure? Can we talk freely?
1DI0025878	Good to see you here. Please keep quiet, you never know who's listening.
1DI0025879	Hi, Christine. How's life stuck in the freak dorm?
1DI0025880	Hi, Chrissie. Any stories from the weirdo dorm?
1DI0025881	Hi, Susie!
1DI0025882	Good to see you, Susie!
1DI0025883	Stanley, how's everything going downstairs?
1DI0025884	Well, Stanley, how's everything going down in the reactor?
1DI0025885	Good to see ya, Butch.
1DI0025886	Tunnel Snakes rule, huh?
1DI0025887	Man, I sure wish we could blow this joint.
1DI0025888	Please, be careful.
1DI0025889	You've got to change the Overseer's mind.
1DI0025890	You've got to convince them it isn't safe outside!
1DI0025891	Are you sure you won't stay and help?
1DI0025892	Go on, get out.
1DI0025893	I'm sorry. Goodbye.
1DI0025894	Sorry to see you go.
1DI0025895	You did it!
1DI0025896	What have you done?
1DI0025897	I never thought you'd be back.
1DI0025898	It's good to see you again.
1DI0025900	Why won't you just leave us alone? You've done enough damage.
1DI0025901	Go ahead and start something, I dare you.
1DI0025902	You don't belong here anymore.
1DI0025903	You have the violin! You've done it!
1DI0025904	Oh my word! Is that what I think it is?
1DI0025905	Oh my goodness... you've been fighting.
1DI0025906	Ugh, you look like you need a rest.
1DI0025907	I hope Vault Tec had some answers for you.
1DI0025908	Hmmm... I don't see a case yet. No luck, huh?
1DI0025909	If there's anything else you need to know, you go right ahead and ask.
1DI0025910	Oh my! I wasn't expecting any visitors.
1DI0025911	I assure you, there's nothing valuable here.
1DI0025912	Well, don't just stand there, say something.
1DI0025913	Maybe we could chat if you have the time.
1DI0025914	Sorry, darling. I'm on a mission of mercy... for me!
1DI0025915	When I look at you, I see two reasons that make me happy to be a man.
1DI0025916	Swing that thing, honey!
1DI0025917	Whoa baby. Slow down a second.
1DI0025918	Got something you wanna' say?
1DI0025919	You find the soda, I pay up. Life couldn't be simpler.
1DI0025920	What the heck do you want?
1DI0025921	Ice cold Nuka-Cola... there's nothing like it in the world.
1DI0025922	Nothing beats the taste... the taste that'll knock you out!
1DI0025923	Hope you met Ronald, he's such a sweetie!
1DI0025924	I am so thirsty. I hope you have something for me.
1DI0025925	Hey! Anything I can do to help, just ask.
1DI0025926	Oh come on, what do you have to lose?
1DI0025927	Shhhh! The tour is in progress.
1DI0025928	Well hey there, stranger!
1DI0025929	Allow me to take you on my Nuka-Cola Tour. Won't take long, I promise!
1DI0025930	I can smell the Rangers's fear!
1DI0025931	This is taking too long. Want to get onto roof and rip Rangers limbs off!
1DI0025932	Watch for booms. Rangers leave many behind.
1DI0025933	Ha ha ha. Rangers bleed like all humans.
1DI0025934	Don't let any more humans through. They try and help Rangers on the roof.
1DI0025935	Stupid humans hiding on roof!
1DI0025936	Must find Rangers... crush them all to paste!
1DI0025937	Good to see you in one piece.
1DI0025938	You don't look like a merc.
1DI0025939	Not bad kid, not bad.
1DI0025940	So, you're the reinforcements, huh? Crazy.
1DI0025941	Hey, all right! Me 'n Eugene are glad to see ya!
1DI0025942	Well, well. We got us a genuine rescue, eh?
1DI0025943	Please give me a status report.
1DI0025944	Sigh. This is a long way from the Statesman Hotel. Why are you still here?
1DI0025945	Whoa. Feel woozy.
1DI0025946	Why are you just standing around here? My men might be dying!
1DI0025947	Please, don't hang around here... just get out to the Statesman Hotel and rescue my men.
1DI0025948	You're still here?
1DI0025949	Humph.
1DI0025950	Hurry up.
1DI0025952	Find him!
1DI0025953	Welcome to the Capital Preservation Society!
1DI0025954	It's so very nice to see you again.
1DI0025955	Good to have you back.
1DI0025956	If you have any questions about the exhibits, please let me know.
1DI0025957	Do have a look around, but don't touch anything.
1DI0025958	We have the most complete archive of U.S. historical documents in the Wasteland.
1DI0025959	Get the hell away from me.
1DI0025960	Keep it moving. I got a whole bottle of whiskey with my name on it.
1DI0025961	The sooner we get back, the sooner we get paid.
1DI0025962	Let's get this scrap of paper to Abraham.
1DI0025963	The Declaration is in the safe, I just know it.
1DI0025964	That robot's brain is scrambled.
1DI0025965	What a nutjob.
1DI0025966	This place is pretty far down, no wonder there's so little damage.
1DI0025967	This place isn't right. Robots still active?
1DI0025968	We're getting closer, I can feel it.
1DI0025969	I know this place like the back of my hand.
1DI0025970	So far, so good.
1DI0025972	Why don't you take a holodisc picture? It'll last longer.
1DI0025973	Yeah, what's up?
1DI0025974	Eyes up here please.
1DI0025975	Alright! Hi there!
1DI0025976	Can we go now?
1DI0025977	I'm still here. Waiting for you.
1DI0025978	I'm bored!
1DI0025979	Are we actually gonna do something, or am I gonna stand here all day?
1DI0025980	I patiently await your word.
1DI0025981	RL-3 stands at attention, sir!
1DI0025982	I am vigilant.
1DI0025983	Nice work cleaning up the town.
1DI0025984	Town's a lot safer now. Thanks.
1DI0025985	Aw, you made this place get so boring.
1DI0025986	Tsk. To think you could have been rich. And now all you'll be is sorry.  VERY sorry.
1DI0025987	I would advise staying clear of me for awhile. A LONG while.
1DI0025988	Tell me. Do you have a death wish?
1DI0025989	It was a wonderful thing you did. Inspirational. Truly.
1DI0025990	Yes friend? Is there something I can assist you with?
1DI0025991	Thanks again for you part in paving the way towards progress.
1DI0025992	Boy do I breathe a lot easier knowing that thing is truly dead!
1DI0025993	Mighty fine thing you did for this town.
1DI0025994	Hey friend!
1DI0025995	Well? Is it done yet? Did you get that door open?
1DI0025996	What are you waiting for? Go open that emergency door!
1DI0025997	What?! You're not here with good news, are you?
1DI0025998	What's up with those bigots at the tower?
1DI0025999	Yeah! We did it!
1DI0026000	Hahaha! They'll get it now!
1DI0026001	I can smell the stink of Ghoul on you.
1DI0026002	Well? What's the status on Roy Phillips and his gang?
1DI0026003	Not ready to take on those Ghouls after all? Huh?
1DI0026004	Don't you have a component to deliver?
1DI0026005	Nothing stops the Railroad.
1DI0026006	Hey you! Welcome back!
1DI0026007	It's the hero of Big Town!
1DI0026008	What the hell?! Oh it's you.
1DI0026009	Have you come to talk to me?
1DI0026013	Oh it's you! Hello!
1DI0026014	Heya!
1DI0026015	Careful where you point that thing. Can't we talk about this?
1DI0026016	Hey you. Ya, you. I want to talk to you.
1DI0026017	Changed your mind?
1DI0026018	Well, look who's back.
1DI0026019	So dude, did that key ever get you anything?
1DI0026020	Ah! It's the keeper of the key.
1DI0026021	Hey, clown shoes. I hope that key was worth it.
1DI0026022	Too bad about Crowley. I heard Tenpenny put out a contract on him.
1DI0026023	Mayor said to let you in alive, but he didn't say you had to stay that way. Watch your step, mungo.
1DI0026024	I don't know why RJ's letting you back in, but if you touch any of my kids, I'll make sure you never have any of your own.
1DI0026025	I know MacCready let you back in, but you stay out of my classroom, understand?
1DI0026026	Hey, why don't you stick around and start a ruckus again? I think your corpse would be great fertilizer for the fungus.
1DI0026027	Watch out, jewk!
1DI0026028	I'm not supposed to talk to bad people.
1DI0026029	Come on, start something again. I dare you. I double dog dare you.
1DI0026030	I put up with Zip's shenanigans, but I'm not having it from an outsider. Keep your hands to yourself, this time.
1DI0026031	Wanna hear a joke? A guy walks into a town of kids and causes trouble. Then they shoot him to death. Get it? Watch out, or you will.
1DI0026032	Wanna hear a joke? A girl walks into a town of kids and causes trouble. Then they shoot her to death. Get it? Watch out, or you will.
1DI0026033	Hey, you hurt any of my friends today? Because it's like this bad habit you've got. I figure I can cure it if I shoot you some, okay?
1DI0026034	Ain't had enough, huh? Well, stay in line and everything'll be a-oh-fucking-kay.
1DI0026035	Business is always welcome in Canterbury Commons. Even business with people like you.
1DI0026036	We take property crime very seriously around here. I don't want to hear about any more trouble from you.
1DI0026037	I don't know why you're still allowed back, but stick in line. Or else.
1DI0026039	Just stay calm. We don't need any more trouble here, okay?
1DI0026040	I oughta toss you off this ship for what you did, but the boss says Rivet City has to forgive and forget. Still, I'm watching you.
1DI0026041	After what you did, I don't trust you. Stay clean or I'll heave you overboard.
1DI0026042	Rivet City doesn't need any more deaths. The Council says I gotta let you be here, but one false move and you're gone.
1DI0026043	You're here because I convinced the Council your business was worth the risk. Don't disappoint me. Oh, and don't kill anybody else either.
1DI0026044	You're a lowlife, but if you keep your nose clean, we'll let you stay.
1DI0026045	You're a petty criminal, but I'm willing to give you another chance. Don't disappoint me.
1DI0026046	I remember what you did. This time you'd better respect other people's property, or I'll have to keel haul you.
1DI0026047	People like you are bad for business. This time you'd better follow the rules.
1DI0026048	I oughta tear you a new asshole for what you did to her. Do your business and get outta here.
1DI0026049	Hey, clown shoes. I remember what you did before. Keep you hands where I can see them.
1DI0026050	You watch yourself. You cause any more trouble and you'll be dead.
1DI0026051	Any more funny business and we'll kill you.
1DI0026052	Watch yourself. I don't want to have to kill you, but I will if I have to.
1DI0026053	You better behave. Gustavo's guards are swift to take care of trouble.
1DI0026054	Watch your manners.
1DI0026055	You better not cause any more trouble.
1DI0026056	We owe you so much. The Memorial will be a beacon for slaves everywhere.
1DI0026057	Everyone is grateful for what you've done for us.
1DI0026058	The Slavers will have some goddamn respect for now, huh?
1DI0026059	It's going to take a lot of work to repair the Memorial. Thanks to you, I'll get to do it.
1DI0026060	You're a hero to everyone here, sir.
1DI0026061	You're a hero to everyone here, ma'am.
1DI0026062	We sure did a number on Hannibal and his abolitionists.
1DI0026063	Those Temple Union slaves got what they deserved.
1DI0026064	What are you doing here?
1DI0026065	You are welcome here any time.
1DI0026066	Hey there. Come to use the radio set?
1DI0026067	Always a pleasure when you visit.
1DI0026068	Welcome back!
1DI0026069	Welcome back to Arefu, kid.
1DI0026070	Huh? Oh, you're back.
1DI0026071	Hey ho! Welcome back to our cozy village!
1DI0026072	Hey, you're back! Let's chat a while.
1DI0026073	Huh? Almost didn't see you there.
1DI0026074	What the fuck do you want?
1DI0026075	What brings you back to Megaton?
1DI0026076	I knew you couldn't stay away!
1DI0026077	The Family welcomes your return with open arms.
1DI0026078	Thanks again for straightening out Ian.
1DI0026079	Well, well look who's back.
1DI0026080	Look what the cat dragged in.
1DI0026081	If you're here to give blood, we're always willing to accept.... Just kidding!
1DI0026082	Needed a place to get out of the sun for a while, eh? I understand completely.
1DI0026083	Come back to the "scary vampire lair" have we? He he he!
1DI0026084	Come on in and relax with a cold Nuka-Cola.
1DI0026085	I knew you'd come back to visit.
1DI0026086	Welcome back to Girdershade!
1DI0026087	Swing that thing, sister!
1DI0026090	Got something on your mind? Spill it.
1DI0026091	Yeah, what?
1DI0026092	Get away from me, you jerk!
1DI0026094	Back again, are we? How marvelous!
1DI0026095	You've got a lot of nerve showing up here after what you've done.
1DI0026096	Make it quick. And don't try anything.
1DI0026097	I know what you did. Everybody does.
1DI0026098	You again, eh? Nervy bastard, aren't you?
1DI0026099	Don't think I've forgotten about what you did.
1DI0026100	Don't even think about trying anything.
1DI0026101	Crime doesn't pay, it just pisses people off.
1DI0026102	Next time you want to talk to someone, stay away from me.
1DI0026103	Just make this fast. I don't like talking to criminals.
1DI0026104	There's a fine line between badass and dumbass, and you crossed it.
1DI0026105	Make no mistake. Try something and I drop your ass.
1DI0026106	We may be alike, but don't take me for stupid. I got my eyes on you.
1DI0026107	Keep acting the way you've been acting and they'll catch you, lock you up and throw away the key.
1DI0026108	I'm not sure I should even be seen talking to you.
1DI0026109	Oh, it's you. Up to the same old crap, huh?
1DI0026110	Sometimes being bad feels pretty damn good, eh?
1DI0026111	You should be ashamed of yourself.
1DI0026112	Next time, use your brains... I know you have it in you.
1DI0026113	What's the matter with you? You can't get away with crap like this.
1DI0026114	The way you're acting surprises me.
1DI0026115	Everyone makes mistakes... just don't do it often.
1DI0026116	Your bad deeds surprise me, they really do.
1DI0026117	Don't act like you didn't enjoy what you did.
1DI0026118	You're as guilty as the rest of us.
1DI0026119	We need more people like you.
1DI0026122	It's not easy to be good in this world. I'm glad that someone is.
1DI0026123	I've heard about you. Let it never be said that there aren't some good people left in the world.
1DI0026124	There's never been anyone like you.
1DI0026125	Is everyone from the Vault as kind as you?
1DI0026126	I'm busy right now, please leave me alone.
1DI0026127	Can't you just get out of here?
1DI0026129	My place is yours. Kick your feet up and relax.
1DI0026130	Grab anything you need.
1DI0026131	Feel free to roam around... you're quite welcome in my place.
1DI0026132	Howdy Ranger!
1DI0026133	You saved my ass back there... I won't forget it.
1DI0026134	Our savior returns!
1DI0026135	Reilly keeps talking' about you. I think you made a friend.
1DI0026136	Come back to visit or to patch yourself up?
1DI0026138	Back from splatterin' more Muties?
1DI0026139	Welcome back to the compound, kid.
1DI0026140	Me 'n Eugene missed ya.
1DI0026141	Well if it isn't our "hero."
1DI0026142	Hey kid.
1DI0026143	Hey. Thanks again. Couldn't have done it with out ya.
1DI0026144	You haven't seen any of those keys, have you? I seem to have lost one.
1DI0026145	Water... please, I need water...
1DI0026146	Just need to pull this hunk of metal out of the ground...
1DI0026147	I don't think this is a good idea. Do you really know what you're doing?
1DI0026148	Where is this damn place?
1DI0026149	I swear it was this way!
1DI0026150	I'm not sure what to think about it.
1DI0026151	It sure is shiny. I'm not sure I like it though.
1DI0026152	What do you think it wants?
1DI0026153	What's it doing out here?
1DI0026154	Think we should shoot it? Enclave tech...
1DI0026155	I've got half a mind to salvage it. Broken when we found it, heh heh.
1DI0026156	Damned survival guide. Must have been written by idiots!
1DI0026157	Why don't you find your own hunting ground?
1DI0026158	Greetings, fellow survivor!
1DI0026159	Help! Bomb!
1DI0026161	My God, it's about to go off!
1DI0026162	Hello, little brother.
1DI0026163	Hello, little sister.
1DI0026164	Remember my offer, Outsider: cash for pre-war books.
1DI0026165	If you have any pre-war books, I'll take them.
1DI0026166	You are not welcome here.
1DI0026167	Leave. I'm busy.
1DI0026168	I told you to go.
1DI0026169	Do you have any scrap metal for me?
1DI0026170	Remember: cash for scrap metal.
1DI0026171	<whistles tunelessly.>
1DI0026173	Umm... hello there. Right! Uh, don't mind me then. I'm uh... just practicing my hunting skills. Keeps me young and all that. Right. Goodbye now!
1DI0026175	Dashwood. What the hell are you skulking about for?
1DI0026177	Hey! What are you up to old man?
1DI0026179	Ahem. Dashwood. Don't do anything stupid.
1DI0026181	You feeling alright, Daring? You having a flash back or something?
1DI0026183	You're behaving rather oddly, Mister Dashwood. Perhaps you should go lie down for awhile.
1DI0026185	Are you alright, Comrade?
1DI0026187	Daring! What on earth are you up to?
1DI0026189	You're up to something. I can tell.
1DI0026191	Daring! What the bloody hell are you up to this time?
1DI0026193	Mr. Dashwood. Perhaps you should go take a nap, dear. You're acting rather peculiar.
1DI0026195	Daring... you're up to no good, aren't you? Naughty, naughty old man!
1DI0026197	What are you doing, Dashwood?
1DI0026199	Finding your way about all right?
1DI0026202	I'll train these marshmallows if it kills me...
1DI0026204	Presence detected. This unit has activated.
1DI0026207	Outsiders in the Citadel. Such a pleasure...
1DI0026208	H... Hello
1DI0026211	You know, you make a very good sandwich.
1DI0026212	Oh. Hello there Susan. It's always a pleasure to see you. Um... you're getting along alright are you, dear?
1DI0026213	Nice to see  you. Carry on.
1DI0026214	Hello. Hello. Can't stop to chat just now.
1DI0026215	Now's not the best time. Perhaps we could parlay sometime later? Thank you.
1DI0026216	Hello Chief Gustavo. You are looking positively fabulous today.
1DI0026217	Hello there, Chief. You're packing a lot of heat, aren't you?
1DI0026218	Doctor Banfield! I haven't seen you in New Urban Apparel for quite some time. Aren't you afraid you've gone out of style in the meantime?
1DI0026219	An outfit a day keeps the frumpy away, eh doctor? Come visit me soon.
1DI0026220	How are you, Mr. Cheng?
1DI0026221	How is Mrs. Cheng these days?
1DI0026222	Ah Lydia, darling. How's that old antique shop of yours doing these days?
1DI0026223	Lydia, darling. What's wrong? You're looking rather frumpy today!
1DI0026224	So, tell me. How are things?
1DI0026225	You haven't stopped by the Urban Apparel in a while.
1DI0026226	So, are you still hiding from that husband of yours?
1DI0026227	Mrs. Cheng! Wouldn't you like a brand new outfit from Urban Outfitters? With a fabulous make-over, perhaps Mr. Cheng wouldn't recognize you!
1DI0026228	I bet you exercise a lot, huh?
1DI0026229	Hi there! That's quite some ordnance you're packing, isn't it!
1DI0026230	If you're tired of sleeping in those barracks, let me know.
1DI0026231	You got anything to report, Ling?
1DI0026232	Doctor. I trust everything's okay?
1DI0026233	Wellington. You and your wife getting along alright?
1DI0026234	Dashwood. You're staying out of trouble, I hope?
1DI0026235	Cheng. Sorry I keep missing your Neighborhood Watch committee meetings. Keep up the good work, though.
1DI0026236	Ms. Montenegro. How are things? Any suspicious activity you'd like to report?
1DI0026237	Ms. Primrose. The next shipment of food stuffs might be delayed. I was chatting with the caravan guard. Seems the Raiders have gotten rather bold.
1DI0026238	Hawthorne. We've gotten a few complaints. Having trouble sleeping recently?
1DI0026239	Mrs. Wellington.
1DI0026240	Ms. Lancaster. How is the tower's favorite resident?
1DI0026241	Ms. Cheng. How are you today?
1DI0026242	I got a spot of blood on my labcoat recently. Any chance you've got something that'll take that out in the wash?
1DI0026243	You feeling alright these days Anthony? It's time we do a regular check up soon; it's been a while.
1DI0026244	Chief. There's something we should discuss. There's been an increase in "accidents" among your crew. I'm afraid someone's going to get really hurt.
1DI0026245	Chief. How're things out there in the Wasteland?
1DI0026246	Hello Lydia. How are you faring these days? Did those pills finally help you start to relax?
1DI0026247	Lydia. Don't suppose you can scrounge up a few more holodisks for me?
1DI0026248	Margaret, you work too hard. I might have to prescribe a vacation for you.
1DI0026249	Don't work too hard!
1DI0026250	Susan, I haven't seen you in a while. Shouldn't you be coming in for a regular "check up" soon?
1DI0026251	How are you feeling today my dear?
1DI0026252	Ms. Cheng. I'm worried about you. You're always seem so high strung. Stress is bad for the heart, you know.
1DI0026253	You finding some time to relax, Ms. Cheng?
1DI0026254	Still keeping the Wasteland at bay, Chief?
1DI0026255	Ms. Primrose. How are you today?
1DI0026256	Millicent, have you ever thought of making friends with the other ladies in the Tower? Not that I mind your constant company, or anything.
1DI0026257	Are you SURE you don't want to make friends with the other ladies? You know, crochet, or gossip, or whatever it is ladies like to do together?
1DI0026258	Are you happy, dear?
1DI0026259	You've something on your mind, dear?
1DI0026260	Oh. Hello there Susan - er, I mean, Ms. Lancaster. I hope all is well.
1DI0026261	Um... hello Susan. Er.. Ms. Lancaster, rather. Pardon my momentary lapse of manners.
1DI0026262	Still pushing back the borders of the Wasteland, Chief? A never ending task, that. Ah. But some days I do miss a good adventure. You're lucky sir!
1DI0026263	Good Chief Gustavo! Anything interesting happening out there in the Wasteland?
1DI0026264	How's that manifesto of yours coming along, Comrade?
1DI0026265	Still having issues with your computer, Comrade?
1DI0026266	How's the cafe holding up these days? I must say, your new menu is superb. You are a fine chef!
1DI0026267	Hello Margaret. You holding up, child? You slave in that kitchen all day for us lazy retired folk. Ever thought of taking a little break?
1DI0026268	Hawthorne! You going to come up for air soon? You're going to drown yourself if you're not careful!
1DI0026269	I've heard Margaret's cafe is running low on pickles. You better not let her catch you, Hawthorne. You might wind up in someone's sandwich!
1DI0026270	Hey girl. How are you doing? You need to slow down and pace yourself, or you'll be old before your time. Like me!
1DI0026271	Marry me, Susan?
1DI0026272	You manage to shake your husband again? Good show! If you'd like, I can show you some stealth tricks I picked up in my adventures.
1DI0026273	I hear Irving's having a bit of trouble with his computer?
1DI0026274	Comrade. Do you have something that will make me, you know, look attractive?
1DI0026275	Comrade, how are you doing?
1DI0026276	Comrade Gustavo! How are things?
1DI0026277	Comrade Gustavo!
1DI0026278	Comrade Dashwood. Do you know much about computers? My computer is not cooperating with me lately.
1DI0026279	I've been thinking about taking up adventuring as a profession. What would I need to know before I do that, comrade?
1DI0026280	Comrade Lydia, do you have something in your shop that my wife would like?
1DI0026281	You have a nice shop, comrade Lydia.
1DI0026282	You make the BEST sandwiches ever, comrade Margaret!
1DI0026283	I think sometime soon I'll try that Iguana Bits sandwich Mr. Tenpenny is always ordering.
1DI0026284	Comrade Hawthorne. You seem to get along okay with the ladies. What's your secret?
1DI0026286	Ummm. Errrr. Ahh...
1DI0026287	Su-su-susan! Hello! I uh... well. You know.
1DI0026288	Tiffany. Why are you always off doing your own thing?
1DI0026289	Tiffany?
1DI0026290	Anthony, darling, you're looking rather bloated today.
1DI0026291	I've got some ointment in the Boutique that should help with those bags under your eyes, love.
1DI0026292	There's nothing to worry about I presume, Chief?
1DI0026293	I trust everyone in the tower is healthy? No plagues to worry about, are there Doctor?
1DI0026294	Have you ever considered performing, what do they call it? Plastic surgery? You know, where you make people look young again?
1DI0026295	I've noticed some new items on the menu.
1DI0026296	One day, you'll have to teach me to cook. I've always wanted to learn, but never had the time.
1DI0026297	Ahhh. There's nothing like a nice glass of wine at the end of a long day, eh Michael?
1DI0026298	Here's to being rich, eh Michael?
1DI0026299	Not to pry, dear. But what is exactly the problem between you and your husband?
1DI0026300	Tiffany. A toast! Here's to stupid men and the women who love them!
1DI0026301	What will you be having for lunch, Mister Tenpenny?
1DI0026302	I'll need another order of hairnets, Anthony.
1DI0026303	You know, if they'd like to, your men could dine in the cafe. They don't always have to eat in the barracks.
1DI0026304	I'll send over something tasty for the men later. A special treat of some kind to let them know we care.
1DI0026305	Doctor, I've been meaning to ask you. Do you think it's safe to serve raw Mirelurk meat? It can be quite delicious.
1DI0026306	Have you noticed the newer, healthier additions to the menu, Doc?
1DI0026307	Here you are, hon.
1DI0026308	Bon appetit!
1DI0026309	Here you are. Sorry that took so long.
1DI0026310	Here you go. I hope you enjoy your meal!
1DI0026311	I made it just like you like it. Enjoy!
1DI0026312	Hey! I know you! Care to share a drink?
1DI0026313	Gustavo, pal. You need to lighten up a bit. Relax. Have some fun, right? Right. Life's too short for all that grumpiness.
1DI0026314	Daring... why do they call you that? Why not "Dash" or "Wood," or "Herb" for godsakes. I mean, that'd make more sense, wouldn't it?
1DI0026315	Daring. I've been meaning to ask. Was it hard to do all those adventures with the radio crew tagging along? I mean, it must have been distracting.
1DI0026316	Hey... Cheng. Why the hell do you call everyone "Comrade" all the time?
1DI0026317	Comrade. Come share a drink.
1DI0026318	Lydia! I've missed you! Come share a wee drinky with me. How was your day dear?
1DI0026319	I'm glad you're here. You're the only one that understands me. The rest, I think they are secretly laughing at me all the time. But not you.
1DI0026320	Susan. Why are you always so kind to me?
1DI0026321	I like spending time with you Susan.
1DI0026322	Mrs. Cheng. Take a load off, enjoy a glass of wine. Relax. You're so high strung, woman!
1DI0026323	Nothing like a fine glass of bubbly to make all things right with the world, eh Mrs. Cheng?
1DI0026324	Did you find any of the information I collected at all useful, Chief?
1DI0026325	Chief. I'm concerned some of your men have been sleeping on the job. Well not literally, I just mean, they don't seem that alert.
1DI0026326	Edgar, dear...
1DI0026327	Edgar...
1DI0026328	I trust you are still feeling satisfied from our last... "conversation?"
1DI0026329	Why, hello there!
1DI0026330	Hello Chief.
1DI0026331	I'm not feeling well, Doctor.
1DI0026332	Doctor Banfield...
1DI0026333	Why Edgar, darling. You're looking quite handsome today!
1DI0026334	Do I make you nervous, Edgar?
1DI0026335	Daring, I'm positively bored here! You know, I used to have quite a different life before Tenpenny Tower. Sometimes I long for a little excitement.
1DI0026336	Let's run away together, and have a real adventure!
1DI0026337	Irving.
1DI0026338	You must learn how to relax, Irving!
1DI0026339	You're always so busy. Why don't you take a day off once in a while?
1DI0026340	Where'd you learn to cook? Everything you make is so delicious. I'd just set the place on fire if I ever tried what you do.
1DI0026341	Michael... do you think I'm pretty?
1DI0026342	Do you ever find it stifling in this tower? Like the walls are keeping us in, rather than keeping the Wasteland out?
1DI0026343	Hey Anthony. I think I need a new dress. Something with a little color, if you got any thing like that.
1DI0026344	You ever been married before?
1DI0026345	What's the chance you or one of your men would trip and accidentally shoot my husband in the head?
1DI0026346	Hello there, Chief. I don't suppose there's any way you could, I don't know, SHOOT MY HUSBAND?! Make it look like an accident or something?
1DI0026347	Hey Doc. You got any poison pills in your hospital?
1DI0026348	Is it hard to tell if someone has been murdered, or just died in his sleep?
1DI0026349	You ever kill a man, Daring?
1DI0026350	Irving's always on that damn computer, typing away at his stupid projects. I wish I knew about computers. I'd erase that damn thing!
1DI0026351	I'm leaving. Bye!
1DI0026352	Lydia, have you ever been in love?
1DI0026353	Do you think it's possible to love someone too much?
1DI0026354	Are you happy with your life, Ms. Primrose?
1DI0026355	Is cooking fun? Maybe I should help you out sometime. You know, just to have something interesting to do?
1DI0026356	You're in here even more than I am. And I thought my life sucked.
1DI0026357	Nothing like a little ale to wash away the day, eh?
1DI0026360	Can I help you?
1DI0026365	I can't believe we're stuck out here babysitting a radio station.
1DI0026366	Man, this sucks. I wanna be where the action is!
1DI0026367	Status report?
1DI0026368	Did you see the hit I scored on that Super Mutant the other day? One round, and his head exploded like an overripe Mutfruit.
1DI0026369	Keep your eyes open, Brother.
1DI0026370	Make sure you keep that weapon clean, Brother.
1DI0026371	Let's see the Super Mutants try and take this place now.
1DI0026372	Nice digs, huh?
1DI0026373	Did you see the size of that Behemoth?
1DI0026374	Welcome to the GNR garrison.
1DI0026375	That was a hell of a fight... nice work.
1DI0026376	If you're looking for Three Dog, he's upstairs.
1DI0026377	That should give the boys at Lost Hills something to think about.
1DI0026378	Good old Mutant cleansing. There's nothing else like it.
1DI0026379	Damn, we lost Reddin.
1DI0026380	Galaxy News owes us big for this one.
1DI0026381	Let's see the Outcasts do THAT.
1DI0026382	Oh man, that thing was enormous.
1DI0026383	Not bad, kid. Not bad at all.
1DI0026384	A pleasure hunting with you.
1DI0026385	Power to the people, eh kid?
1DI0026386	Smooth moves, kid. Smooth moves.
1DI0026387	Looks like the Good Fight has gained a new ally.
1DI0026388	You got questions, I'm your answer man.
1DI0026389	I'm sensing that you have more to say. Well, go on.
1DI0026390	Got more on your mind, huh?
1DI0026391	Wow kid, you look like you've got ten pounds of worry stuffed into a five pound box. Why don't you take a load off and tell me about it.
1DI0026392	Bend my ear... I won't bite.
1DI0026394	You look like you've got ten pounds of worry stuffed into a five pound box.
1DI0026395	Can I help you, Sheriff?
1DI0026399	'can I do for you, Sheriff?
1DI0026400	'can I do for you, daddy-o?
1DI0026401	'can I do for you, dolly?
1DI0026402	Helluva day, isn't it?
1DI0026403	What's shakin'?
1DI0026404	You got a lot of nerve wearing that badge in here.
1DI0026405	You got somethin' to say?
1DI0026406	Well, look who's starin' at me.
1DI0026407	Start talkin' or start walkin'. Your choice.
1DI0026408	(whistling a tune)
1DI0026411	Light shine upon you, Sheriff.
1DI0026412	May Atom's Light shine.
1DI0026413	Light shine on your path.
1DI0026414	Yes, my brother?
1DI0026415	Yes, my sister?
1DI0026416	You don't got nearly enough holes in you to be botherin' me.
1DI0026417	You sick? Injured?
1DI0026418	Less'n you're on death's door, I'm busy.
1DI0026419	<hacking cough> What?
1DI0026420	Welcome back, stranger.
1DI0026421	Good to see you again, stranger.
1DI0026422	Welcome to Moriarty's.
1DI0026423	You... uh... want a drink?
1DI0026424	You might wear his badge, but you're not my dad.
1DI0026425	Dad says not to talk to strangers.
1DI0026427	<coughs> Is there... <coughs> ...something you need?
1DI0026428	Stop starin'. We only sell drinks here.
1DI0026429	Can I interest you in a drink?
1DI0026430	C'mon in to the Brass Lantern, best food in town!
1DI0026431	That badge don't impress me, kid.
1DI0026432	You makin' a move? Huh?
1DI0026433	Point your eyes somewhere else.
1DI0026434	Either start talkin' or get the fuck out of my face.
1DI0026435	You got somethin' to say to me, kid?
1DI0026436	Junk is my business.
1DI0026437	Welcome to Craterside Supply!
1DI0026438	Got something to sell?
1DI0026439	Now, you're a man who looks hungry. What do you need?
1DI0026440	Now, you're a lady who looks hungry. What do you need?
1DI0026441	Welcome to the Brass Lantern!
1DI0026442	Welcome! What can I get for you?
1DI0026444	No trouble I take it?
1DI0026446	Everything okay?
1DI0026447	Hrm?
1DI0026448	Billy says not to talk to you.
1DI0026449	I got nothin' to say to you.
1DI0026450	...now where has that man got to?
1DI0026451	You seen Nathan around anywhere?
1DI0026452	You need something, cupcake?
1DI0026453	Welcome. Join us in the Glow, won't you?
1DI0026454	Welcome, child.
1DI0026455	[Humming a tune]
1DI0026457	God bless the USA. And nowhere else.
1DI0026458	Need someone to brighten your day?
1DI0026459	Looking for fun?
1DI0026460	Looking's free. Everything else will cost you.
1DI0026461	Why am I looking at you?
1DI0026462	What are you lookin' at, girl?
1DI0026463	What are you lookin' at, boy?
1DI0026464	... no respect ... I tell ya' ...
1DI0026466	You need something, youngster?
1DI0026467	[sniffs] I got nothin' to say to you.
1DI0026468	I got my eye on you.
1DI0026469	Don't try anything.
1DI0026473	You want something?
1DI0026481	Hey, Andy. Got a sec?
1DI0026482	Andy, listen to this great idea I had!
1DI0026483	Hey there, Andy.
1DI0026484	Billy, I want to talk to you...
1DI0026485	Billy, can I talk to you about something?
1DI0026486	Billy...
1DI0026487	Hey there, Billy...
1DI0026488	Mister Moriarty? Can I talk to you?
1DI0026489	Umm... Mister Moriarty? Sir?
1DI0026490	Hey, Colin.
1DI0026491	Colin... Listen...
1DI0026492	Colin.
1DI0026493	Good morning, Mr. Moriarty...
1DI0026494	Mr. Moriarty...
1DI0026495	Husband, a word if you will.
1DI0026496	Might we talk, dearest husband?
1DI0026497	Confessor.
1DI0026498	Hey, Jenny. Lookin' good. What've you got for me today?
1DI0026499	Well, hello there, sweetie. What's on the menu today?
1DI0026500	Hi, Jenny.
1DI0026501	Hey, Jenny.
1DI0026502	Jenny...
1DI0026503	What's up, Jericho?
1DI0026504	Hey, Jericho.
1DI0026505	Jericho...
1DI0026506	Gob. These people aren't nearly drunk enough. Fix it.
1DI0026508	I want a word with you, zombie.
1DI0026509	Hey. Zombie. Yeah, you. Come here.
1DI0026510	Gob. Here. Now.
1DI0026511	Heya, Gob...
1DI0026512	Gob...
1DI0026513	Come here for a second, son. I want to talk to you.
1DI0026514	Harden, come here, boy. I want to talk to you.
1DI0026515	It's my turn to be the Raiders!
1DI0026516	I see you, Harden!
1DI0026517	C'mon, Harden! Let's go over here!
1DI0026518	Hey there, Harden.
1DI0026519	Leo, we need to talk.

1DI0026524	Dad! Dad, I want to talk to you!
1DI0026525	Hey, Maggie! How you doin', darlin'?
1DI0026526	Hey! Sweetie-pie!
1DI0026527	C'mon, Maggie! Let's go over here!
1DI0026528	I see you!
1DI0026529	It's my turn!
1DI0026530	Hey there, little Maggie.
1DI0026531	Manya! Manya!
1DI0026532	Darling!
1DI0026533	Hello there, Manya.
1DI0026534	Hello, Manya.
1DI0026535	Hello, Miss Brown.
1DI0026536	Hi, Moira.
1DI0026537	Hey there, Moira.
1DI0026538	Ah, my dearest wife...
1DI0026540	Nathan, dear...
1DI0026541	Nathan.
1DI0026542	Nova, love. A word...
1DI0026543	A moment, Nova. NOW.
1DI0026544	Nova?
1DI0026545	Lookin' good, Nova.
1DI0026546	Nova, can you come here for a second?
1DI0026547	Hey, Nova. I want to talk to you.
1DI0026548	Hello, Nova.
1DI0026549	Nova...
1DI0026550	How are you doing, Walter?
1DI0026551	Hello, Walter.
1DI0026552	Hey, c'mere. I want to talk to you.
1DI0026553	Hey, you. I need to ask you something.
1DI0026558	How are you?
1DI0026561	Um...uh...I'd like, I mean can you get me some Iguana Bits? And a glass of water. No... yes, a glass of water.
1DI0026562	May I take your order?
1DI0026563	I'm so nervous! Just think. Diego and I will be husband and wife.
1DI0026564	I'll be right with you.
1DI0026565	The Mirelurks have been quiet lately.
1DI0026566	Hello, Miss Vera.
1DI0026567	We're running low on river water, dad.
1DI0026568	Dad, can I buy that dress from Bannon? I want to wear it at my wedding. I want to look special for Diego.
1DI0026569	Dad, do you think you'll ever meet someone? I mean like mom? You shouldn't just spend all day cooking you know.
1DI0026570	I'm so excited about getting married. You got my invitation, didn't you? You've got to come.
1DI0026571	Hello, Mrs. Cantelli. Do you have anything that would make a guy be like crazy in love? You know, make him really horny?
1DI0026572	Are you nervous about getting married?
1DI0026573	I have something special for you, but I can only give it to you in private.
1DI0026574	Diego, do you think I'm sexy? I mean, if you weren't a priest and everything, would you be turned on by me?
1DI0026575	Hello, Mr. Holmes. Do you have anything new today?
1DI0026576	Hello, Mr. Shrapnel. My dad wants some more 10mm rounds. Do you have any?
1DI0026577	Hello, Mr. Bannon. Can I look at that blue dress again? The one with the really deep cleavage?
1DI0026578	The prayer was touching, Father.
1DI0026579	I know you could do a much better sermon. I could hardly stay awake.
1DI0026580	Try not to drink too much tonight, sir. It affects your judgment.
1DI0026581	This area looks safe, Mister Zimmer.
1DI0026582	I'll have some water.
1DI0026584	Sister.
1DI0026585	You've had too much to drink, Trinnie.
1DI0026586	Miss Vera, could I trouble you for some vegetables? Whatever you have is fine.
1DI0026587	Mister Buckingham, I'd like some vegetables. Whatever you have available.
1DI0026588	Hmmm. No. I don't think you're him.
1DI0026589	I'll have two Mirelurk Cakes, carrots and wine, if you have it, beer if you don't.
1DI0026590	Angela, why do you insist on wearing such rags? I could sell you a most beautiful dress. Diego, would be positively starstruck.
1DI0026591	Angela, why do you insist on wearing such rags? I could sell you a most beautiful dress.
1DI0026592	You come in here a lot, but you never buy anything.
1DI0026593	Must you always sit next to me in church?
1DI0026594	Before you start in on me, Vera, there's not much new here.
1DI0026595	Can we make this quick? I have a wedding to get ready for.
1DI0026597	Hmmph.
1DI0026598	When that little shit gets here, watch him. If he starts anything, kick his ass.
1DI0026599	You've had too much, Trinnie. Go sleep it off in the back.
1DI0026600	Every week you come down here preaching this crap. Why don't you just stay in your god damned church?
1DI0026601	What'll you have? And don't say water.
1DI0026605	You've got some nice stuff in here, Bannon. Too bad it's so expensive.
1DI0026606	You need to raise your prices, Belle. You're practically giving this stuff away.
1DI0026607	Belle told me to throw you out of here if you stir up too much trouble, Father.
1DI0026608	Flak, I'm running low on ammo. What do you have in stock?
1DI0026609	Let's not have a repeat of the other day, Flak.
1DI0026610	Size doesn't scare me, Sister. Don't start anything that I'll have to finish.
1DI0026611	Hey, Shrapnel. How's the gun business?
1DI0026612	Tammy, why don't you take the night off and spend it with James? If there's a repeat of the other night, Belle is going to kick you out.
1DI0026613	Tammy, why don't you go home? If there's a repeat of the other night, Belle is going to kick you out.
1DI0026614	Don't you think you've had enough, Trinnie?
1DI0026615	This is the Muddy Rudder. Cause any trouble, and you'll have to deal with me.
1DI0026616	Care for a drink?
1DI0026617	Hey, I'm not looking for trouble.
1DI0026618	Don't forget to pick up your room, C.J.
1DI0026619	Finish your food, C.J. There are starving people in the Wasteland you know.
1DI0026620	Stop fidgeting, C.J.
1DI0026621	Congratulations! I'm so happy for Angela and Diego. Have they set a date yet?
1DI0026622	Are the Mirelurk Cakes fresh?
1DI0026623	Henry, I'm not sure I like C.J. playing with that Hargrave boy. His mother is just dreadful, even if she is on the upper deck.
1DI0026624	God has truly blessed our family, Henry.
1DI0026625	Wonderful sermon, Father. It really made me think.
1DI0026626	Someday you'll be the one preaching the sermons, Diego.
1DI0026627	How was work today, Henry? Is Doctor Li almost finished?
1DI0026628	Isn't it exciting? A wedding. We haven't had a wedding in Rivet City in years.
1DI0026629	Oh! Hello. Are you lost?
1DI0026630	Hey, Vera. Still dodging old Seagrave? He's got eyes for you.
1DI0026631	Shrapnel, I thought you shot your own food?
1DI0026632	Hi, Flak. I hear the Iguana on a Stick is good today.
1DI0026633	Your little girl is getting married! How exciting! You must be so proud.
1DI0026634	Gary, could I have some ant meat and a Nuka-Cola?
1DI0026635	Come to spend some of your hard earned caps, Henry? I'm afraid I'm all out of moral superiority.
1DI0026636	Christie. I noticed you never clean up the hangar deck. Just the upper deck. What, we aren't good enough for you?
1DI0026637	Hello, C.J.
1DI0026638	Go home, or get high, or whatever it is you do when I'm not around.
1DI0026639	I heard you're getting married! Are you excited? Is Diego nervous?
1DI0026640	Angela, what brings you into A Quick Fix?
1DI0026641	Father Clifford is making more sense than usual.
1DI0026642	Hi, Bannon! Mind if I sit with you?
1DI0026643	See anything you like, Mei?
1DI0026644	You know, we helped fix up those love birds up. I'm so glad it worked out.
1DI0026645	Welcome to A Quick Fix.
1DI0026646	Have you seen my husband, Paulie?
1DI0026648	Hey, Dad, can you tell me a story? Tell me one about when people could drink the river.
1DI0026649	Dad, can I be excused to go play with James?
1DI0026650	Dad, I'm bored.
1DI0026651	Mom, can I have a snack?
1DI0026652	Mom, why don't we like the people that live on the hangar deck?
1DI0026653	Mom, is James' mom going to go to hell?
1DI0026654	What do you want to do, James?
1DI0026655	Excuse me.
1DI0026656	Mr. Staley, could I have a Nuka-Cola please?
1DI0026657	Hello, mister.
1DI0026658	Hello, ma'am.
1DI0026659	Chief Harkness, we should go over those reports.
1DI0026660	Report, officer.
1DI0026661	Hello, Seagrave. You shouldn't waste your time with Vera. You can do better than her.
1DI0026662	Hello, Diego. I'd be careful with that jailbait if I were you.
1DI0026663	Hello, Garza. Everything okay down in Doctor Li's lab?
1DI0026664	You better be minding yourself, Sister. One more screw up and I'm tossing your ass overboard.
1DI0026665	Hello, Father Clifford.
1DI0026666	Hello, Flak. I've got a couple of pistols that need repair. I'll bring them by tomorrow.
1DI0026667	Guns and liquor don't mix, Shrapnel. Leave the ordnance at home when you're in the Muddy Rudder.
1DI0026668	Hello Miss Weatherly. Still letting that bucket of bolts do all your work for you?
1DI0026669	How am I supposed to manage security at a wedding? It's impossible I tell you.
1DI0026670	If you see anything suspicious, be sure to tell a security officer.
1DI0026671	Hey, Security guy. This place is awesome. Don't mind me. I'm just admiring the scenery.
1DI0026672	So what's your story? Me, I'm just experiencing my freedom. You know, wandering the Wasteland, doing whatever I please.
1DI0026673	Dude, what's the word? You tripping or something? You seem really bummed out.
1DI0026674	Dude, I believe in better life through chems, but you're taking it way too far. You gotta cut back some.
1DI0026675	Hey, squirt.
1DI0026676	Chief Harkness! Dude, what's up?
1DI0026677	Hey, missy.
1DI0026678	Brock! The bouncer man! Dude, I would love your job. Free booze, drunk women, and you get to crack some skulls too.
1DI0026679	Stay chill, dude.
1DI0026680	Chief Harkness. It's always comforting to see you on your rounds.
1DI0026681	Have you decided on the message for your next sermon?
1DI0026682	Father, doesn't it bother you to preach to an empty church everyday but Sunday?
1DI0026683	I'm sure God hears your prayers, Mister Lopez.
1DI0026684	Doctor Preston, may I visit with your patients? I promise to be brief and quiet.
1DI0026685	Angela, people are starting to talk. I can't be seen with you like this any more. From now on only visit me in the church.
1DI0026686	Angela, I'm not sure you should spend so much time around me. I am to be married to God soon.
1DI0026687	What looks good on the menu today, Mister Buckingham?
1DI0026688	This may be the happiest day of my life!
1DI0026690	Don't go too far away. I'm going to need you to move some equipment shortly.
1DI0026691	Henry, do you have those readings ready for me yet?
1DI0026692	Let me guess. I'm perfectly healthy. I keep telling you I'm fine.
1DI0026693	Anna, don't just stand there, bring me that equipment.
1DI0026694	Janice, have you overbalanced the chemical mix?
1DI0026695	Don't get in the way. We're very busy.
1DI0026696	Father Clifford, I'll let you pray with my patients, but only for a short time. They need their rest.
1DI0026697	Diego, I assume you are here to visit my patients.
1DI0026698	Li, you shouldn't see this weekly checkup as a bad thing. All of Rivet City needs you to be as healthy as possible.
1DI0026699	Mister Buckingham, could I get a bite to eat?
1DI0026700	If those two lovebirds aren't careful, I'll be helping Angela deliver a baby before the year is out.
1DI0026701	You're hurt. Fortunately, this is a medical clinic. Why don't you let me take a look at that.
1DI0026702	This is a medical clinic. Please don't disturb any of my patients.
1DI0026703	You don't look too good. Come by the clinic and I'll patch you up.
1DI0026704	Diego, you have been fornicating with that strumpet, Angela Staley. Don't try to deny it. I have a witness.
1DI0026705	Make sure the chapel is prepared for Sunday services.
1DI0026706	Don't forget to prepare the sacrament.
1DI0026707	Saint Monica bless you, Vera. You have truly found peace through the Lord.
1DI0026708	Saint Monica bless you, Christie. How is your family?
1DI0026709	Saint Monica bless you, C.J. Have you spoken to James about coming to church? I'd really like to see him here.
1DI0026710	Saint Monica bless you, Henry. The work you are doing with Doctor Li is blessed by God as well.
1DI0026711	I'm so glad you and Diego decided to get married. So many couples decide to live in sin these days.
1DI0026712	Saint Monica bless you, Angela. I hope your father is well. You really should try to get him to come with you to church.
1DI0026713	Saint Monica bless you, Mei. Remember, you faith will be your armor.
1DI0026714	Your patients appreciate my visits, even if you don't, Doctor Preston. The Holy Spirit can be a balm to the soul.
1DI0026715	Diego, we must pray with any of Doctor Preston's patients. Help them to heal through Saint Monica.
1DI0026716	Suicide is a sin, Mister Lopez. Why kill yourself when there is so much to live for?
1DI0026717	Have faith in Saint Monica, Mei. She will protect you from those that seek to hurt you.
1DI0026718	My son, you are drifting through life. God can provide you a purpose, just as He did for Saint Monica.
1DI0026719	Forsake the evils of alcohol, Flak. They tempt you with oblivion when you should be glorifying God.
1DI0026720	I'll just have some fruit today, Buckingham.
1DI0026721	Put down that drink and raise your voice to the Lord!
1DI0026722	Trinnie, can't you see what whiskey has done to your life? You've sold your body to men and your soul to the Devil.
1DI0026723	Belle, you are an unwitting servant of the devil. You serve his demon brew down here.
1DI0026724	Deep down you are a good man, Brock. Come away from this den of iniquity. Come into the light of the Lord!
1DI0026725	This is not a safe place for your soul. Do not be tempted by the sins of vile liquor in this den of iniquity!
1DI0026726	It's a glorious day for a wedding!
1DI0026728	How's our ammo inventory? It was getting low yesterday.
1DI0026729	Hey, Brock. Looking for more 10mm ammo?
1DI0026730	Business or pleasure, Vera?
1DI0026731	Hello Vera. I think I heard a Mirelurk off the starboard side. Think I'll get in some target practice.
1DI0026732	The deck is quiet tonight.
1DI0026733	Gary, two Mirelurk Cakes. And make it quick.
1DI0026734	Welcome to Flak and Shrapnel's. Best god damn weapons anywhere.
1DI0026736	You've grown up so fast, Angela. I remember when you first learned to walk, and now you're getting married!
1DI0026737	I heard that you've been hanging around that Diego boy. Be careful, Angela. You know boys only want one thing, even priests.
1DI0026738	Make sure to clean all the empty tables.
1DI0026739	Taking a break, Vera?
1DI0026740	My little girl is all grown up. After today, she'll be married to Diego.
1DI0026741	Have a seat anywhere. Someone will be with you in a minute.
1DI0026742	I...nevermind.
1DI0026744	I moved the new plant beds under the sun lamps.
1DI0026745	Doctor Li, the new shipment has been stowed away.
1DI0026746	I have some spare time. Do you need anything?
1DI0026747	Hello Diego. Has Father Clifford decided to ordain you as a full priest yet?
1DI0026748	Commander Danvers. Doctor Li has asked that the latest shipment be locked up this time.
1DI0026749	If you could move out of the way, it would make things easier for all of us.
1DI0026753	Any problems in the Muddy Rudder that I should know about?
1DI0026754	C.J., don't do everything James tells you. He's a bad example.
1DI0026755	Commander Danvers, anything to report?
1DI0026756	Ted, if you're still looking for work, Christie Young can always use help cleaning the Hangar Decks.
1DI0026757	Hey, Flak. How's business?
1DI0026758	James, you stay out of trouble.
1DI0026759	Hello, Mei. I'm still keeping an eye on him. You're safe.
1DI0026760	Hello, Mei. You seem much more relaxed now that he's gone.
1DI0026761	Paulie, you need to lay off the chems.
1DI0026762	Seagrave, got anything new in that flea market of yours?
1DI0026763	Tammy, take it easy on the booze. You've got a son to raise.
1DI0026764	Trinnie, don't make a fool of yourself tonight like you did last week.
1DI0026765	Vera, you look lovely as always.
1DI0026766	Mister Zimmer. Have you found what you're looking for?
1DI0026767	Let me or a security officer know if you see anything out of the ordinary.
1DI0026768	Shall we go for a walk on the flight deck tonight, dear?
1DI0026769	How's your food, dear?
1DI0026770	Attendance is good today.
1DI0026771	A thoughtful message, Father.
1DI0026772	He was on fire today, Diego. I could barely keep my eyes open.
1DI0026773	C.J, have you done your chores?
1DI0026774	I fixed the transformer, again. You should have power for a while.
1DI0026775	Garza, you stacked those crates on the cables again. They need to be moved or you'll short out the system.
1DI0026776	Janice, are those sunlamps I fixed the other day holding up?
1DI0026777	I do the repairs around here. So if you see something that needs fixing, let me know.
1DI0026778	No problems to report, I assume.
1DI0026779	Mom, can I go to C.J.'s?
1DI0026780	Hey C.J., let's play killer. You pretend to be my Mom, and I'll pretend to be a serial killer.
1DI0026781	Mom, do I have to eat this?
1DI0026782	You're nothin' but a talking refrigerator.
1DI0026783	Outta my way, tin can.
1DI0026784	Don't mind me, mister.
1DI0026785	Don't mind me, lady.
1DI0026786	Doctor Li, the new solutions will be ready in a few hours.
1DI0026787	The waste water in the hydroponic gardens isn't draining properly. Could you look at it?
1DI0026788	Garza, when you get a chance, remove the empty water tanks in the gardens and put in the fresh ones.
1DI0026789	The work that Doctor Li is doing is just amazing. I might even be able to produce broccoli in the hydroponic gardens next year.
1DI0026790	I'd like a potato and some carrots. Oh, and put some of this herb in hot water. If I'm lucky, it will make tea.
1DI0026791	Don't touch the vegetables. They're fragile.
1DI0026792	Some people are in such a hurry.
1DI0026793	Ted, could you please not put your stuff on my bed or all over the floor?
1DI0026794	Mister Lopez, would you like to talk? They say talking helps with problems.
1DI0026795	A lovely sermon, Father.
1DI0026796	Diego, try and get Father Clifford to put some energy in his sermons. Some of us were trying not to fall asleep.
1DI0026797	Don't mind me.
1DI0026798	Miss Mei, may I get you some water?
1DI0026799	Doctor Preston, the usual?
1DI0026800	Is everything satisfactory, Mister Washington?
1DI0026801	Miss Janice, do you need a refill?
1DI0026802	Are you ready to order, Mister Diego?
1DI0026803	Are you ready to order, Mister Father Clifford?
1DI0026804	Are you ready to order, Mister Sister?
1DI0026805	Something different today, Mister Armitage?
1DI0026806	Are you ready to order, Mister Zimmer?
1DI0026807	Do you have any instructions, Miss Vera?
1DI0026808	I am at your service.
1DI0026809	Mei, you've been kind to me. I'll miss you when I'm gone.
1DI0026810	Ted, you're wasting your life. Do something with it. How about I teach you to read?
1DI0026811	Ted, you're wasting your life. Do something with it. If you don't, you'll turn out just like me.
1DI0026812	Shrapnel, do you sell ammo individually? Could I buy just one bullet?
1DI0026813	Father, I have these feelings of worthlessness. I just want to end it all.
1DI0026814	Diego, I am a troubled man. My life has no meaning. There is no point in going on.
1DI0026815	Gary, is there anything new on the menu?
1DI0026816	Leave me alone. This is none of your business.
1DI0026817	Don't mind me. I'm just taking up space here.
1DI0026818	Hey, Commander. Just walking the deck here. Yep, just walking the deck.
1DI0026819	You're tired, Cindy. I'll close up tonight. You go home and go to bed.
1DI0026820	Ted, Teddy! I got some great Psycho. It's totally wow. You oughta come down to my shop and buy some. We could shoot it together.
1DI0026821	It's the colors, man. The colors are amazing. You really gotta try Psycho.
1DI0026822	Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
1DI0026823	Man, I'm so hungry. When I come down, I really get a need to feed.
1DI0026824	Gary, my man! I'm so hungry I could eat a whole Brahmin. How about lettin' me put this one on my tab?
1DI0026825	Angela, how would you like to trade some Brahmin steak for Mentats? It'll make you beautiful.
1DI0026826	This is A Quick Fix. We sell all kinds of chems.
1DI0026827	Wanna do some Buffout? Maybe a little Psycho?
1DI0026828	This area is off limits to civilians.
1DI0026829	Hello, Vera. I just got in a new hot plate. I can sell it to you at a discount.
1DI0026830	Vera, I know I'm not a sophisticated man, but I am a man, and I can take care of you.
1DI0026831	I'll have some mutfruit and noodles.
1DI0026832	Can I get a Nuka-Cola?
1DI0026833	Any news with Doctor Li's project?
1DI0026834	Hey, Cindy. How's that secure storage unit I made you working out?
1DI0026835	There's the blushing bride to be! Congratulations Angela. You and Diego will make a good couple.
1DI0026836	Hello, Miss Angela. What brings you into my shop today?
1DI0026837	Hello, Bannon. Anything interesting happen in the last council meeting?
1DI0026838	Hello, Henry. I just got in some new torc wrench and some electrical test equipment. You should take a look at them when you're done eating.
1DI0026839	Cindy, don't forget to bring by anything interesting you might find while cleaning the deck. It might be worth some caps to you.
1DI0026840	C.J.! You're getting bigger and prettier every day.
1DI0026841	Hey, Flak. I'd avoid the Iguana today. It gave me the runs yesterday.
1DI0026842	Diego is a lucky boy. Angela agreed to marry him.
1DI0026843	Welcome to Rivet City Supply. I've got a little bit of everything here.
1DI0026844	Nice day, huh?
1DI0026845	I can't get that god damned laser pistol working. Think I should ask Seagrave to look at it?
1DI0026846	Vera. Don't see you in here often. Looking for something in particular?
1DI0026847	Hey Brock, when are you going to trade in that piece of shit sidearm? I've got some sweet new ones here.
1DI0026848	How's the whiskey, Belle?
1DI0026849	Hey, girlie. This ain't a god damn dress shop. There's nothing in here you oughta be buyin'.
1DI0026850	Gary, gimme some Brahmin steaks. And don't burn them this time.
1DI0026851	If you want a gun, you've come to the right place.
1DI0026852	Are you looking at me?
1DI0026853	I need another whiskey, Belle.
1DI0026854	You're not so tough.
1DI0026855	Let me buy you a drink. You and Flak have a nice shop. Have you known him long? Was he born in Rivet City?
1DI0026856	You'd be worth some caps in the right circles. Too bad.
1DI0026857	Hey, you rusty tin can. Get me some food. Meat, any kind. And don't call me Mister Sister.
1DI0026858	You can shove your sermon up your ass, Father. We're busy drinking down here.
1DI0026859	You don't look so tough.
1DI0026860	Don't slouch. Chew your food. And don't give me that look or I'll slap it right off your face!
1DI0026861	Stop that! Don't make me smack you. I oughta lock you in your goddamn room, you little brat. And stay away from that C.J. bitch from now on.
1DI0026862	Gary, you know what I like. Make it rare. Oh, and get James something too. Not too expensive though. He's been naughty.
1DI0026863	Did I ever tell you about my husband? Got me pregnant with that brat James. Then he ran off. Asshole.
1DI0026864	Hey, you. Don't trust those Hangar Deck people. They're all jealous of us cause we live in the Upper Deck.
1DI0026865	I'm drunk. Don't try to take advantage of me. No, really. You wouldn't like me when I'm sober.
1DI0026866	You're a drunk and a slut. I'm just a drunk. So there.
1DI0026867	I'm outta caps. Can you put my next drink on my tab? Please Belle? I really need a drink after dealing with my brat all day.
1DI0026868	Have you seen my good-for-nothing son, James?
1DI0026869	Belle, gimme another drink.
1DI0026870	Brock, how come you never put the moves on me?
1DI0026871	I've got the headache from hell. Do you have anything that will help?
1DI0026872	Flak, honey, buy me a drink. I'm short on caps, and I really need one.
1DI0026873	Shrapnel! You're my favorite man. Buy me a drink lover?
1DI0026874	Hey, Sister. How about that drink you owe me?
1DI0026875	Father Clifford, I've been a bad girl.
1DI0026876	Hey stranger. Wanna buy a girl a drink?
1DI0026877	Can you spare enough for drink? I could really use one.
1DI0026879	So you finally got Diego to ask you to marry him. Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
1DI0026880	Angela, you are growing up so fast! Your father must be proud.
1DI0026881	Are you getting enough to eat, Mister Armitage?
1DI0026882	When are you going to get some new dresses, Bannon? I'm tired of these worn out styles.
1DI0026883	Hello Cindy. Is Paulie off getting high again? You really should kick him out.
1DI0026884	Hello Cindy. I know we haven't been the best of friends, but I am sorry he's dead. I know he meant something to you.
1DI0026885	Commander Danvers. Walking the night patrol?
1DI0026886	Eat what you want, Diego. I never charge you or Father Clifford for you meals.
1DI0026887	Father Clifford's sermon was very inspirational.
1DI0026888	Your sermon was very inspirational, Father Clifford.
1DI0026889	I'm so happy for Angela. She and Diego will be so happy together.
1DI0026890	Hello Gary. How's Angela doing? I saw her with Diego the other day.
1DI0026891	Someone said the Mirelurks are out tonight.
1DI0026892	Hello Flak. How's business?
1DI0026893	Here for some target practice, Flak?
1DI0026894	It's good to see you eat, Janice. How are the hydroponic gardens?
1DI0026895	Hello Seagrave.
1DI0026896	Lovely night for a walk on the deck. Thank you for keeping me company.
1DI0026897	Mister Shrapnel. I need some 10mm ammo. Two clips should do.
1DI0026898	Is your room comfortable, Mis...uh...Sister?
1DI0026899	Is everything to your satisfaction, Mister Zimmer?
1DI0026900	Well, my metal friend. How are we doing today?
1DI0026901	Have you heard? Angela and Diego are getting married.
1DI0026902	Welcome to the Weatherly Hotel.
1DI0026903	Nice to see you.
1DI0026904	Madam, do you know of anyone in Rivet City that seems unusual? Very unemotional or too formal?
1DI0026905	A glass of wine, please.
1DI0026906	We're not having any luck, Armitage. We may have to change strategies.
1DI0026907	Miss Janice, maybe we could exchange science notes sometime. My work in biological systems might be of interest to you.
1DI0026908	Excuse me, sir. Have you noticed anyone acting peculiarly in Rivet City?
1DI0026909	Do you have any salt?
1DI0026910	Did I order already? If I didn't, I'd like Iguana Bits with vegetables.
1DI0026911	Vera, may I have some Brahmin steak, carrots, and a glass of water, please?
1DI0026912	Hello officer. You haven't seen anyone acting oddly lately, have you?
1DI0026913	Wastelander.
1DI0026914	This place is closing soon. Do your business and get out.
1DI0026915	They're all eating breakfast at Gary's. They'll still sell to you though. Just ask 'em.
1DI0026916	They're all eating dinner at Gary's. They'll still sell to you though. Just ask 'em.
1DI0026917	Go get some chow. Your shift's over.
1DI0026918	Shift's over. Go get some rest.
1DI0026919	Everything looks okay here.
1DI0026920	Any trouble in this area?
1DI0026921	I'm looking for troublemakers. Have you seen any?
1DI0026922	Out of the way you rust bucket.
1DI0026923	It was so noisy last night. I could hardly sleep.
1DI0026924	One of the new immigrants died of radiation poisoning last week.
1DI0026925	I heard that the City Council is debating putting railings on the flight deck.
1DI0026926	Did you hear about the fight in the Muddy Rudder last night?
1DI0026927	Doctor Li and her staff left to get Project Purity running.
1DI0026928	I heard that a bunch of former slaves from Paradise Falls set up a free town in the Lincoln Memorial.
1DI0026929	Did you hear that the Enclave attacked Project Purity? They've taken over the Memorial.
1DI0026930	Hey, have you noticed that Enclave radio is off the air?
1DI0026931	Did you hear what happened to Ted Strayer?
1DI0026932	You know Tenpenny Tower, right? Well, Allistair Tenpenny was killed.
1DI0026933	There was some sort of battle in the city yesterday. The gate guard said the gunfire went on for over an hour.
1DI0026934	They found Harkness dead. It looks like he put up a fight though.
1DI0026935	Chief Harkness has vanished. Nobody knows what happened to him.
1DI0026937	Sir.
1DI0026938	Ma'am.
1DI0026939	Attention! Officer on deck.
1DI0026940	Authorized Civilian. Proceed.

1DI0026956	You like what you see? Talk to Mr. Eulogy.
1DI0026957	Don't mind Eulogy. Daddy don't pay no attention to us.
1DI0026958	Hey there, uh... handsome?
1DI0026959	Hey there, handsome.
1DI0026960	I'm sure you have a great personality.
1DI0026961	Hey there, pretty.
1DI0026962	Can't help you now. Come to the clinic in the morning.
1DI0026963	Sorry, kid. Clinic's closed.
1DI0026965	You hurt?
1DI0026966	You here to do business?
1DI0026967	It's a pleasure to see a fresh face around here.
1DI0026968	Welcome to Paradise Falls, my dear.
1DI0026969	Here on business?
1DI0026970	Welcome to Paradise Falls, sir. Step right on up.
1DI0026972	I've killed people for looking at me like that.
1DI0026975	<disgusting hacking cough>
1DI0026976	Enjoy your stay. Hahaha!
1DI0026977	What are you hangin' around here for?
1DI0026978	Head on up.
1DI0026979	Watch yourself up there.
1DI0026983	This place is awful...
1DI0026984	I miss my brother...
1DI0026985	Please, won't you help?
1DI0026986	They told me not to go too far...
1DI0026987	I'm off right now. Hit me up in the morning.
1DI0026988	Sorry, man. Shop's closed.
1DI0026989	I got all kinds of guns, man.
1DI0026990	You looking to buy something?
1DI0026991	Holy, shit! Where'd you get that gun?
1DI0026992	You need a new shooter, bro?
1DI0026993	You need a new shooter, chica?
1DI0026994	Ain't no reason to stick around here, is there?
1DI0026995	Tell Eulogy I said hi.
1DI0026996	<grumbles to himself>
1DI0026998	Can't nobody eat fifty eggs...
1DI0026999	Yeah, I guess I gotta find my own way.
1DI0027000	Psst. Hey. Help me out.
1DI0027001	<growls>
1DI0027003	You're so... small...
1DI0027005	Whoa, sorry! I'll get out of your way!
1DI0027006	Respect, man.
1DI0027007	Holy shit, it's you!
1DI0027008	We should grab a drink sometime.
1DI0027009	What's up, killer?
1DI0027010	Hey, welcome, buddy.
1DI0027011	You're not so bad from what I've heard.
1DI0027012	Heh. I've heard a few things about you.
1DI0027013	Watch it.
1DI0027014	We don't like outsiders here.
1DI0027015	Get your business done and go.
1DI0027018	One wrong move, and you're going in the meat pen.
1DI0027019	Watch your step, square.
1DI0027021	You don't look like you belong here.
1DI0027022	Goddamn tin can.
1DI0027023	Looks like one of those Brotherhood assholes...
1DI0027024	Nice outfit. You raid a vault or something?
1DI0027025	Fucking Vault brats...
1DI0027027	Got a minute?
1DI0027028	If it isn't MacCready himself...
1DI0027029	Looks like something's on your mind, Lucy.
1DI0027030	What's bothering you, Penny?
1DI0027031	Care to talk?
1DI0027032	Hey, Zip. Come over here.
1DI0027033	Here for your grub?
1DI0027034	Chow time?
1DI0027036	Excuse me, I've got a question.
1DI0027037	Um, can I ask something?
1DI0027039	Why, hello little girl. What a lovely dress you have!
1DI0027040	Just bring me a nice kid to meet, and I'll take care of the rest.
1DI0027041	Hey, dummy.
1DI0027042	Hey, Sammy.
1DI0027044	Hey, heard the latest tales of the Wastes?
1DI0027045	So, bro, any luck trading today?
1DI0027046	So, sis, crack anybody up today?
1DI0027047	Hey, sis!
1DI0027048	Hey, sib!
1DI0027049	Wanna hear a story?
1DI0027051	So, sis, made any good jokes today?
1DI0027052	Guess what?
1DI0027053	Mind if I follow you around for a bit? I promise not to bug you! It'll be fun!
1DI0027054	Oh, hey, excuse me, hey!
1DI0027055	Somebody said you wanted to see me, E?
1DI0027056	Umm...
1DI0027059	Pardon me.
1DI0027061	Tell me more about shooting, Joseph.
1DI0027063	Look alive, you mopey motherfucker, you've got a mayor talking to you!
1DI0027064	Hey, Princess, give the squirt a fucking break and answer a few questions.
1DI0027065	Hey, Princess, if you aren't busy daydreaming about me, how about answering a few questions?
1DI0027066	Eclair, stop trying to make crap taste like sugar and tell me what's going on.
1DI0027067	Anybody break anything important, Lucy?
1DI0027068	Knock, what's up? And if you say "the sky" I swear I'm gonna kick you in the junk.
1DI0027069	Knick, anything new and fancy in your magic junkpile full of crap?
1DI0027070	Joe, anything useful you can teach me about how the classes are going?
1DI0027071	Well, if it isn't my favorite girl.
1DI0027072	Look alive!
1DI0027073	Hewwo!
1DI0027074	Lucy, can you take a look at this?
1DI0027077	S'up, Pronto?
1DI0027078	How's it goin', Pronto?
1DI0027079	Don't think I haven't seen what's been goin' on around here, Bleak. You're makin' it dangerous for us all.
1DI0027080	I see what you're doin' around here, girl, and I got somethin' to say to you about it.
1DI0027081	Hey, Bleak... you remember... you remember that thing that you asked me about? The secret thing?
1DI0027082	Hey... Hey, Bleak... check this out... I did that thing you asked.
1DI0027083	Hey, Bleak.
1DI0027084	Bleak...
1DI0027085	Breadbox, listen. I need your help.
1DI0027086	Listen up, old man. I'm going to need your help with something...
1DI0027087	Hey, man... Breadbox... where'd you get such a funny name?
1DI0027088	I... I was wonderin'... where'd you get your... get your name, Breadbox?
1DI0027089	Hey, Breadbox. What's up?
1DI0027090	Breadbox...
1DI0027091	Bronson, boy. You need to get off of that drink.
1DI0027092	Look at you, Bronson, you're a mess. You need to stop all this drinkin'.
1DI0027093	Hey, Bronson, listen up. Hey! Pay attention! I need your help!
1DI0027094	Bronson... Bronson! Dammit, listen to me. And keep quiet!
1DI0027095	Bronson...
1DI0027096	Drunk fool...
1DI0027097	Come here, Carolina, I have something that I'm wondering about.
1DI0027098	Red, I wanna ask you something.
1DI0027099	Hello, Miss Carolina.
1DI0027100	Hey, Miss Carolina.
1DI0027101	Carolina...
1DI0027102	Red...
1DI0027103	Crimson, did you hear what those fools were saying out in the yard?
1DI0027104	I can't believe that Mr. Eulogy let's those fools out in the yard talk like that! Did you hear what they said?
1DI0027105	Clover, stay nearby. Let's not cause a scene.
1DI0027106	Clover, we've had this discussion. You stay with me at all times.
1DI0027107	Hey, Clover.
1DI0027108	Miss Clover...
1DI0027109	Crimson, did you see that new guy walking around here?
1DI0027110	Did you get a chance to check out the new guy, Crimson?
1DI0027111	Crimson, did you see that new girl walking around here?
1DI0027112	Did you get a chance to check out the new girl, Crimson?
1DI0027113	Crimson... Crimson! Do not cause me to lose my cool.
1DI0027114	Crimson, let's stay down to earth, shall we? No more daydreaming.
1DI0027115	Miss Crimson...
1DI0027116	Hey, Crimson.
1DI0027117	So Cutter, what's the good word? Happy to see me? Miss me?
1DI0027118	Heya Cutter... you got anything for me today? Flowers, love letters?
1DI0027119	Cutter.
1DI0027120	Hey, Cutter.
1DI0027121	Mr. Eulogy... uhm... can I talk to you for a second? If, if you're not busy, I mean.
1DI0027122	If you're not busy, Mr Eulogy... I... I wanted to talk to you for a second.
1DI0027123	I've got something to say to you, Mr. Eulogy.
1DI0027124	Listen, Mr. Eulogy. We have to talk.
1DI0027126	Excuse me... sir...
1DI0027127	Eulogy! My man!
1DI0027128	What's up, Eulogy?
1DI0027129	Eulogy...
1DI0027130	Forty, what do I pay you for? Have you seen this out here?
1DI0027131	Goddammit, Forty, I don't pay you to sleep on the job. Look around here. Tell me what you see.
1DI0027132	Dude, Forty. Did you hear?
1DI0027133	Hey, Forty.
1DI0027134	You seen anything good today?
1DI0027135	Hey, man. Anything goin' on out here today?
1DI0027136	Grouse.
1DI0027137	Hey, big boy. How you holdin' up today?
1DI0027138	Well look who's still standing. You're looking a lot better! And here I thought that wasn't possible...
1DI0027139	Look at you, my boy! Fit as ever! You're as big as a tank! I always tell them, I say "My Jotun, he could lift a house!"
1DI0027140	Haha! My boy! He is so big! Look at him! He could carry four slaves under his arms! He doesn't even need a gun to take them!
1DI0027141	Where'd you get a name like Jotun, anyway?
1DI0027142	Hey, Jotun. How's your old man?
1DI0027143	Hey, Jotun.
1DI0027144	Ug. Get away from me.
1DI0027145	Miss Jeanette...
1DI0027146	The man with the hardware. How are things, Pronto?
1DI0027147	There's the man that keeps us knee deep in lead. How you doing?
1DI0027148	Pronto...
1DI0027149	Jesus fucking Christ, it's dull out here.
1DI0027150	For fuck's sake, I'm bored. There ain't nothin' happening today.
1DI0027151	Richter.
1DI0027152	That boy of yours sure was drunk off his ass the other night, huh?
1DI0027153	Oh, man. Jotun was fucking hammered the other night. I thought he was gonna kill himself!
1DI0027154	Hey, Ymir. Do you want a drink?
1DI0027155	Drink with me, Ymir?
1DI0027156	Hey... uhm... Ymir. How's it going?
1DI0027157	Hail, Ymir.
1DI0027158	Ymir...
1DI0027161	Hey, you're back. You get anything good?
1DI0027162	You caught anything lately?
1DI0027163	How'd that roundup go?
1DI0027164	How's the meat?
1DI0027165	Hey, how'd it go with that blonde thing you brought in here?
1DI0027166	You went out with Ymir last week, didn't you? Catch anything good?
1DI0027167	Catch any good meat lately?
1DI0027168	Things are quiet around here. We haven't had any good roundups in a while.
1DI0027169	S'up, fool?
1DI0027170	S'up.
1DI0027173	Brother...
1DI0027174	I've been meaning to ask you...
1DI0027175	Got a second?
1DI0027176	So...
1DI0027177	Hey, let me ask you something.
1DI0027178	Father, might I have a word with you?
1DI0027179	I need to speak with you, Father.
1DI0027180	Elder Lyons, SIR!
1DI0027181	Elder on deck!
1DI0027182	Elder Lyons...
1DI0027183	Damn, Dusky. You're a beast with that rifle.
1DI0027184	Goddamn, Dusk. Pretty good shootin'.
1DI0027185	Hey hey, Dusky. How's it going?
1DI0027186	How's it comin' along, Dusky?
1DI0027187	Initiate waiting for orders, sir!
1DI0027188	Initiate reporting, Sir Dusk!
1DI0027189	Knight Captain Dusk, Sir!
1DI0027190	Damn robot. Worst bedside manner ever.
1DI0027191	Scribe Bowditch. I'd like to hear your report on those latest armor modifications.
1DI0027192	Hail, Scribe Bowditch. All is well with your work?
1DI0027193	Scribe Bowditch, I trust you are well. I'm here for your progress report on the modified Recon Armor.
1DI0027194	Hail to you, Scribe Bowditch.
1DI0027195	Hail, Scribe Bowditch.
1DI0027196	Scribe Peabody. How does the day find you?
1DI0027197	Hello, Scribe Peabody. I trust that things are well with you?
1DI0027198	Hail, Scribe Peabody. I trust that your research goes well.
1DI0027199	Hail, Scribe Peabody.
1DI0027200	Hail to you, Scribe Peabody.
1DI0027201	Rothchild, a word please.
1DI0027202	If you have a moment, Scribe Rothchild...
1DI0027203	Scribe Rothchild, sir.
1DI0027204	Hail, Scribe Rothchild.
1DI0027205	Hail to you, Scribe Rothchild.
1DI0027206	Sir Scribe.
1DI0027207	Sentinel Lyons, ma'am!
1DI0027208	Watch it, Squire.
1DI0027209	Don't you have somewhere to be, Squire?
1DI0027210	Step lively, Squire.
1DI0027211	Hail, Star Paladin, sir.
1DI0027212	Star Paladin Cross, sir!
1DI0027213	I saw that you completed your tests. What results are you seeing?
1DI0027214	Scribe Rothchild wants a report on your tests. Have your results posted?
1DI0027215	Switches are showing green. Ambulatory systems look good.
1DI0027216	The weapons systems are showing red on startup. We'll have to spend the rest of the day scrubbing the system before we can try again.
1DI0027217	There's been a shutdown in the port shoulder systems -- looks like the gyros are locked up again. It'll take a few hours to clean it out.
1DI0027218	There's a problem in the cooling system. I'm not sure what it is, but I'll take a look.
1DI0027219	I made a little bit of progress with Prime's locomotion capacitor, but now his IFF system is, um... unpredictable.
1DI0027220	I have those results you asked for. I sent them over to your station.
1DI0027221	Scribe Rothchild wanted those AMS tests done right away, so I went ahead and handled it for you.
1DI0027223	The Brotherhood is at your service.
1DI0027224	You honor us with your presence here.
1DI0027225	Need something, friend?
1DI0027226	So what's the latest report?
1DI0027227	What was the result of the latest scan?
1DI0027229	Well? What's your tactical appraisal of our situation?
1DI0027231	Oh, another soul to add to my circle of darkness.
1DI0027232	Looks like the muties missed one.
1DI0027233	Oh, great, another person trying to kill us all off.
1DI0027234	Someone new in town? You aren't from Lamplight.
1DI0027235	Welcome to my clinic. If you're hurt, then you're in the right place.
1DI0027236	Hey there. Are you hurt?
1DI0027237	The Wastelander from Germantown. How's life treating you?
1DI0027238	Here to help me out again?
1DI0027239	Hey, look at me. I'm in Big Town!
1DI0027240	You saved my life. Thank you.
1DI0027241	I've got the best whores in the Wasteland. The two of them are going to break my bed springs some day. Hah ha!
1DI0027242	Aren't my party girls sweet? I just want to eat them like candy. Ha ha!
1DI0027243	I don't have my Cherry pie any more. That bitch ran away.
1DI0027244	My women are dead. I'm gonna have to get me some new ones.
1DI0027245	Hey, let's get wasted. I mean really stinking drunk. Ha ha!
1DI0027246	Hey, sexy, let's get wasted. I mean really stinking drunk. Hah ha! If you're lucky I might let you hold onto my love handle. Hah ha!
1DI0027247	You've got a smokin' bod, sugar pie. How about letting old Dukov rock you to sleep, if you know what I mean? Hah ha!
1DI0027248	If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your gun in it's holster.
1DI0027249	Well, aren't you looking fine?
1DI0027250	Hello, sugar.
1DI0027251	Are you still here?
1DI0027252	Hi there, big boy.
1DI0027253	Whatcha doing, honey?
1DI0027254	Are you planning on moving in, or what?
1DI0027255	We should call this the wasted land, not the Wasteland! Ha, ha! Come on, Cherry. Let's get wasted out here.
1DI0027256	Cherry! Oh, you are looking fine, my Cherry pie! I'm gonna have me a piece of pie for dessert tonight! Ha ha!
1DI0027257	I'm thirsty. How about a drink, Cherry. I'm planning on getting totally plastered tonight, so what I need now is a drink.
1DI0027258	Hey baby, I'm paying you to entertain me. So keep a smile on that pretty face and get me a drink.
1DI0027259	I'm bored. We should get naked and do it in the fountain!
1DI0027260	I like the way you jiggle Fantasia! Maybe later tonight you can come to Papa, if you know what I mean! Hah ha!
1DI0027261	You aren't nearly wasted enough Fantasia. Come on, drink up. We're gonna get real liquored up tonight! Hah ha!
1DI0027262	Fantasia, if you want to earn your keep, you've got to keep me happy. And you know what makes me happy, baby! Ha ha!
1DI0027263	God, it stinks out here. Can't we go inside, Dukey?
1DI0027264	Dukey, you promised to take me to Rivet City to go shopping.
1DI0027265	I think I've had too much to drink, Dukey. I'm going to be sick.
1DI0027266	I'm so fucking sore today. Can't we just sit out here and get drunk, Dukey?
1DI0027267	Dukey, honey, can your Fantasia have the night off?
1DI0027268	How about making it just you and I tonight? Let Cherry sleep by herself for once.
1DI0027269	Smells like shit out here. Why the hell do we have to live right on the river?
1DI0027270	That bastard just about wore me out last night. Can you try and talk him into giving me the night off?
1DI0027271	I don't know how much longer I can do this, Fantasia. If I get the chance, I'm going to try and get to Rivet City.
1DI0027272	I wish he'd get us some regular clothes. It cold out here dressed like this.
1DI0027273	We're running low on liquor. Dukey is going to have to go out for supplies sometime next week.
1DI0027274	We need a new mattress. The one we have is shot.
1DI0027275	You have my vote, Mister President.
1DI0027276	That election is getting pretty close, huh?
1DI0027277	Who are you going to vote for, Bob?
1DI0027278	Hey Jessica, you excited about the election?
1DI0027279	Hey Shawna, did you do the early voting?
1DI0027280	Isn't election time so much fun, Mary?
1DI0027281	Rachael, can you believe you're almost old enough to vote?
1DI0027282	Who would you vote for if you were old enough, Flower?
1DI0027283	Don't you just love election time, Ralph?
1DI0027284	Hello Mister President.
1DI0027285	Hi, Mister President.
1DI0027286	How's my first lady doing today?
1DI0027287	Hi Mary.  I mean Flower.  Rachael!
1DI0027288	Rachael, come play with me!
1DI0027289	Ralphie, you wanna play?
1DI0027290	Tag!  You're it, Ralphie!
1DI0027291	Come on Mary, let's go play!
1DI0027292	Hello Rosie.
1DI0027293	Get out of my way.
1DI0027294	Don't make me shoot you, Rosie.
1DI0027295	Excuse you.
1DI0027296	Hey, go clean up after the Brahmin.  It's your turn.
1DI0027297	Man, the Brahmin smell awful today.
1DI0027298	Ugh, another foreigner in the Republic.
1DI0027299	We have someone new in my Republic.
1DI0027300	Hey there. Are you gonna play Republic with us?
1DI0027301	I'm Dave's wife, so don't even think about trying anything...
1DI0027302	A Wastelander! Like in the stories about Dave!
1DI0027303	Welcome to the Museum of Dave!
1DI0027304	Have you heard about Dave, lady?
1DI0027305	Have you heard about Dave, mister?
1DI0027306	You're almost as big as Dave.
1DI0027307	Hi there, honey. Have you spoken to Dave?
1DI0027308	Well hello there, sweeheart.
1DI0027309	Hello there, Junior.
1DI0027310	Hello there, Junior, sweetheart. It's a lovely day, isn't it?
1DI0027311	Hey there, Junior!
1DI0027312	How's it going, sport?
1DI0027313	Hey there, little buddy!
1DI0027314	Mmmm... dinner smells delicious, honey!
1DI0027315	There's my honey pie!
1DI0027316	Honeypie, can I talk to you?
1DI0027317	Hi, Mrs. Smith!
1DI0027318	Dinner smells great, mom!
1DI0027319	Room's all clean, mom!
1DI0027320	Dammit, woman...
1DI0027321	This place is a mess. Can't you do something about it?
1DI0027322	Dinner is late. Again.
1DI0027323	I noticed some smudges in the bathroom. Take care of it.
1DI0027324	Mrs Wilson...
1DI0027325	I love you, Mommy!
1DI0027326	My room is all clean, Mommy!
1DI0027327	Hello, Mr. Harris.
1DI0027328	I'm worried about something, Bill.
1DI0027329	William, we need to talk about something.
1DI0027330	Mommy says that it's almost time for dinner!
1DI0027331	I saw you napping, daddy!
1DI0027332	Hi there, daddy!
1DI0027333	Hi, Bill.
1DI0027334	Hello, Bill.
1DI0027335	I can't find Mortimer. I think he got out of his box.
1DI0027336	Remember, dad. We're gonna play catch later.
1DI0027337	Hey dad, have you seen my... oh, never mind. There it is.
1DI0027338	Hey, dad.
1DI0027339	Mr. Smith...
1DI0027340	You're going to love what I'm cooking tonight, dear!
1DI0027341	Oh, what a handsome man I landed!
1DI0027342	Honey...
1DI0027343	Hello, Jack.
1DI0027344	Hi, Jack.
1DI0027345	Uh oh, Jenny. Look at you. The boys better watch out!
1DI0027346	Hey there, Jenny, sweetheart. Looking gorgeous as usual.
1DI0027347	Hi there, honey. Don't you look precious today?
1DI0027348	Jenny, you look beautiful today! You're like a little doll!
1DI0027349	Jenny, honey, you look so cute in that dress.
1DI0027350	Heya, Jenny.
1DI0027351	Hey, stranger. C'mon over here, I'd like to talk to you about something.
1DI0027352	What... who are you?
1DI0027353	Why are you still here? Go!
1DI0027354	Are you crazy? Get out of here!
1DI0027355	Don't be fooled by them!
1DI0027356	It's a fine day, isn't it?
1DI0027357	Glorious day, isn't it?
1DI0027358	Well, hello there!
1DI0027360	Welcome to Andale!
1DI0027361	The good Lord made Andale for days like today.
1DI0027362	<yawns> I could use a nap.

1DI0027367	Sit. Drink. Pay. It'll make you feel better.
1DI0027368	Come human, come drown your sorrows.
1DI0027369	Excellent. Another customer.
1DI0027370	We don't get a lot of humans in here...
1DI0027371	Do you need a room?
1DI0027372	Welcome to my place.
1DI0027373	Welcome, visitor.
1DI0027374	Assessing threat...
1DI0027375	Scanning...
1DI0027379	Humans have such strange anatomy.
1DI0027380	Do you need my help?
1DI0027381	Do you need something?
1DI0027383	You need somthin', hon?
1DI0027384	You gonna stare, or are you gonna order?
1DI0027385	This'd better be important.
1DI0027386	Make it fast, human.
1DI0027387	What is it, human?
1DI0027388	Bugger off, ye bastards bugger off... ye'll get nae more this evenin'.... how's it go?
1DI0027389	<drunken muttering>
1DI0027390	<hic>
1DI0027391	Oh, hello there!
1DI0027392	Oh... we hardly ever get humans down here these days...
1DI0027394	Do you want to hear a story about the Wastes?
1DI0027395	Welcome to Underworld Outfitters!
1DI0027396	We'll accept caps from anyone, even a human.
1DI0027397	Can I help you, smoothskin?
1DI0027398	You'd look great in some Leather Armor.
1DI0027399	You here to buy, or just looking around?
1DI0027400	Scrap metal is in short supply around here.
1DI0027401	I sure could use some of that scrap metal.
1DI0027402	Everything around here... always busted...
1DI0027403	...can't ever get ahead...
1DI0027404	You need something, smoothskin?
1DI0027405	I got work to do, so if you need something, spit it out.
1DI0027406	About time someone did that.
1DI0027407	Bastard got what was coming to him.
1DI0027408	I... I thought Charon liked Ahzrukhal!
1DI0027409	Jesus, what did Ahzrukhal do?
1DI0027410	Oh my God, is he dead?
1DI0027411	Did you see that!?
1DI0027412	Yeah, what is it?
1DI0027413	Damn smoothskins...
1DI0027414	See? We're not so bad.
1DI0027415	It could happen to you, you know.
1DI0027416	What? Never seen a Ghoul before?
1DI0027417	What're you staring at?
1DI0027418	...think you're so pretty...
1DI0027419	...mmm... ...so smooth and soft...
1DI0027421	<belches> ... mmm... 'scuse me...
1DI0027422	<belches> ... tasted better going down...
1DI0027423	<hocks something up>
1DI0027424	<coughs>
1DI0027426	<coughs> ...terrible air down here...
1DI0027427	<wheezing cough>
1DI0027428	<clears throat>
1DI0027432	Phew... you smell that?
1DI0027433	Don't let the smell get to you.
1DI0027434	This is our town. You'd best be careful.
1DI0027435	...think you own the place...
1DI0027438	Just try not to kill anyone while you're here.
1DI0027439	Don't mess with us, we won't mess with you.
1DI0027440	Ahzrukhal, boy, I want to talk to you.
1DI0027441	Boy, you and I need to talk.
1DI0027442	Ahzrukhal, boy, I need to talk to you.
1DI0027443	Oh, oh! Mr Ahzrukhal, I want to ask you something.
1DI0027444	Oh, hey... Mr. <coughs> .... Mr. Ahzrukhal... hi.
1DI0027445	Hey, Mr. Ahzrukhal...
1DI0027446	Mr. Ahzrukhal...
1DI0027447	Excuse me, Mr. Ahzrukhal...
1DI0027448	Mr. Ahzrukhal.
1DI0027449	Hello, Ahzrukhal.
1DI0027450	Ahzrukhal...
1DI0027451	Carol, why don't you get some rest? You look so tired.
1DI0027452	Why don't you go get some sleep, Carol. I can manage things up here for a while.
1DI0027453	Hey, are you okay? You're not looking so good.
1DI0027454	Carol, honey, I'm worried about you. Are you alright?
1DI0027455	Hey, Carol. You okay? You don't look so good.
1DI0027456	Hi, Carol.
1DI0027457	Hello, Carol. It's been pretty quiet around here lately.
1DI0027458	Hi, Carol. You know, things seem a little quiet around here.
1DI0027459	Carol...
1DI0027460	Dammit... it was attached a second ago... Hey! Robot! You seen any, you know, toes around here?
1DI0027461	Hey, robot, have you seen any toes laying around here?
1DI0027462	All clear, Cerberus?
1DI0027463	Have you seen anything unusual, Cerberus?
1DI0027464	Cerberus, run your diagnostic program. Code 662-847-B.
1DI0027465	Cerberus, you're still making that god awful noise. Go ahead and run that diagnostic program. Code 662-847-B.
1DI0027466	Why, hello there, Cerberus.
1DI0027467	Cerberus! How are you? Programming holding up?
1DI0027468	Charon. Charon! Look at me when I'm talking to you!
1DI0027470	Charon... come here. I want to talk to you about something...
1DI0027471	Charon. Come here. Now.
1DI0027472	Hey, Charon...
1DI0027473	I was wondering something...
1DI0027474	Hey... uh... Charon, is it? I was...
1DI0027475	Good to see you, Doctor Barrows.
1DI0027476	Hey there, Doc.
1DI0027477	Doc Barrows! Good to see you!
1DI0027478	If it isn't ol' Doc Barrows. Hey there, Doc!
1DI0027479	Doctor Barrows...
1DI0027480	Greta, bring me some of that slop that you call food.
1DI0027481	Greta, bring me something. Preferably something dead this time. And not glowing.
1DI0027482	Hey, Greta, can I get a drink?
1DI0027483	I'm thirsty, Greta.
1DI0027484	Greta, I have a thirst.
1DI0027485	Greta, you got a second? I wanted a drink.
1DI0027486	Hey Greta, can I get a drink?
1DI0027487	I need a drink, Greta.
1DI0027488	Greta, I'm still sober. Fix it, please.
1DI0027489	Brains... I mean "food". I'm hungry, Greta.
1DI0027490	Well, I'm not dead yet, so I might as well eat something.
1DI0027491	I want some food.
1DI0027492	Greta, can I get some food over here?
1DI0027493	Greta, can you get me something to eat?
1DI0027494	I'm starving, Greta. Help me out here.
1DI0027495	Nng. Hungry.
1DI0027496	Heya, Greta.
1DI0027497	Morning, Greta.
1DI0027498	Nice night, huh, Greta?
1DI0027499	Greta...
1DI0027500	Hello, Mister Crowley.
1DI0027501	Mister Crowley, hello!
1DI0027502	Good to see you, Mister Crowley!
1DI0027503	Hello, Mister Crowley! Nice day, isn't it?
1DI0027504	Mister Crowley...
1DI0027505	Patches. Patches! Hey, buddy, stay with me here for a second. We need to talk.
1DI0027506	Hey, Patches. Patchwork, man. Pay attention, I need to talk to you.
1DI0027507	Everything alright there, Patches? You don't look so good.
1DI0027508	Heya, Patches. You alright, buddy? You're not lookin' so good.
1DI0027509	Hey, Patchwork. How're you holding together?
1DI0027510	Patchwork, buddy, how are you holding up?
1DI0027511	Hey, Patchwork... whoa there, be careful. Are you okay?
1DI0027512	Hello, Patchwork.
1DI0027513	Patchwork...
1DI0027514	Quinn, no one told me you were back!
1DI0027515	Hey, Quinn.
1DI0027516	Quinn...
1DI0027517	Hey there, Tulip.
1DI0027518	Hi, Tulip!
1DI0027519	Tulip...
1DI0027520	Hey, Winthrop. How's it going?
1DI0027521	Hey, I wanted to tell you, Patchwork got drunk last week and left his booze in the air filter...
1DI0027522	Winthrop, I was wondering if you could take a look at the generator down in the common area...
1DI0027523	Heya, Winthrop. You got a second?
1DI0027524	Winthrop...
1DI0027525	How's everything? Enjoying your drinks?
1DI0027526	Yes, yes, how is everyone doing? Everything alright? Do you need anything else?
1DI0027527	Hey, hon. Do you need anything?
1DI0027528	Do you need anything else?
1DI0027529	Hello, Citizen!
1DI0027530	Greetings!
1DI0027531	This place is going to shit, have you noticed?
1DI0027532	You know, Winthrop does his best -- he's a great mechanic, but he just can't keep up. This place is falling apart!
1DI0027533	Winthrop needs some help. I mean, it's not like he has any time to train anyone to fix this shit around here.
1DI0027534	Every day, there's something new: the generators go down, the water has funk in it, the air filters die...
1DI0027535	The air is off in the common house again. It stinks of sweaty death down there. I swear, every day it's something new.
1DI0027536	Carol's changed at lot lately. Have you noticed? She's more... quiet.
1DI0027537	Carol just seems so sad these days...
1DI0027538	Carol used to love this place, now it's like she hardly even cares. Have you noticed that?
1DI0027539	Did you hear that?
1DI0027540	That sound just won't stop. Do you hear that?
1DI0027541	Hey, did I tell you about... wait... do you hear that?
1DI0027542	Do you smell something strange?
1DI0027543	I keep smelling this strange smell... it's like... onions. You remember onions? Yeah. It's like that. Do you smell it?
1DI0027544	What the hell is that smell? I mean, it's not bad, it's just... I don't know... do you smell that?
1DI0027545	Have you tried the new whisky he's stocking? It's... it's something special...
1DI0027546	This drink is foul. And that's a Ghoul calling something foul.
1DI0027547	Oh man... this is nasty, but it does the job.
1DI0027548	This vodka really sucks.
1DI0027549	Have you tried this? It isn't good, but it's strong.
1DI0027550	Christ, the beer in this place tastes like piss...
1DI0027551	You know, the cider isn't half bad... for malted rat piss.
1DI0027552	This stuff tastes like Centaur piss.
1DI0027553	...buncha goddamn worthless walking corpses...
1DI0027554	Jesus Christ... 123 years... what's the fucking point?
1DI0027555	Some days, I just wish that someone would come through here and put a bullet in all of our heads...
1DI0027556	Nothing but pain and misery...
1DI0027557	There's got to be something more than this...
1DI0027558	Yeah, I'm just a drunk zombie... what good am I?
1DI0027559	The best I can hope for is that the liquor kills me before some mutated beast turns me into a snack.
1DI0027560	If there were a God, I'd pray for death.
1DI0027561	All I ask is to go quietly. And soon.
1DI0027568	Hey, you. What's new?
1DI0027569	Hey, man. What's happening?
1DI0027570	Long time, no see. What's going on with you?
1DI0027572	It's been a while, what've you been up to?
1DI0027575	What's the word?
1DI0027576	What've you heard?
1DI0027577	You'll, uh, um, need help with the barricades soon, right Pappy?
1DI0027578	Kimba, um, I heard you helped bandage me up when I was on the table. Uh, thank you.
1DI0027579	I was thinking of hitting patrol again soon, Flash.
1DI0027580	Hey Sticky, um, uh, what do you think of Big Town?
1DI0027581	I wonder if someone should work on the barricades again.
1DI0027582	Hey, Red, can I stop by the clinic later? You know, just in case?
1DI0027583	Timebomb, I heard you got hurt. Wow... What does it feel like?
1DI0027584	Hey, Flash. Patrolling sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe I could come out with you.
1DI0027585	Do you have any idea of what I can do in town, Shorty?
1DI0027586	Hey there, Pappy. I was out trying to gather food. Did you know there's not much food out here in the Wastes?
1DI0027587	Hey there, Kimba. Is there anything I can do around town?
1DI0027588	Hey, Red. Is there anything I can do around town to help out?
1DI0027589	Sticky, it's about time you learned that I'm in charge here.
1DI0027590	I think I should be mayor of this town, Kimba...
1DI0027591	I don't like the looks of the barricades, Pappy. Why don't you redo them?
1DI0027592	Timebomb, since you insist on staying alive, why don't you make yourself useful and help me reset the barricades.
1DI0027593	You don't go far out enough on your patrol, Flash. A real patrol would cover a solid half-mile radius.
1DI0027594	I'm telling you, Red, just let me run everything. I'll get those barricades twice as high!
1DI0027595	Bittercup, make sure you're paying attention out on patrol. There are dangerous people out there.
1DI0027596	Hey, Flash. How are you feeling? Any calluses from stroking that new gun of yours?
1DI0027597	How are you feeling, Timebomb? Are those stitches holding together?
1DI0027598	There's my Sticky! How are you doing?
1DI0027599	Hey, Pappy. How's that wound on your arm?
1DI0027600	Shorty, I want to gather everyone together soon about setting up the barricades higher. I'd really appreciate your, uh,  expertise.
1DI0027601	Kimba, could you help me out with Pappy? It's just... He's been so glum lately.
1DI0027602	Hey Kimba, thanks for offering to help me in the clinic.
1DI0027603	How are you feeling, Timebomb?
1DI0027604	Hey there, Sticky.
1DI0027605	How are the patrols going, Flash? Are we still safe?
1DI0027606	God, I miss Lamplight. Those were the days...
1DI0027607	I wonder how the Lamplighters are doing...
1DI0027608	Hey, Red. Do you need any help washing bandages later?
1DI0027609	Hey Shorty. How's our favorite little guy doing?
1DI0027610	How are you doing, Pappy?
1DI0027611	Hey, Sticky. Keep your stickiness away from me and my new gun. This is a Sticky-free zone!
1DI0027612	Timebomb! How're you doing? I thought you were dead for sure!
1DI0027613	Hey Shorty, you should come with me on patrol. The Raiders will never see you coming.
1DI0027614	Hey Red, can I stop by the clinic later? I feel a bit sick.
1DI0027615	Wow, you should have seen me on patrol, Kimba, I was all "bang-bang-bang." I must have killed a hundred Raiders!
1DI0027616	Have you seen my new gun, Pappy? It's awesome! Bad-Ass.
1DI0027617	Did you see anything on patrol, Bittercup?
1DI0027618	Red, have you got a sec? It's about this wound on my arm.
1DI0027619	We're all going to die here. There's no way we can survive out here in this mess.
1DI0027620	Hey there, Kimba.
1DI0027621	What do you think of the barricades, Shorty?
1DI0027622	Hey, Timebomb. You look like you're going to fall over dead.
1DI0027623	Never thought you'd make it, Sticky. Out of everyone who died trying to get here from Lamplight, we get you.
1DI0027624	Anything out there, Flash? The Super Mutants and Raiders are coming back soon, aren't they?
1DI0027625	What are you supposed to actually do if you ever find something on patrol, huh? Scare them off with that rusty pistol of yours?
1DI0027626	At least we made it another day, right?
1DI0027627	I haven't slept in weeks.
1DI0027628	Those assholes in Lamplight said that this place was great.
1DI0027629	I hate it here.
1DI0027630	This place gets worse all the time.
1DI0027631	Remember to keep an eye on the north.
1DI0027632	Trading caps for crap, step right up!
1DI0027633	Got some junk to unload? I'm buying!
1DI0027634	Welcome, friend. Looking for more appropriate attire?
1DI0027635	The spirits told me you'd be coming. And that you're looking to buy.
1DI0027636	Here for a pick-me-up?
1DI0027637	If you've got the caps, I've got your fix.
1DI0027638	Here to pick up a few of my marvelous toys?
1DI0027639	Fear not, for Lucky Harith is here to offer you protection for a price!
1DI0027640	Looking to make a trade?
1DI0027641	Searching for that special something?
1DI0027642	Hello, there!
1DI0027643	How do?
1DI0027645	'Scuse me!
1DI0027649	No need to look so nervous... right?
1DI0027650	<snort>
1DI0027651	Hey, move.
1DI0027652	Morning, sleepyhead! Sleep well, boy?
1DI0027653	Rise and shine! How was your night, my boy?
1DI0027654	Day go well for you, my boy?
1DI0027655	Evening! Get a lot of work done today, boy?
1DI0027656	How're you doing, boy? Is everything all right?
1DI0027657	Hello, Dom. Everyone behaving themselves?
1DI0027658	Dom. Any news I should be worried about?
1DI0027659	Go away!
1DI0027660	Umm... Hi, miss. I mean, Machete. Things okay with the, umm, guarding?
1DI0027661	Hey, Machete. You on guard? I mean, of course you are. I mean, umm, never mind.
1DI0027662	Hey, Derek. You did some fine work out there with those Brahmin.
1DI0027663	Derek, been hearing good things about your work with the traders. Way to go, man.
1DI0027664	Eating right? Hope so.
1DI0027665	Ernest, the good news is we ain't dead, yet.
1DI0027666	Ernest, I've seen worse nights. But we aren't dead yet, and that's always a good sign.
1DI0027667	Hey, Machete. Report in. You see anything odd out there?
1DI0027668	Machete, what's the word from your watch?
1DI0027669	All clear out there, captain, sir!
1DI0027670	Nothing I couldn't handle, captain, sir!
1DI0027671	So many failures. Must try more.
1DI0027672	Must guard the birth place.
1DI0027673	Need more stuff to make more us.
1DI0027674	Fox talks too much.
1DI0027675	Must find the Human.
1DI0027676	Stupid small Humans, not enough meat.
1DI0027677	Check the top place.
1DI0027678	Keep lookout. Human is here.
1DI0027679	Stupid Fawkes! Talks like the Humans!
1DI0027680	Begone from this place, blasphemer!
1DI0027681	Oasis is no longer a refuge for you, Outsider.
1DI0027682	You stupid-head! I can't believe you mouthed off to the Tree Father.
1DI0027683	You're no longer welcome here.
1DI0027684	Leave us and never look back, Outsider.
1DI0027685	Such a shame, you could have been of great benefit to us.
1DI0027686	It's time for you to leave.
1DI0027688	Is something amiss?
1DI0027689	We'll begin as soon as the rest of the Treeminders have taken their places.
1DI0027691	I can't believe you're here!
1DI0027692	All will be answered soon, my friend.
1DI0027693	Welcome, Outsider... welcome to Oasis!
1DI0027694	I hate you! I hate you!
1DI0027695	Ah, Outsider... back again I see.
1DI0027696	It's good to see you again, Outsider.
1DI0027697	We welcome you always with outstretched arms.
1DI0027698	Hello again, Outsider.
1DI0027699	Oasis is no more.
1DI0027700	It can't be... it just can't be!
1DI0027701	The Great One is dead!
1DI0027703	We are lost!
1DI0027704	Tree Father and Leaf Mother have conferred with the Great One. Something important must have happened.
1DI0027705	Our leaders have spoken with the Great One. I hope nothing's wrong.
1DI0027707	I feel a change in the air. I wonder what it could be.
1DI0027708	You're a guest among us and quite welcome, Outsider.
1DI0027709	Cast aside your bits of technology and marvel at His miracles, Outsider.
1DI0027710	Revel, Outsider. You are under His protection.
1DI0027711	There's nowhere like this left in the world anymore, eh Outsider?
1DI0027712	This place is wonderful, isn't it?
1DI0027713	Hello, Outsider! It's very nice to see you!
1DI0027717	We welcome you with outstretched arms.
1DI0027718	Welcome to Oasis, Outsider.
1DI0027719	We're very pleased to see you, Outsider.
1DI0027721	I was wondering if we could speak a moment.
1DI0027723	You look quite troubled, my darling. What's on your mind?
1DI0027724	And how are we doing today?
1DI0027725	Hey there, how's it going?
1DI0027726	How's life treating ya?
1DI0027727	Well hey there, cutie... how's it hangin'?
1DI0027728	Well hey there, sweetie... how's tricks?
1DI0027729	How very nice to make your acquaintance. I'm your new Robobutler.
1DI0027730	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you utilitze your infirmary?
1DI0027731	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you seek medical attention as soon as possible?
1DI0027732	You appear to have been wounded, madame. May I suggest you utilitze your infirmary?
1DI0027733	It appears you've been wounded, madame. May I suggest you seek medical attention as soon as possible?
1DI0027734	I hope things are going well for you today, sir.
1DI0027735	I hope things are going well for you today, madame.
1DI0027736	Welcome home, sir.
1DI0027737	Welcome home, madame.
1DI0027738	It's good to see you alive and well, sir.
1DI0027739	It's good to see you alive and well, madame.
1DI0027740	You got the stuff, I got the caps. A match made in heaven.
1DI0027741	All my equipment is ready. Just need some Sugar Bombs.
1DI0027742	Ah. You're back. Good...
1DI0027743	Whoa, who the hell are you?
1DI0027744	So what's the deal, smoothskin?
1DI0027745	Goddamn are you one ugly son-of-a-bitch!
1DI0027746	Keep it moving, meat.
1DI0027747	Yeah? You got somethin' to say?
1DI0027748	No one messes with Sudden-Death Overtime. No one.
1DI0027749	Damn, poor Mercier. He was a good Winger.
1DI0027750	Whew... it's hot in this mask.
1DI0027751	Hey. You. Yeah, you. I don't like the look you're givin' me. Keep it up and I'll break your fuckin' head open.
1DI0027752	Hey, what'd I tell you about lookin' at me like that? Are you in the mood for a busted mouth or something?
1DI0027753	You'd best point those peepers somewhere else before I tear 'em out of your skull.
1DI0027754	Did you hear about those newbies? The ones who who went up north lookin' for raids?
1DI0027755	Oh, hey. Check this out. You know those rookie idiots that tried to head up north?
1DI0027756	You heard anything?
1DI0027757	What's goin' on over here?
1DI0027758	Que pasa?
1DI0027759	What's happenin'?
1DI0027763	What's new?
1DI0027767	What do you need, sir?
1DI0027768	Hello, sir.
1DI0027770	Squire.
1DI0027771	Sir Knight.
1DI0027772	Paladin.
1DI0027773	Sentinel. What can I do for you?
1DI0027774	Hello, Elder.
1DI0027775	Have a nice day.
1DI0027778	Move along, please.
1DI0027779	How may I serve you, master?
1DI0027780	How may I serve you, mistress?
1DI0027781	Another glorious day in this man's army!
1DI0027782	Great, here's some of the local wildlife.
1DI0027783	Back off, local.
1DI0027784	You're not involved in this. You want to keep it that way.
1DI0027785	Good to see you're holding up alright.
1DI0027786	Watch your back and keep your batteries dry out there.
1DI0027787	What are you lookin' at?
1DI0027789	Talk!
1DI0027791	If you're gonna talk, talk!
1DI0027794	You're funny looking.
1DI0027795	Are you talking to me?
1DI0027796	Um. Yeah. Please go away.
1DI0027797	Hi. How are you today?
1DI0027800	Hey. Anything going on?
1DI0027801	Howdy mister.
1DI0027802	Hi there, miss.
1DI0027805	Hi there.
1DI0027811	Welcome to Tenpenny Tower.
1DI0027812	Charmed, I'm sure...
1DI0027813	Ah, hello!
1DI0027819	Nice to see you. Doing well, I hope?
1DI0027820	How are things?
1DI0027821	And how are you this fine day?
1DI0027823	Don't push your luck, punk.
1DI0027825	Don't mess with the Tunnel Snakes!
1DI0027826	You'll get yours eventually, spaz.
1DI0027827	It's going to be fun paying you back for that.
1DI0027828	Hey, cut it out!
1DI0027829	Ow! That hurts, you know!
1DI0027830	That wasn't very nice.
1DI0027831	Come on, stop that.
1DI0027832	Don't do that again. Last warning.
1DI0027835	Hey, shoot at the targets, okay? That's not a toy!
1DI0027836	Careful with that, sport!
1DI0027837	Whoa, that stings!
1DI0027838	Ow!
1DI0027839	This is your last warning before I kill you.
1DI0027840	Once more and I'm going to have to kill you.
1DI0027844	Cut that out!
1DI0027845	I'm on your side!
1DI0027846	What do you think you're doing?
1DI0027847	Careful with that!
1DI0027848	Son, I brought you into this world. I think you know the rest.
1DI0027849	Honey, I brought you into this world. I think you know the rest.
1DI0027850	Aggh! What in God's name is wrong with you?
1DI0027851	Stop screwing around!
1DI0027852	Ugh!
1DI0027854	Ooomf!
1DI0027855	Ooogh!
1DI0027856	Get it off me!
1DI0027858	Help! Roaches!
1DI0027859	Oh my God, someone help me!
1DI0027860	Aaaaah!
1DI0027861	Help! Aaaaaah!
1DI0027862	Oh please help me!
1DI0027863	Get them away from me!
1DI0027864	Get away, you filthy thing!
1DI0027865	Ow! That hurts!
1DI0027866	Butchie! Help me!
1DI0027868	Aaagh!
1DI0027869	Aaah! Stop it!
1DI0027871	You're going to regret that.
1DI0027874	Ow! Quit it!
1DI0027876	Aah!
1DI0027878	Quit it!
1DI0027879	That hurts!
1DI0027880	Stop!
1DI0027883	Ahh!
1DI0027884	Ooof!
1DI0027887	I'm hit!
1DI0027889	Damn!
1DI0027890	Dad!
1DI0027891	Alarm!
1DI0027893	My leg!
1DI0027894	My arm!
1DI0027895	My eyes!
1DI0027897	Medic!
1DI0027898	Taking fire!
1DI0027900	Head hurt!
1DI0027901	Arm hurt!
1DI0027902	Leg hit!
1DI0027904	Oof!
1DI0027909	Paaaaiiinn!
1DI0027910	You pay for that!
1DI0027911	Aggh! Wounded!
1DI0027912	Ug!
1DI0027914	Yah!
1DI0027919	Fuck!
1DI0027922	My fuckin' head!
1DI0027924	Agh! My leg!
1DI0027925	Uuggh!
1DI0027929	My head...
1DI0027931	Arm's hit!
1DI0027932	Leg's hit!
1DI0027934	Uggh!
1DI0027938	Aggh! It's called Power Armor for a reason, freak!
1DI0027940	Bzzt.
1DI0027943	Vvvvzzz.
1DI0027947	Blood! Aaah!
1DI0027953	You think that'll stop a Tunnel Snake?
1DI0027955	Oh, man!
1DI0027956	You're asking for it, pal!
1DI0027957	Hey, asshole, no fair fighting back!
1DI0027958	Don't you know who you're dealing with? I'm Butch, punk!
1DI0027959	You are in so much trouble now!
1DI0027960	Okay, that's it! No more mister nice Butch!
1DI0027961	Oh shit, that hurt!
1DI0027962	What the hell, man?
1DI0027963	That didn't even hurt.
1DI0027964	You're gonna pay for that.
1DI0027965	That the best you got?
1DI0027966	Dammit, that hurts!
1DI0027967	Arg! Shit!
1DI0027968	Can I get some help over here?
1DI0027970	This is preposterous!
1DI0027971	You're just pissing me off!
1DI0027972	Grrrr.
1DI0027973	I just had this suit tailored!
1DI0027978	Oh!
1DI0027998	Hmph!
1DI0028010	Grraa!
1DI0028031	What... what's happening?
1DI0028032	Why's everything all blurry?
1DI0028033	Whoa... what's going on?
1DI0028034	<hacking cough>
1DI0028035	So... thirsty...
1DI0028036	Won't someone please... water...
1DI0028037	I can't take it anymore... please... help me...
1DI0028038	Please... God... so thirsty...
1DI0028039	Rusty old pipe! A fresh coat of paint is just what you need!
1DI0028040	That should just about do it.
1DI0028042	Let's go people. The Overseer's patience is... limited.
1DI0028043	You don't want to be the first class in history to fail the G.O.A.T., do you?
1DI0028044	Take your seats so we can get started.
1DI0028045	Come on, people. Find your seats.
1DI0028046	Let's not keep the Overseer waiting.
1DI0028047	Come on, Freddie! Finish up already.
1DI0028048	Freddie, do you understand what "pencils down" means?
1DI0028049	Freddie, it's multiple choice. You can't really still be thinking about it.
1DI0028050	I don't have all day, Freddie. The Overseer's waiting for these.
1DI0028051	If I ever get my hands on that kid, so help me...
1DI0028052	Anyone could have told him the roaches would swarm if we shut the lights off...
1DI0028053	Damn roaches... where do they keep coming from?
1DI0028054	Please no more roaches.
1DI0028055	I can't believe it. Jonas...
1DI0028056	Lights'll be back on in a few more minutes. Few more minutes.
1DI0028057	What the hell has gotten into the Overseer?
1DI0028058	You won't see the Overseer out on roach patrol.
1DI0028059	I can't believe the Doc went out there. Rather shoot myself in the head.
1DI0028060	Damn that troublemaking doctor.
1DI0028061	It's all the Doc's fault. He never should have opened the door.
1DI0028062	I knew we should've never let him in. Said so at the time.
1DI0028063	Oh my God. Oh my God.
1DI0028064	They're everywhere...
1DI0028065	Please, no more. No more no more no more.
1DI0028066	Got to get a grip on yourself, Gloria. Get a grip.
1DI0028069	Don't get me wrong, I love to cause trouble, but you go too far.
1DI0028070	You've changed. I mean, bad is one thing. Evil is another.
1DI0028071	Did you really have to kill all of those people back there? They didn't seem so bad.
1DI0028072	I always knew that you were a teacher's pet.
1DI0028073	This do-gooder crap is for the birds.
1DI0028074	Man, you're just a little goody two-shoes, aren't you?
1DI0028075	I need some shades or something...
1DI0028076	It's so bright out here.
1DI0028077	Let's get inside. I hate it out here.
1DI0028078	Man. That creeps me out. That thing up there. You know, the sky.
1DI0028079	You're not gonna leave me here, are you?
1DI0028080	Let's head to that place in Rivet City for a drink.
1DI0028081	Being sober really sucks.
1DI0028082	Can we rest or something?
1DI0028083	<coughs> How do people breathe out here?
1DI0028084	Man, I'm all itchy.
1DI0028085	What if someone's following us?
1DI0028086	Do you even know where you're going?
1DI0028087	Are you going the right way?
1DI0028088	This place gives me the creeps.
1DI0028089	Whew. Man, it stinks.
1DI0028090	I heard that there were dragons out here. You ever see one?
1DI0028091	You wanna get out of here?
1DI0028092	What was that noise?
1DI0028093	Hey! Did you hear that?
1DI0028094	Bo-ring.
1DI0028095	Man, it stinks. The vault never smelled like this.
1DI0028098	This place is not safe.
1DI0028099	There may be danger here.
1DI0028102	Be cautious.
1DI0028104	Aww, aren't you cute?
1DI0028105	Can I have a better gun?
1DI0028106	<yawns>
1DI0028107	I wonder what Eulogy is doing...
1DI0028108	This place sucks.
1DI0028109	I'm bored.
1DI0028111	There's not a lot of cash in bein' good, you know.
1DI0028112	I didn't sign on with you so that we could be playing Santa Claus out here.
1DI0028113	What's goin' on here, kid? I thought you were some sort of badass.
1DI0028114	Goddamn cigarettes are getting' harder to find.
1DI0028115	Man... am I out of smokes again?
1DI0028116	I could use a smoke.
1DI0028117	Hang on... just need to catch my breath...
1DI0028118	Goddamn collar on this armor is too tight...
1DI0028121	<coughs> ...is that blood?
1DI0028122	<coughs> Dammit...
1DI0028123	I forgot how fucked up everything was out here.
1DI0028124	Man, I'm glad to finally be away from Megaton.
1DI0028125	It's good to be out here again. Damn good.
1DI0028126	Hey! I found a... dammit. Never mind. It wasn't anything.
1DI0028127	C'mon. Let's get moving.
1DI0028128	What the...? Did I step in something?
1DI0028129	Thought I heard something...
1DI0028130	I think I've been here before.
1DI0028131	Too much open space out here. I don't like it.
1DI0028132	Up there. That's a good fuckin' spot for a sniper. Keep an eye out.
1DI0028133	I hope this place stays standin' long enough for us to leave.
1DI0028134	This floor don't look stable.
1DI0028135	Man, it stinks in here.
1DI0028137	It saddens me to see you behaving in this manner, my friend.
1DI0028138	The path of right action is the way of truth. Perhaps you need a reminder of this.
1DI0028139	You have strayed from your path, my friend.
1DI0028140	There is reason to be cautious here.
1DI0028141	Be aware of our surroundings.
1DI0028142	Though we may seem safe for the moment, it is fleeting.
1DI0028143	There is safety in mindfulness.
1DI0028144	Be aware of the present moment.
1DI0028145	We should be mindful.
1DI0028146	In all things, the calm heart must prevail.
1DI0028147	I'm here, at your back.
1DI0028148	Careful...
1DI0028149	Our steps must be measured.
1DI0028150	The air smells... dangerous.
1DI0028151	There are times that I feel the primal part of me pulling me away.
1DI0028152	We must walk softly.
1DI0028153	It's amazing that people trust you enough not to attack me.
1DI0028154	I'm concerned about this area.
1DI0028156	Sir, searching for targets.
1DI0028157	Scanning, sir...
1DI0028158	Sir, I am on the lookout.
1DI0028160	Your actions have become disturbing to me.
1DI0028161	This is a dangerous game that you play.
1DI0028162	We all stray from our path from time to time. I trust that you will return to yours. Soon.
1DI0028163	Make no mistake. Your father would be proud of what you've done.
1DI0028164	Your father would be proud of you.
1DI0028165	You are a credit to your father.
1DI0028166	You're on point. I shall back you up.
1DI0028167	Watch for signs of trouble.
1DI0028168	Helping the people of the Wasteland is of the utmost to the Lyons Doctrine.
1DI0028169	I've been here before...
1DI0028170	I remember this area.
1DI0028171	There may be hostiles in the area.
1DI0028172	Caution is advised.
1DI0028173	Is this relevant to the mission?
1DI0028174	Vigilance is advised.
1DI0028175	Be vigilant.
1DI0028176	There are no dishes in this house. Please go out and purchase more.
1DI0028177	Laundry is dirty and unfolded. Please purchase a washing machine and ironing board.
1DI0028178	Floors need sweeping. Please purchase broom and vacuum cleaner accessories.
1DI0028179	Damn, machine. Stop floating there and get moving!
1DI0028180	This robot is broken, all right. Damned if I know what to do about it...
1DI0028181	Maybe it's a servo error? Nah, that doesn't make any sense...
1DI0028185	So boring...
1DI0028186	No green stuff here...
1DI0028187	Getting hungry...
1DI0028188	Wish a buckethead would show up... I'd rip his legs clean off...
1DI0028189	<bored grunt>
1DI0028208	Mabel sure does make some wonderful pies. She's a great cook.
1DI0028209	Oh, I was just looking at the new RobCo catalog. Some impressive things they're doing these days.
1DI0028210	I was thinking of having a cookout soon, since the weather has been so wonderful.
1DI0028211	Sure is a beautiful day today.
1DI0028212	Nothing like the smell of apple pie, is there? I can't get enough of it.
1DI0028213	Do I look like I care?
1DI0028215	Come on out, son, I promise I won't hurt you!
1DI0028216	Come on out, miss, I promise I won't hurt you!
1DI0028217	You don't really think you can hide from us, do you?
1DI0028218	We'll find you eventually. You know that, don't you?
1DI0028219	You're only making it worse for yourself by hiding.
1DI0028220	It's all a big mistake! Come with me and we'll figure it out together!
1DI0028221	You better hope I don't find you...
1DI0028222	Hiding is for fools. Show yourself!
1DI0028223	This is foolish. Let's end this!
1DI0028224	Hunh?  Gary?
1DI0028225	Gary-wha?
1DI0028226	Expanding search pattern.
1DI0028227	Switching to pattern zeta-seven-four.
1DI0028228	Still no go on targets.
1DI0028229	Still no sign of target.
1DI0028230	Scope still negative. No tangos.
1DI0028231	Zero targets detected.
1DI0028232	Oh, I know you're here. I'll find you.
1DI0028233	When you turn up, you're dead.
1DI0028234	Come on out... I promise a quick death!
1DI0028235	Only a fuckin' coward hides.
1DI0028236	Scared huh? You should be.
1DI0028237	No need to hide. It'll all be over soon.
1DI0028238	I know you're around here.
1DI0028239	I can smell ya.
1DI0028240	Don't worry... we'll find you soon.
1DI0028241	Here kitty, kitty...
1DI0028242	Come on, asshole. I ain't got all day.
1DI0028243	I hate this cat and mouse crap.
1DI0028244	You're here. You're here... Stop hiding!
1DI0028245	Gonna find you soon, human!
1DI0028246	You have to come out sooner or later.
1DI0028247	You can't hide from me... I can taste your fear!
1DI0028248	Here human, human, human. I got a treat for you!
1DI0028249	Come out, come out wherever you are!
1DI0028250	It's only a matter of time.
1DI0028251	Continuing sweep.
1DI0028252	Target may still be in area.
1DI0028253	Search pattern delta-two.
1DI0028254	Still trying to reacquire hostile.
1DI0028255	I got nothing here.
1DI0028256	Alert. Non-combatant safety cannot be guaranteed.
1DI0028257	Target lock status: red. Continuing perimeter sweep.
1DI0028258	Alert. Hostile remains at large. Recommend non-combatants seek secure location.
1DI0028259	There's no point in trying to hide from me, you know. I've been programmed to be quite relentless.
1DI0028260	Please come back. I'm sorry about all that recent unpleasantness.
1DI0028262	Are you still there?
1DI0028263	Warning. Dangerous fugitive is on the loose. Do not attempt to apprehend.
1DI0028264	Attention. Fugitive should be considered armed and dangerous.
1DI0028265	Continuing search for fugitive.
1DI0028266	You better run, you commie-loving bastard!
1DI0028268	Come on, people, I need a target!
1DI0028269	This is taking time from my experiments.
1DI0028270	Where have you gone?
1DI0028271	You can't hide fwom me fowever.
1DI0028272	Come out, come out, wherever you are!
1DI0028282	I'm going to find you.
1DI0028283	You can't hide from me forever.
1DI0028284	Nothing yet.
1DI0028286	I've got something for you...
1DI0028289	The Overseer said there'd be a bonus for whoever brought you in.
1DI0028290	Here he is!
1DI0028291	Here she is!
1DI0028292	It's coming this way!
1DI0028297	Intruder Located! Contacting Vault-Tec Security!

1DI0028309	I have contact. Weapons hot.
1DI0028310	Positive contact. Firing.

1DI0028338	Tango reacquired!
1DI0028339	Positive ID on lost target acquired!

1DI0028341	Target found! Firing!
1DI0028342	We've got the target!
1DI0028343	Target relocated! Engaging!
1DI0028344	There you are, you little bastard.
1DI0028345	There you are, you little bitch.
1DI0028346	Your time just ran out!
1DI0028347	Fuckin' hide from me? You're dead!
1DI0028348	Ha! Found your sorry ass!
1DI0028349	Thought you could hide?
1DI0028350	Bingo!
1DI0028352	Nice try, amateur.
1DI0028353	Found your sorry ass!
1DI0028354	Playtime's over!
1DI0028356	Aha! Gotcha!
1DI0028357	Nice try!
1DI0028358	Can't escape me!
1DI0028359	I knew it! I'm gonna tear you apart!
1DI0028360	No more hidin' for you!
1DI0028361	Ha ha! I found you!

1DI0028371	Were you trying to hide from me?
1DI0028372	You'll find that my electronic sensors are quite sophisticated.
1DI0028373	My search routines are quite advanced, don't you think?
1DI0028374	Fugitive has been located. Commencing attack.
1DI0028375	Your attempted escape is only making things worse for you.
1DI0028376	Do not make any further escape attempts, lawbreaker.
1DI0028377	You cannot hide from me, you commie maggot!
1DI0028378	You can run, but you can't hide!
1DI0028379	Your worthless hide is mine!
1DI0028381	Perhaps you're not the master of stealth you thought you were!
1DI0028388	Thought hiding would save you?
1DI0028390	You can't hide from me.
1DI0028394	I don't know where he could have gotten to.
1DI0028395	I don't know where she could have gotten to.
1DI0028396	Doesn't that just beat all.
1DI0028397	No matter. We'll find them eventually.
1DI0028398	Oh, never mind. They'll turn up sooner or later.
1DI0028399	What's the use. Must be long gone by now.
1DI0028400	That zombie will be back. I just know it.
1DI0028404	I'm sure our paths will cross again.
1DI0028405	Then we both live to fight another day.
1DI0028406	Very well... run, coward!
1DI0028407	Go tell your friends you got whooped by a Ghoul!
1DI0028408	Run away to suck at your mommy's tit? Go on get out of here!
1DI0028409	Ha ha! You keep running!
1DI0028410	Chicken shit!
1DI0028411	Can't handle the old Daring Dashwood, eh? Can't say I blame you!
1DI0028412	Buggered off, eh? Fine. I was done playing with you anyway.
1DI0028413	Must've given up.
1DI0028414	That's right! Don't mess with me!
1DI0028417	Gary?  Gary?
1DI0028418	Reporting enemy has escaped.
1DI0028419	Cancel alarm.
1DI0028420	Target has escaped.
1DI0028421	Resume normal procedures.
1DI0028422	Enemy has evaded detection. Standing down.
1DI0028423	Contact with tango lost.
1DI0028424	Yeah. Keep runnin'.
1DI0028425	Chicken shit.
1DI0028426	You better run.
1DI0028427	Ha. What a little bitch.
1DI0028428	Dumb ass coward.
1DI0028429	Shit. Must've scared 'em off.
1DI0028430	Next time... next time.
1DI0028431	Ahhhhh. I lost 'em.
1DI0028432	I got better things to do anyway.
1DI0028433	I don't have time for this crap.
1DI0028434	Crap! They're gone.
1DI0028435	Keep on running, chump.
1DI0028436	Gone now. Pity.
1DI0028437	I wanted a fight.
1DI0028438	No blood to spill today.
1DI0028439	Slippery humans.
1DI0028440	Aggh... a waste of my time.
1DI0028441	Damn... I was hopin' for a fight.
1DI0028443	The area's clear. Must've bugged out.
1DI0028444	Looks like they thought better of tangling with the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI0028445	Area is secured. Hostiles have vacated.

1DI0028451	Oh well. I wish you hadn't left so soon. I was having such a good time with you.
1DI0028452	I'll miss you. Please come back and see me again.
1DI0028453	I hope I didn't hurt your feelings with all that shooting and flaming. I'm afraid it's just the way I was programmed.
1DI0028454	Hostile has escaped. Transmitting description to designated law enforcement authorities.
1DI0028455	Fugitive has evaded pursuit. Law enforcement authorities now have primary responsibility for apprehension.
1DI0028456	Search complete. No hostiles detected. Standing down.
1DI0028457	Typical chickenshit commie maneuver.
1DI0028458	The enemy has retired before the awesome might of the U.S. army.
1DI0028459	This battlefield now belongs to Uncle Sam!
1DI0028460	Must've crawled into a hole and died or something. That's going to smell in a few days...
1DI0028461	Hmm. Strange. I wonder where they went.
1DI0028462	Run off, I guess.
1DI0028463	Well, I can't find anything.
1DI0028464	Huh. Guess they're gone.
1DI0028465	Whew. I was hoping I wouldn't find anything.
1DI0028466	Hmph. Better get back to my bitches! Ha, ha!
1DI0028467	Cleawed out I guess.
1DI0028469	Ah, screw this. Let's have a drink.
1DI0028470	Must have bugged out.
1DI0028471	Hmm. Oh well.
1DI0028472	I can't find anything.
1DI0028473	Cleared out, I guess.
1DI0028474	Stand down.
1DI0028475	I guess we ran 'em off.
1DI0028477	Nobody here anymore.
1DI0028478	You... you killed him. In cold blood....
1DI0028479	You... you killed her. In cold blood....
1DI0028480	What... how could you?
1DI0028482	Crime detected. Judicial circuits recommend immediate application of capital punishment.
1DI0028483	Crime detected. Application of death sentence commencing.
1DI0028484	Crime detected. Consulting judicial circuits... offender sentenced to death.
1DI0028485	Even I know that was not a nice thing to do.
1DI0028486	Now I'm going to have to do the same to you.
1DI0028487	You'll understand that now I have no choice but to employ deadly force.
1DI0028488	You are sentenced to death for the crime of murder.
1DI0028489	Halt, lawbreaker! You are hereby sentenced to death for felony murder.
1DI0028490	Commencing judicial sanction for felony murder.
1DI0028491	Dear me, how unsporting of you.
1DI0028492	*Gasp!* Murder!
1DI0028493	I suppose I'm going to have to do something about that.
1DI0028494	You are the lowest form of commie scumbag I've ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on!
1DI0028495	You seem to need an object lesson in democracy!
1DI0028497	Holy shit! Someone got themselves whacked.
1DI0028498	Oh my lord!
1DI0028499	Murderer!
1DI0028500	We've got one over here!
1DI0028501	What the hell have you done?
1DI0028502	You... murderer!
1DI0028503	Alarm! Alarm!
1DI0028504	What the hell? Hey!
1DI0028505	Aaaah! Murder! Help!
1DI0028506	You're not going to get away with that!
1DI0028507	Help! Someone's been murdered!
1DI0028508	Is he... is he dead?
1DI0028509	I think she's dead!
1DI0028511	I can't believe you'd do that!
1DI0028513	Holy shit! You just killed them! Like, dead!
1DI0028514	Whoa, calm down!
1DI0028515	You'we gonna pay for that!
1DI0028516	What the? Damnit! You're going to pay for that!
1DI0028517	You won't get away with that!
1DI0028518	We got ourselves a psychopath! Everyone stand clear!
1DI0028519	What?! Okay, you're ass is mine.
1DI0028520	Hmm. Some people have no respect for the sanctity of life.
1DI0028521	Natural selection at it's finest.
1DI0028522	What the hell? No one gets away with murder in my town!
1DI0028525	My word. Was that truly necessary?
1DI0028526	I think I'm going to be a trifle sick.
1DI0028527	Ah! What did you have to go and do that for? Such a fucking waste.
1DI0028528	You killed him!
1DI0028529	You killed her!
1DI0028538	You're going to pay for that!
1DI0028539	Murdering scum!
1DI0028540	You did what you had to do, son.
1DI0028541	You did what you had to do, honey.
1DI0028545	Better him than me.
1DI0028546	Better her than me.
1DI0028547	Damn roaches are everywhere!
1DI0028548	I'd better go check that out.
1DI0028549	Another one, eh?
1DI0028550	Probably just my nerves, but you never know.
1DI0028551	Hello? Curfew's in effect! Everybody's supposed to be in their rooms!
1DI0028552	Who's there? Don't make me come find you, now!
1DI0028553	I hear a zombie scratching around over there.
1DI0028554	What's that? It's a fucking zombie, isn't it.
1DI0028555	This isn't happening. I'm dreaming. I must be dreaming!
1DI0028556	Please God!
1DI0028559	<incoherent screams>
1DI0028561	Ah you think you can sneak up on ol' Roy Phillps, do you?
1DI0028562	What's that? You want a piece of me? Keep making that noise!
1DI0028563	Think you can get the drop on me, do you?
1DI0028564	Shit, I hear something!
1DI0028565	You like playing hide and seek, eh? You won't like it when I find you!
1DI0028566	You can't hide forever. I'll get you sooner or later.
1DI0028568	I think I heard something!
1DI0028569	Uhhhuuuhhh.
1DI0028570	Gary?
1DI0028571	Target possibility. Standby.
1DI0028572	We may have a breach. Searching.
1DI0028573	Position may be compromised.
1DI0028574	Investigating possible target.
1DI0028575	Danger. Possible threat.
1DI0028576	Enemy target may be in vicinity. Checking.
1DI0028577	Hey, I think someone's out there.
1DI0028579	Whoa, whoa. Shut the fuck up a second. I hear something.

1DI0028590	Huh? What's that?
1DI0028591	A noise?
1DI0028593	I hear something.
1DI0028594	That sound! What is it?
1DI0028595	Possible contact.
1DI0028596	I've got something over here.
1DI0028597	Look sharp.
1DI0028599	Trying to lock onto target.

1DI0028610	Is that someone who needs me to kick their ass?
1DI0028611	Move it out, people. I want this place searched top to bottom.
1DI0028612	Who's ready to have their ass kicked?
1DI0028613	Huh? What was that?
1DI0028614	Wait, what's happening?
1DI0028615	What's this? An interruption?
1DI0028616	Whoa, what the hell?
1DI0028620	Did you hear something?
1DI0028621	I'm going to go check it out.
1DI0028624	If that's the way it has to, then so be it.
1DI0028625	I WON'T let it end like this!
1DI0028626	If that's the way you want it....
1DI0028627	I didn't want to have to do this....
1DI0028628	Hey! It's the doc's kid!
1DI0028629	Criminey, more roaches!
1DI0028634	Why'd you have to go and do that?
1DI0028641	ZOMBIE!
1DI0028642	Damn that thing's ugly as hell!
1DI0028643	How many of those things are in here?
1DI0028654	We can do this if we all stick together!
1DI0028655	Here they come! Come on, let's kill them!
1DI0028656	Now we're dead.
1DI0028657	Oh shit. They're bigger than I remember.
1DI0028658	This is exactly how I always expected it to end.
1DI0028659	I need help over here!
1DI0028660	Maybe we'd better run for it.
1DI0028661	And now I will have my vengeance!
1DI0028662	Now the prisoner is the executioner!
1DI0028663	I'll kill every last one of you!
1DI0028664	You're going to pay dearly for what you did to me!
1DI0028665	I only kill to know I'm alive!
1DI0028666	Your life here is done!
1DI0028667	I promise this will be swift but painful!
1DI0028668	Prepare for your death!
1DI0028669	Only one of us will walk away alive!
1DI0028670	Let the battle begin!
1DI0028671	To arms, Brothers! To arms!
1DI0028675	Backup! Hostile in the lab!
1DI0028676	Hostile contact in A Ring!
1DI0028678	It's been too long since I've been in a good fight!
1DI0028679	Yeah, bring it over here. I dare you!
1DI0028680	I'm going to enjoy kicking the shit out of you!
1DI0028681	Got the jump on me.
1DI0028682	You want a piece of this?
1DI0028686	Take it elsewhere!
1DI0028687	No one fucks with the Stahl family!
1DI0028688	Time for an ass whuppin'!
1DI0028689	I'm gonna stomp you!
1DI0028690	You picked the wrong town to mess with, stranger.
1DI0028691	It's been a long time since I kicked an ass.
1DI0028692	I might just fight you bare handed.
1DI0028693	No quarter will be given, my friend.
1DI0028694	You must not do this! Not here!
1DI0028695	I implore you, do not resort to violence!
1DI0028696	Oh for the love of... are you serious?
1DI0028697	So, you like to fight old men, do you?
1DI0028698	I ain't gonna sew you back together.
1DI0028699	I'm just a bartender!
1DI0028700	This Ghoul hits back, smoothskin.
1DI0028701	I'm gonna get my dad!
1DI0028702	Everyone! Help! Raider!
1DI0028704	Are you fucking kidding me?
1DI0028705	Oh HELL yeah!
1DI0028706	Two hits, kid. Two hits.
1DI0028707	I'm gonna fuck your shit up, kid.
1DI0028708	Andy! I need help over here!
1DI0028709	That was your last chance.
1DI0028710	No! Help me, someone! Help!
1DI0028711	Billy! Help me!
1DI0028712	Are you out of your mind?
1DI0028713	Nathan!
1DI0028717	We got a Commie here!
1DI0028718	I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you.
1DI0028719	You want something? C'mon!
1DI0028720	Get the Sheriff!
1DI0028721	Get the children inside, we've got a Raider!
1DI0028722	You've messed with the wrong town.
1DI0028723	Raider! Raider alert! Come quick!
1DI0028724	Alarm! Alarm! We're under attack!
1DI0028725	I'll teach you to pull a gun on me!
1DI0028726	I won't mess up this time.
1DI0028727	You dumb motherfucker.
1DI0028728	Alright, some action!
1DI0028729	Your end draws near!
1DI0028730	May His enemies fall like the leaves!
1DI0028731	May He guide my aim and fell my enemies!
1DI0028732	Blessed be the defenders of Oasis, may we strike swift and true!
1DI0028733	Through His wrath, I will drive you from this earth!
1DI0028734	I will smite you with His vengeance!
1DI0028736	Engaging hostile!
1DI0028737	Positive ID on target!
1DI0028739	Tango spotted!
1DI0028740	Security breach!
1DI0028741	Threat engaged!
1DI0028742	Oh. Hell. YES.
1DI0028743	First mistake. Last mistake.
1DI0028744	Fresh blood, just ripe for the takin'!
1DI0028745	Time for you to bleed!
1DI0028746	I'm gonna tear your fuckin' throat out!
1DI0028747	This shouldn't take long!
1DI0028749	This is what it's all about!
1DI0028750	Oh man, it's go time!
1DI0028751	Don't worry, this'll only hurt a bit!
1DI0028752	You wanna mess with me?
1DI0028753	That's it... you're dead!
1DI0028754	Ha ha ha ha! Let's play, little human!
1DI0028755	Time to die!
1DI0028756	I'll wear your bones around my neck!
1DI0028757	Gonna splatter your brains!
1DI0028758	I love a good fight!
1DI0028759	Death to all humans!
1DI0028760	I've got contact!
1DI0028761	Hostiles!
1DI0028762	Hostile detected! Commencing attack!
1DI0028763	Targets acquired!
1DI0028764	Engaging targets!
1DI0028765	Contact! Opening fire!

1DI0028767	Hostile detected. Non-combatant safety can no longer be guaranteed.
1DI0028768	Threat analysis: red. Engaging hostile target.
1DI0028769	I'm afraid my programming requires that I try to kill you now.
1DI0028770	Please don't take this personally.
1DI0028771	I'm sorry, sir, but you've forced me to utilize deadly force.
1DI0028772	I'm sorry, ma'am, but you've forced me to utilize deadly force.

1DI0028776	Please stand clear. This is now a free fire zone.
1DI0028777	Commencing lawful use of deadly force.
1DI0028778	Ready to die for your country, you commie son of a bitch?
1DI0028779	Kill them all and let God sort them out!
1DI0028780	Every day is a good day to die!
1DI0028781	I've got a live one here!
1DI0028783	This isn't going to be pretty.
1DI0028784	Here we go.
1DI0028785	Uh oh.
1DI0028786	Why me?
1DI0028787	Vargas! Cover me!
1DI0028788	Fire and maneuver!
1DI0028790	Got me a wanker! Gonna fuck him up good!
1DI0028791	Uh oh!
1DI0028792	Time for some fun!
1DI0028793	Oh, it's on! It's so on!
1DI0028794	Tunnel Snakes, it's rumble time!
1DI0028795	Time to strike a blow... for science!
1DI0028796	I'm going to blind you with science!
1DI0028797	Well now! This should be fun!
1DI0028798	And here I thought I was going to have a boring day.
1DI0028799	Do you know who I am?
1DI0028800	That was dumb.
1DI0028801	What luck! I was hoping I'd get to shoot an idiot today.
1DI0028802	Hey, what's the big idea?!
1DI0028804	I've got one!
1DI0028806	Opening fire!
1DI0028807	Open fire!
1DI0028809	This is madness...
1DI0028810	This isn't right.
1DI0028811	This is what we've come to.
1DI0028812	This should be interesting.
1DI0028813	Barbarians.
1DI0028814	So much violence in the world these days.
1DI0028815	Fight! Fight! Fight!
1DI0028817	Yeah! Awesome!
1DI0028818	Holy moley, it's a fight!
1DI0028819	Hey, be careful!
1DI0028821	Are you crazy?
1DI0028822	None of my business, okay?
1DI0028823	I'm staying out of the way.
1DI0028826	Fight!
1DI0028830	Damn, it's a fight!
1DI0028831	Ain't none of my business!
1DI0028832	What in God's name has gotten into you?
1DI0028833	Did you just try to... pick my pocket? My God, son....
1DI0028834	Did you just try to... pick my pocket? My God....
1DI0028835	Hey! What are you doing?
1DI0028836	Is this how I raised you? To steal from me?
1DI0028837	Crime detected. Death sentence authorized by judicial circuits.
1DI0028838	It's a shame that you had to do that.
1DI0028839	Unauthorized materials requisition detected.
1DI0028840	The class of people I'm forced to associate with these days just keeps falling.
1DI0028841	Please tell me that you did not just do what I think you did!
1DI0028842	Just like every other thieving mungo.
1DI0028843	There's a reason why we don't let mungos in here.
1DI0028844	Thought I wouldn't notice your fat fingers going through my pockets?
1DI0028845	You think you can just come in here and take my stuff?
1DI0028846	You dirty sneak! Give me that back!
1DI0028847	You must think I'm pretty stupid.
1DI0028849	You have a death wish or something?
1DI0028850	Thief!
1DI0028851	I'm being robbed!
1DI0028852	Have you no decency?
1DI0028853	Alarm! We have a thief!
1DI0028854	Hey! Those are mine!
1DI0028856	Are you for real?
1DI0028857	Wow. You're so screwed.
1DI0028858	What? You touchin' my stuff?
1DI0028859	Oh no you didn't.
1DI0028860	Get your hand outta' there!
1DI0028861	Wha? You out of your mind?
1DI0028862	Keep that up, you're gonna end up wearin' a collar.
1DI0028863	Really now. What are you thinking?
1DI0028864	Are you stupid, you big shit-butt?
1DI0028865	...the hell you doin', mungo?
1DI0028866	You will cease at once.
1DI0028867	What do you think you're doing? Stop that!
1DI0028868	Stop that at once!
1DI0028869	Hey! Only my bitches are allowed in my pants!
1DI0028870	Give that back!
1DI0028871	You find anything you like in those pockets? Huh?
1DI0028872	Get your fuckin' hands out of my pockets.
1DI0028873	Please keep your hands to yourself.
1DI0028874	Damnit. Keep your hands to yourself!
1DI0028875	If you wish to keep all your fingers, you'll keep them to yourself.
1DI0028876	Hey now! Cut that out!
1DI0028877	Kindly remove your grubby hands from my pockets.
1DI0028879	Get your fucking hands out of my stuff.
1DI0028880	Aw, baby. A little to the right. Hey, that's not my...why you little thief!
1DI0028881	That's stealing!
1DI0028882	You're in trouble now!
1DI0028883	Help, he's robbing me!
1DI0028884	Help, she's robbing me!
1DI0028886	A pickpocket!
1DI0028887	Stop! Thief!
1DI0028888	You can't do that!
1DI0028889	You stole that!
1DI0028890	Honey. If you wanted it that badly, you could have just asked.
1DI0028891	Son. If you wanted it that badly, you could have just asked.
1DI0028892	Was that really necessary?
1DI0028893	I certainly didn't raise you to behave like that.
1DI0028894	That was uncalled for.
1DI0028895	Be more careful, will you?
1DI0028896	What are you doing? That's dangerous!
1DI0028897	Stop that! Someone could get hurt.
1DI0028898	Whoa! Are you like... some kind of crazy person?
1DI0028899	Do that again!
1DI0028900	Cool. Can I try?
1DI0028901	Whoa, whoa! Careful!
1DI0028902	Hey, knock it off!
1DI0028904	Not so close!
1DI0028906	Cut it out, will you?
1DI0028907	Watch where you point that.
1DI0028908	That's not a toy, you know.
1DI0028909	Now's not really the time for that, is it?
1DI0028910	You're not going to shoot me, are you?
1DI0028911	Is that loaded? Let me try it!
1DI0028912	Hey, I can almost see right down the barrel!
1DI0028913	Put that away. Unless you plan on using it.
1DI0028914	I've had guns leveled at me before. If you are wise, you will pause to consider that I am still around to talk about it.
1DI0028915	Only small men require guns to do their persuading.
1DI0028916	Most civilized people consider waving guns around to be rather uncouth.
1DI0028917	Why don't you put that away? Or do I need to give you a lesson in manners?
1DI0028918	Don't point that thing at me.
1DI0028919	Hey, knock it off.
1DI0028921	Be careful with that!
1DI0028922	That's not a good idea.
1DI0028923	Easy there.
1DI0028924	Getting some exercise, are we?
1DI0028925	Hey, there's no jumping in the capitol.
1DI0028926	Please be careful.
1DI0028927	A bit clumsy today, are we?
1DI0028928	Watch where you're going.
1DI0028929	Watch it, will you?
1DI0028930	Oh come on. Pay more attention to what you're doing.
1DI0028931	Cut it out.
1DI0028932	Hey, be more careful!
1DI0028933	Why don't you look where you're going?
1DI0028934	What's the big idea?
1DI0028935	Be careful with that.
1DI0028936	I trust you know what you're doing.
1DI0028937	You know what you're doing there?
1DI0028938	Whoa now. Be careful with that thing.
1DI0028939	Don't blow yourself up, okay?
1DI0028940	You sure that's a good idea?
1DI0028942	I don't think that belongs to you.
1DI0028943	Is that yours?
1DI0028944	I don't think you should mess with that.
1DI0028945	Tamper with that, and we're going to have a problem.
1DI0028946	I really hope you're not thinking of breaking into there.
1DI0028947	It's locked for a reason. Don't get any ideas.
1DI0028948	Yes, that's locked. And yes, I can see you eyeing it...
1DI0028949	Don't even think of breaking into that.
1DI0028950	That's secure for a reason.
1DI0028951	Hands off.
1DI0028952	Leave that alone.
1DI0028953	That's not yours.
1DI0028954	I can see what you're doing, you know.
1DI0028955	I don't think I have anything you'd want.
1DI0028956	Don't touch me.
1DI0028957	Don't even think about it.
1DI0028959	I'm watching you.
1DI0028960	Keep your hands to yourself.
1DI0028961	You won't get away with that.
1DI0028966	Would you stop screwing around?
1DI0028968	Can I try that? Just for a minute? Please?
1DI0028969	I used to have one just like that.
1DI0028970	Neat. What else you got?
1DI0028971	Watch where you're swinging that, will you?
1DI0028972	Is that really necessary?
1DI0028974	Why don't you go swing that somewhere else?
1DI0028975	Careful with that.
1DI0028976	Stop doing that so close to me.
1DI0028984	Do you know where that's been?
1DI0028986	What are you going to do with that?
1DI0028987	Does that belong to you?
1DI0028988	You're kind of weird.
1DI0028989	Oh come on. Cut it out.
1DI0028990	Put that down, will you?
1DI0028991	Give it a rest, will you?
1DI0028993	Are you having fun with that?
1DI0028994	You're easily amused, eh?
1DI0028995	Yeeeaaagghh!
1DI0028996	Huuuurrrrgggghhhh!
1DI0028998	Heearrh!
1DI0028999	Enforcing peace and justice with maximum force.
1DI0029000	The Mechanist regrets this necessary use of violence.
1DI0029001	You're mine!
1DI0029002	Yeaaaaaaahhhhgh!
1DI0029003	Wake up... time to die!
1DI0029004	Don't say I didn't warn you!
1DI0029005	Break you!
1DI0029006	Rrrraaaggh!
1DI0029007	Huuurrrggghhh!
1DI0029008	Here it comes!
1DI0029009	Smashie, smashie!
1DI0029010	Yaaaagh!
1DI0029011	You want to get close, huh? Huh?!
1DI0029012	Want to dance, meat? Let's dance!
1DI0029013	I'm gonna eat your heart, you piece of shit!
1DI0029014	<heavy grunt>
1DI0029015	<battle cry>
1DI0029016	Got somethin' for ya!
1DI0029017	I strike this blow for science!
1DI0029018	Take this, you miserable wretch!
1DI0029019	I'll cut ya!
1DI0029020	I'm a blade man!
1DI0029021	Haargh!
1DI0029022	Huurrraghh!
1DI0029023	Rrrraaahhh!
1DI0029024	Yaargh!
1DI0029025	Grrrraah!
1DI0029028	Ha!
1DI0029034	If anyone can hear this, this is Bob Andersteen.

1DI0029042	Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

1DI0029046	Greetings to the oppressed masses from the peace-loving peoples of China!
1DI0029047	All peace-loving peoples must join together to stop the war of aggression being waged by the Wall Street gang!
1DI0029066	This next piece is dedicated to my old friend Crazy Wolfgang. No one can scour the Wasteland and find such oddities as you.
1DI0029067	I'd like to play this next piece of music for the man out there who keeps an old lady alive and well. Doc Hoff, once again I thank you.
1DI0029068	To the traveling merchant who only goes by the name Crow, I thank you for all the times you spent keeping me company. Enjoy the music, my love.
1DI0029069	This is just a quick thank you to my new friend. Thank you for bringing me what I'd been searching for all these years.
1DI0029070	Music has always been an important part of my life. I hope you enjoy listening to these pieces as much as I enjoy playing them.
1DI0029071	Here is another lovely song for a lonely traveler wandering the Wasteland. You know who you are.
1DI0029072	If my notes sound sweeter it's all thanks to a special someone who helped out a poor old lady living alone in the Wasteland. Thank you, my friend.
1DI0029073	Remember, Agatha is with you on those cold nights. Just keep listening to this broadcast and I'll keep you company. It's the least I can do.
1DI0029074	They say recent events have made the world seem like a better place. I hope all of you out there can smile and feel better knowing that it's true.
1DI0029075	This next selection was one of my mother's favorites. I hope you'll enjoy hearing it as much as I enjoy playing it.
1DI0029076	That song reminded me how wonderful these composers were. How delightful to have such an amazing imagination.
1DI0029077	This is for all those people out there who take the time to help out those in need. Enjoy the music... you've earned it.
1DI0029078	This next piece reminds me of something my husband said. "Friendship is like a violin. Even if the music stops, you'll still have the strings."
1DI0029079	Just a word to my Wasteland friends out there. Stay safe, stay healthy and above all, stay happy.
1DI0029080	I'm dedicating this next piece of music to my loving husband. May his soul find peace.
1DI0029123	This is an automated distress message from Vault-Tec Vault 101. Message begins:
1DI0029124	Repeating message. This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers sending out an S.O.S. on all known friendly frequencies.
1DI0029125	This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers. If anyone can hear this signal we're in danger and we need your help.
1DI0029126	To anyone receiving this message. This is Butcher of the merc company Reilly's Rangers. We're in danger and need help.
1DI0029127	To anyone that can receive this. We are in danger and need your help. This is Butcher of Reilly's Rangers.
1DI0029128	Nice try asshole. Pay up or find someone else's time to waste.
1DI0029129	Eulogy Jones pays me enough not to take shit from someone like you.
1DI0029130	Besides there's plenty of side "benefits" to keep me happy.
1DI0029131	I'm sorry. I am not in a position to help you.
1DI0029132	Penny's one of us. She's gotta come too.
1DI0029133	Don't matter how good a time he could show me. Eulogy'd have my head. I like my head where it is.
1DI0029134	No! I'm not leaving him!
1DI0029135	Hey, I got an idea.
1DI0029136	How 'bout you stop tryin' to shine me up before I put a bullet in you.
1DI0029137	[sighs] You know what I don't appreciate? I don't appreciate when people try to take advantage of me.
1DI0029138	So right now, I'm not looking fondly on you. You want something from me, we do a straight-up deal. You don't try and pull one over on me.
1DI0029139	No, no. Perhaps if I had more time to rest.
1DI0029140	I'm sorry, but that is completely unacceptable.
1DI0029141	Like I'm going to listen to a little shrimp like you. Get lost, Poindexter.
1DI0029142	Nice try, buttwipe.
1DI0029143	You must think I'm stupid or something. I'm not falling for any of your tricks!
1DI0029144	What a horrible thing to say! Is that your idea of a joke?
1DI0029145	It's none of your business. Now leave me alone.
1DI0029146	You're a big dumb liar.
1DI0029147	Shut up! I'm not listening to you. It's not too late!
1DI0029148	No... no, I'm not going back in there. I can't!
1DI0029149	You're full of it. You always were.
1DI0029150	I'm afraid I won't be persuaded. Whatever powers you may have over the average Wastelander are ineffectual on me.
1DI0029151	I'm not listening to anything you have to say, prisoner! Stand down at once!
1DI0029152	I'm being reasonable. I'm also being a businessman.
1DI0029153	The information about your father must be worth quite a bit to you, otherwise you would never have come back.
1DI0029154	With the rise in demand comes the rise in price. The offer is 300 caps, and it stands.
1DI0029157	And, like any commodity, it must be sold at a reasonable market price. So, what's reasonable? Let's say... 100 caps, and daddy's location is yours.
1DI0029158	Sorry, smoothskin. I can't take the risk. Moriarty will beat the shit out of me for even talking to you!
1DI0029159	Sorry, kid. It's not worth the shitstorm I'll bring on myself.
1DI0029160	You're in over your head, and no amount of talking is going to get you out of it.
1DI0029161	Once you're dead, we'll finish off this pathetic Brotherhood and become the true saviors of the Wasteland.
1DI0029162	This ends NOW!
1DI0029163	That's just a technicality, really. This wasn't what you'd call a "settlement" until I whipped them all into shape. More of a "camp," really.
1DI0029164	But I suppose if you really care about what they have to say, you could grill some of the Hangar Deck rabble.
1DI0029165	Don't expect a speck of truth from them, Especially not that bartending crone, Belle Bonny. She tells the most disgusting lies.
1DI0029166	No, but I can damn sure share a bag of "Get the hell outta my bar."
1DI0029167	First one's on the house. Now scram!
1DI0029168	I think most of the people from back then have either moved on or passed away, sorry to say.
1DI0029169	Well, I'll just have to prove you wrong, then! Now let's get back to work!
1DI0029170	Believe what you like, but I've got a gift, and...and it'd be wrong not to try to use it!
1DI0029171	I'm not buying it. I mean, I know it's scary, but you can't half-ass something like this, you know?
1DI0029172	Now, go on out there walk through that Minefield like a real researcher!
1DI0029175	I don't think so. I've heard a lot of stories from traders that there's food out there. A whole lot.
1DI0029176	Either you weren't looking hard enough, or you didn't really go at all. Either way, I'm going to have to insist you go back again, alright?
1DI0029177	I know it's just about a definite that it works right, but I can tell you haven't really tested it out much.
1DI0029178	I appreciate your confidence, but I can't stress enough the importance of good research. So please go out and give it a real test, okay?
1DI0029179	I don't appreciate that sort of joke, especially not when it's about losing knowledge.
1DI0029180	Now you go out there again and get back to looking!
1DI0029181	Yeah, yeah, very funny. Just go there and do some real research, will you?
1DI0029182	Nope! Take the tour first. Then we talk about my proposition!
1DI0029183	So, you up for it?
1DI0029185	No, I don't think so. Take what you can get.
1DI0029186	Your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
1DI0029188	I'm sorry, your voice stress patterns indicate you are telling a falsehood. This is in violation of Protocol NC-01.
1DI0029191	I don't care what you need, this place is off limits and that's that.
1DI0029192	It's outsider's perspectives that drove him here in the first place.
1DI0029193	Sorry, I can't really help you.
1DI0029194	I am afraid that the knowledge required to appreciate our true nature is far above your level of comprehension.
1DI0029195	In light of your candor, all I can promise is that Arefu will no longer be a target of the Family. Beyond that, I make no such other promises.
1DI0029197	Nothing. The Family are just a bunch of damn punks.
1DI0029198	No, I'm sorry. I'll never set foot in that place again.
1DI0029200	Is that the best you can do? I'm afraid I'm not impressed.
1DI0029201	Not an option, I'm afraid. We aren't exactly rolling in cash, down here.
1DI0029202	Listen up good. I'm running the show here, not you. Now get out hell out of here!
1DI0029203	I'm in charge here. Not you. Now get out of my face!
1DI0029204	Last time I checked, I was the man in charge around here.  Now get out of my face. I have things to do.
1DI0029205	I'm in charge here!
1DI0029206	Who do you think you are? Tenpenny won't allow it. I'm a paying member of the tower. He'll listen to reason. Get out of here!
1DI0029207	What?! You must be retarded. Tenpenny won't allow that. I pay good money to live here. You can't just go pushing people around like that.
1DI0029208	Who do you think you are? I pay good money to live here. And I run a most prestigious store. You can't push me around like that!
1DI0029209	In case you haven't noticed, I run a fabulous shop, and live in the most fabulous of places. You can't push people like me around! Ha!
1DI0029210	I've hung with tougher assholes than you. I can handle myself. I'm not afraid of you. Besides, I'm one of Tenpenny's favorites!
1DI0029211	I'm not stupid, and I'm not falling for your tricks. Forget it!
1DI0029212	Certain information came to light. I paid a fortune in caps and obtained it.
1DI0029213	There really isn't much more to it.
1DI0029214	You sir, are a liar, a fraud and likely a spy of the Royal Crown. I warn you not to test my patience. You'll find it wearing quite thin.
1DI0029215	I'm not at liberty to say.
1DI0029216	I'm not easily manipulated. So don't bother.
1DI0029217	I'm sorry. Certain things are best shared between friends.
1DI0029218	You have to do better than that. I deal with bigger assholes than you on a daily basis.
1DI0029219	Mmm. Let's talk about something else.
1DI0029220	That's privileged information.
1DI0029221	Sorry. Doctors are trained in confidentiality.
1DI0029222	You won't be intimidating me today, sir.
1DI0029224	You're starting to really annoy me. People usually start dying when I get annoyed.
1DI0029225	Um. Yeah. Sorry. Not telling. Change the subject now.
1DI0029226	I don't know anything about that.
1DI0029227	I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. Sorry.
1DI0029228	You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Well, if you knew enough to be trusted, you wouldn't go around asking questions like that. Sorry, kid.
1DI0029229	Ummm. Yeah. Sorry. Don't know.
1DI0029230	Grownups just can't be trusted with certain types of information. Sorry.
1DI0029231	Yeah, I'm afraid that's not going to work with me.
1DI0029232	No way. I don't know you well enough.
1DI0029233	I'm trained in resisting all forms of coercion. You're wasting your time.
1DI0029234	Meh. Not going to tell the likes of you.
1DI0029235	You're right. It's probably not safe for me here. But from the sound of the man on that recording, it's not safe for me in the Commonwealth either.
1DI0029236	Sorry. You ain't all that good at sweet talking. Maybe if you came back with some caps.
1DI0029237	No. It's a cruel world and people are just looking for an excuse to blame someone... how much more convenient if that someone is a something!
1DI0029238	I'm saving the rest of my money to buy medical supplies for the town! I've given you all I can afford!
1DI0029239	There is no way that's happening.
1DI0029240	You've got to be kidding.
1DI0029241	No, I'm sorry. I will not force her to awaken. I can't predict the effect it may have on her system.
1DI0029242	I've told you everything I can think of.
1DI0029243	No! Those things! They're right behind me! Leave me alone!
1DI0029244	Nope! All I got is what's left on my back.
1DI0029248	What kind of nonsense is that? What does science have to do with a religious belief?
1DI0029249	Now I ask you again, why did you do such a horrible thing?
1DI0029250	If I had a cap for every punk that tried that line on me, I'd be rich.
1DI0029251	Well, I don't give a shit. Take him somewhere else... we're closed.
1DI0029252	Endangering the town? That goes against everything the Mechanist stands for. I can't believe I would ever become something like that...
1DI0029253	Which is just what the AntAgonizer wants me to think! Isn't that right, citizen. Or should I say... secret agent?!
1DI0029254	Her menace may have passed, but I cannot risk the suit falling into another's hands.
1DI0029255	The temptation of its power may be too great for others. I couldn't live with myself if it corrupted you, as well.
1DI0029258	Perhaps humanity isn't dead yet, but I'll be sure to help it along. Its writhing corpse shall feed my colony well.
1DI0029259	Now, my royal ant guard... kill this commoner!
1DI0029260	Oh, but it is. His hollowed shell will be an effigy - a warning to the rest of mankind!
1DI0029263	Umm. I just remembered something I need to do. Bye.
1DI0029264	I'm afraid that won't do, friend. Are you sure you won't take the generous offer I've already made?
1DI0029265	You're... You're lying! He may be crazy, but he'd never try to destroy the Vault like this!
1DI0029266	Only an outsider would do something like that. Someone like... you!
1DI0029267	I'd deal with you myself, except these people are going to need someone to watch out for them out there.
1DI0029268	As for you... You can stay down here and die, for all I care. If you ever talk to me again out there, I'll kill you.
1DI0029269	But we don't want to give up the safety of the Vault. We just want to end its isolation.
1DI0029270	That's what you and my father don't seem to understand!
1DI0029271	But we can't stay isolated forever, or eventually all we'll have left is a handful of inbred remnants!
1DI0029272	You may think Vault security is just bunch of chubby guys in padded helmets, but I promise you, most of them aren't as friendly as you remember.
1DI0029273	Don't worry about it; I won't tell the Overseer if you won't. To tell the truth, I'm glad she did.
1DI0029274	Heck, maybe you can even put all this trouble to rest once and for all.
1DI0029275	Even they aren't foolish enough to destroy their homes just to prove a point. It could only have been you!
1DI0029276	How many of them do you think will survive out there? Still, better a few of them stay alive out there than have them all die down here.
1DI0029277	The evacuation will begin immediately. But you won't be joining them outside. I'll see to that myself!
1DI0029278	The previous Overseers were idiots, and we nearly died because of their naivete. I'm simply trying to make up for their mistakes.
1DI0029279	In a generation or two, no one will remember it ever happened, and we'll still be the safest, purest humans left.
1DI0029280	But for that to happen, we can't let ourselves be further tarnished by outsiders.
1DI0029281	We can make more. That's what humanity does. It survives.
1DI0029282	You can't get blood from a stone. I'd love to help you, but first we need to iron out the deal.
1DI0029284	Oh no no no. That just won't do. 200 Caps is all I'm going to pay.
1DI0029285	How about no. 200 caps or no deal.
1DI0029286	I don't have to take that crap from you! Shut up!
1DI0029287	I'd prefer not to talk about it. Some people wouldn't appreciate my past.
1DI0029288	I understand your hesitation, but I can assure you that no harm will befall you.
1DI0029290	You're lying. I bet you didn't have the guts to kill him.
1DI0029291	Right. You're just a lying bigot, like all humans.
1DI0029292	No dice.
1DI0029293	Well, I never! You, sir, are no gentleman.
1DI0029294	Well, I never! You, madam, are no lady.
1DI0029296	You're lying. You don't know anything.
1DI0029297	Oh, no! You're just trying to get me in trouble. And drunk.
1DI0029298	I don't think so.
1DI0029299	No way, dude. Like I said. I need the caps.
1DI0029300	That dog ain't gonna hunt. You're going to have to do better than that.
1DI0029301	Mister Crowley was a mercenary I worked with a long time ago.
1DI0029302	Wait! You're seeking to discredit me before the next election!
1DI0029303	You're status is revoked. You have one hour to leave the Republic or I will have you executed.
1DI0029304	How dare you question my military record?
1DI0029305	You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave or I will have you executed.
1DI0029306	So you were sent to plunder the treasury?
1DI0029307	Your diplomatic status is hereby revoked.
1DI0029308	You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave, or I will have you executed.
1DI0029309	Are you accusing me of impropriety? In an election year?
1DI0029310	I'll give you one hour to leave the Republic of Dave. After that, I'll have you executed.
1DI0029311	You must be joking.
1DI0029312	I'm tired of you're presence. Leave the Republic of Dave within the hour, or I'll have you executed.
1DI0029313	Right. And Brahmin can fly. Idiot.
1DI0029314	A murderer and a thief. I'd sooner die.
1DI0029315	What? Gimme a break.
1DI0029316	You know what I think? I think you killed her. That means we've got a problem.
1DI0029317	I think it's time to introduce you to a close friend of mine. I call him the Kneecapper. Say hello.
1DI0029318	Um, no dice, roadkill. Now hand over what you got.
1DI0029319	That's all I have on me, friend, no deal.
1DI0029320	You broke it, didn't you? Way to go, Mirelurk bait. Forget you, I'm outta here.
1DI0029321	Oh, trying to be cute, are you? Once you're dead, we'll have plenty of time to find them ourselves.
1DI0029322	You're welcome to take your business to another doctor if you don't like my prices.
1DI0029323	Sorry, I can't let it go for anything less than 100.
1DI0029324	Look, I don't know who you are. I'm not just handing over my life's earnings to you!
1DI0029325	Nice try. I said no.
1DI0029326	Seriously. No.
1DI0029327	Charming. I feel I should tell you that your negotiation skills aren't quite up to par. You wouldn't want to embarrass yourself again.
1DI0029328	Ha ha. Really now? I'm afraid you aren't as agile tongued as you'd like to think.
1DI0029329	Look. I can't let you in. If you did something stupid, it's my ass on the line. I'm not going to risk it. I need this job. Now get out of here!
1DI0029330	I'm just doing my job. Now, back away before I'm forced to shoot you.
1DI0029331	Nice try. Are you done wasting my time? Good.
1DI0029332	Sorry friend. You ought keep better track of your loved ones.
1DI0029333	Heh. Yeah right. I don't think so.
1DI0029334	Yeah, sorry. I don't think so.
1DI0029335	Nice try.
1DI0029336	You...oh. You don't know. You're just trying to trick me. Well, it won't work.
1DI0029337	You first, asshole.
1DI0029338	I ought to slap you.
1DI0029339	But I think I'll puke instead.
1DI0029340	Sir! That's a really stupid idea, sir!
1DI0029341	Why should I tell you? You'll just tell everyone else.
1DI0029342	So you can take it? No way!
1DI0029343	No, no. It's hopeless.
1DI0029344	Why the hell should I trust you?
1DI0029345	That's just what I would expect to hear from another spy from the Wasteland. You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave or be executed.
1DI0029346	I'm not stupid! You're just pushing me around.
1DI0029347	No... no. I don't think I could. Sorry.
1DI0029348	Don't lie to me. Dave would have told me that if it were true.
1DI0029349	Yeah, like you could manage that. You really don't know shit about how we work, do you? But if you're that serious...
1DI0029350	I've got some I keep for myself in case there's an accident or something. Will you shut up about this if I give some to you?
1DI0029351	This kind of crap gets around, you know. You try bullying too many people, and it's going to cost you.
1DI0029352	You don't have to lie to make me feel better. I know it's a dumb joke. We don't really tell them to laugh with them - more to laugh at them.
1DI0029355	No. Because I don't trust you.
1DI0029356	She's a jerk, but she's still one of us.
1DI0029357	I don't want to talk about it with you.
1DI0029358	No! I'm not supposed to go outside with strangers! Help!
1DI0029359	None of your business. Go bother someone else.
1DI0029360	Uh ... do I look like I have any money on me? I'm sorry, I can't pay you anything.
1DI0029361	We're too poor for that.
1DI0029362	Nah. Too rich for me.
1DI0029363	I like what you're saying but this is bigger than just you and your dad.
1DI0029364	If you want help from Galaxy News, you need to contribute to Galaxy News. That's all there is to it.
1DI0029365	I'm afraid that it just doesn't work that way.
1DI0029366	I guess we know where the next meal is coming from!
1DI0029367	No way, that's more than I was gonna pay Grady. Forget it!
1DI0029368	All I'm offering is 200 caps. That's it. Take it or leave it.
1DI0029369	Nope. It's 15 each. You wanna do it or what?
1DI0029370	[Makes buzzer noise]. Nice try, but that's a miss. 250 is the score... you in?
1DI0029371	Wrong answer, dead meat!
1DI0029372	Nice try, but ... nah. I don't think so.
1DI0029373	That's not going to work on me.
1DI0029374	I'm not falling for that.
1DI0029375	Stealing? What are you thinking?
1DI0029376	Your mother would be ashamed of you.
1DI0029380	I wish you hadn't done that.
1DI0029381	I'm sorry. I've been programmed to protect private property at all costs.
1DI0029382	I wish I could look the other way, but I'm afraid my programming is very strict.
1DI0029384	Please put your hands in the air and prepare for disciplinary action.
1DI0029385	That is stealing. Stealing is prohibited.
1DI0029387	Did you really need that?
1DI0029388	Why do I get all the hoodlums?
1DI0029389	I thought I had seen every species of moronic petty bullshit, but you've just topped the list. Congratulations.
1DI0029390	Do you have no respect for private property, you slimy little commie bastard?
1DI0029391	Did you not realize that I have eyes in the back of my head?
1DI0029392	Bad move, mungo.
1DI0029393	I thought you were different.
1DI0029394	Put that back, you big smelly mungo!
1DI0029395	Here's how we deal with robbers in Little Lamplight.
1DI0029396	You got a lot of nerve, coming in here and trying to rob us.
1DI0029397	You'd better run, you damn thief.
1DI0029398	That doesn't belong to you!
1DI0029399	Put that back at once!
1DI0029401	I'd recommend putting that down.
1DI0029402	Alarm! We're being robbed!
1DI0029403	That's not your property!
1DI0029404	Hey! What do you think you're doin'?
1DI0029405	Put that back!
1DI0029406	Hey! That ain't yours!
1DI0029407	That ain't yours, mungo.
1DI0029408	Hey! That's mine.
1DI0029409	Hey, that's valuable junk!
1DI0029410	Now, now.
1DI0029411	There is nothing that comes free in this life, friend.
1DI0029412	Put that back, now.
1DI0029413	That doesn't bewong to you!
1DI0029414	Please! You're spoiling my experiments!
1DI0029415	Don't take that! You'll ruin everything!
1DI0029416	You there. Keep your hands off other people's property!
1DI0029417	Are you daft? That doesn't belong to you.
1DI0029418	That isn't yours!
1DI0029419	You better put that back!
1DI0029420	Hey, that's not yours!
1DI0029421	I saw you take that!
1DI0029422	You're going to be in trouble if you don't put that back!
1DI0029427	You can't just take that!
1DI0029429	Come on, let's go.
1DI0029430	Beat it, mungo.
1DI0029431	Move it or lose it.
1DI0029432	Get out of here.
1DI0029433	You need to leave now, mister.
1DI0029434	You need to leave now, miss.
1DI0029435	Uh, can you leave now, please? I've got to do something.
1DI0029436	Time for you to go.
1DI0029438	You've got to leave now so I can lock up.
1DI0029439	I'm locking up, so you'll need to leave.
1DI0029440	Please! I give up! I give up!
1DI0029442	Sure thing, man.
1DI0029445	Command accepted, pard-ner.
1DI0029446	You sure?
1DI0029447	Okay!
1DI0029449	Let me know if you need anything else!
1DI0029451	No problem, buddy.
1DI0029456	Command accepted.
1DI0029457	No problem!
1DI0029458	As you wish, child.
1DI0029462	Yeah, all right.
1DI1000001	Yes sir. We'll attack the enemy at the Mining Town.
1DI1000002	Yes sir. We'll attack the enemy at the Listening Post.
1DI1000003	Yes sir. We'll attack the enemy at the Ice Camp.
1DI1000004	Yes sir. We'll attack the enemy at the Chimera Depot.
1DI1000005	Yes sir.  On our way. We'll wait for you by the Chimera Depot.
1DI1000006	Yes sir.  On our way. We'll wait for you by the Listening Post.
1DI1000007	Yes sir.  On our way. We'll wait for you by the Mining Town.
1DI1000008	Yeah, of course. Go on through.
1DI1000009	You're clear, but the pet Frankenstein stays up here...
1DI1000010	Sure, but the zombie stays here.
1DI1000011	No problem, but your friend stays topside with me.
1DI1000012	No problem, but leave the bot here.
1DI1000013	Yeah, but Lyons' woman stays topside. You head in. Alone.
1DI1000014	Yeah, but make sure that stray pooch doesn't tag along.
1DI1000016	Sure, but your pet Frankenstein stays here.
1DI1000017	Sure, but the zombie stays up here, where I can keep an eye on it...
1DI1000022	Okay, that's what I'm here for.
1DI1000023	Yes sir. On our way. We'll wait for you by the Ice Camp.
1DI1000024	I'll just take care of all your old gear for you and here are the new ones.
1DI1000025	Everything appears to be in order. Here you go.
1DI1000032	Can do. What unit should we request?
1DI1000033	Yes sir. We'll wait here. Let us know when you want us to attack the enemy at that location.
1DI1000037	That's about the smartest decision you ever made.
1DI1000038	Think long and hard before doing that again.
1DI1000039	Be more careful next time.
1DI1000040	That better have been an accident.
1DI1000041	Jeezus! What was that about?
1DI1000042	Target in proximity. Search pattern seven-three.
1DI1000043	We got us a ghost here. Eyes on.
1DI1000044	Possible hostile contact.
1DI1000045	Movement detected. Keep sharp.
1DI1000046	Hmm, thought I heard something.
1DI1000051	Enemy sighted! Get him!
1DI1000052	There he is! Drop that son-of-a-bitch!
1DI1000053	Target acquired! Engaging!
1DI1000054	Hostile! Hostile!
1DI1000058	Invader!
1DI1000059	Lost the target. Must have bugged out.
1DI1000060	Nothing here. False alarm.
1DI1000061	There's no one here. Stand down.
1DI1000062	Target lost.
1DI1000063	Gone now, I guess.
1DI1000064	Nothing there...
1DI1000065	Looks clear.
1DI1000066	Watch where you point that thing!
1DI1000067	Check your fire! Check your fire!
1DI1000068	Hey, careful with that!
1DI1000069	Over there, over there! Get 'em!
1DI1000070	I'm on this one!
1DI1000071	Got a present for ya, Commie!
1DI1000072	Plenty more where this came from!
1DI1000074	U.S.A.!
1DI1000075	Stars and Stripes forever, you Commie sonsabitches!
1DI1000076	Assaulting hostiles!
1DI1000081	Going weapons hot!
1DI1000088	Defend our assets at all costs!
1DI1000092	Destroy the Americans!
1DI1000095	For General Jingwei!
1DI1000098	Defend your positions! Don't let them through!
1DI1000099	Die Americaaannn!
1DI1000100	Stop and drop!
1DI1000108	The enemy ghosted himself. Keep your eyes on.
1DI1000109	Target's gone out of sight! Watch it!
1DI1000110	Lost visual on target!
1DI1000111	What the hell? Where did he go?
1DI1000112	Search the area!
1DI1000113	The invader disappeared!
1DI1000114	That'll teach them to mess with us.
1DI1000115	Area cleared... let's move out.
1DI1000116	Only good Commie's a dead one.
1DI1000117	Aw, come on. Is that all you got?
1DI1000118	Don't mess with the U.S.!
1DI1000119	Hostiles vaporized.
1DI1000120	And THAT'S how we do things in the Corps!
1DI1000121	All targets eliminated.
1DI1000123	Chalk another one up for me!
1DI1000124	Welcome to Alaska, Commie.
1DI1000125	Hostile vaporized!
1DI1000126	Target is down!
1DI1000127	G'night, Commie!
1DI1000128	Ha! Dropped one!
1DI1000129	That's how we do things in my hometown!
1DI1000130	U.S.A. forever!
1DI1000133	Situation resolved.
1DI1000134	Return to patrols.
1DI1000135	Urrghh...
1DI1000136	Mother...
1DI1000140	Aaaaiieee!
1DI1000142	You'll never win...
1DI1000143	Man down, man down!
1DI1000145	I'll make you pay for that!
1DI1000147	Shit. Lost one.
1DI1000149	Fu-ucck!!! Damnit, McKinney!
1DI1000151	McKinney! Jesus! You got a death wish?!
1DI1000152	He's up on that ridge. Right over there.
1DI1000153	We've got to take out that goddamned sniper! We're pinned in here.
1DI1000154	Hold it.
1DI1000155	Sniper.
1DI1000156	There we go. Stay safe out there, okay?
1DI1000157	All patched up. Now get back into the fight!
1DI1000158	You're fine now. Just be careful out there, all right?
1DI1000159	All right boys, I'm going to make you famous. Get yourselves into a heroic pose.
1DI1000160	Okay. That's it. Just like that. Hold still.
1DI1000161	Excellent! The Capital Post thanks you! Who knows, maybe someone will turn this photo into a statue one day.
1DI1000162	All right, you boys try not to die out there, okay? God bless you, and God bless the U.S. of A!
1DI1000163	I'll see you there...
1DI1000164	Burn in hell, traitor!
1DI1000165	No, you're not going to get away with giving up the tech we risked our asses for.
1DI1000166	Treason, Sibley? Really? You're not going to get away with this.
1DI1000167	Sorry, sir, but it IS my call now. I'm not taking orders from you anymore.
1DI1000168	I've made it quite clear that it's not your call. A deal's a deal.
1DI1000169	No, sir. Now IS the time. There's no way in hell I'm letting this... local... walk out with anything.
1DI1000170	Dammit Sibley, now's not the time.
1DI1000171	All right, McGraw. This has gone on long enough.
1DI1000172	What? You bastard!
1DI1000173	Yeah, I heard about you. Behave yourself down there, or you'll have me to answer to on the way out.
1DI1000174	You're clear to enter, but your pet Frankenstein stays here.
1DI1000175	You're clear to enter, but the pet zombie stays up here.
1DI1000176	Head down, but the sidekick stays topside.
1DI1000177	Yeah, I got word to let you by. Can't take the bot with you, though.
1DI1000178	You've got some nerve bringing Lyons' bitch here. You go down. Alone.
1DI1000179	No dogs allowed. Head down, but leave the mutt with me.
1DI1000180	Good. Go down and report to Protector McGraw.
1DI1000181	Fine. Freak show stays, though. Report to Protector McGraw downstairs.
1DI1000182	About time. Report to Protector McGraw, but leave your friend with me.
1DI1000183	Get in the elevator, then. Robot stays topside.
1DI1000184	Go report to Protector McGraw. I'm keeping an eye on your heretic. She stays with me.
1DI1000185	Report to Protector McGraw as soon as you get down there. I'll keep an eye on the dog while you're gone.
1DI1000187	You're clear to enter, but leave your pet monster here.
1DI1000192	Sure. See you around.
1DI1000193	Yeah, Maybe.
1DI1000194	Molly, I'm... I'm okay. Everything's fine. I was found, but not by the Chinese. It was the Captain, he found me. Cap says everything will be okay.
1DI1000195	It's been a few hours, and I'm tired, but I wanted to let you know I'm all right. I'm in the refinery now, resting.
1DI1000196	Cap brought me here. We snuck around the Chinese and made it in. It's the last place they haven't taken.
1DI1000197	I got... I got shot, Molly. In the shoulder. And back. When Cap and I evacuated the mountain. It's not bad. Just a few bullets. Souvenirs, right?
1DI1000198	Cap jabbed me with a bunch of meds, so I can't feel much of anything anymore. He patched me up pretty good, too. Still bleedin', but that'll stop.
1DI1000199	I can hear Cap and the others out in the yard, fighting. So much gunfire. They'll kill those Chinese bastards, and then we can all come home...
1DI1000200	Physician's Log, Doctor Adrienn Adami, United States Army, Anchorage, Alaska forward base.
1DI1000201	Considering what's at stake, General Chase and I both feel the chem codenamed "Psycho" can be of significant use during this operation.
1DI1000202	I've read the early clinical trials, and there are certainly some possible side effects -- dementia, psychotic aggression. And of course addiction.
1DI1000203	But the adverse effects do seem limited. Okay, I do realize the chem was developed by Chase's R&D division, but if the thing works it works.
1DI1000204	Can we really afford to be picky at this point? Some of these groundpounders have family in Anchorage. I'll give them any boost I damn well can.
1DI1000205	I just hope my Hippocratic Oath is still speaking to me when this whole mess is over with...
1DI1000207	Listen, son, I know Morrill was rough on you.  I'm sorry, I really am -
1DI1000209	Right.  You can drop the act, now.  I'm not here to hurt you.
1DI1000211	<heavy sigh> Look, just remove the PIP-Boy and we can part ways.
1DI1000212	Gary? GARY!
1DI1000213	You know what?  Fuck this.  Hand me that saw - and turn off the recorder.
1DI1000214	Gaaaaaaary....
1DI1000215	Molly, I hope this tape gets to you, someway, somehow. I don't have a lot of time, but you need to know what happened to me.
1DI1000216	The early reports weren't bullshit. The Chinese are here. As in, they're invading Anchorage, in force. Right now!
1DI1000217	This is the real deal. It makes Pearl Harbor look like an academy exercise. I've never seen so many goddamned warships.
1DI1000218	Sergeant Lowry has ordered the platoon to assemble in the mess in fifteen minutes.
1DI1000219	The plan is to dig in on the cliffs, and slow the Chinese advance until the civilian contractors can evacuate.
1DI1000220	And then... Then we hold the line, for as long as we can. I talked to Durney, Ciello and Dallas, and we all agreed - surrender is not an option.
1DI1000221	I never told you, but... that night in Cleveland? On the ferris wheel? That was when I fell in love with you.
1DI1000222	Goodbye Molly. I... I'm sorry.
1DI1000223	This is Private First Class Henry Hodges, signing out.
1DI1000224	Audio log begin.
1DI1000225	This is Captain Zachary Lloyd, United States Army, Anchorage, Alaska security detachment.
1DI1000226	Approximately 23 minutes ago, Chinese Communist forces set foot on Anchorage soil, despite our soldiers' best efforts to prevent that landing.
1DI1000227	As expected, the Chinese have launched a two-pronged attack - one aimed at occupying Anchorage proper, and the other at securing this base.
1DI1000228	Thanks to our entrenchment, U.S. casualties here on the mountain are currently minimal, but that's not going to last for long.
1DI1000229	But that's not going to last for long. Chinese reinforcements appear to be... endless. It's just a matter of time before we're overrun.
1DI1000230	We'll die today, but by God we'll give those Communist sonsabitches a black eye they'll never forget.
1DI1000231	Lloyd out.
1DI1000232	Audio log begin!
1DI1000233	This is Captain Zachary Lloyd, United States Army, Anchorage, Alaska security detachment!
1DI1000234	We are approximately two hours into the Chinese assault on this outpost!
1DI1000235	We are being shelled non-stop, indiscriminately! The entire base is under bombardment from the Chinese ships, and they don't care who they hit!
1DI1000236	All accounts indicate they've actually killed more of their own men than ours! They just do not seem to care about their own troops, at all!
1DI1000237	At this rate, the entire mountain will be a graveyard in less than an hour, and then the Chinese will just move in and set up shop!
1DI1000238	God help us! God help America!
1DI1000239	Oh, Molly... I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
1DI1000240	I can't do this. I'm so afraid, Molly. I don't want to die. Oh my God, I don't want to die...
1DI1000241	We held them as long as we could, I swear we did. Then Ciello asked for a magazine, and when I turned to give it to him, a shell hit, and...
1DI1000242	He's gone, Molly. He was there one second, and then he wasn't. His blood... and, and... bits of him... Ohh... my God, he's all over me!
1DI1000243	Please, please, please, let them leave, let them leave, let them leave. I just want to come home. I just want to be with you again.
1DI1000244	I'm hiding now. The Chinese are everywhere. I'm a coward, I'm a coward I know. But I don't care. If they find me, I'm surrendering.
1DI1000245	...yeah, I can.  Don't know who exactly this simulation is supposed to benefit, though.
1DI1000246	...<static>...
1DI1000247	Jesus, are these guys serious?  Why would they bring that kind of hardware with them?
1DI1000249	I got word from brass at the Pentagon.  We're going to need to modify the RoE on the Chinese to match this.
1DI1000251	We just got more field reports from DoD.  Hey, Rick.  You busy?
1DI1000252	You and me both. The General gets any more comfortable here and there going to be lot more all-nighters for everybody.
1DI1000254	I hear Chase is having them deliver his personal effects, including an overnight cot.
1DI1000256	Between us, I think the General's taken a little too much interest in the project. You know how the CO's office is usually a formality?
1DI1000258	...yeah, got to. These bombers Chase requested; we're pushing the system to the brink with all this crap.
1DI1000260	Let's see, if I can just re-allocate some of the... yeah, that frees up memory for the bombers, and...
1DI1000261	Yea? We can talk about how many times he made me re-work the way his coat looks in the sim...
1DI1000263	Sure, but the idea of the Chinese developing something similar isn't out of the question.
1DI1000265	Chimera Tanks? Come on, man, even you have to admit these are sheer fantasy.
1DI1000267	Look, this is the job. Most of these scenarios will never happen, but if they do, we'll have a plan.
1DI1000269	I swear, if Chase comes to us with another ridiculous contingency scenario...
1DI1000270	...<laughs>You almost sound like a sympathizer - you really feel sorry for the poor saps?
1DI1000272	Yeah, exactly.  They're in for a long haul.
1DI1000274	You'd think, but they're not like us.  Their boys are drafted and left to rot on whatever shit assignment they're handed.
1DI1000276	No, no - it's not that at all.  I get that the Chinese occupation in Alaska is strictly military, but don't you think they'd settle in a bit?
1DI1000277	Absolutely. You're always welcome to trade with us at any time. We pick up odds and ends from all over the Wasteland, so keep checking back.
1DI1000278	Certainly. Take a look at what we've got.
1DI1000279	Hell yeah! Take that you Red bastards!
1DI1000280	That's two. Let's finish the job.
1DI1000281	Ha ha! And they all come tumbling down! Yeah!
1DI1000282	Woah... watch your step near those ledges. That is a HELL of a long fall.
1DI1000283	Eyes on, we got company up ahead!
1DI1000284	We're crossing that pipe? And here I thought I was the one with the death wish.
1DI1000285	If I live just one more day without seeing another catwalk, I'll die a happy man.
1DI1000286	Through this next structure is the entrance to the Artillery Base. I dunno what they got waiting for us, so keep a sharp watch.
1DI1000287	Here's the entrance. Place is probably swarming with Reds.
1DI1000288	Holy shit...
1DI1000289	There! See 'em down there? That's their damn Chimera tanks. Don't worry, they're well out of range.
1DI1000290	Hmm. Looks like the Commies are getting low on ammo for the big guns. Maybe we didn't even need to come up here.
1DI1000291	Yeah, yeah.... so I was wrong. Let's keep moving.
1DI1000292	That's the Front down there. These guns are pounding on our guys. Let's take 'em out!
1DI1000293	Alrighty chief... we got three of those things to take down. You lead the way.
1DI1000294	Plant that thing and let's go!
1DI1000295	Let's blow this beast apart!
1DI1000296	Last gun! Blow that thing off the map!
1DI1000297	Morrill calling in... Yeah, we took care of 'em. Listen, I'm sending down a local. You'll want to talk to this one. Yeah, exactly. Morrill out.
1DI1000298	About damn time the reinforcements showed up! Fall in, soldier!
1DI1000299	We've got multiple hostiles between here and the base camp. We're sweeping the area to secure it. Let's move!
1DI1000300	You got a death wish, walking through a war zone?
1DI1000301	Listen, local, if you want to be of use, help us clear the mutants between here and our base camp. If not, stay the hell out of our way!
1DI1000302	What? Just who the hell are you, some local? You got a death wish, walking around in our...
1DI1000303	Wait a second... that computer on your wrist. You're from a damned Vault?
1DI1000304	All right, we'll probably need their help. Mutants'll be back before long.
1DI1000305	Get inside and check in with Protector McGraw. He's running the operation.
1DI1000306	Uhh, that'd be Protector McGraw... Sir. He's... he's inside. Go ahead in.
1DI1000307	Uhh, that'd be Protector McGraw... Ma'am. He's... he's inside. Go ahead in.
1DI1000308	Uh huh. Well, now that you've been nice enough to return it to us...
1DI1000309	...hey, what's that on your wrist? That's some kind of computer, isn't it?
1DI1000310	Well, isn't that nice of you. Looks like things have calmed down now, so why don't you just run along...
1DI1000312	You filthy fucking wastelander... You're dead, you hear me? Dead!
1DI1000313	Are you some kind of idiot? Listen, little girl... hey, wait a second. What's that on your wrist there? Some kind of computer?
1DI1000314	Are you some kind of idiot? Listen, kid... hey, wait a second. What's that on your wrist there? Some kind of computer?
1DI1000315	I suggest you turn right around before you find yourself full of holes. We've taken over this sector, and...
1DI1000316	Hang on. Is that some kind of computer on your wrist?
1DI1000317	You heard our signal? How'd you manage that? It's not broadcast on a standard frequency...
1DI1000318	...oh, I see. You've got one of those wrist-mounted computers. Well, well. Isn't that interesting.
1DI1000319	How the hell did you hear my signal? It's not broadcast on a standard frequency...
1DI1000321	Isn't that fancy. Listen kid, maybe you could help us out. We've been looking for someone like you.
1DI1000322	Why don't you head inside and talk to Protector McGraw? I'll radio ahead and let him know you're coming.
1DI1000323	Slow down there, kid. I'm not asking for it.
1DI1000324	I think, though, that you wanna talk to Protector McGraw. Head on inside; I'll let him know you're coming.
1DI1000325	Okay, okay. I'm sure Protector McGraw will be happy to tell you.
1DI1000326	Why don't you go on inside? I'll let him know you're coming.
1DI1000327	...all I'm saying is, why can't we just ice the guy and use his computer ourselves?
1DI1000328	...all I'm saying is, why can't we just ice the chick and use the computer ourselves?
1DI1000329	...like I said, Morrill should be up top. So who the hell's in the elevator?
1DI1000330	McGraw gave orders. It's that simple.
1DI1000331	No idea. Stay sharp, but don't open fire without my order.
1DI1000332	Come on, man. How long you gonna let McGraw screw us over like this?
1DI1000333	Man, this is the last thing we need...
1DI1000334	That's enough. McGraw's in charge, so we follow his orders, no matter how much we don't like it.
1DI1000335	Outcasts, we've got to secure those ruins before we can reach the base!
1DI1000336	Yes, sir! Proceeding.
1DI1000337	Yessir. Heading uphill, wiping out some green.
1DI1000338	Let's move, people.
1DI1000339	All mutants have been put down. Outcasts, proceed to the base!
1DI1000340	Area clear. Returning to base.
1DI1000341	Done here. Back to base.
1DI1000342	That's the last of them. Moving to base.
1DI1000343	Point secure. That just leaves these mutants in the ruins. Outcasts, move out!
1DI1000344	Ready. Let's hit the ruins.
1DI1000345	Entering the ruins.
1DI1000346	Pushing into the ruined building.
1DI1000347	You realize I could force you to stay?
1DI1000348	I'm not going to do that. I hope you take that gesture as it's intended -- to show that I really do want your help.
1DI1000349	Under different circumstances, that wouldn't be nearly enough of an explanation.
1DI1000350	But... I think you can be helpful, and so I'll overlook it for now.
1DI1000351	Well, you're certainly not the help that Morrill had in mind, but from the looks of you, you might be useful in other ways.
1DI1000352	Try me, reject. Ouutcassttsss! Hostile in base!
1DI1000353	I'm not an idiot. That computer you've got on your wrist there? That's not our tech.
1DI1000354	So how about you tell me what you're really doing here before I have you killed.
1DI1000355	Do we look like cannibals? Are you really that dense?
1DI1000356	That computer on your wrist is what I'm talking about. I need that computer -- and the person attached to it -- to access the technology here.
1DI1000357	That device on your wrist. That's not our tech. That, and the fact that none of us would be stupid enough to take our armor off.
1DI1000358	This is the part where I'd have you killed. At least, under normal circumstances.
1DI1000359	But, it turns out you might be useful to us. If you can help, I'll forget that you should be dead for wearing that armor.
1DI1000360	That device on your wrist. That's not our tech.
1DI1000363	Fine, fine. I get it. I'm not trying to intimidate you here. I just need your help, and we can both come out of this better off than we are now.
1DI1000364	That computer on your wrist there. I need that, and I need you to use it. Okay? That's it. No one's going to hurt you.
1DI1000365	You're not wrong. So for now I'll overlook the fact that you've got some of our tech.
1DI1000366	If you can assist us, it'll be worth your while.
1DI1000367	IF you can help, then I suspect it will definitely be worth your time.
1DI1000368	Yes, that is our main base of operations in the area. If Casdin is willing to trust you, then I hope we can work together.
1DI1000369	You arrogant little shit. Outcasssttssss! We've got a hostile!
1DI1000370	So you do have half a brain. That's good.
1DI1000371	I'll keep it simple. I need you, and I need that computer of yours. You help me out, and I'll do what I can to help you.
1DI1000372	This isn't an offer the Outcasts extend to anyone, so you really should think carefully about it.
1DI1000373	Heh, all right. You're obviously sharper than the average rubble dweller.
1DI1000374	That computer you've got on your wrist is a specialized piece of equipment. I need someone who knows how to use it.
1DI1000375	If you can be that someone, I'm willing to work with you to make your life easier.
1DI1000376	Records indicate there's some high-value tech in this base, but we can't get to it. The armory is sealed by a blast door, and we can't get it open.
1DI1000377	We're pretty sure anyone who completes the facility's VR simulation program will gain access, but it requires a certain interface.
1DI1000378	Unfortunately, we don't have one. You do, right there on your wrist.
1DI1000379	I need you to go into the simulator and complete that program... which will unlock the armory. You'll get a share of the gear, of course.
1DI1000380	Wasting your time, am I? You're in MY house, reject. You'd do well to remember that. Now shut up and listen. This could be worth your while.
1DI1000382	We're pretty sure anyone who completes the facility's simulation program will gain access, but it requires a certain interface. Like your Pip-Boy.
1DI1000383	I need you to go into the simulator and complete that program... which will unlock the armory. Do that, and you'll get a share of the gear.
1DI1000384	I apologize for the gruffness of my men, but as you can see, everyone's under quite a bit of... duress. Maybe if I explain our situation?
1DI1000386	We're pretty sure anyone who completes the facility's VR sim program will gain access, but it requires a certain interface. Like your Pip-Boy.
1DI1000388	Ah, so you're a mercenary. Suddenly everything has become much clearer... All right, I'll get right to the point.
1DI1000392	You wasters, always thinking of yourselves.
1DI1000393	All right, look. I'm in a bind here. I need results from this expedition, and I need them now.
1DI1000394	If you can help us out, you get a cut of whatever we find locked up in here. You're not going to get a better deal from me than that.
1DI1000395	Look, local. I'm trying to be reasonable with you. Don't make me reconsider that decision.
1DI1000396	We'll be waiting for you.
1DI1000397	It's the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese Communists. It was a pretty significant event in American history, according to our Scribe.
1DI1000398	I won't lie to you. It's heavy combat -- safety protocols disengaged. That means you die in the sim... your body goes into massive cardiac arrest.
1DI1000399	You're still listening, so I'm going to assume you're interested. But time's wasting. Sibley can take you to the pod. Olin will get you briefed.
1DI1000400	If you want to walk away, you're free to leave. My men won't stop you.
1DI1000401	Well it's not. It's a hyper-realistic military training simulation of the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese Communists.
1DI1000402	This is heavy combat -- safety protocols off. That means you die in the sim... your body goes into massive cardiac arrest. Sim death... real death.
1DI1000405	Don't be so sure. It's the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese Communists. A pretty significant event in American history, I'm told.
1DI1000406	We're talking front line, heavy combat -- safety protocols disengaged. That means you die in the sim... your body goes into massive cardiac arrest.
1DI1000409	Umm.... Noooo....
1DI1000414	Very well. Sibley will take you to the simulator.
1DI1000415	Okay, good luck. And don't worry -- we'll be right here when you get out.
1DI1000416	Don't forget to put the Neural Interface suit on first. We can't hook you up until you're wearing it.
1DI1000417	Fine, great. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can leave.
1DI1000418	First you need to put on the Neural Interface suit, and then you can get going.
1DI1000419	Oh, I... I'm sorry. Things have been tense here lately, and I'm afraid it's getting the better of me.
1DI1000420	I shouldn't be taking it out on you. Did you need something?
1DI1000421	Look, if you're going to help out, then that's great. Just don't get in my way.
1DI1000422	Until you actually do something that helps us out, you're just one more liability.
1DI1000423	What? Is that some kind of joke?
1DI1000424	Look, you're only here because McGraw says we need you. Otherwise we'd have you on security outside, with the rest.
1DI1000426	Look, you're only here because McGraw says we need you. Otherwise you'd be out on your ass.
1DI1000427	Fine, hurry up then. What do you want?
1DI1000428	Same thing we're always doing: Locating technology, preserving it, and making sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
1DI1000429	McGraw thinks there's something of value here. I know not everyone agrees, but based on what I've seen I think he's right.
1DI1000430	We're doing our jobs. Locating technology, preserving it, and making sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
1DI1000431	Someone has to safeguard the future of the human race, right?
1DI1000433	The same thing we always do. Recover technology and preserve it, making sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
1DI1000434	McGraw's hope is that whatever's in here will give us a big advantage. I'm not convinced, but I'm on his side.
1DI1000435	Don't you know? This sim had to have been one of the most important of its time -- it's the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from the Chinese.
1DI1000436	Not up on your history, huh? Back before the world was nuked, the Chinese had invaded Anchorage, Alaska. That really amped things up.
1DI1000437	Eventually, the Americans went in and liberated the city, but there were heavy losses. This simulation trained soldiers for that engagement!
1DI1000438	Anyway, the technology here is impressive, but something's a bit off. Records suggest even some of the people who built this didn't understand it.
1DI1000439	*Sigh* I find your level of ignorance disgusting... if not unexpected.
1DI1000440	This sim had to have been one of the most important of its time -- it's the liberation of Anchorage, Alaska from the Chinese.
1DI1000442	Really, you must brush up on your history.
1DI1000443	The simulation needs an external interface device to run correctly. I'm not exactly sure why, the records on that are spotty at best.
1DI1000444	We figured out that your Pip-Boy there will suffice. Since you're kind of attached to it, you go along with it.
1DI1000445	You should be fine... Assuming you can actually get some results.
1DI1000446	Well, I suppose if you don't mind us hacking off your forearm, we don't really.
1DI1000447	The sim is looking for an external interface. I haven't quite figured out why, but there's no way to bypass it.
1DI1000448	Your Pip-Boy there is a match. So since you're the one wearing it, you're the one running through the simulation. Get it?
1DI1000449	Are you kidding me?
1DI1000450	Listen, chump. You're here because McGraw says we need you. You're not here to make small talk.
1DI1000451	You're sure as hell not here to get anything out of me, so quit trying.
1DI1000452	I got loads of problems, chump. You don't want to become one, so shut up and get in the... the simulator thing there. Move it!
1DI1000453	Uhh, sure. Sure thing, miss. I'll take you to Protector McGraw right now.
1DI1000454	You a wiseass, or just stupid?
1DI1000455	Okay, stupid, let's go see the boss.
1DI1000456	Matter of fact, I do mind. I mind enough to put a few rounds in you. Get me?
1DI1000457	You and me, we're going to see the boss, so he can decide what to do with you.
1DI1000458	Someplace you locals ain't supposed to be.
1DI1000459	But, ah... Since you're down here, let's go have a chat with the boss.
1DI1000460	Yessir.
1DI1000461	Noted, Defender. That'll be all.
1DI1000462	Sir, I'm going to say again that I don't like this idea.
1DI1000463	Thank you, Defender. Give us a moment, please.
1DI1000464	Here she is, Protector. Like you asked.
1DI1000465	Here he is, Protector. Like you asked.
1DI1000466	That'll be all, Defender. Thank you.
1DI1000467	Yeah, like I said, sorry Sir. Not my fault he ran in here. Listen, I still don't think this is a good idea.
1DI1000468	Yeah, like I said, sorry Sir. Not my fault she ran in here. Listen, I still don't think this is a good idea.
1DI1000469	You were supposed to keep an eye on our guest, Defender.
1DI1000470	Sorry, sir. Here he is, like you asked.
1DI1000471	Sorry, sir. Here she is, like you asked.
1DI1000472	What's going on is this whole mission is one big rat-fuck. We've been stuck here for way too long with no results.
1DI1000473	McGraw won't give up, so we've stooped to using chumps like you to try and get something out of this place.
1DI1000474	Fine, then get out and let me do my job.
1DI1000475	Sure, whatever. Just make some progress, okay? We're all looking to get out of here.
1DI1000476	Go to hell, Sibley. You know that wasn't my fault.
1DI1000477	Yep. Let's hope you treat this one better than the last guy, huh? Heh heh.
1DI1000479	Knock knock, Olin. Got a new best friend for you.
1DI1000480	Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
1DI1000481	Look, we ain't gonna be friends when this is all over, so the less talking we do now the happier I am, got it?
1DI1000482	Yeah, I almost bought it out on the cliffs. Didn't know the Reds were so handy with a Sniper Rifle.
1DI1000483	So, what's the situation? We clear to blow the hell out of this place?
1DI1000486	Yeah, yeah. Don't break your arm patting yourself on the back, rookie. You took the easy way in.
1DI1000488	I got your six.
1DI1000489	Yeah, I can spare a few rounds.
1DI1000490	And I'm supposed to kill the Chinese with what? Snowballs? Sorry, that's all I can give ya.
1DI1000491	No sweat. You're on point, rookie.
1DI1000492	That was a hell of a nasty fall you took. When your chute bunched up like that I thought you were a goner. I hope the other guys made it...
1DI1000493	I don't think their patrols spotted us coming in, so at least we still have the jump on 'em.
1DI1000494	You still have your gear, so I'm gonna let you make the call. You can go in quiet or guns blazing.
1DI1000495	We'll still meet at the rendezvous point inside as planned then we'll blow those artillery guns to hell.
1DI1000496	Just watch yourself. The Reds up here don't take prisoners. Good luck!
1DI1000497	Okay... pay attention, soldier. I'm only going to go through this once.
1DI1000498	We've set up our new Field H.Q. down here. The area is pretty secure now that the Artillery Guns are gone.
1DI1000499	The first of the three targets we need to handle is their Chimera Depot over here.
1DI1000500	Be careful on your approach, you're going to have to get through the Enemy Camp on the way.
1DI1000501	Once you breach the perimeter of the Depot, you need to take out both of the main fuel tanks.
1DI1000502	Your second target is all the way over here. The Chinese have set up a listening post set into the side of Calliway Ridge.
1DI1000503	There are some abandoned mines along the route, so keep your eyes and ears open. It's a great place for an ambush.
1DI1000504	You need to clear the place of personnel so we can get our intelligence boys in there to start decoding.
1DI1000505	Once the first two targets are down, the last obstacle standing in the way is their damn Pulse Field.
1DI1000506	You need to cross it then cause it to overload so we can mop up the place with the T-51b's.
1DI1000507	Let me warn you now. Unless you have some sort of a death wish, I wouldn't even go near the field until the first two targets are down.
1DI1000508	Lieutenant Morgan will be your eyes and ears for Operation Anchorage, so get everything else you need from him.
1DI1000509	Uncle Sam's invested a lot of money turning you into a killing machine... time to pay him back. Dismissed.
1DI1000510	At ease, soldier. We're all a bit strung out from the last Commie bombing run on our Field H.Q.
1DI1000511	We lost some good men including my Strike Team Commander, Colonel Patterson.
1DI1000512	We're all a bit strung out from the last Commie bombing run on our Field H.Q.
1DI1000514	Soldier, you're fixing to have a size 10 combat boot shoved up your candy ass.
1DI1000515	Your attitude's just earned you a demerit. I don't want to hear that kind of talk out of you again. Is that crystal clear enough now?
1DI1000516	Unfortunately while you were up there climbing mountains, we were down here getting our butts kicked.
1DI1000517	The Chinese decided to use our Field H.Q. for target practice and damn near blew us all to pieces.
1DI1000519	No need to thank me. I know a genuine true-blooded soldier when I see one... and that's why I sent you.
1DI1000523	Now hold on there, soldier. You see these fancy little gold stars on my uniform?
1DI1000524	I spent a lot of time getting them, and I'll be damned if some punk like you isn't going to address me properly.
1DI1000525	While I appreciate your enthusiasm in this operation, there's still protocol to be maintained. Are we clear?
1DI1000526	This is no simulation, soldier! That's real blood you see out there on the snow!
1DI1000527	I got enough to worry about without some hotshot like you breaking protocol. Now get it together... you have a job to do. Am I clear, soldier?
1DI1000528	I didn't call you down here for a pep talk and cigars. You've earned yourself a field promotion, soldier.
1DI1000529	As of this moment you're taking over Patterson's Strike Team.
1DI1000530	And before you thank me, you better wait and see what your mission entails.
1DI1000531	Damn Red bastards... can't wait to push them all the way back to Beijing.
1DI1000532	But I didn't call you down here for a pep talk and cigars. You've earned yourself a field promotion, soldier.
1DI1000533	From this moment on, you're in charge of Patterson's Strike Team.
1DI1000534	Commie sons-of-bitches. It'll be a cold day in hell before I let them cross Canada into the mainland.
1DI1000535	But enough of that. I called you down here for a reason.
1DI1000536	You've earned yourself a field promotion, soldier. From this moment on, you're in charge of Patterson's Strike Team.
1DI1000537	There are three hardened targets that stand between us and the Chinese Headquarters. That's where your Strike Team comes in.
1DI1000538	Follow me over to the situation map and I'll bring you up to speed.
1DI1000539	Well you'd better be, soldier. We're running short on time and that was NOT an offer, that was an order.
1DI1000540	We have three hardened targets we need your team to handle otherwise Operation Anchorage will be dead in the water.
1DI1000542	Hell, saluting is the least I can do. Do you have any idea how many of our guys you saved by taking out those guns?
1DI1000543	Simulation? What the hell are you talking about? This is as real as it gets, G.I.
1DI1000544	And thanks to you, a lot of guys are still vertical. Those artillery guns were pounding the crap out of our soldiers!
1DI1000545	You deserve it, sir.
1DI1000546	You have no idea how many lives you saved by destroying those guns.
1DI1000548	Oh ho! Listen to this guy!
1DI1000549	What kind of a role model do you expect to be for your men with that kind of hot air coming out of you?
1DI1000550	All in a day's work he says. Yeah sure... every day I wake up and single-handedly infiltrate a Commie infested base on a suicide mission.
1DI1000551	With a role model like you, our boys are gonna turn into killing machines!
1DI1000552	Who cares?
1DI1000553	Lemme take a close look at you. Hmmm. Nope, I don't see any tin plating. You don't look like a robot.
1DI1000554	Come on. You have no idea what kind of a role model you are for these boys. They look up to you now. You need to set an example.
1DI1000555	That's the spirit, buddy!
1DI1000556	Now onto bigger and better things, eh?
1DI1000557	We all want to get through this. None of us asked to be here. We ALL left things behind when this shit started.
1DI1000558	Some of the guys out here are falling apart. We need guys like you to keep them focused; make them think they're going to get home one day.
1DI1000559	Wow, this place must really be getting to you.
1DI1000560	Look... we all want to get through this. None of us asked to be here. We ALL left things behind when this shit started.
1DI1000562	Subroutines? This is an Army gig, not the Navy. You sure those artillery guns going off didn't shake something loose up there?
1DI1000567	Don't worry. We WILL get through this. I'll be there every step of the way to give you a hand.
1DI1000568	Fine. I guess we have a job to do, so let's get to it.
1DI1000569	Everyone's ready to go kick some Commie ass... sir.
1DI1000570	What are your orders?
1DI1000571	Yes sir. What are your orders?
1DI1000573	Hey, all I got to keep me warm out here in this freezebox is my sense of humor.
1DI1000574	Anyway, I'm here to give you a hand with Intelligence and Logistics. Whatever you need, I'm your guy.
1DI1000575	Do I really have to answer that? You aren't going after civilian targets you know... this is the big leagues.
1DI1000577	None of us did. We all just end up doing what we're supposed to do and hopefully make the enemy die in the process.
1DI1000579	Don't worry about it. Sergeant Montgomery will be your squad commander and he knows all the in's and out's of the team.
1DI1000580	If you need anything, like reinforcements or status reports, just speak to him.
1DI1000581	So, what else can I do for you before you hit the field?
1DI1000585	Ha ha! Cocky bastard, aren't ya? You planning on taking on the whole Red Army alone?
1DI1000586	Just stick with Sergeant Montgomery. He'll be your squad commander and he knows all the in's and out's of the team.
1DI1000589	That's my specialty. What target did you need a report on?
1DI1000590	You've got two fuel tanks to destroy. One in the central courtyard of the facility and one near the rear gate.
1DI1000591	This place is one tough nut to crack. Not only do you have the Chimeras to contend with, but the place is heavily populated by infantry.
1DI1000592	Oh, this place is a honey pot, lemme tell you.
1DI1000593	Not only is it swarming with regular ground troops, but they've put their best guys in there as well, the Crimson Dragoons.
1DI1000594	I hear those guys start training as soldiers right from the womb, so watch yourself in there.
1DI1000595	The problem out there isn't the Field itself... I mean, you wouldn't be foolish enough to drag robots out there with you.
1DI1000596	The place is crawling with their stealth units... the Crimson Dragoons.
1DI1000597	If you spot something out of the corner of your eye, shoot first and ask questions later or it's the last thing you'll ever see.
1DI1000598	Sorry, that's all Uncle Sam is going to issue ya. Maybe you could find some more stuff out there in the field.
1DI1000599	Can do. Just use the Requisition Terminal here in the Command Tent.
1DI1000600	Pick whatever loadout you need and the terminal will dispense a Requisition Tape. Bring it to the Quartermaster Officer and you're all set.
1DI1000601	The government sure loves its paperwork, doesn't it?
1DI1000602	Uncle Sam's made it really easy for you. All you have to do is use Patterson's Terminal here in the Command Tent.
1DI1000603	Use the Recruitment Markers I gave you and choose your team members any way you see fit.
1DI1000604	Then head outside to the Barracks and your units will be ready to go.
1DI1000605	No way. The bigger your Strike Team, the bigger your footprint on all of the Chinese sensing devices. You need to think small.
1DI1000606	The Recruitment Markers I gave you will recommend what size you keep your team in order to maintain the smallest footprint possible.
1DI1000607	So to put it simply, you pick a big clunky robot, and you won't have much room left in the team for many other units. You decide.
1DI1000608	You can always speak to your Strike Team squad leader and requisition a new unit if you've lost one.
1DI1000609	Sure, what did you need to know?
1DI1000611	Put simply, it's a co-opted mining rig that's been changed into an armored vehicle -- bigger and tougher than any tank we have in our arsenal.
1DI1000612	The Chinese fitted the vehicle with multiple weapons, reinforced the armor and outfitted them for long range.
1DI1000613	Take the Explosive Charges I gave you and locate both of the fuel tanks. Just stick 'em on and boom. Couldn't be easier.
1DI1000614	I wouldn't stand too close to admire your handiwork, though. The fireball will likely take your head off.
1DI1000615	Well, I don't know about you, but if I was running across the main battlefield I'd like a few less of those monstrosities shooting at me.
1DI1000616	Take out the Depot and they have nowhere to rearm and refuel their armor. Otherwise, they'll blast your team to bits.
1DI1000619	Basically, you need to clear it of all personnel and make it safe for occupation by our troops.
1DI1000620	It's a little bit of a rat hunt though, since you'll have to poke around inside the facility and root them out one-by-one.
1DI1000621	The Chinese have a team of commandos they call their Crimson Dragoons. They're pretty much the best soldiers they've got.
1DI1000622	That Listening Post is filled with those units. I'd be extra careful in there if I were you -- they aren't about to give that place up lightly.
1DI1000623	Well the Chinese Army not only uses the Listening Post to spot our forces and relay battle information, they also use it for air traffic control.
1DI1000624	If we can get a hold of that facility, we can stop them from bombing the living hell out of us any chance they get.
1DI1000625	What did you need to know?
1DI1000626	Well, it generates a grid-based, localized electromagnetic pulse. Anything mechanical that goes through there gets all its circuits fried.
1DI1000627	The only thing that can punch through their defenses there are the T-51b's, so you can see the problem.
1DI1000628	There's a bunker the Chinese have set up to monitor the area somewhere beyond the emitters.
1DI1000629	An operator in the bunker can deactivate the field to allow their own guys to pass through unharmed.
1DI1000630	If you can get to the bunker, you could set the field to overload and blow it out permanently.
1DI1000631	Yup. If you take down the Pulse Field, we'll send the T-51b shock troops in to blast through their defenses, and then it's on to the Headquarters.
1DI1000632	Okay, whatever you need.
1DI1000633	With the General's death, our boys can secure this refinery and be on their way to Anchorage proper.
1DI1000634	You've helped pave the way for taking the city back from the Reds, soldier. Good work.
1DI1000635	You've also gone above and beyond the call of duty by recovering important enemy intel and exposing their plans to us. Again, well done soldier.
1DI1000636	That'll complete this portion of your training. Report to your superior for debriefing and your next assignment.
1DI1000642	This concludes the simulation, and this portion of your training. But if you're thirsty for more, soldier, your commanding officer can oblige.
1DI1000643	You've shown that you've got what it takes. There's a possible promotion in your future, if you keep your head on straight.
1DI1000645	Good work, soldier. When you exit the simulation, report to your superiors for debriefing. Dismissed!
1DI1000649	You've got an attitude problem, soldier, and this simulation is going to recommend a swift kick in the ass to correct it.
1DI1000650	However, you've more than made up for it by recovering important enemy intel and exposing their plans to us so I'll overlook your attitude.
1DI1000651	Since you've completed the training, it's time to report to your commanding officer for your debriefing. Dismissed!
1DI1000654	Well, it's about goddamned time.
1DI1000655	You will never take me prisoner!
1DI1000656	Surrender? Never!
1DI1000657	I'll see your blood on my blade before today is done!
1DI1000658	This is Montgomery to Field H.Q. We are go for the attack! Send in the tin cans! I repeat, we are go for the attack!
1DI1000659	You're not sitting in that thing unless you're wearing the suit for it. I'm not going to have you fry the circuits.
1DI1000660	Normally I'd never consider this, but I probably wouldn't be alive if it weren't for you. I'd say that warrants an exception.
1DI1000661	All right, let's take a look.
1DI1000663	I should be able to help.
1DI1000664	This is a high priority message, back-up is needed at our location.
1DI1000665	Any personnel listening on this frequency, please report at once.
1DI1000666	Help yourself. Anything you need should be in the ammo crates.
1DI1000668	Understood, sir.
1DI1000669	Affirmative, sir.
1DI1000670	Right away, sir.
1DI1000671	You got it, sir.
1DI1000672	No problem, they should arrive shortly.
1DI1000673	Missile Unit on its way, sir.
1DI1000674	They'll be here momentarily, sir.
1DI1000675	Command will send it right out to us, sir.
1DI1000676	It's on its way from the motor pool as we speak, sir.
1DI1000677	No problem, sir.
1DI1000678	As soon as we take out the Pulse Field, I'll radio Chase to send in the shock troops.
1DI1000679	They're wearing the T-51b Power Armor. We'll see how well the Reds handle all of us charging into their headquarters.
1DI1000680	The fuel tanks at the Chimera Depot need to be destroyed. Then we can move on to deactivating the Pulse Field.
1DI1000681	The Listening Post still needs to be secured, and then the Pulse Field needs to be deactivated.
1DI1000682	Well, they're pretty much untouched. The Listening Post needs to be secured and the fuel tanks at the Chimera Depot need to be destroyed.
1DI1000683	Of course, after all that's done, the Pulse Field still needs to be deactivated.
1DI1000684	Sorry, that's all we're allowed to distribute.
1DI1000685	If you have a complaint, make sure you lodge it in writing using the standard 10-78BGHCF Form.
1DI1000686	Yeah sure. Just get me a new Requisition Form.
1DI1000687	You can only change your gear once, though. We've got limited weapons out here in the sticks. Anything else you'll have to scavenge from the field.
1DI1000688	Hell, you earned a lot of respect with the soldiers for what you did to those Chinese artillery guns.
1DI1000689	Tell you what... take this extra gear with you, requisitions be damned. If anyone asks, it fell off a truck.
1DI1000690	Good, good. Keep monitoring the battlefield and let me know when we've punched through the Pulse Field.
1DI1000691	Well, tell those men they need to be ready. As soon as the Pulse Field is down, we need them cocked, locked and ready to rock.
1DI1000692	Well you tell them that if they want their viable liberation contingency ready in case Operation: Anchorage fails, they need to get off their asses!
1DI1000693	I'd say about 20 percent, sir. But that number significantly decreases if we can get the tin cans in there.
1DI1000694	The T-51b units are at 95 percent readiness level. We've had a bit of trouble adapting them to the cold.
1DI1000695	Sorry sir, they said the technicians are still dragging their heels a bit on the fusion power plant issues.
1DI1000698	Heavy hitter!
1DI1000699	Explosives out!
1DI1000703	Fall back! Fall back, dammit!
1DI1000706	Spit it out, soldier.
1DI1000707	You got somethin' to say, say it.
1DI1000708	I'm listening...
1DI1000709	Come on, I don't have all day. What's up?
1DI1000710	Don't you get the feeling that this is all just a waste of time? I mean, how do we REALLY know that simulation gives access to the tech?
1DI1000711	It's just... I don't know, I feel kind of bad about that Gary guy. Not his fault the Pip-Boy didn't work. Did we really need to... you know.
1DI1000712	Look, we've been dropping like Bloatflies lately. How long can we keep those Frankensteins at bay? One more focused attack, and we're all dead.
1DI1000713	Just... If Casdin were in charge, we would have had the tech and been back at Fort Independence yesterday. Protector McGraw is in over his head.
1DI1000714	You ever wonder what they're doing? You know, back at the Citadel? I mean, sure, Lyons went off-mission... but it wasn't a bad life, was it?
1DI1000715	This is such a wild goose chase. Lost tech? Please. Only thing we're going to find in this tomb is canned peaches and moldy blankets.
1DI1000716	Let's say we DO find some really high-grade tech. Seems to me, a group of enterprising grunts could strike off on their own. Go... independent.
1DI1000717	Just hear me out. I've been thinking  imagine what a group like Talon Company could do with the two of us. Huh? You and me,  goin' merc...
1DI1000718	Well. I, um... Listen, when all this is over, I... I think I might go back. Not to the Citadel! I mean, all the way back. You know, back west.
1DI1000719	What? You cannot be serious. Just... stop talking. You're going to get us both killed.
1DI1000720	Have you lost your mind? If the Protector hears you talking like that...
1DI1000721	Troop, you are having a serious malfunction... Would you listen to yourself? That's treason!
1DI1000722	Huh? What are you TALKING about? Look, would you just... just get back to your assignment. I'm not listening to this.
1DI1000723	I don't know where this is coming from soldier, but I've heard enough. Button it, or I'll report you myself.
1DI1000724	No! No, no, no no. You want to talk crazy, do it someplace else. I'm keeping my mouth shut and following orders.
1DI1000725	Oh, not again! You've got to shake this stuff off. Get your head clear. You're an Outcast, now, just like the rest of us. Deal with it already. Okay?
1DI1000726	I know, I know... It's just...
1DI1000727	Oh, get off your high horse! You see what's happening around here. We've been falling apart since we left the Citadel. I'm sick of it!
1DI1000728	Yeah, but... I mean...
1DI1000729	Come on, you know I'm right! I overheard what you said yesterday.
1DI1000730	Oh. But I just thought... You know...
1DI1000731	Wait, wait! What I MEANT to say, was that, um...
1DI1000732	Right, like you're the model of well adjustment. I see the way you eye McGraw. You'd cut and run if the opportunity presented itself. Admit it.
1DI1000733	I thought you'd understand. You of all people. I guess I was wrong.
1DI1000734	This conversation's over.
1DI1000735	Do us both a favor and walk away, and forget this conversation ever took place.
1DI1000736	Get away from me, moron. And pray I don't report you.
1DI1000737	Ugh! No more. Just... no more.
1DI1000738	You still here? Cause some of us have orders to follow.
1DI1000739	Dismissed, soldier.
1DI1000740	Treason. That's the word, soldier. Think about it while you're getting the hell away from me. Now shoo.
1DI1000741	Enough! Okay? You go down, I ain't letting you drag me down with you.
1DI1000742	Back off, troop, or I WILL report your sorry ass.
1DI1000743	All I need is a weapon at my front and you sons o' bitches at my back. I'm ready to get this thing done.
1DI1000744	I'm ready to kill me some Commies, I can tell you that much.
1DI1000745	I ever tell you I got an aunt lives in Anchorage? She's in there... somewhere. And God help me, I'm gonna get those Reds out of her backyard.
1DI1000746	Man, Anchorage ain't nothin'. You know what all this is? Practice. Next stop, Shanghai. Just you wait.
1DI1000747	You know me. My day ain't complete unless I've killed me some Reds. So let's start the killin' already...
1DI1000748	I'm feelin' that "twitch" in my eyebrow. You, know, that one I get when there are Commies around. Gonna be a fun day!
1DI1000749	What good's having a weapon if they won't let me use it? Pal, I am ready to flick the safety off and engage.
1DI1000750	Well, don't you go actin' the hero on me, all right? You'll hog all the medals, like last time.
1DI1000751	Yeah, well, you just remember you're not a one-man army, and you may live long enough to enjoy the victory.
1DI1000752	Oh, that's right. You signed up for this crap. Sometimes I forget you actually like killing people. Maybe we can just send you in by yourself.
1DI1000753	Spoken like a true defender of freedom. Just don't go doin' anything stupid out there, okay? Remember, I'll be standing next to you.
1DI1000754	I just want to get in there, kill a couple Reds for good measure, and then get my ass back to base camp.
1DI1000755	Well, now, remember... We got a lot of damn Chinese to kill. Millions of 'em. You're gonna have to step up your game. Do some real soldierin'.
1DI1000756	I haven't died yet, have I? In fact, I'm startin' to think I'm indestructible. Like some kind of superhero. You can call me... "Supergrunt."
1DI1000757	Soldier, you just stick with me. We'll be the most highly decorated soldiers in the Army when this thing is done.
1DI1000758	Hey, I'll do whatever it takes. You know why? If I don't protect the weak -- you know, people like you -- who will?
1DI1000759	Well, I do have a sort of "secondary objective" I need to get done. My kid brother back home wants one of them Chinese guns. Things could get ugly.
1DI1000760	We will crush them!
1DI1000761	Destroy them all!
1DI1000762	Get them! Get them all!
1DI1000764	We'll be here.
1DI1000768	Remember that your Strike Team members got families too you know. Let's send 'em home alive instead of in a pine box, got it?
1DI1000769	Stock up on ammo at the Quartermaster's tent. You're gonna need it.
1DI1000770	Take out some of those Commies for Patterson and all the other guys we lost.
1DI1000771	Better dead than Red, right?
1DI1000772	You watch yourself out there... the Chinese Army is one of the best fighting forces on Earth.
1DI1000773	Good luck out there.
1DI1000774	Affirmative, sir. I'll inform them of your, ummm, displeasure at their progress.
1DI1000775	Absolutely sir. I'll make sure they're ready.
1DI1000777	Okay, now you're just babblin'. I'll talk to ya later.
1DI1000778	You're crazy, you know that?
1DI1000779	Riiiiggghhhtt...
1DI1000780	We live through this, and you're buying the beers.
1DI1000781	It's like talking to a child sometimes, you know that?
1DI1000782	Look, I'm sorry if I upset you. Okay? I'll just... get back to my duties now. No problem.
1DI1000783	Well that was a waste of time...
1DI1000784	Think about what I said.
1DI1000786	*Sigh.* Whatever.
1DI1000787	Okay, okay. I'm going. But I'm right. You know I'm right.
1DI1000788	Pfft. All right. I'll leave you alone, so you can pretend everything is fine. But you're kidding yourself, you know that.
1DI1000789	I'm leaving, already!
1DI1000790	All right, all right. Forget I said anything.
1DI1000791	Wow, okay, I'm sorry. I was just... kidding...
1DI1000792	Everything well with you? We're still busy cataloging all the gear you uncovered.
1DI1000793	Dropped by for another visit? Bring any good tech with you?
1DI1000794	Welcome back. We're still picking up the pieces from the... incident.
1DI1000795	You've saved us. Sibley would've had the upper hand if you hadn't been here.
1DI1000796	We'll be here for a while, cataloging all the tech. If you need anything, you come see us.
1DI1000797	You may not be one of us, but you're the next best thing.
1DI1000798	Thank you for helping. Sibley would've gotten the best of me if you weren't here.
1DI1000799	It's a damn shame about Olin, but she died well.
1DI1000801	It's been an honor working with you. I don't think I've ever seen bravery like that on any battlefield.
1DI1000802	Hopefully, after we mop up the mess in Anchorage, we can get together and have a couple of beers.
1DI1000803	Stay safe, soldier.
1DI1000804	It's been a pleasure, soldier.
1DI1000806	All that's left is General Jingwei. We take him out, and we've won Anchorage. Let's do it!
1DI1000807	This is it! Throw that switch and we can send in the T-51b's.
1DI1000808	All right, now it's just you and me. Let's go take down the Pulse Field!
1DI1000809	Let's get in there and finish this!
1DI1000810	We'll get this place opened up in no time! Stand back!
1DI1000811	Everything okay? Nothing's changed out here, so you can't be done...
1DI1000812	You fool! You will be crushed by the might of the Chinese Army!
1DI1000813	Go on, take whatever you like. I never break my promises.
1DI1000814	All right, let's get this door open.
1DI1000815	We should be able to access the restricted areas now. Let's hope it's been worth all this time.
1DI1000816	Good job making it through that simulation. All you have to do now is open the Armory.
1DI1000817	And, as agreed, you get your share. Feel free to take whatever you want. If our records are right, there's plenty for all of us.
1DI1000818	That'll do, soldier. Stand down!
1DI1000819	You've hit the targets, now the only thing left is the refinery. Good luck.
1DI1000820	The simulation has concluded, soldier.
1DI1000821	The objective's in sight, soldier! Your place is out there on the field!
1DI1000822	There better be somethin' good behind that door...
1DI1000823	Well, what are you waiting for? Let's get this door open.
1DI1000824	Attack on the Mining Town is in progress, sir. I'll give you a new update when the objective is complete.
1DI1000825	The Mining Town is crawling with Commie forces, sir. We're holding up here for the moment.
1DI1000827	The Mining Town is now secured, sir. Awaiting your new orders.
1DI1000828	Attacking the Listening Post as ordered, sir.  I'll give you a new update when the objective is complete.
1DI1000829	The Listening Post is up ahead, sir. I can smell the Reds from here.
1DI1000831	Listening Post secured, sir. Awaiting new orders.
1DI1000832	Attacking the Ice Camp as ordered, sir. I'll update you once the objective is completed.
1DI1000833	Ice Camp's right around the bend, sir. We're holding up here for the moment.
1DI1000835	Ice Camp secured, sir. Awaiting further orders.
1DI1000836	What are your orders for the Strike Team, sir?
1DI1000837	I'm on my way out, sir.
1DI1000839	The Sergeant wants to speak with you.
1DI1000840	Sergeant Montgomery wants to talk to you.
1DI1000841	Ah, thank you for responding to our distress call.
1DI1000842	All right, follow me. I'll take you to Protector McGraw.
1DI1000843	You're the backup? Great. Just great.
1DI1000847	Please, come this way. And be careful what you touch - some of this equipment is rather delicate.
1DI1000848	All right, you. Keep your weapons holstered, your hands to yourself, and your mouth shut. Follow me.
1DI1000849	Who the hell are you, and what do you think you're doing?
1DI1000850	You're here to help? Fine, then put this on, get in the chair, and we'll run the simulation.
1DI1000851	You've got the suit, so put it on and get in the simulator.
1DI1000852	Kind of busy, here.
1DI1000853	So this thing is some kind of training sim, near as we can figure. Guess you can tell us more when you come out.
1DI1000854	Come on, let's move it. I ain't got all day.
1DI1000855	You getting in there, or what?
1DI1000856	Come on. I'll show you to the command room.
1DI1000857	So you're the one Morrill sent down.
1DI1000858	Except you're not one of us, are you? I'll have to have a little chat with Morrill about that.
1DI1000859	But... you do have that computer there on your wrist. Hmph. I can see now that Morrill made the right call. Maybe you can be useful after all...
1DI1000861	I'll be perfectly honest -- I'd trust a Wastelander to shine my Power Armor, and even that's pushing it.
1DI1000863	Look, Wastelander. I'm not sure what brings you here, but we don't like surprise visits from the local populace. You're lucky you weren't killed.
1DI1000864	But... Maybe there's more to you than the average rubble dweller, hmm? That computer there on your wrist...
1DI1000865	Maybe you can be useful to us after all...
1DI1000866	This is a pre-war research facility. There's technology to be had, and I am determined to have it.
1DI1000867	Unfortunately, it's locked up tight. As far as we can tell, it's linked into some kind of simulator.
1DI1000868	But we can't access the simulator, because we lack the proper interface. Your little computer there is exactly what we're looking for.
1DI1000869	So, I'll make you a deal. You access the simulator and get us into the rest of this base, and I'll give you a cut of what we find.
1DI1000870	"Payment for Services Rendered." You help us, and we'll help you.
1DI1000871	I've said my piece. If you're interested in assisting, follow Sibley to the simulation pod. Olin will help get you jacked into the sim.
1DI1000873	I hope you've got half a brain in that head. You could be useful to us.
1DI1000874	Head inside, soldier. Report to McGraw and then get back out here to help us fortify these defenses.
1DI1000875	Protector McGraw's inside, Sir, like I said. You'll want to speak to him.
1DI1000876	Protector McGraw's inside, Ma'am, like I said. You'll want to speak to him.
1DI1000877	Nice work out there, soldier. Thanks for the back-up, but where's the rest of your detachment?
1DI1000878	Head on into the base and talk to McGraw. I'll let him know you're coming. Don't worry, they won't shoot you.
1DI1000879	Could you have been any more useless out there? You don't deserve to wear that armor after that display! Explain yourself, soldier!
1DI1000880	All right, now who the hell are you, and what do you think you're doing wearing that armor?
1DI1000881	Give me one good reason why I shouldn't put you down right now, outsider.
1DI1000882	Don't think for one second I didn't see what you're wearing. If you hadn't actually helped out here, I'd have put you down along with these mutants.
1DI1000883	You've got about three seconds to explain yourself, outsider.
1DI1000884	All right local, mind explaining what you're doing here?
1DI1000885	Damned guard detail!  That sounded like a good ruckus.
1DI1000886	You can go ahead and stop right there.  Who the hell are you?
1DI1000887	Well?  You headed down or not?
1DI1000888	I'm a little busy right now!
1DI1000889	Morrill will explain at the base. Focus on those mutants for now!
1DI1000890	Stick with us until we make it through to the base!
1DI1000891	Take that elevator and report in to Defender Sibley.
1DI1000892	I think Defender Sibley's going to want to talk with you. Take that elevator down into the base.
1DI1000893	Defender Morrill's going to want to talk with you.
1DI1000894	Stop gawking at me and get going, soldier.
1DI1000895	Lieutenant Morgan will give you all the details. Carry on.
1DI1000896	You've got a job to do, soldier. Now hop to it!
1DI1000897	So... you're in charge of Patterson's Suicide Squad, huh?
1DI1000898	So... what can the Intelligence Corps do for you?
1DI1000899	Questions?
1DI1000900	Hope the operation is going well.
1DI1000901	I'd get over to the map and listen to the General's briefing if I were you.
1DI1000902	That should be the last of them, and the last of the bombing runs on our guys, thanks to you.
1DI1000903	I'm going to order our men back to the Field H.Q. See you there.
1DI1000904	Nice work. They've been rolling those Chimeras all over us for months... good to see 'em out of commission for a while.
1DI1000905	I'm going to order the Strike Team back to the Field H.Q. See you there.
1DI1000906	Well, looks like we're working together again, sir. General Chase assigned me to the Strike Team.
1DI1000907	And thanks to your promotion, I guess I'll be saluting you from now on.
1DI1000908	What are your orders, sir?
1DI1000909	Stow the chit-chat and let's take out those guns.
1DI1000910	Keep your eyes peeled for Commies. They're around, I can smell 'em.
1DI1000911	What is this, a break? Keep moving.
1DI1000912	Goddamn this place is swarming with Reds. I almost didn't make it.
1DI1000913	We don't have time for this... just get inside the base and meet me at the rendezvous.
1DI1000914	No time for talk. Get inside that base and meet me at the rendezvous.
1DI1000915	I'll meet you at the rendezvous. Now go!
1DI1000916	Damn fine work you did taking out those guns. Damn fine!
1DI1000917	The General is waiting to speak to you... and he hates waiting.
1DI1000918	Good luck, soldier. Everyone back home's rooting for you. Who knows, maybe your mug will end up on the front page of the Capital Post!
1DI1000919	Good luck, G.I. We're all counting on you!
1DI1000920	Congratulations on making it to the HQ. It's pretty fierce out there. Here's your chem ration. I'm doctor Adami. Come see me if you need patching up.
1DI1000921	Well, you're not dead. That's good. Hold still while I patch you up.
1DI1000922	Back again? Well, I'm glad you came in on your own, and not in a body bag. Now be still while I fix you up.
1DI1000923	Let's get you up to 100% , shall we? Uncle Sam needs you back in the fight! Hold still a moment.
1DI1000924	Thanks. Look, I've got to get back to HQ. I Found some papers before I got caught. Good hunting!
1DI1000925	Goddamn Commies caught me with my pants down. Don't tell anyone you found me like this, all right?
1DI1000926	They took us by surprise. I was the lucky one. Thanks for the rescue!
1DI1000927	Thank God! I thought I was a goner.
1DI1000928	Am I glad to see you!
1DI1000929	Thanks again! I'm out of here!
1DI1000930	You really have time to stand here and chat? We've got work to do.
1DI1000932	Nothing noteworthy to report, sir.
1DI1000933	Those Commies don't stand a chance, sir.
1DI1000934	We'll crush the Commies soon, won't we, sir?
1DI1000936	What did you need, soldier?
1DI1000937	Come back for a loadout change?
1DI1000938	Remember, that gear's property of Uncle Sam. Hope you didn't get it dinged up too badly...
1DI1000939	Back for some new gear?
1DI1000940	I'm not turning over anything to you until I have that Requisition Holo.
1DI1000941	You need to get a Requisition Holo before I can hand out gear -- you should know that!
1DI1000942	Sorry, no Requisition Holo, no gear. This ain't a library.
1DI1000944	Carry on. I've got this in hand.
1DI1000946	If you're here to help, then help. If not... back off.
1DI1000947	If you didn't notice, I'm busy. Get lost.
1DI1000948	Find someone else to bother, local.
1DI1000951	Nice work in there, soldier.
1DI1000952	Old games are no match for us Outcasts, huh?
1DI1000953	You did us proud in there.
1DI1000954	Good work, for a local.
1DI1000955	Never would have thought a savage could do it.
1DI1000956	Thanks, I guess.
1DI1000957	Oh, great. Just what we need.
1DI1000958	Keep moving, local.
1DI1000959	Hey... hey! Wake up. Come on... snap out of it.
1DI1000960	The General is very anxious to speak with you.
1DI1000962	Hell of a job you're doing soldier. America's watching. I'm making sure of that.
1DI1000963	Sir!
1DI1000964	Lieutenant Thomas Morgan, Intelligence and Logistics at your service. I point, you shoot.
1DI1000965	Next stop, Chinese H.Q. Keep it going!
1DI1000966	Just got the confirmation that the Listening Post is ours. Now that's what I'm talking about!
1DI1000967	Radar confirms that the Chinese Bombers are flying in circles now that we have the Listening Post. Nice one!
1DI1000968	Boom! Scratch one Chimera Depot. Nice work!
1DI1000969	Good work on the Chimera fuel tanks. Half of their division is dead in the water.
1DI1000970	The rest of the Operation should make the Artillery Guns feel like a walk in the park.
1DI1000971	Welcome back to H.Q.
1DI1000972	Anything else that I&L can help with?
1DI1000973	The U.S. Army needs more soldiers like you. Carry on.
1DI1000974	Let's wrap this thing up, soldier. We're cold, we're tired and we want our goddamn oil back!
1DI1000975	Damn Chinese Communists are stomping all over us. Time for us to pay them back.
1DI1000976	I think it's time to show those Red bastards what the U.S. Army is all about.
1DI1000977	Those targets can't secure themselves. You've got a job to do, soldier... now snap to it.
1DI1000978	You're doing a man's job, soldier. Keep it up!
1DI1000979	Carry on, soldier.
1DI1000980	Any word from Washington on my latest request?
1DI1000981	How's our boys in the suits doing?
1DI1000982	What are we looking at for losses if we pull this off?
1DI1000983	So... you ready for this?
1DI1000984	How you feelin'?
1DI1000985	This waiting is killing me. I just want get out there, get it over with. How 'bout you -- doin' all right?
1DI1000986	Almost time. You doin' okay?
1DI1000987	God, the adrenaline is giving me the shakes. How you holdin' up?
1DI1000988	How can you be so relaxed? Before the day is out, we'll be fighting for our lives. You do realize that... right?
1DI1000989	Look at you, all calm, cool and collected. Doesn't the fact that we're surrounded by Chinese troops make you even a little bit anxious?
1DI1000991	Nothing to report, soldier.
1DI1000992	Glad you could join the party!
1DI1000993	Nice to see a friendly faceplate.
1DI1000994	All clear, sir.
1DI1000995	Good to have reinforcements.
1DI1000996	Don't think I recognize your unit. Must be a new convert from old man Lyons.
1DI1000997	Watch it, local.
1DI1000998	If you're here to help, fine. Otherwise, out of my way.
1DI1000999	Shouldn't you be huddling in a cave somewhere?
1DI1001000	What're you doing here?
1DI1001001	Great, another local.
1DI1001002	Keep your distance, mutt. No knowing what you've got breeding on you.
1DI1001003	Want to get your take on something...
1DI1001004	Hey... Um... Ah, nevermind... It's nothing...
1DI1001005	So, um...
1DI1001006	You know, I've been thinking...
1DI1001007	Got a second? I just...
1DI1001008	I need to talk to you... Two minutes of your time, that's all I'm asking...
1DI1001009	Ugh... taking fire!
1DI1001010	Agh! Commie bastards!
1DI1001011	I'm hit! I'm hit!
1DI1001012	Uuurgh!
1DI1001014	Taking fire over here!
1DI1001017	My arm's hit!
1DI1001019	Urgh! My head!
1DI1001024	I've been shot!
1DI1001031	Keep those eyes open, people.
1DI1001032	Expanding search.
1DI1001033	Still nothing. Continuing search.
1DI1001034	Continuing our sweep. Will advise.
1DI1001035	You can't hide, American...
1DI1001037	No visual on target yet...
1DI1001038	I will find you, American dog.
1DI1001039	We've got him! Firing!
1DI1001040	Found him! Opening fire!
1DI1001041	Target acquired! Go go go!
1DI1001042	There he is! Get him!
1DI1001044	You can't hide!
1DI1001046	Contact lost, stand down.
1DI1001047	Slippery Commie got away.
1DI1001048	Target lost. Dammit!
1DI1001049	That's it, he's gone.
1DI1001051	Area is clear.
1DI1001053	I don't see anything.
1DI1001054	Eyes on. I think we may have company.
1DI1001055	Possible threat in area.
1DI1001056	We may have a target. Look sharp.
1DI1001059	Someone there? Show yourself!
1DI1001062	Get out of my country, Commie!
1DI1001063	Here's a little something from Uncle Sam!
1DI1001065	Don't let one of those Commies get away!
1DI1001066	Wake up...Ole' Benji's got something for ya!
1DI1001067	Come on you Red bastards!
1DI1001068	I'm gonna push you bastards right back to the Great Wall if I have to!
1DI1001069	Targets spotted! Engaging!
1DI1001070	Hostiles spotted! Firing!
1DI1001071	Bury those Commie bastards!
1DI1001072	Enemy spotted! Drop 'em!
1DI1001073	There they are! Over there! Get 'em!
1DI1001074	Get outta' my country, Commie!
1DI1001075	Payback time!
1DI1001076	Drop those Reds!
1DI1001077	Targets spotted! Going weapons hot!
1DI1001079	Engaging target!
1DI1001080	Invaders! Open fire!
1DI1001082	Americans! Attack!
1DI1001086	Looking for something?
1DI1001087	...the hell do you think you're doing?
1DI1001089	Keep your weapon holstered!
1DI1001090	Holster that thing immediately!
1DI1001091	No weapons fire in here, dammit!
1DI1001093	Are we under attack?!
1DI1001096	You do that, and it'll be the last move you ever make.
1DI1001097	Bad idea. Really bad idea.
1DI1001098	I hope the safety's on.
1DI1001099	Sir?
1DI1001100	Jesus! Put that down! I'm a friendly!
1DI1001101	Hey, watch it.
1DI1001102	Clumsy local...
1DI1001103	Be more careful.
1DI1001104	Got the shakes, sir? Why don't you sit down and take a break?
1DI1001105	Whoops.
1DI1001106	Careful. You alright?
1DI1001108	That's locked. For a reason.
1DI1001109	Keep your mitts off that.
1DI1001110	What the hell do you think you're doing?
1DI1001111	There's nothing in there worth taking.
1DI1001112	Is there something you need, sir?
1DI1001113	Um... what are you doing?
1DI1001114	Combat stress getting to you, sir?
1DI1001115	Well that's not something you see every day.
1DI1001116	Got a better view from up there, sir?
1DI1001117	Whoa now. Careful with that!
1DI1001118	Maybe you should put that away. Before someone gets hurt.
1DI1001123	Put that down.
1DI1001124	Knock it off.
1DI1001125	...This is Defender Morrill... Any Outcasts listening on this frequency, report to Sector 7-B, Bailey's Crossroads.
1DI1001126	Your head will be mounted as a trophy, dog!
1DI1001127	Shut it, grunt. I'm not taking orders from anyone but McGraw. Now if you're done yapping, get inside and report for new orders.
1DI1001128	You know what you need to know. Don't push your luck.
1DI1001129	Sorry, this is the best I've got. You don't like it, go borrow from the Reds.
1DI2000001	Oh, it'll be fine. I can take care of extracting the full cure from it, and meanwhile the slaves can raise it as one of their own.
1DI2000002	Slaves get the cure, and by the time the baby's all grown-up, she won't even remember a thing!
1DI2000003	It's a resilient little spud! Don't you worry about it.
1DI2000004	What, you didn't like our little welcome? Us big kids playing too rough with you?
1DI2000005	You want a rematch, or are you gonna go cry about it some more?
1DI2000006	I know I shouldn't trust you, but if it'll make Marie happy, it means I can get some sleep. So, okay.
1DI2000007	She seems to really enjoy teddy bears. She just can't seem to get enough of them.
1DI2000008	Bring as many as you can, and I'll even pay you... Once I make sure they aren't filled with razor blades.
1DI2000009	Oh, you'd be such a life-saver! A happy Marie means I can get some sleep once in a while.
1DI2000010	She seems to really enjoy teddy bears. She just can't seem to get enough of them!
1DI2000011	Bring as many as you can, and I'll make sure you're well paid for the effort!
1DI2000012	Thanks! And Marie says thanks too!
1DI2000013	Thanks, but don't think this makes up for what you did. Here's your pay, I guess.
1DI2000014	That sure would help me out. Happier Marie is, the more likely I can get a full night's sleep for once in my life.
1DI2000015	She seems to really enjoy teddy bears. Creepy little things, but I guess she doesn't know any better.
1DI2000016	Bring as many as you can, and you'll get paid plenty for it. I promise.
1DI2000017	Thanks, you have no idea how much this will help. Here's your pay.
1DI2000018	Just to find one man? You... you wouldn't dare!
1DI2000019	Oh, I see how it is. You signed on with Ashur, and now you're going to stand by your man. Maybe trying to catch his eye and be his queen?
1DI2000020	Well, good luck with that, starfucker. I'm sure the two of you will kill each other eventually, even without my help.
1DI2000021	You, him, and this whole town can burn for all I care. I'm gone.
1DI2000022	Sure, fine. Obviously, you've joined with Ashur and I think you've got a bright future as a lackey. You really do.
1DI2000023	But you know what? Fuck this city, and fuck the raiders, fuck the slaves, and fuck you too, fucker. I'm gone.
1DI2000024	What's the matter? Still afraid of getting your hands dirty?
1DI2000025	Let's see if you've got any guts at all.
1DI2000026	It's not like we were going to harm her. We just needed to kidnap her for our freedom. Look, sometimes, these things have to happen!
1DI2000027	Okay, okay! Wernher was the one who wanted to steal the baby. I just wanted our freedom. I didn't think about what it would take.
1DI2000028	Wernher's hiding in the steelyard. Look for a rooftop door in the southwest. There, are you happy? Go! Just stop looking at me like that!
1DI2000029	Fine, if it'll get you out of the way, go check under the blast furnace in the steelyard.
1DI2000030	Look for a rooftop door in the southwest. It's got a blue light, you can't miss it. But Wernher will put you in your place.
1DI2000031	Not in the slightest. During the Scourge, we looted The Pitt and left the rest of it to rot. I was just a dumb convert who got stuck here afterwards.
1DI2000032	See, beneath it all, the Brotherhood's just lazy. It's easier to loot a dying city than work to bring it back to life, so that's what they did.
1DI2000033	They're so obsessed with the technology of the past, they don't care what needs to be done for today and tomorrow.
1DI2000034	It takes real work to rebuild and run a city. But there isn't a machine to do it for them, so the Brotherhood ain't interested. Good riddance.
1DI2000035	This thing? It's a relic from my time with the Brotherhood of Steel, decades ago.
1DI2000036	It's been through so much that they'd hardly recognize it as one of theirs.
1DI2000037	A little like me, come to think of it.
1DI2000038	My little Marie is the very picture of health. And eventually, she'll make it possible for a new generation of healthy babies in The Pitt.
1DI2000039	You know, I always wanted to make The Pitt a strong city, but that was because I wanted to make my mark on the world.
1DI2000040	But when Marie was born, that changed. Now she's my reason to make The Pitt succeed. Because she's depending on it.
1DI2000041	It's just something a parent has to do for their child, you understand?
1DI2000042	My little angel is just the healthiest baby in the world! She just couldn't be doing better.
1DI2000043	Wish I could say the same about the research for a cure. But that can't be rushed, now can it?
1DI2000044	Honestly, it'd help us all if she got some new toys to play with. The happier she is, the easier it is for me to do research.
1DI2000045	Oh, so now you care about her well-being? Well, she's fine.
1DI2000046	Wish I could say the same about the research for a cure. But I can't risk rushing that.
1DI2000048	Oh sure, someday. Meanwhile, they keep bringing in more slaves to die.
1DI2000049	Be obedient and subservient because someday the god-king's only child will make everything better? Who'd fall for that one?
1DI2000050	She's a handful, is what she is. I mean, I'm glad she's healthy, and I take care of her like she's my own, but it's a full-time job.
1DI2000051	And I hardly have any time to work on finding a cure from her. People help out here and there, but she's just such a handful!
1DI2000052	I got folks working on it, 24/7. It'd go faster if they didn't keep fussing about not hurting the little squirt.
1DI2000053	Midea's the worst of them. Keeps asking people to bring the kid toys or some sorta bullcrap.
1DI2000054	You'd think an old slave like her would know how to work without raising a fuss, right?
1DI2000056	Yup, guess you got every last one out there. You're one hell of a steeler, kid.
1DI2000057	That's your problem, ain't it? Get back out there, scab.
1DI2000058	Well, there's still more out there. But I guess some other sucker can get killed looking for them.
1DI2000059	Looks good.
1DI2000060	I'll just take those.
1DI2000061	Nothing like some heavy labor, huh?
1DI2000062	More metal for the Mill.
1DI2000066	I thought I heard something.
1DI2000068	Thought you could hide, huh?
1DI2000069	I knew I heard something!
1DI2000071	I guess it's gone now.
1DI2000072	Nothing there, I guess.
1DI2000074	I must be hearing things.
1DI2000075	Well, whatever.
1DI2000077	Hey! What the hell?
1DI2000078	Help me out, buddy! c'mon!
1DI2000079	Don't just stand there, shoot!
1DI2000080	What are you waiting for? Get 'em!
1DI2000084	We're gonna take you back and feed you to the Trogs!
1DI2000085	Wernher, you motherless fuck!
1DI2000086	Fuck you, Wernher!
1DI2000087	Ashur wants his fuckin' head!
1DI2000088	Die, traitor!
1DI2000089	You're comin' back dead, asshole!
1DI2000090	You've always been a bastard, Wernher!
1DI2000091	No one escapes The Pitt, Wernher!
1DI2000092	Thought you could get away, huh?
1DI2000093	All scabs die!
1DI2000094	Die, grinder!
1DI2000095	Get down, slave!
1DI2000096	Sit! Back! Down!
1DI2000097	Die, slave!
1DI2000098	Fuckin' scumbags!
1DI2000099	Put this fuckin' scab down!
1DI2000100	It's the end for you! Haahahahaa!
1DI2000101	Blood and steel!
1DI2000102	Death!
1DI2000103	I'm gonna tear you the fuck apart!
1DI2000105	I'll break you!
1DI2000106	For Ashur's glory!
1DI2000108	Die! Just fuckin' die!
1DI2000109	Fuck! You!
1DI2000110	Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
1DI2000111	Nobody's gonna miss a scab like you.
1DI2000112	Time to teach you scum a lesson.
1DI2000113	Know your place, scab.
1DI2000114	You always were a lousy worker.
1DI2000115	Back in your work-hole, worker.
1DI2000116	Shoot! Shoot!
1DI2000118	Keep him pinned down!
1DI2000119	Keep her pinned down!
1DI2000121	Did I hit her?
1DI2000123	Take her out!
1DI2000125	Help me out here!
1DI2000126	Har!
1DI2000127	Arrrraarr!
1DI2000128	Rrrarrr!
1DI2000129	<shriek>
1DI2000133	Need!
1DI2000134	Blood!
1DI2000135	Warm!
1DI2000137	Kill it!
1DI2000138	'licious...
1DI2000139	Taste...
1DI2000140	Must have...
1DI2000141	Smell it...
1DI2000142	Meat!
1DI2000143	Hungry!
1DI2000144	HATE!
1DI2000146	Help me...
1DI2000149	Brothers! Fight!
1DI2000150	This is over!
1DI2000151	We've had enough!
1DI2000152	No more!
1DI2000153	Don't be afraid! Fight!
1DI2000154	Fight back!
1DI2000155	Don't let them keep us down!
1DI2000162	What? Gone? How'd that happen?
1DI2000163	That's the last mistake you'll ever make.
1DI2000164	That's what you get.
1DI2000166	That'll teach you to mess with me.
1DI2000167	No! Ashur... I've failed you...
1DI2000168	I was only... playing...
1DI2000169	I didn't see... that... coming...
1DI2000170	What did I ever do to you...
1DI2000171	Oh, c'mon!
1DI2000172	That preacher... lied...
1DI2000174	Arg... my lung...
1DI2000175	I just need to sit down for a second...
1DI2000177	Is that... my... blood?
1DI2000178	No! My... g...
1DI2000179	Arg... fuck...
1DI2000181	I'm... hit...
1DI2000182	Aw, fuck!
1DI2000184	Gaaaahhh!
1DI2000188	Ohhhh...
1DI2000190	Aaaaaggrgg...
1DI2000191	Arrrggrgg...
1DI2000193	Noooo...
1DI2000197	<sigh>
1DI2000206	..peace...
1DI2000207	Thank you...
1DI2000208	Nooo! My brothers!
1DI2000209	Fight on...
1DI2000210	Go on... without me...
1DI2000211	Never... forget...
1DI2000212	Now that everything's quieted down, I guess we've got time for the full story. What do you want to know?
1DI2000214	I'm not the one to ask, really. Between Marie and the research, I hardly have any free time anymore.
1DI2000215	You know how stressful it is, raising a kid and studying her at the same time?
1DI2000216	But that's what has to be done, for the future of The Pitt.
1DI2000217	What the hell do you think? We're still brought here against our will, and we still have to work until we fall over.
1DI2000218	Sure, maybe the guards don't shoot us for fun as often. And there's a slim chance that someday we'll stop getting sick and dying. Maybe.
1DI2000219	Whoop-tee-fucking-doo. Thank goodness you came here to save us.
1DI2000220	You better believe it. No more beatings, no more forced work, no more slaves being brought here in chains. You did some good work.
1DI2000221	Of course, we've got all new problems, now that Ashur and the taskmasters are gone. Not enough food getting brought in, for one thing.
1DI2000222	Wernher said he'll organize scavenging parties, but I think he'd rather stay up in the bar than actually do any leading.
1DI2000223	Whatever. We'll work it out, somehow.
1DI2000224	Oh, things are fine. Don't let any grumblers tell you differently!
1DI2000225	Oh, sure, there are a few problems... We need scavenging teams, people to fight off the Trogs, and overseers for the mill's operation.
1DI2000226	But it's a small price to pay for seeing the end of Ashur and his bastards, right?
1DI2000227	It wasn't actually that tough. The Scourge had cleared out a lot of Trogs, so we had space to move in.
1DI2000228	The Brotherhood had looted a lot, but they left even more behind as "damaged goods." And you can rebuild a lot out of "damaged goods."
1DI2000229	For example, they took one survivor, a kid the called "Kodiak". But they left his big brothers behind, because they were too wild and mean.
1DI2000230	But as it turns out, the Bear Brothers were some of my finest soldiers. At least, until they went up against you.
1DI2000231	Believe it or not, it started when the Brotherhood decided to loot this hellhole and wipe it off the map. We called it the Scourge.
1DI2000232	Back then, I was "Initiate Ashur." But that ended when the Brotherhood left me behind, and I came to see The Pitt in a new light.
1DI2000233	I was found by tribals who thought I was a god. I didn't argue, and with my leadership and their divine dedication, we began rebuilding this city.
1DI2000234	First of all, they aren't "slaves." They're "workers." They can earn their freedom, like you did.
1DI2000235	I know it's not a big difference, but it's important. And it's a lot better than they'll get from the slavers we get them from.
1DI2000236	I wish it wasn't necessary, but we need the labor to keep the city functioning. We don't have the leisure of laziness.
1DI2000237	Soldiers fight Trogs and get food from outside of town. Workers need to supply them with ammo and gear. Everyone has to do their part, or we all die.
1DI2000238	Until we have a cure for The Pitt, the city has no children. People die, so we need new people. And sometimes, that means buying them.
1DI2000241	I know some of my soldiers are harsher than they need to be. Usually, it's the ones who were raiders before they signed up here.
1DI2000242	The workers need to be pushed, but I don't tolerate cruelty for cruelty's sake. The soldiers who used to be workers know where to draw the line.
1DI2000243	I can't stop all of the abuse, but when someone goes too far, I make sure they're strung up around town as an example.
1DI2000245	We are what we wish to be. I found this book once, over by the library. Midea read part of it to me.
1DI2000246	It said: "A good traveler has no fixed plan and is not intent on arriving."
1DI2000247	It means that I'd like to be free, but I'm not. And the harder I cling to that desire, the more miserable I'll be that I'm stuck here.
1DI2000248	And this work is hard enough without extra misery. Speaking of which, I should get back to it.
1DI2000249	I'd like to be free, but I'm not. And the harder I cling to that idea, the more miserable I'll be that I'm stuck here.
1DI2000251	I'm not cheery, really. I've just accepted my role here. I found a book once. Midea read part of it to me.
1DI2000252	It said: "The Master doesn't try to be powerful; he is powerful. An ordinary man keeps reaching for power and thus never has enough."
1DI2000257	And now, my friends, we have for you a group of slaves willing to kill and slaughter in order to become one of we privileged few!
1DI2000258	They will fight! They will die! And all for you! All for your entertainment!
1DI2000259	Now, are they ready to die for their chance at freedom? Let's find out! Release the barrels! Fight!
1DI2000260	And there is only one left standing! Only one! Oh, my friends! What a fantastic fight! How far will this slave go?
1DI2000261	And now, this slave has proven willing to kill and die for his freedom! But how will he fare against the last man who made it all the way: Gruber!
1DI2000262	And now, this slave has proven willing to kill and die for her freedom! But how will she fare against the man who made it all the way: Gruber!
1DI2000263	Undefeated in the Hole, Gruber has yet to meet his match.
1DI2000264	Only one will walk out with their freedom! Only one will walk out alive! Release the barrels! GO!
1DI2000265	And Gruber falls! Gruber falls! The champion is toppled! A new slave rises from the gutter to join us! Welcome him! He's earned it!
1DI2000266	And Gruber falls! Gruber falls! The champion is toppled! A new slave rises from the gutter to join us! Welcome her! She's earned it!
1DI2000267	They're savage! They're brutal! They're here to keep this worker in his place -- the undefeated Bear Brothers!
1DI2000268	Let's find out if the newcomer can hold his own against real fighters! Release! Fight!
1DI2000269	The Bear Brothers are dead! Amazing! This newcomer is showing promise, my friends!
1DI2000270	C'mon! C'mon you bastard!
1DI2000271	Think you got what it takes? C'mon!
1DI2000272	Get out here and fight, scab!
1DI2000274	C'mon, coward!
1DI2000278	Oooh!
1DI2000281	Ever since the city was scourged, we've done what everyone does: whatever's necessary to survive.
1DI2000282	I know my city seems barbaric to you, but it's the only way we can carve out a home in this hellhole, and it's kept these people alive.
1DI2000283	But that's enough stalling for time. So, do you know Wernher?
1DI2000284	Lord Ashur! The slaves are rioting, and someone's armed them! We need you out here, and fast!
1DI2000285	Damnit, I'm on my way.
1DI2000286	Clever thinking, but couldn't you have let us in on your little plan?
1DI2000287	No matter. Marie's safe now, and that's what really matters.
1DI2000288	The city's got a bright future ahead of it, and I guess you'll have a chance to see it.
1DI2000289	You're fucking right, it won't. I ought to have you thrown out of town. In pieces.
1DI2000290	But my Marie is safe, Wernher's gone, and the city's got a bright future, so I'm feeling unusually forgiving. Consider yourself lucky.
1DI2000291	Now that Marie's back, we have a chance at curing the disease that's been ravaging The Pitt since the bombs.
1DI2000292	Without it killing our kids, we can grow like a real city. No more bringing in slaves. No more forced labor. Things can get better.
1DI2000293	It's taken me a lot of work to rebuild this city. With your help, it's finally going to have a chance.
1DI2000294	I probably should. Hell, I still might. But you got rid of Wernher, and things are looking good, so you're welcome in my city. For now.
1DI2000295	As long as you stay in line, you're free to use the Mill's ammo press. But I recommend you head out of town before using the ammo itself.
1DI2000296	And Sandra's made some progress with the radiation studies. You're not on her good side, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind testing it out on you.
1DI2000297	You've kept the city in one piece and put a stop to Wernher's plans. Yeah, I guess you've earned one.
1DI2000298	As a full citizen of The Pitt, you'll have full access to the ammo press in the Mill. It's how I keep my soldiers well armed, so make good use of it.
1DI2000299	And I think Sandra's made some progress with the cure. So here's a little something to help with radiation.
1DI2000300	I wish I could, but you have to see things in the bigger picture. Without those workers, this city would fall apart.
1DI2000301	The city's disease means we can't have kids, so slaves and recruits are the only way we get new people in the city.
1DI2000302	But some day, soon, we'll have a cure, and we won't need forced labor. The workers will be free, and the city can grow naturally.
1DI2000303	Thanks to what you've done, that day is coming. But until then, this is the only way the city can survive.
1DI2000304	Right now, nothing. Until we can reproduce a treatment from Marie, they'll have to keep working. Otherwise, this city falls apart.
1DI2000305	But once we do have a cure, things will be different. We won't need to kidnap people for our city. We'll be able to grow naturally.
1DI2000306	Until then, this is the way it has to be. It's just what has to be done.
1DI2000307	Lord Ashur will be right with you. Feel free to wait inside, champion.
1DI2000308	Just head back and talk to Sandra. She'll explain all about the cure. Then you'll see why you have to put an end to Wernher.
1DI2000309	I suggest you forget Wernher's offer, and consider mine: stop Wernher, and you'll have a bright future in The Pitt. Don't disappoint me, new blood.
1DI2000310	Citizens of The Pitt, workers of Downtown, traders of Uptown, and all fierce souls who do what must be done!
1DI2000311	I bring you good news! We stand at the dawn of a new golden age. Where others merely survive, we thrive!
1DI2000312	Our industry is the envy of the Commonwealth! Our safety is the envy of the Capital Wastes! Our might is the envy of Ronto!
1DI2000313	And while I have led your efforts, it has been by your own strength that you have earned all of the envy of the world.
1DI2000314	They envy the steel shaped by the workers in our mills, and they envy the strength of our traders and raiders who wield that steel for The Pitt.
1DI2000315	And most of all, they envy our victories in the struggle for freedom. Because, yes, freedom is what we all work towards.
1DI2000316	Freedom from fear, freedom from disease, freedom to live as once we did before we were shackled by atomic fire!
1DI2000317	And so, to celebrate this struggle, I ask my loyal workers: who among you is prepared to fight for your freedom?
1DI2000318	Who among you will risk your life in the crucible to create a new life of freedom in Uptown? Who will take this rare chance to thrive?
1DI2000319	Right here! We have one! This woman here will fight in the Hole!
1DI2000320	Right here! We have one! This man here will fight in the Hole!
1DI2000321	C'mon, Ashur! Will you send someone to the Hole who actually stands a chance?
1DI2000322	Very well, Midea. If that is the will of the workers, then this man shall be their champion!
1DI2000323	Very well, Midea. If that is the will of the workers, then this woman shall be their champion!
1DI2000324	Sir, you carry not only the dream that workers can become free, but that we may all someday become truly free from the threats of our world.
1DI2000325	Madam, you carry not only the dream that workers can become free, but that we may all someday become truly free from the threats of our world.
1DI2000326	Prepare yourself, sir. And when you are ready to be forged anew, report to Faydra in the Steel Mill.
1DI2000327	Prepare yourself, Madam. And when you are ready to be forged anew, report to Faydra in the Steel Mill.
1DI2000328	The rest of you are dismissed.
1DI2000329	You heard right. And after a show like that, how could I refuse someone of your talents?
1DI2000330	While the rest of the world scrambles to survive, we have an army, industry, and thanks to a recent surprise, we've got no need to fear radiation.
1DI2000331	But we do have a few loose ends that still need tied up. Tell me, do you know a man named Wernher?
1DI2000332	I understand. We've all got a past, and damn few of us have reason to be proud of it.
1DI2000333	That's all behind you, now. In The Pitt, you'll be part of a growing army, a thriving industry, and maybe even witness to a cure for radiation.
1DI2000334	But we aren't perfect, and sometimes the past comes back to haunt us. Tell me, do you know a man named Wernher?
1DI2000335	I figured it'd be something like that. Goodbye, new blood.
1DI2000338	Wernher used to be my second-in-command, until he betrayed me. He was exiled to the slave pens, but he escaped not too long ago.
1DI2000339	I believe he's planning to strike at the city again, and may be working with the slaves to do it.
1DI2000340	You've had a lot of contact with them, so maybe you can hunt him down and put an end to him. Do it, and I'll name you my lieutenant on the spot.
1DI2000341	Then you know he's not to be trusted. He escaped after a failed coup, and I believe he's working with the slaves to plan a revolt.
1DI2000342	You know the slaves, and you've met Wernher, so you're in a prime position to put an end to him. Do that, and I'll make you a lieutenant in my army.
1DI2000343	I appreciate your honesty. It's a rare virtue in this age.
1DI2000344	Wernher was my lieutenant until he betrayed me and escaped justice. And if I know him, he brought you here to steal something very dear to the city.
1DI2000345	Do you intend to follow through with his plan?  Feel free to be honest. Please, don't be intimidated by the turret behind you.
1DI2000346	That's what I wanted to hear! You've got a bright future ahead of you in The Pitt, new blood.
1DI2000347	In fact, I'd like to let you in on a little secret, and show you the amazing advance that'll secure our place in the Wasteland.
1DI2000348	Now, I think, would be a good time for you to meet the cure for yourself. Let's take a trip back to the lab, where Sandra can explain...
1DI2000349	Ah, of course. Would these plans happen to involve stealing a precious little something from me?
1DI2000350	Don't look so surprised. Your arrival was too convenient, and even if you never met Wernher, I'm sure he got someone to make you an offer.
1DI2000351	It's okay, I get a lot of people trying to betray me. Part of the position, really. You can be honest with me.
1DI2000352	Test, one, two. Looks like this thing's on. Marie, if you're there, this is your father speaking: Ishmael Ashur, sometimes called Lord of The Pitt.
1DI2000353	Now, I hope you're hearing this ten years from now, sitting on my knee safe and sound. Right about now, I bet I'm looking pretty silly.
1DI2000354	But things don't always work out the way we'd like. There are a lot of risks, including what your mother would do if she heard me talking like this.
1DI2000355	And I'm not about to risk leaving you alone without knowing where you came from. These tapes are for you, so you can know who your father really was.
1DI2000356	Marie, the first thing you need to know is that I wasn't always the Lord of The Pitt. Long before I was a king, I was a scholar and a soldier.
1DI2000357	In fact, I was in the Brotherhood of Steel. You've probably heard about them. But you may not have heard what we did to this city: the Scourge.
1DI2000358	When we came here, The Pitt was just a breeding ground for Trogs, cannibals, and worse. Commander had us torch the place and take what we could.
1DI2000359	The Pitt had useful technology, but it was suicide to stay here. So when an explosion left me buried in the Mill, my brothers were sure I was dead.
1DI2000360	I don't blame them for leaving. I probably would have. We thought nothing could live in The Pitt. We were wrong.
1DI2000361	Marie, you know those fights in the Mill's arena? Well, its first fight was when I woke up to someone pulling me out from a pile of rubble.
1DI2000362	At first I thought it was my brothers pulling me to safety. Instead, it was a scavenger trying to steal my armor. She didn't get it.
1DI2000363	But I learned she had a whole family of scavengers. They'd make raids into the city for gear from the Mill. And that gave me an idea.
1DI2000364	This was the only working steel mill we'd ever seen. In a world of leftovers, it was a chance to build again. And that was worth any price.
1DI2000365	The scavengers saw me as a god, so along with my Brotherhood know-how, it was easy to set up the basics. We started to build a city.
1DI2000366	As word of a new settlement got out, the city started growing, and fast. When Raiders attacked, I'd kill the leader and recruit the rest.
1DI2000367	I had to. The city's disease meant we couldn't have children, so recruiting was the only way to grow. And as we grew, the Mill needed more workers.
1DI2000368	And, yes, that meant recruiting workers by force. I'm not proud of it, but it's the only way to keep the city supplied and armed.
1DI2000369	But it was always a temporary solution, until our best scientist found a way to cure the city's epidemic. Sandra and I worked on it day and night.
1DI2000370	And after one, particularly late night of work, we were blessed with a cure. It's the cure inside you, Marie.
1DI2000371	Even now, we're doing everything we can to figure out how to share your gift with the city - while keeping you safe, of course!
1DI2000372	So by the time you're old enough to hear this, you'll already be a hero. Congratulations, Marie. You've already saved us all. I knew you would.
1DI2000373	That's up to you. We'll keep working on the cure and keep the city running. You're free to come and go as you like.
1DI2000374	Of course, you can help out at the mill by collecting metal from the Steelyard. It'd help lighten the load on the workers.
1DI2000375	And if you want to work on Sandra's good side, you can always bring her toys for Marie. It's a little thing, but it'd make a difference.
1DI2000376	Sure if that's what you want. I'm sure Harris will keep pouring drinks down your throat, as long as you can afford them.
1DI2000377	Or you can help out at the mill by collecting metal from the Steelyard. I'm sure the foreman would be glad to repay you for your work.
1DI2000378	And if you want to get on Sandra's good side, you can always bring her toys for Marie. It's a little thing, but it'd make a difference.
1DI2000379	A wise decision, new blood. A very wise decision. It looks like Wernher underestimated you.
1DI2000380	And he certainly didn't appreciate what I'd do to anyone that threatened our little discovery.
1DI2000382	That's an interesting way to put it. But yes, I suppose the city's future does rest squarely upon it.
1DI2000383	Something tells me you won't want the responsibility that comes with it.
1DI2000384	Now, someone of your character would be much better off if you just...
1DI2000385	Easy enough. You could say no because he lied to you.
1DI2000386	My discovery is a miracle, but it isn't the type that sets slaves free.
1DI2000387	Now, it would do a lot more good if you were to...
1DI2000388	Oh, it's valuable. I'd say there's nothing I care more about in the world.
1DI2000389	But Wernher doesn't truly appreciate everything it means to me, or to The Pitt.
1DI2000390	Now, if caps are all you want, I can make you a much better offer than that snake, and all you have to do is...
1DI2000391	Then that means you're either a liar or a moron. And neither one is a trait I like to see in my army.
1DI2000392	Care to try again?
1DI2000393	I still ought to slice you open. You're lucky my daughter's still safe.
1DI2000394	I'll let Ashur decide what to do with you. Get out of my sight.
1DI2000395	That's better. Now, I recommend you go hunt down Wernher before I cut off your fingers and give them to Marie as pacifiers.
1DI2000396	You're fucking insane. But at least my daughter's back safe and sound. That's all that I care about.
1DI2000398	You're a goddamned dead man.
1DI2000399	You're a goddamned dead woman.
1DI2000400	Oh, no reason. Just asking. I haven't seen you before, that's all.
1DI2000401	Never mind, then.
1DI2000402	Hey now, why so angry? I'm just asking some questions, no reason to jump down my throat. Never mind, then.
1DI2000403	Well, since you might be able to help me, I'll let you in on a little secret: the slaves are always planning all sorts of things.
1DI2000404	I find out what's going on and let the bosses know and they let me shrug off some of the work detail.
1DI2000405	Good deal, huh? If you hear anything, you should let me know.
1DI2000406	Oh. Oh? A cure? That is very interesting. I'll be sure to note that.
1DI2000407	Here's a little something that I found. Make good use of it.
1DI2000408	Hrm. Well, let me know if you do.
1DI2000409	That's a shame. Keep an eye open.
1DI2000410	From outside The Pitt? That's new. I heard there might be someone from far away showing up.
1DI2000412	I guess that shouldn't surprise anyone. The bosses all thought they were up to something.
1DI2000413	Here's a couple of things for your trouble. They should help keep you alive out here.
1DI2000414	That figures. Must be why the bosses hate him so much.
1DI2000415	Here are a couple things. Thanks for your help.
1DI2000416	I knew that bastard was up to something. Finally! After all he's done to me, I can get him!
1DI2000417	Here's something for your trouble. I can't thank you enough for this one.
1DI2000418	I should have gunned you down long ag... what the hell is that?!
1DI2000419	This is for Marie, you bastard!
1DI2000420	That's enough! Get her stuff. ... C'mon, hurry! ... Hey! Put that down, that's mine! ...Okay, got everything? Let's get out of here!
1DI2000421	That's enough! Get his stuff... C'mon, hurry! ... Hey! Put that down, that's mine! ...Okay, got everything? Let's get out of here!
1DI2000422	Right behind you! Hahahahaha!
1DI2000423	I want you to hurry.
1DI2000424	Okay, got it. Let's go!
1DI2000425	Relax. They messed you up pretty bad.
1DI2000426	Take it easy. Don't move too quickly.
1DI2000427	Come on. Sit up now.
1DI2000428	Understood, champ! But if you want to keep collecting ingots, I still got plenty of gear stashed away.
1DI2000429	You bring me ingots, I'll make sure you get rewarded. Can't be more fair than that.
1DI2000430	Guess I couldn't stop you, but then you'd never find all the little bonuses I got stashed over the years.
1DI2000431	How about this: you bring me ingots, like you used to, and I'll make sure you get compensated when you do. Can't be more fair than that.
1DI2000432	Okay, so what's up?
1DI2000433	Wehrner's back!
1DI2000434	Where'd you hear that?
1DI2000435	From a trustworthy source. Midea confirmed it.
1DI2000436	Great! I'll spread the word.
1DI2000437	Careful who you tell. Ashur's got spies everywhere looking for him.
1DI2000438	I'm not an idiot.
1DI2000439	I'm just saying... look, after what happened last time...
1DI2000440	I know. I know. Don't worry, I'll be careful.
1DI2000441	Good. We can't afford any more mistakes.
1DI2000442	It's good.
1DI2000443	You were gone a while. We worried.
1DI2000444	Nothing to worry about.
1DI2000445	We NEED those parts for the weapons!
1DI2000446	Shhh! Ashur's got ears everywhere.
1DI2000447	I'll chop those ears off, soon enough.
1DI2000448	Amen... The weapons are coming, relax.
1DI2000449	It's just... I'm so ready to DO this!
1DI2000450	We all are. Soon. It'll happen soon.
1DI2000451	Not soon enough.
1DI2000452	Ashur's got a cure.
1DI2000453	A cure for WHAT?
1DI2000454	The plague! We're talking no more Trogs! Ever!
1DI2000455	What? Really? How the hell do you know that?
1DI2000456	You're not the ONLY one with connections.
1DI2000457	Fine. So spill it already, or are you just gonna stand there gloating?
1DI2000458	That's it. He's got a cure.
1DI2000459	That's it?: "He's got a cure." You don't know what it IS, or where he HAS it, or what he's planning to DO with it?
1DI2000460	What? That's all I know. It's good intel!
1DI2000461	You're useless.
1DI2000462	Everything's under control.
1DI2000463	Taken care of.
1DI2000464	You know me. I do good work.
1DI2000468	All right. We're counting on you.
1DI2000469	Better not have screwed up.
1DI2000470	<Whistles>
1DI2000472	<Cries.>
1DI2000475	I'm going!
1DI2000476	Sorry... I'm just so tired. I'll work harder. Don't hurt me.
1DI2000477	Get back to work, maggot!
1DI2000478	You can rest when you're dead. And I'd be happy to help you out with that.
1DI2000479	You want to keep your brains in your head? Get to it!
1DI2000480	Nap time's over, asshole. On your feet!
1DI2000481	I missed on purpose. The next one won't. Now back to work!
1DI2000482	I won't miss next time!
1DI2000484	Get up!
1DI2000485	On your feet, maggot!
1DI2000486	You want to die, asshole? Back to it!
1DI2000487	You don't belong up here.
1DI2000488	Anthony's sick. He sent me to take his place.
1DI2000489	Tough shit. Get back down there where you belong!
1DI2000490	Your friends are dead. You're next if you don't talk!
1DI2000491	You helped them escape. I know it.
1DI2000492	We can do this the easy way, or the "I break you in fucking half" way. Your choice.
1DI2000493	Fine, have it your way. Fucking talk, you piece of shit!
1DI2000494	Billy.
1DI2000496	Billy, it's me, your brother John-John. You remember me. Don't you, Billy?
1DI2000498	Billy?
1DI2000500	<Ferocious growl>
1DI2000503	I warned you.
1DI2000504	Well, that's one less useless mouth to feed.
1DI2000505	What the...? <Grumble>
1DI2000506	You there. What are you doing?
1DI2000507	Get back to work!
1DI2000508	Nap time's over.
1DI2000509	Get up! Get up, goddammit!
1DI2000510	Fine. Have your little break. But if you're not tossing coal when I get back, you're dead.
1DI2000511	So Steelyard duty, eh? Who'd you piss off to get that death sentence?
1DI2000512	Actually, don't even tell me. It's not like you'll be alive for long anyways.
1DI2000513	See that fella up there? You'll be seeing lots of those.
1DI2000514	And if you survive them, you'll probably run into those crazies that live up on the blast furnace.
1DI2000515	Tell you what, why don't you do me a favor and get killed close to the door?
1DI2000516	That way I won't have to walk so far to loot your corpse. Heh.
1DI2000517	Here's the door. Get out there and grab some ingots. Don't come back without at least ten!
1DI2000518	Turn them in to me and I'll see if I can't slip a little something your way.
1DI2000519	Good to see a little enthusiasm, for once! Well, follow me!
1DI2000520	That you do. This ain't no union shop.
1DI2000521	Guess I could spare this.
1DI2000522	Yeah, looks like you've earned it. If you're heading back out there, these oughta help with the Trogs.
1DI2000523	How about I give you some metal this time?
1DI2000524	Here. This armor was a special order for one of the Hole fighters. Great against bullets, but didn't help him when he got pushed off the bridge.
1DI2000525	Sure thing. Bit of a weird one, here - found it from some sucker out of town.
1DI2000526	Some genius got to tinkering with his laser. Polished metal barrel, a few prisms in there, and he got this lethal light show.
1DI2000527	You bet I do! Check out this cutting edge of fashion! Wear this armor, and everyone's going to want to get close to you.
1DI2000528	Which just means they'll be inside your blast radius, huh?
1DI2000529	Guess you earned this. Used to belong to a desert priest. Said wearing it made him bulletproof.
1DI2000530	Course, that didn't stand up to a little testing. But damn if it wasn't a gloriously fun time.
1DI2000531	All the metal you're bringing in, I suppose it's worth giving you something to really help with those Trogs.
1DI2000532	Here, this thing's mauled Trogs and Ghouls from here to Monroeville. Give it a whirl.
1DI2000533	I probably shouldn't, but damn if you ain't earned it.
1DI2000534	Here. This is the best gun I ever had. A little slower on the trigger, but she makes up for it in power and accuracy. Use her in good health.
1DI2000535	Well, I'll be damned. That makes 100 ingots you found. And here I remember thinking you'd be lucky to bring back any at all.
1DI2000536	Ain't no question, you earned the treasure of my collection. This armor goes all the way back to when the Brotherhood tried to wipe out The Pitt.
1DI2000537	Some of the tribals who worshipped Ashur made it to look like their god. Try it on, and you'll feel a little like a god, yourself!
1DI2000538	Nope. Go grab a few more, and I'll see what I can spare for my star scavenger.
1DI2000539	Not right now. Bring in a few more, and maybe.
1DI2000540	Like it or not, this is what you're getting.
1DI2000541	See for yourself. If you're heading back out there, these oughta help with the Trogs.
1DI2000542	Well, how about metal for metal? That's gotta be a fair trade.
1DI2000544	How about something one-of-a-kind? Bit of a weird one, here - found it from some sucker out of town.
1DI2000546	Is it ever! Check out this cutting edge of fashion, huh? Wear this armor, and everyone's going to want to get close to you.
1DI2000547	Which just means they'll be inside your blast radius!
1DI2000548	Sure is. This armor used to belong to one of those desert-crazy priests. Said wearing it made him bulletproof.
1DI2000552	Kid, this is worth more than you know. But damn if you ain't earned it.
1DI2000557	You know the rules. Not until you bring in a few more.
1DI2000558	Ain't gonna happen. Not until you bring in more.
1DI2000559	I tried. Really I did. This is your own fault.
1DI2000560	You'd best not be wasting my time, newbie.
1DI2000561	Yeah sure, newbie.
1DI2000562	Sure thing, newbie.
1DI2000566	One of 'em is coming back? Dumbass slaves... Open the gate!
1DI2000567	Who is that down there? I can't see a fuckin' thing. Open up the gate, it might be one of those slaves.
1DI2000568	Watch where you're going, meat!
1DI2000569	It hurts my heart to see a sober customer.
1DI2000570	If you walk out of here sober, I'm not doing my job.
1DI2000571	Oh, good! And here I thought you were planning to stay sober.
1DI2000572	Hey, that's Ashur's kid! Sound the alarm!
1DI2000573	Ghoul? Who're you calling a Ghoul? Get lost before I dump you in the river!
1DI2000574	The Lord of The Pitt knows all, and his eyes see promise where others see rubble.
1DI2000575	What does he see in you? A cure? A scourge? Or maybe nothing more than a plaything?
1DI2000576	Soon, Lulu will see what lies inside you! But first, perhaps Ashur's pet needs to be fed?
1DI2000577	Perhaps your "assets" appeal to the degenerate women you're used to, but I'm quite immune.
1DI2000578	I would never lay with a beast of burden, no matter how impressive it is.
1DI2000579	I'm sure you think so. The delusion of equality is part of what makes your kind so pitiful.
1DI2000580	That worked out well for all of us, didn't it?
1DI2000581	And don't worry, I'm sure I'll find some excuse to take a potshot at you later. So we can all look forward to that!
1DI2000582	I hope so, for your sake. You screw up down in the Mill, you just get a beating. It's harsh, but it heals.
1DI2000583	But if you screw up when raiding a caravan, you get gutshot and bleed out in the dirt. So you better be as tough as you think you are.
1DI2000584	But I do what I can to keep our mistakes from being too fatal. If you need to drop some rads, I'm here to help.
1DI2000585	You'd be surprised how many of us worked our way up - even if we don't like to admit it.
1DI2000586	The rest are just toughs from the Wasteland who decided to join the biggest gang around.
1DI2000587	Either way, watch your back around here. Nobody got to Uptown by playing nice.
1DI2000588	Oh, you're definitely looking at a lot of risk, up here.
1DI2000589	Watch out, or you'll get fed to the Trogs. They just love eating trash.
1DI2000590	Hey, it's not pretty, but it's the truth. We're all just meat in the grinder out here. Today's hotshot is tomorrow's Trog-chow.
1DI2000591	Nothing to it but to be the best, and eat our fill before we're next on the plate.
1DI2000592	Work hard and you might just be a grade-A cut like me!
1DI2000593	Go take a swim in the river. You'll find out for yourself, asshole.
1DI2000594	Ha! That rules out your wit. It must be something else that makes you so interesting to our lord.
1DI2000595	Lulu will see soon enough. Oh yes. But first, perhaps Ashur's pet needs to be fed?
1DI2000596	It's the price I pay for perfection.
1DI2000597	And a fair price it is, if it means I can avoid things like you.
1DI2000598	I should hope so! That's what I did when I was fighting down there.
1DI2000599	And it really gets the crowd going when they see you've got some fight in you!
1DI2000600	Fuck yes, we do. Those lazy workers get food and board, and all they have to do is work the Mill and complain.
1DI2000601	But we're the ones who go out on raids to get that food, and we're the ones getting shot at for their lazy asses.
1DI2000602	So don't you get all weepy for those scabs Downtown. They don't know how easy they got it.
1DI2000603	But I do what I can to keep us all standing upright. If you need to drop some rads, I'm here to help.
1DI2000604	That's a pissing match you don't want to start around here. We've got people from every blasted-out crater on this coast.
1DI2000605	Don't mistake us for those drugged-up idiot Raiders out in the wild. They're an embarrassment to the profession.
1DI2000606	You just go out there and prove yourself to Ashur. We'll all be watching.
1DI2000607	I already fought my way outta there once. There ain't no force in The Pitt that could make me go back there again.
1DI2000608	Not you, not Ashur, not anything. Got it?
1DI2000609	Not hardly. Deep down, we're all meat, and even the best of us is just gonna be Trog-chow someday.
1DI2000610	No shame in it -- just the way life goes. It's all meat, baby.
1DI2000611	Uhm... nothing. Nothing... uh... sir. I was just telling this new worker about the job the Foreman posted.
1DI2000612	Oh yeah? So he's the one that's going out to the Steelyard, huh?
1DI2000613	Oh yeah? So she's the one that's going out to the Steelyard, huh?
1DI2000614	Yes sir. I told him what he needs to do. He knows. 10 ingots. As fast as he can.
1DI2000615	Yes sir. I told her what she needs to do. She knows. 10 ingots. As fast as she can.
1DI2000616	Well then, I hope you also said goodbye! HAHAHAHA! Alright, play time's over. Get to work, grinders.
1DI2000617	I am working. You must be new here.
1DI2000618	I serve the slop to the other slaves. You want food, let me know. The good news is that this crap is nearly unlimited.
1DI2000619	But it's mostly radiated water and Trog meat, anyway. You want some or not?
1DI2000620	Sure. Whatever. Let me know if you need some food.
1DI2000621	I'm not sure if this stuff will kill you faster than starvation or not.
1DI2000622	Good move.
1DI2000623	That's probably for the best.
1DI2000624	It's your funeral. Here you go.
1DI2000626	Sorry. I'm all out. Check back tomorrow.
1DI2000627	He watches over the city from Haven, his tower in Uptown. Take the northeast exit from here and look for the tallest building in town.
1DI2000628	Oh, Ashur also said that he has a few gifts for you. You'll find them in the container behind me.
1DI2000629	Enjoy. And don't keep the man waiting.
1DI2000630	No, he expects you to accept his courteous invitation. Or at least to guess what would happen if you keep him waiting.
1DI2000631	You'll find him in Haven, his tower in Uptown. Take the northeast exit from here and look for the tallest building in town.
1DI2000634	You're looking for Marco, hrm? What's he up to?
1DI2000635	He's over in the old control room, near the gate to Uptown. I'll... I'll let him know you're coming.
1DI2000636	He's over in the Mill. I don't see him except for meals.
1DI2000637	He's in the Mill. He tried to keep out of sight of the bosses, so look around where they can't see.
1DI2000638	Very well, then. Good luck on your path.
1DI2000639	Why would you? They'll probably thank you for the information with a bullet to the head. They don't give a rat's ass about you.
1DI2000640	Weapons. Lot's of 'em. There's something coming... and soon.
1DI2000641	So, I take the crap we find out in the yard and some of the tools we use, and I make them into stuff we can fight the bosses with.
1DI2000642	I don't know you, stranger. I need these for the boys I know are dedicated to the cause.
1DI2000643	Sorry I can't help you out.
1DI2000644	Yeah... you're the one Midea told me about. Wernher sent you, right? I can help you out.
1DI2000645	Take this. It's called an Auto Axe. Nice, huh? I make 'em out of the old car parts the breakers drag in from the city.
1DI2000646	Do what you can with it, just be careful around the bosses. Make a wrong move and you're done.
1DI2000647	Right. Back to work.
1DI2000649	Why would you? They'll probably thank you for the information with a bullet to the head. They don't give two shits about you.
1DI2000650	Does ratting me out still sound like a good idea? If so, go squeal to Brand. That little rodent will be happy to hear what you have to say.
1DI2000651	Now, get the fuck out of my face. I got work to do.
1DI2000652	Making weapons. Lot's of 'em. There's something coming... and soon.
1DI2000654	HAHA! I love it. Another slave wandered back here, huh? You couldn't even get over the bridge, could you? You're lucky I don't fuckin' paste you.
1DI2000655	And look at all this! Where'd you get all this shit anyway? Whatever. Mine now. I hit the fuckin' jackpot today!
1DI2000656	Now get back in there and get to work, or next time I'll just stake you out there for the Trogs.
1DI2000657	Is that so? Well, since we're hirin', you can just head right on in and fill out a fuckin' application.
1DI2000658	I'll let 'em know that you're comin'. They'll take good care of you once you get inside.
1DI2000659	Oh, good. It's been way too long since I killed anybody.
1DI2000660	Hold it right there, grinder. Inspection.
1DI2000661	Hold it right there, Waster. Inspection.
1DI2000662	Boo hoo, the mean boss took all of the dumbass slave's goodies! Is 'im gonna cry to Ashur?
1DI2000663	You found it, I took it. You got a problem with that?
1DI2000664	Tough luck, Grinder. It's mine now.
1DI2000665	Hey, that's my stuff. Get your fuckin' hands off of it.
1DI2000666	You head down to the hole. Talk to Faydra. She sets up the fights.
1DI2000667	We're just supposed to live and die in slavery, and watch our children turn into monsters, all because you don't have the balls to do your job?
1DI2000668	Wake up, you simple-headed sap. That baby could do more good for us than all of his mongrel raider family ever did for us combined.
1DI2000669	No, we expected you to steal the one thing that was both a cure for our children, and a hostage to earn our freedom.
1DI2000670	But congratulations, your petty sentimentality has doomed us to continued slavery and pestilence. Thanks.
1DI2000671	Oh, now I see how it is! Think you're going to become Ashur's new lieutenant, do you? Maybe wait until you can take his throne?
1DI2000672	I've seen your type come and go, and they always leave town face down in the river.
1DI2000673	So, fine. You picked your side, and you made your choice. See where that takes you.
1DI2000674	Of course I knew, you dolt. I also know it's the only chance we had of finding a cure and ransoming our freedom.
1DI2000675	If they ever find a cure, do you think they'll share it with us? Of course not. Why waste medicine on people you'll just work to death, anyway?
1DI2000676	Of course, she'll be safe. We're just going to do our own research for the cure, and then ransom her back for our freedom.
1DI2000677	You've seen how Ashur and his people treat us. It's far, far kinder than they deserve.
1DI2000678	Don't get all sentimental on us now. This child will provide us a cure, and in exchange for our freedom, she can go back to her family.
1DI2000679	And if something happens to her family, I'm sure she'll grow up fine with us. She wouldn't even have to know the monsters her real parents were.
1DI2000680	She's not just any baby. She holds the promise of a cure for our own children, and we can ransom her back for our freedom.
1DI2000681	Don't think I enjoy this any more than you. But it's the only way we can be free and healthy enough to leave.
1DI2000682	Of course I knew, but you don't see me blubbering about it. That baby is our only chance of a cure and freedom from this hellhole.
1DI2000683	But if it makes you feel better, when we're done, she'll be back with her parents, and never needs to know any of this happened. So quit whining.
1DI2000684	She'll be all right - just not with me. Ashur's guards are always watching me. They'd find her right away.
1DI2000685	Wernher sent me word that he's hiding out in the Steelyard. He's got everything there to take care of the cure.
1DI2000686	Take it to him, and he'll handle the rest. Now get going!
1DI2000687	Not yet, hotshot. Ashur's got people watching me, and I can't keep a baby hidden in this dump.
1DI2000690	It's simple, really. From time to time, Ashur opens up the arena. Any slave who wants to can fight against the gladiators.
1DI2000691	If you win, you get your freedom. More importantly: you get an audience with Ashur. It's the only way a slave will ever get to talk to him directly.
1DI2000692	You fight. You win. And when you talk to Ashur, you take the cure.
1DI2000693	Not exactly, no. Wernher has a... distraction planned. We haven't been making these weapons for nothing, you know.
1DI2000694	But, when you're meeting with Ashur, you'll be close enough to grab the cure. Get it, and bring it to me.
1DI2000695	Now let's get out there and listen to Ashur's speech. There'll be hell to pay if the guards catch us in here.
1DI2000696	I wouldn't shed a tear, but no. Wernher has a... distraction planned. We haven't been making these weapons for nothing, you know.
1DI2000699	It's simple, really. From time to time, Ashur opens up the arena. We call it the Hole. Any slave who wants to can fight against the gladiators.
1DI2000702	I don't know what you saw on the way in, but the guards don't really take kindly to workers just standing around.
1DI2000703	You're going to need to look busy, or they'll sniff you out pretty quickly. And if they get too close, you don't look like you belong here.
1DI2000704	Outside of the mill, there are a bunch of old steel ingots just lying around. Every so often, the Foreman puts out a work order to collect them.
1DI2000705	It's practically a death sentence and they never assign it to anyone. They make us pick who's going to do it. Bastards.
1DI2000706	Yeah? Well the area is full of Trogs.
1DI2000707	They're what most of us hope we never become. The contamination gets to everyone to some degree.
1DI2000708	For most people, it's some form of cancer. Sometimes harmless, sometimes not. For others, the contamination drives them insane.
1DI2000709	If it doesn't kill them, it changes them. They become animals -- deformed and inhuman. It's not pretty. They're everywhere and they kill on sight.
1DI2000710	I can't really help you there. Ask around. Maybe check with Marco in the Mill. He's been making some of our tools into weapons.
1DI2000711	You might even be able to find a gun on one of the dead bosses out in the Steelyard. They- what was that?
1DI2000714	If you need a weapon, check with Marco in the Mill. He's been making some of our tools into weapons.
1DI2000716	You're either an idiot or a smartass, either way I don't think it's funny.
1DI2000717	They're what most of us hope we never become but, the contamination gets to everyone.
1DI2000720	What in god's name is a Super Mutant? You know what, never mind. Whatever they are, you're wrong.
1DI2000721	What it is full of are Trogs.
1DI2000722	Well... the area is full of Trogs.
1DI2000723	Yeah, and right now, this is what you need to do to help us.
1DI2000724	You're not really going to be much use if the guards figure out who you are and stake you out for the Trogs, are you?
1DI2000725	Outside of the mill, there are a bunch of steel ingots just laying around. Every so often, the Foreman puts out a work order to collect them.
1DI2000726	It's pretty much a death sentence, but they never assign it to anyone. They make us pick who's going to do it. Bastards.
1DI2000727	By itself, no. It isn't. But the area is full of Trogs.
1DI2000730	I assure you, no one is more unhappy about being here than us. But right now, we need you to do a job we call "collecting the trash".
1DI2000732	They never assign it to anyone. They make us pick who's going to do it. Bastards.
1DI2000736	Well, if you mess it up and get killed, you won't get any reward, now will you?
1DI2000737	Now, outside of the mill, there are a bunch of old steel ingots just lying around. Every so often, the Foreman puts out a work order to collect them.
1DI2000741	So, I'm going to send you out to do a job that will keep you away from the guards.
1DI2000742	Yes. It is. I don't know what you saw on the way in.
1DI2000743	You're going to need to look busy, or the bosses will sniff you out pretty quickly. And if they look too close, you don't look like you belong here.
1DI2000745	Someone needed to. I'm sure you noticed that the guards don't take kindly to newcomers.
1DI2000748	Is this like when you said you'd free us slaves? Because I guess I'll be waiting a long time.
1DI2000749	Dammit! Dammit, you monster!
1DI2000750	Wernher's in the steelyard! Here, take his damn message, hunt him down, whatever. Just leave my people alone, you bastard!
1DI2000751	Don't you dare try to blame me for your actions, you bastard! I never made you turn your back on us, and I sure as hell never made you a murderer!
1DI2000752	But if this is what it's coming down to, I'm not going to let you hurt any more innocent people!
1DI2000753	The cure is the key to healing the sickness around here. Look at us. We've all got it.
1DI2000754	And the more they force us to work in this mess, the worse it gets. People are going Trog faster than ever before.
1DI2000755	The cure is the first thing in this place that hasn't been infected.
1DI2000756	What about me? I was born here. I'll probably die here. I've lived my whole life under Ashur's boot heel.
1DI2000757	The only thing that keeps me alive is the thought that I might be able to turn the tables someday.
1DI2000758	I was born shortly after the Brotherhood Scourge. As bad as it is now, I can't imagine what it was like before Ashur.
1DI2000759	Some of the stories I heard when I was a little girl... about the Trogs and the Wildmen would scare the hell out of you.
1DI2000760	I don't care how tough you were. Honestly, I don't know how anything survived, let alone how Ashur managed to control any of those freaks.
1DI2000761	Sometimes... just sometimes, I think that maybe things are better with him here...
1DI2000762	We come from all over. Most were born here, but lately, the bosses have been bringing us in from all over.
1DI2000763	Bill's a friend of mine, a very dear friend.  We've worked the mill together for a long time.
1DI2000764	Last week we were forced to choose someone to gather ingots from the Steelyard.  Bill volunteered.
1DI2000765	He didn't want anyone to have to die out there. But... he's a survivor. He can't be dead.
1DI2000766	You look like you can handle yourself.  Could you look for him and bring him back?
1DI2000767	Oh! That's wonderful!  Where is he now?  Did he come back with you?
1DI2000768	No?  Well, if you do see him, could you let me know?
1DI2000772	Oh, okay...
1DI2000773	Thank you so much. Just... be careful out there. Bill would never forgive himself if someone got hurt looking for him.
1DI2000774	Well, okay.  I hope you'll change your mind.
1DI2000775	He's dead?  But he promised us he would come back... I... I have to let the others know.
1DI2000776	Thank you for your help. Here, take these stimpaks.  They're all I have.
1DI2000777	As long as I know he's okay, then that's all that matters. Thank you for your help.  I'll tell the others that Bill is alright.
1DI2000778	Here, take these stimpaks.  They're all I have. Goodbye.
1DI2000779	He's dead?  But he promised us he would come back... I... I have to let the others know.  Thank you for your help.
1DI2000782	That's horrible! Poor Bill!
1DI2000783	Bill, he was alive?
1DI2000784	Please, please stop.  I can't hear anymore of it.  I don't feel so well.
1DI2000785	I think, I think I'm going to faint. Please stop it.
1DI2000786	I don't feel...  I'm going to...
1DI2000787	If you say so. Just be careful out there. We need everyone healthy.
1DI2000788	All right. Let's do this fast before the bosses notice.
1DI2000789	This'll be your last fight, scab. One more and I don't get to call you that anymore. You ready?
1DI2000790	I wouldn't count on luck this time. You damn well better be ready.
1DI2000791	Are you sure about that? Once I lock the door, there's no going back. Arena rules.
1DI2000792	I'm not surprised. Just don't take too long. And don't get yourself killed anywhere but in here.
1DI2000793	You're going up against Gruber. He's one of the only slaves to win in the Hole. There's only ever been... what? Three?
1DI2000794	I guess he got a taste for blood. But unfortunately for you, he's got a pretty decent gun.
1DI2000795	So, odds are, this is the last time you and I will be talking.
1DI2000796	Ashur says he wants to make this one good so he gave you the Bear Brothers. They're a couple of mean bastards.
1DI2000797	Hell, rumor has it that they're half way to Trog as it is. But I'm sure you'll do fine. Just fine.
1DI2000798	We're gonna throw you in there with a bunch of the other scabs who think they got what it takes.
1DI2000799	You're all gonna fight it out and the last one standing gets to move on. Probably won't be you, though.
1DI2000800	Well all right! That's what I like to hear! Get on in there!
1DI2000802	If you're ready, just step on in.
1DI2000803	Oh yeah? You sure you're ready to die?
1DI2000804	You don't sign up. You tell me that you want to fight. I set up a fight. You die, and I repeat it with the next jackass slave who comes in here.
1DI2000805	Sound good? You want in? C'mon, death's got to be better than your life, am I right?
1DI2000806	What? One of the boys hit you upside the head a little too hard? This is the arena. You want to fight? You tell me. I'll set it up.
1DI2000807	Then you die and we all have a good laugh. So what do you say? C'mon? We haven't had a good bloodbath in a while.
1DI2000809	Well, all right. I've got one for you right away. Or you can take some time to put your affairs in order. It's up to you.
1DI2000810	It's pretty simple. When the gates open, you fight. The last one standing wins.
1DI2000811	Of course, when the gates open, the barrels drop in. So just make sure you kill the other guy before you die of radiation poisoning.
1DI2000812	You don't wanna spend too much time with whatever is in those barrels.
1DI2000813	You have what you take in with you.
1DI2000814	But, if that's not enough, there are a couple of things in that locker over there.
1DI2000815	What's to tell? Most die. One or two have made it out, but that's about it.
1DI2000816	Hey! Hands off the merchandise!
1DI2000818	My clothes? Off my back? Well... I guess. You did help us. I'm sure... I'm sure I'll make do out there in the wastes.
1DI2000819	I... don't worry about me. I'll find something, I'm sure. Take them, please. Take them.
1DI2000820	Yes... ma'am. Yes, we will. Thank you, again. You're very kind.
1DI2000821	Yes... sir. Yes, we will. Thank you, again. You're very kind.
1DI2000824	Wait... we're free? You're serious? You're just going to let us go? Thank you! Thank you so much!
1DI2000825	Wait... we're free? You're serious? You killed them and we're just free to go?
1DI2000826	You're either the kindest person in the world or the dumbest. Either way: thank you. I can help you. It's the least I can do.
1DI2000827	What is it that you need?
1DI2000828	Wait... we're free? You're serious? You just paid money just so you can let us go?
1DI2000831	That guy over there on the mattress died last night. I never did get his name.
1DI2000832	If you don't mind the smell, you can just take his.
1DI2000833	We will. Thank you again, stranger. We owe you our lives.
1DI2000838	I'm telling you, they're planning something!
1DI2000839	And I'm telling you, I've got it covered.
1DI2000840	I'll be with you, right after I maintain some order and dispense a little justice.
1DI2000841	And I suppose you'll follow that up by raising the dead?
1DI2000842	No, but I may heal the infirm later in the week. Time permitting, of course.
1DI2000843	Sir, we've had sightings of Wernher back in the city, and there's been an increase in chatter between slaves.
1DI2000844	"Workers."
1DI2000846	We call them "workers." Helps with morale, reminds them they might earn their freedom, someday.
1DI2000847	Whatever we call them, they've been gathering makeshift weapons.
1DI2000848	All right, all right. Put your guards on alert, tell them to be on the lookout for anyone loitering too long downtown.
1DI2000849	And keep a watch on Midea at all times - anything big happens, it's bound to go through her.
1DI2000850	Now, I've got a very important meeting with our new friend, so if anything big comes up, you use the intercom.
1DI2000852	Okay, break's over.
1DI2000853	I have information of great value to anyone willing to help me free my people.
1DI2000854	Please... help us.
1DI2000855	Go! Get him! Get the traitor!
1DI2000856	Finally. Here's the key to the gate. Do whatever you want with 'em. I couldn't care less.
1DI2000857	Oh, hey: Eulogy says to tell your man that we're sorry that we could only get three. We'll get a better roundup next time.
1DI2000859	What? Are you serious? You'd better hurry back here. I'd like to sell this meat some time before I'm an old man.
1DI2000860	Jesus Christ! Hurry up and make up your damn mind, will you?
1DI2000861	Oh, I knew not to trust you Pitt bastards!
1DI2000862	Hey! There's someone in the pen! Get 'em!
1DI2000863	About damn time you showed up. We've been waiting here for-fucking-ever.
1DI2000864	Whatever, man. You're here now. I just hope you're ready to do business.
1DI2000865	We've got three. Usual price: 200 each. Boss says no trade so, cash only.
1DI2000866	I really don't. I'm just glad that you finally showed up. We've been waiting here for-fucking-ever.
1DI2000869	Waiting for Santa Claus, what do you think? We're here to do business.
1DI2000870	So, if you're not who we're waiting for, then I suggest you fuck off before I shove my gun so far up your ass that you start burping lead.
1DI2000871	Not that it's any of your business, but we're waiting for some dudes who live up north.
1DI2000872	They've been buying up all the meat they can get their hands on.
1DI2000873	No clue why, but they pay good money, so I don't really care.
1DI2000874	Yes. Go. Asshole.
1DI2000875	Well, that's how it is, huh? Well, right now I want you to be a customer.
1DI2000876	Usual price: 200 each. Boss says no trade. Cash only.
1DI2000877	Oh? Is that so? Well then, kill away!
1DI2000878	Damn right. Piss off.
1DI2000879	Hey! Wake up, you fucks!
1DI2000880	Hey... meat! Meat meat meat! Look alive, meat!
1DI2000881	C'mon! Can't sell you if you don't look healthy! Walk around or something!
1DI2000882	Hey! No dying! I'll kick your ass if you die on me! Dead meat isn't worth a thing!
1DI2000883	C'mon! Dance or something! You're boring!
1DI2000884	Stupid meat! C'mon! Amuse me!
1DI2000885	Don't make me come in there...
1DI2000886	Yeah? Well, like I said: 200 each.
1DI2000887	Yeah? Well, like I said: 200 each. You came an awful long way just to waste my time screwing around.
1DI2000888	Yeah? And I don't want my boss to kick my ass.
1DI2000889	So, unless you're the dude from The Pitt, these slaves ain't for sale. Piss off.
1DI2000890	You're gonna be checking my foot up your ass if you don't leave us alone.
1DI2000891	This is the last time I'm gonna warn you. Waste my time again, and you're fuckin' dead.
1DI2000892	That's it! I've had enough of your shit!
1DI2000893	Ah, talk to this! Get her, boys!
1DI2000894	Ah, talk to this! Get 'im, boys!
1DI2000895	Good luck! Get her, boys!
1DI2000896	Good luck! Get 'im, boys!
1DI2000897	Leave this bastard alone, boys. His fate's in Ashur's hands, now.
1DI2000898	Leave this bitch alone, boys. Her fate's in Ashur's hands, now.
1DI2000899	Oh, I hate it when he calls her that. I swear, it's a terrible thing to call his own daughter.
1DI2000900	Actually, it's a combination lab and nursery. Little Marie needs a lot of attention and care, if she's going to cure the city.
1DI2000901	Pull your head out of your ass, and you might realize they're one and the same, idiot.
1DI2000902	Don't be silly! It's the best of both worlds!
1DI2000903	As a mother, I love that I can spend all day with my daughter. And as a scientist, it's great to work on something that will benefit the city!
1DI2000904	Well, this is a nice surprise. Apparently, you and Ashur are the only other people who know anything about science in this place.
1DI2000905	Yes, it seems that our daughter was born with a naturally acquired immunity to any form of mutation. It's nothing short of a miracle, honestly.
1DI2000906	I'm still trying to figure out why, but she may just hold the key to stopping The Pitt's Trog problem. Hell, maybe other types of mutations, too!
1DI2000907	Believe it or not, she's both. My daughter appears to have a naturally acquired immunity to any form of mutation.
1DI2000908	Basically, she won't turn into one of the Trogs. Or a Ghoul, or anything else. And by studying her, we can keep that from happening to others, too.
1DI2000909	No really. It's nothing short of a miracle, but Ashur and I couldn't be happier. Our daughter was born with an immunity to The Pitt's mutations.
1DI2000910	What's more, Marie's miracle should lead us to a vaccine for others. And maybe even protection from other effects of radiation.
1DI2000911	Really? You think you're just going to waltz in here and take my daughter? The daughter of the Lord of The Pitt?
1DI2000912	You'll be shot dead before you reach the bridge, all without so much as spilling a drop of blood on Marie's blankie. And that's if you're lucky.
1DI2000913	If they take you in one piece, I'll string you up on the bridge, and keep you alive until Marie's old enough to shoot you, herself.
1DI2000914	Oh, no, these tests are perfectly safe. In fact, between the crib and her uncanny health, she's probably the safest child in the world!
1DI2000915	Ashur and I would never risk her health, and if that means it takes longer to develop a full cure, then, well... everyone else can wait.
1DI2000916	No, no, nothing like that. Calm down, these are just observational tests, and perfectly safe for Marie.
1DI2000918	You're a dear, but things are well in hand, here.
1DI2000919	If you really want to help, you should probably go deal with whatever had Ashur rushing off in such a hurry.
1DI2000920	Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to take care of one last test before Marie's nap-time.
1DI2000921	Yes, you'd think that, wouldn't you? But that's because you're an idiot who thinks he can get away with kidnapping Ashur's daughter.
1DI2000922	Our raiders will tear you apart, and when they're done, Marie will be playing with your bones as a rattle.
1DI2000923	And you really think the slaves can develop a cure more efficiently than I can? Don't be an idiot.
1DI2000924	And if they so much as pluck one hair off her head, I'll be sure to pluck one eye out of each of theirs.
1DI2000925	So maybe you should just put her back right this instant and tell those miserable bastards that they can wait until their goddamned turn.
1DI2000926	You really think so? Because if you ask me, it might not be too clever to kidnap Ashur's daughter, while in the middle of his army.
1DI2000927	Walk out that door with her, and they'll reduce you to a chunky smear on the wall. And all without ruffling a hair on Marie's head.
1DI2000928	Yeah, that's what I thought, asshole.
1DI2000929	The last person to try that was Wernher, and you can be damned sure Ashur's going to turn him into a little ball of pain.
1DI2000930	I recommend you get out there and help, and maybe I'll forget you had that little lapse of judgement.
1DI2000931	No, I wouldn't. But our snipers could pop the eyes out of your head without even ruffling her hair.
1DI2000932	Marie's going to be using them as playthings when you're long dead, you son of a bitch.
1DI2000933	Now, stay still while mommy takes a few readings. Don't worry, dear, you're perfectly safe!
1DI2000934	He's got my baby! Take him down, but be careful!
1DI2000935	She's got my baby! Take her down, but be careful!
1DI2000936	You think you can get away with this? Every raider in this town will be after your head to bring her back.
1DI2000937	If you want to live, I suggest you give her back right this instant.
1DI2000938	You don't even know how dead you are, do you?
1DI2000939	Bring her back, or you're dead, bastard!
1DI2000942	Get out of here, sellout!
1DI2000943	You ain't welcome here no more.
1DI2000944	Stay outta Downtown, traitor.
1DI2000945	Thought you had the sense to stay out.
1DI2000946	Ashur's new pet is looking for a beating!
1DI2000947	You're not the boss of me!
1DI2000948	Workers of The Pitt, unite!
1DI2000949	Oh, that's it! RIOT!
1DI2000950	Yeah, that's right! Keep walking, little shit.
1DI2000951	Then here... Delicious food for you! Eat, and be good.
1DI2000952	Too bad! Lulu has given you plenty for today. Don't be a greedy pet. Lord Ashur won't like it!
1DI2000953	Then say no more, friend. Can't share much, but this should do the trick. Use it in good health!
1DI2000954	Wish I could help you, but I'm all out for today. Just tough it out?
1DI2000955	That's it! This is between me and the little shit! Nobody else!
1DI2000956	I was the first thing you saw in this city, and damn if I ain't gonna be the last, too.
1DI2000957	Then go, and be good. Remember, Lulu has got her eye on you!
1DI2000958	Okay. Watch yourself out there!
1DI2000959	Oh, but aren't we all pets of our Lord? He built this menagerie, and chose each of us to live in his world.
1DI2000960	Good pets do work, find food, build weapons, and kill the unclean. Good pets get food and Lord Ashur loves them. Bad pets get drowned in the rivers.
1DI2000961	Lulu knows all about being good. So Lulu is in charge of feeding other good pets!
1DI2000962	All workers report to the Square. All workers report to the Square.
1DI2000963	They'd rather die for freedom than die working for the raiders.
1DI2000964	Come on, we're almost there. It's just past this gate.
1DI2000965	Here come more of them! Watch out!
1DI2000966	Hang on. Someone's coming. Let me do the talking.
1DI2000967	You're just going to be their tool right up to the bloody end, aren't you? Bye-bye, tool.
1DI2000968	Well now, a hero! Look at you.
1DI2000969	I come from a place far to the northwest. It's called The Pitt. It's... well... let's be honest...
1DI2000970	The place is a nightmare... radiation, mutation, disease. But the worst of it: my people, some of the only survivors, are slaves.
1DI2000971	No big deal, you're thinking? It's a rough world. But I have the chance to free them. All I need is an outsider's help before that chance is gone.
1DI2000972	Yeah. That's why these guys were after me. As long as I know about the cure, I'm a threat. So I ran.
1DI2000973	And you can be damn sure there will be more of 'em coming.
1DI2000974	The Pitt is a mess. Nearly everyone who lives there is either sick, dying, or... worse. It's the water. And the air. You can't escape it.
1DI2000975	You stay there a few years, and no matter what, it'll get you. But the bastards who have my people, they've found a way to a cure it.
1DI2000976	And once they have that cure perfected, we don't stand a chance. So, we need the cure to bargain for our freedom.
1DI2000978	You stay there a few years, and no matter what it'll get to you. But the bastards who have my people, they've found the way to cure it.
1DI2000979	And once they have the cure perfected, we stand no chance. So, we get the cure. With it, we turn the tables on them.
1DI2000980	It's not like that. You can't catch it from me. The Pitt... it gets to you. It's the water, and the air. You can't escape it.
1DI2000981	You stay there a few years, and no matter what, it'll get to you. But the bastards who have my people, they've found a way to fight it off.
1DI2000982	And once they have it perfected, we don't stand a chance.
1DI2000983	So, I need you to come with me and help me get the cure. With it, we can turn the tables on them.
1DI2000984	Once we control the cure, Ashur will have no choice but to free the slaves.
1DI2000985	Fine. Well, everyone is sick. All of us. The bosses too. Everyone who lives in The Pitt is sick. It's the city it... changes you.
1DI2000986	The guys in charge have found something that can cure the disease. And that something is very VERY valuable.
1DI2000987	With it, I can control the city, and we can be free from the bosses. But I need an outsider to help me get it.
1DI2000988	I'm on the run from our dead friends over there. As soon as I found out about the cure, they came after me.
1DI2000989	And you can be damn sure they won't be the only ones.
1DI2000990	To put it simply: we're slaves. We're some of the only healthy survivors, but we're forced to work like animals.
1DI2000991	Well, look at you, Moneybags. Right down to business. Gotta respect that.
1DI2000992	But before you get anything, what I need you to do is to take a trip with me to a place called The Pitt.
1DI2000993	It's a city to the northwest of here, a long way away. I want you to come with me and help me steal something that will free my people.
1DI2000994	Yeah, whatever. I didn't come to DC to swap insults with Wasters. You want to flap gums, fine. But don't waste my time.
1DI2000995	Now, you came about the broadcast. You want to hear what I have to say about The Pitt or not?
1DI2000996	You're a real joker, aren't you? Whatever. Listen, I come from a place called The Pitt.  It's a city far to the northwest.
1DI2000997	The place is a nightmare for... well, for so many reasons. But the bigger problem is that my people are slaves.
1DI2000998	No big deal, right? It's a rough world. Who cares? But I have the chance to free them. I just need an outsider's help before we lose that chance.
1DI2000999	You're a real joker, aren't you? Whatever. Shut up and listen. I come from a place called The Pitt. It's a city far to the northwest.
1DI2001000	The place is a nightmare for... well, for so many reasons. But the problem I have right now is that my people are slaves.
1DI2001001	No big deal, right? But I have the chance to free them. I just need an outsider's help before that chance is gone.
1DI2001002	The Citadel, huh? That's the Brotherhood of Steel fortress, right? Yeah, I know about those guys.
1DI2001003	He must have been part of the attack that cleaned up The Pitt. Well... it didn't so much clean it up as it calmed it down.
1DI2001004	No way that hellhole could ever be cleaned up without the cure. That's why those guys were after me.
1DI2001005	And you just went along with him, did you? To hell with everyone else but you, huh?
1DI2001006	Here, I thought that you of all people would understand that sometimes you have to get your hands dirty to make a difference.
1DI2001007	But you're just a coward, afraid of making a choice. Afraid of changing the world!
1DI2001008	Oh, boo-fucking-hoo. You don't think bringing those bastards down is worth getting your hands dirty?
1DI2001009	No, I guess you're okay with torturing, slaving scum like that, just so long as you don't have to make a decision, huh?
1DI2001010	Yeah, because you would have just whined about it. If you aren't getting your hands dirty, you aren't making a difference. Welcome to the world.
1DI2001011	What's important is that the kid is here now, and we can move on to the last part of the plan.
1DI2001012	That's just a simple matter of letting the Trogs overrun Haven and take care of the bosses for us.
1DI2001013	Think of it as clearing the stage. The cure in this brat's genes is the only thing worth keeping, and now we can wipe that hellhole clean.
1DI2001014	And that takes us to the last part of the plan: letting the Trogs overrun Uptown, killing every last bastard in there.
1DI2001015	Leaving you to take Ashur's place.
1DI2001016	It means that we can study Ashur's bastard, and once we dig the cure out of it, make sure that we all get the treatment.
1DI2001017	But more importantly, it means we're ready for the last part of the plan - letting the Trogs overrun Uptown and wipe out the bosses.
1DI2001018	Leaving the slaves free, and turning the bosses into Trog food!
1DI2001019	Hold on, there. Sure, you brought Ashur's spawn, so the tough part's over. But there's one last bit of housekeeping to take care of.
1DI2001020	We let the Trogs overrun Uptown, and there won't be any bosses left to get in our way.
1DI2001021	Leaving you in control of the city, and with the appreciation of many grateful ex-slaves.
1DI2001022	That's the spirit. Just stick with the plan, and everything'll work out fine.
1DI2001023	Only thing that's left is to finally wipe out all the bastards in Uptown. And that honor falls to you.
1DI2001024	Oh, sure. You'll just march back to Ashur and his venomous little wifey, and say, "Sorry I stole your firstborn. My mistake!"
1DI2001025	You're in it this far, it's easier to follow through than it is to back out.
1DI2001026	That's the spirit. Nobody likes a quitter.
1DI2001027	In fact, now comes the fun part: we wipe out all of those bastards in Uptown!
1DI2001028	See? You're stuck on this path, pal. Might as well see it through to the end.
1DI2001030	You cowardly little shit! You're afraid to get your hands dirty, so you'll go crawling back to Ashur for forgiveness?
1DI2001031	And after all this work, you're going to turn around and betray me?
1DI2001032	You know, I already have everything I need from you. So, you're expendable.
1DI2001033	Simple: get someone else to do it for you. And there's a whole city full of Trogs hungry to do the job.
1DI2001034	The only thing keeping them out of Uptown are those floodlights. And I know where you can shut those off.
1DI2001035	Shut off Uptown's lights, and the Trogs'll sweep in to take care of the rest.
1DI2001036	Whoa, there! Sweet as the thought is, you can't just kill 'em all yourself! You're just one man. You might miss a few!
1DI2001037	But there's an army of Trogs out there, hungry to get in. And the only thing holding them back are those floodlights.
1DI2001038	Shut off Uptown's lights, and the Trogs'll take care of the rest.
1DI2001039	Whoa, there! Sweet as the thought is, you can't just walk through and throttle each one by hand. You're just one girl. You might miss a few!
1DI2001042	You cocky bastard. Think you killed all of Ashur's little psychos? No way! Not even close!
1DI2001043	Any given day, most of them are out on raids, or trying to push further into the city. Now there's trouble, they'll be rushing back, guns blazing.
1DI2001044	No, the only way to put an end to their kind is to destroy their home and salt the fucking earth. Give uptown back to the Trogs!
1DI2001045	Sorry, doll, but I'll be busy setting everything up with the squirt, here. But for you, I guess I can spare a few supplies.
1DI2001046	You can get to the power plant from a manhole down in the Steelyard. Near the train tracks -- you can't miss it.
1DI2001047	Head down there,  find the floodlight controls, and turn off Uptown's floodlights. I'll meet you back Downtown.
1DI2001048	And here, take this - you'll want to stay hidden when the Trogs come. Now get moving!
1DI2001049	My advice? Keep running until you're in Downtown, and don't look back!
1DI2001050	Now, you can get to the power plant from a manhole down in the Steelyard. Near the train tracks -- you can't miss it.
1DI2001051	Head down there. find the floodlight controls, and turn off Uptown's floodlights. I'll meet you back Downtown.
1DI2001053	You can get to the power plant from a manhole down in the Steelyard. It's near the train tracks -- you can't miss it.
1DI2001054	Head down there and find the floodlight controls. Turn off Uptown's floodlights, and I'll meet you back in Downtown's Market Square.
1DI2001055	And here, take this - you'll want to stay hidden when those Trogs start swarming. Now get moving!
1DI2001056	Hey, hey! What are you guys doing here?
1DI2001057	I might ask you the same thing. You got a lot of guts coming back to this place, Wernher.
1DI2001058	Yeah? Well, I guess that's the difference between us. I have a lot of guts. You don't.
1DI2001059	No guts? What do you mean-
1DI2001060	Yeah, yeah, everybody's happy. Midea says she'll take care of the kid, when she's not too busy with everything else. Don't worry about it.
1DI2001061	We cut a few corners on researching the brat, so we've already got something good to keep down the rads. It's on the house.
1DI2001062	But the real wealth of the city is in that steel mill. You'll have access to the ammo press in there, so go nuts. You earned it, kid.
1DI2001063	Keep your shirt on, I'm getting to that! And I promise, you're getting plenty!
1DI2001066	Yeah, but it's gonna take work to clean up after the riots. I can take care of the day-to-day stuff - you just reap the benefits, huh?
1DI2001069	Whatever you want, boss. I'll be whipping folks back into shape, and Midea's keeping an eye on the brat, so you can come and go as you like.
1DI2001070	But if you want, you could keep collecting steel from the Steelyard. Most folks can't handle it, and the foreman would see you get a reward.
1DI2001071	And if you really care, Midea said she's looking for toys for the brat. I guess if you find anything, you could bring them to her.
1DI2001072	But that's only if you give a shit. If it were just me, I'd just keep drinking 'till the booze runs out. So live it up!
1DI2001073	It's not that easy. This is still our home, and there's still lots of work to be done. Killing Ashur is just the first step.
1DI2001076	But don't you worry about it all. I'll be here to take care of the getting the city back into shape. You just bask in the glory, huh?
1DI2001077	Relax. It's not about you. It's about your... companion.
1DI2001078	We only have enough supplies for two. He's gonna have to stay behind.
1DI2001079	Besides, we don't need some greaser tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
1DI2001082	Besides, we don't need a... uhm... whatever he is tagging along with us. He'll only draw attention.
1DI2001084	We only have enough supplies for two. She's gonna have to stay behind.
1DI2001085	Besides, we don't need some diseased whore tagging along with us. She'll only get in the way.
1DI2001086	Relax. It's not about you. It's about your dog.
1DI2001088	Besides, we don't need some filthy mutt tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
1DI2001094	Besides, we don't need some burnt out old loser tagging along. He'll only slow us down.
1DI2001095	Relax. It's not about you. It's about your... robot
1DI2001096	We're not going to be able to keep him maintained while we're on the road.
1DI2001097	Besides, we don't need some bucket of bolts tagging along. He'll only get in the way.
1DI2001100	Besides, this might turn ugly. We don't need some do-gooder slowing us down.
1DI2001101	Yeah. That's the way it is. You can hook up with her again when you get back.
1DI2001102	Now c'mon. Let's get going.
1DI2001103	Yeah. That's the way it is. You can hook up with him again when you get back.
1DI2001105	Yeah. I'm sure. You can hook up with her again when you get back.
1DI2001107	Yeah, I'm sure. You can hook up with him again when you get back.
1DI2001120	Besides, we don't need come filthy mutt tagging along with us. He'll only get in the way.
1DI2001128	We won't be able to maintain him on the road.
1DI2001133	Well... you might be able to get a small gun or a knife past them if you conceal it just right.
1DI2001134	I can do that for you but I can't promise that they won't see it and just gun you down.
1DI2001135	You want the gun or the knife?
1DI2001136	Okay. Here you go. Don't take it out until you get past the gate. You clear on what you need to do?
1DI2001138	Yeah, probably for the best. Are you clear on what you need to do?
1DI2001139	That's it. Good luck. We're counting on you.
1DI2001140	It's a bit too late for that now, isn't it? Either way, good luck. We're counting on you.
1DI2001141	I followed you. I've gotten very good at staying out of sight when I don't want to be seen.
1DI2001142	Oh yeah? What is it?
1DI2001143	Whatever you say, hero. Just don't take too long. We need to get started. This ain't a short trip.
1DI2001144	Go shopping if you need to, but don't take too long, Moneybags. We need to get started. This ain't a short trip.
1DI2001145	Don't take too long, Joker. We need to get started. This ain't a short trip.
1DI2001146	Just don't take too long. We need to get started. This ain't a short trip.
1DI2001147	Well, you might try a disguise. They probably won't let some random armed Waster past the gates.
1DI2001148	But if you look like one of the working stiffs, you should be able to slip in with no problem.
1DI2001149	Lucky for us, a group of Slavers is nearby waiting to make a sale. You should be able to get one off of them.
1DI2001150	They're off to the west, near the tunnel that leads to The Pitt. That should be our first move.
1DI2001151	It looks like you've already got a set of Slave Clothes to disguise yourself with. Good. That'll make things easier.
1DI2001152	I'll meet you up by the tunnel that leads to The Pitt. You go get whatever you'll need for the trip.
1DI2001153	Make sure you're prepared. It's a long trip and you won't be back here for a while.
1DI2001154	Okay. You go get the outfit. I'll stay here and meet up with you when it's done.
1DI2001156	You won't be coming back here for a while, so keep that in mind.
1DI2001157	Whatever. Just get the outfit off of one of them while you're playing hero. I'll stay here and meet up with you when it's done.
1DI2001158	Then we'll head out to The Pitt.
1DI2001159	Hrm. Well... that's not the best idea, but at this point, I'm pretty much out of options, so if that's how it has to be...
1DI2001160	The city is controlled by a man named Ashur. He's powerful. No one there dares go against him. No one except me.
1DI2001161	I need you to sneak into The Pitt and find a way to get close enough to him to steal the cure. Nothing to it, right?
1DI2001162	They know that I know about the cure. All of them will be looking for me by now. That's why those guys came all the way here.
1DI2001163	I came here because I needed an outsider. Someone like you, who has the strength to pull off what I need.
1DI2001164	It's the key to a cure for the mutations. Everyone in The Pitt is mutated in some way. Some are just sick, some are... worse.
1DI2001165	The bosses have the key to the cure. With it, we can take control of the city and free my people.
1DI2001166	I need to you find a Slave Outfit so we can sneak you into The Pitt. I had to ditch mine whenever I ran for it.
1DI2001167	I spied on a group of Slavers nearby. They're waiting to make a sale to some guys from The Pitt.
1DI2001168	Do whatever you have to, but get a Slave Outfit from them. We don't have much time.
1DI2001169	Gather what supplies you'll need and meet me at the first tunnel to The Pitt. You'll never find your way there without me to guide you.
1DI2001171	The city is built on the backs of slaves. We're diseased, and suffering. What else do you want to know?
1DI2001173	He's a guy named Ashur. I don't know where he came from, but he's strong enough that he keeps all the other bosses in line.
1DI2001174	The bosses, well... they're a ragtag group of vicious little fucks. But they have the guns and the power.
1DI2001175	Ashur keeps them from killing each other, and keeps them forcing us to work.
1DI2001176	You got it, Hero.
1DI2001177	Whatever you say, Joker.
1DI2001178	Whatever you say, Moneybags.
1DI2001180	Midea. She's another slave, like me. She's helping to organize them. She'll know when it's time.
1DI2001181	Some of us are native to The Pitt, most of us are, really. People sometimes have kids before the sickness takes them.
1DI2001182	But the need for slaves has gotten bigger. Ashur's started importing them.
1DI2001183	Ever wonder why there are so many Slavers, but you hardly see any slaves? The Slaver operation in this area has been supplying The Pitt.
1DI2001184	What do you want to know about it?
1DI2001185	It's hard to describe. It's nasty. And it affects everyone a little differently. But the longer you're there, the more it gets you.
1DI2001186	Some just get sick and die. Others go crazy, completely psycho. They live out in the city. We call 'em "Wildmen".
1DI2001187	And the worst... well... just hope you never have to see 'em. They turn into animals. They forget who they are. They just eat, sleep, fuck, and kill.
1DI2001188	But this cure, maybe it can stop all that.
1DI2001193	After the war, the place just turns into a shithole. The buildings start falling over and the sickness makes people just turn on each other.
1DI2001194	Some of them... change. They lose any sense of who they are. They just go around killing and fucking and eating. Like animals, man.
1DI2001195	Some people are still okay, but just... I don't know. Anyway, about 30 years ago, those Brotherhood guys come in and wipe the place out.
1DI2001196	They kill all of these sick fucks. Anything that looks like it's going to fight -- Bam! Then they take whatever they were looking for and leave.
1DI2001197	Well, as bad as The Pitt is, it used to be worse. Much worse. It was complete chaos. Every man for himself.
1DI2001198	About the time I was born, those Brotherhood guys swept through the place. Killed anything that put up a fight.
1DI2001199	More'n half the place was dead by the time they were done. It was a slaughter. But they got the worst of the worst.
1DI2001200	If it weren't for the Brotherhood sweeping the place, I doubt Ashur would have been able to get control of as much as he has.
1DI2001201	The city is built on the backs of slaves. My people. We're diseased, and suffering.
1DI2001202	They've restarted the steel mills there. They have us breaking down metal and reforging it. No one knows why.
1DI2001203	But the guy in charge, Ashur, you can damn well bet your life that he has a plan.
1DI2001204	Can't believe I'm saying this, but I think you cleared out the whole place!
1DI2001205	We'll get other workers to salvage metal from the buildings. You take a break!
1DI2001206	There should be plenty out in the steelyard, especially higher up and around buildings.
1DI2001207	I hear there's a supply plant in the northeast. Should be plenty of ingots in there, too.
1DI2001216	No! Please!
1DI2001218	Run! We can't win!
1DI2001219	Live to fight again!
1DI2001221	Yeah, no shit, huh?
1DI2001222	I hear that, man.
1DI2001223	I hear that, girl.
1DI2001224	He he he. Damn, man, you're starting to sound like me. Old and bitter.
1DI2001225	He he he. Damn, girl, you're starting to sound like me. Old and bitter.
1DI2001226	I'd tell you to shut up and everything's great, but that'd make me a hypocrite. And I might be a lot of things, but I ain't no fuckin' hypocrite.
1DI2001227	Hey, you remember that time you and me made that scab take off his clothes and run into the Steel Yard? Fucking Trogs tore him apart! Ha ha ha ha!
1DI2001228	Ashur needs to send us out on a good old fashioned raid. Like March of '73? Me, you and that strung-out Ghoul chick? Ha ha ha ha!
1DI2001229	What I wouldn't give for a random Radscorpion attack. Those fuckers make for some good target practice...
1DI2001230	Don't get me wrong - beatin' on the scabs is okay some days, but there's got to be more to life. Any ideas?
1DI2001231	Sometimes I miss the early days, ya know? Shit was so unpredictable. Uprisings, Ghoul attacks. Kept a motherfucker on his toes. Now? Pfft.
1DI2001232	Know what we should do? Me and you? Get some leave time and get out of The Pitt for a few days. Head south into Paradise Falls. Somethin'...
1DI2001233	Maybe I'll talk to Zubrowski or Diehl, get a card game going. Not exactly exciting, but it beats sitting around with our thumbs up our asses, right?
1DI2001234	I was thinkin', maybe we could convince the boss man to have regular fights in the Hole. Shit, I'd go in, see what I'm made of. We could both do it.
1DI2001235	Okay, how's this for a plan? I get hold of some of the Lord's private stash, and the two of us get wasted beyond all fuckin' belief. Yeah?
1DI2001236	Hmmm... I'm getting an idea. Picture this... a Trog, three scabs, two live grenades... and a Brahmin. We take 'em out to the bridge, right? And...
1DI2001237	Man, me and you need to get one of those uninfected scab whores, get her shitfaced, and just see what happens.
1DI2001238	Tell you what. You arrange for the two of us to have some fun, and then let me know. Until then... it's back to work.
1DI2001239	Yeah, well, we'll see. Anyway, I got to get back to my shift.
1DI2001240	Yeah! Yeah, that's a good idea. You get the ball rollin', and I'll check back with you tomorrow. Gotta get back to work now.
1DI2001241	I like the way you think. Tell you what. I'll see what I can get stirrin' on my end too, and we'll catch up later. Now... back to the grind.
1DI2001242	I'll do anything at this point. Another day of screamin' at scrubs and I'm gonna go fuckin' nuts. Speaking of which... duty calls.
1DI2001243	This message repeats.
1DI2001244	Yeah? Keep it quick... the bosses are watching.
1DI2001245	What? You trying to get us both shot?
1DI2001246	What do you want? Come on, hurry up, they'll hear!
1DI2001247	Not now! They'll see us!
1DI2001248	Are you crazy? If they see us talking...
1DI2001249	Look, I just want to know if you gave it any thought. You know... what we talked about yesterday. We can't wait forever.
1DI2001250	You can't avoid me forever. And I need your decision. You in or out?
1DI2001251	Fuck them. Those assholes will be a bad memory once we pull this off. Assuming you're in...
1DI2001252	Just shut up and listen to me. You want to get out of this shithole or not? Look, I need your decision. You with us?
1DI2001253	There's been talk. An uprising. Happening soon. It can work, but only if we stick together. It's all of us or none of us, man.
1DI2001254	There's been talk. An uprising. Happening soon. It can work, but only if we stick together. It's all of us or none of us, girl.
1DI2001255	Revolt is in the air, my friend. It's going to happen with or without you. But I'd like it to happen WITH you. What do you say?
1DI2001256	Okay, I'll do it. But I'm not killing anybody. You understand me? Enough blood's been spilled in this place already.
1DI2001257	I... <sigh> All right, I'm in. Whatever you need, whenever you need... I'll be ready.
1DI2001258	Fine, fine. I'm with you. What's the worst that could happen? I get myself killed? That's really not much of a deterrent at this point, is it...
1DI2001259	Oh, I'm in. Just promise me one thing -- when this shit goes down, you put a weapon in my hand and give me my due.
1DI2001260	No. No! I'm sorry, I... I can't. It's just too risky. We fuck up, and we're Trog food. You want to be lunch for your own brother? Cause I sure don't.
1DI2001261	You're fucking crazy, you know that? There's no way I'm getting involved in any half-assed escape plan.
1DI2001262	Well. I thought about it and... no. I'm sorry. Better to live a slave than die a free man. It's just not worth it.
1DI2001263	Not going to happen. You're in over your head. I want no part of whatever craziness you guys are cookin' up. Okay?
1DI2001264	Man, what is wrong with you? There's a window opening, and we've got to jump through while we still can. I'm disappointed...
1DI2001265	Fine. But this IS happening, and when it does, you'd better stay the fuck out of my way, or I may just forget which side you're on.
1DI2001266	Okay, sure. Pussy out if you want. But when it's all over, when me and the others are on the outside... just remember you had your chance.
1DI2001267	What? Man, come on! This is our chance! This is YOUR chance! But you want to stay in the fucking Pitt? What... what happened to you?
1DI2001268	Fuckin' A! I knew you had it in you! Okay, well, just do... what you normally do. You'll know when it's time.
1DI2001269	You're making the right decision here, man. Okay, just stay ready. I'm not sure exactly when. Today, tomorrow, next week, I dunno. But soon.
1DI2001270	Ha! All right! I knew you'd come around! I'll let the others know, and someone will give you the details. We'll hit 'em fast and hard.
1DI2001271	Perfect. Just hang tight a little while longer, while everything comes together. We'll probably have a meeting soon. I'll let you know.
1DI2001272	We're counting on you.
1DI2001275	Good luck down there.
1DI2001276	Get out there before the guards notice you messing around.
1DI2001277	C'mon! Head out to the Steel Mill and look busy!
1DI2001278	Our freedom is in your hands.
1DI2001279	Come back when you're ready to fight.
1DI2001281	Hurry up! I want to see you die!
1DI2001282	Walk proud. You're an ambassador of The Pitt.
1DI2001284	You're always welcome in The Pitt.
1DI2001285	Oh, you take care out there.
1DI2001286	Stop by anytime. It's always a pleasure.
1DI2001287	Come back again soon! Marie and I will be waiting!
1DI2001288	Try not to kidnap anyone on the way out.
1DI2001289	Yes, I think you do.
1DI2001291	Oh good. I can go back to working to death.
1DI2001292	Please, don't let our suffering delay you.
1DI2001293	Sounds like Ashur's working you pretty hard. Must be so tough for you.
1DI2001294	Back to the kid, I guess.
1DI2001295	Yeah, back to work for both of us, I guess.
1DI2001296	And I have a diaper to change and blood samples to run.
1DI2001297	Don't forget to spread the word about The Pitt! Seriously, we could really use more people.
1DI2001298	Don't you worry about a thing. I've got everything under control!
1DI2001299	You just wait, we'll whip The Pitt back into shape!
1DI2001301	Enjoy your loot.
1DI2001302	All right then, come back when you've got more.
1DI2001303	Keep bringing in metal, I'll keep getting you gear.
1DI2001305	Brand.
1DI2001306	Kai.
1DI2001307	Marco.
1DI2001308	Nola.
1DI2001309	We're slaves.
1DI2001310	Bingo.
1DI2001311	Bone.
1DI2001312	Try spending some more money next time.
1DI2001313	Yeah, whatever, newbie.
1DI2001314	Come back any time. Any time you have some cash, that is.
1DI2001315	Hammer.
1DI2001316	Any time you need a little pick me up, I'll be here.
1DI2001318	Don't get yourself killed. That doesn't do me any good at all.
1DI2001319	Tibb.
1DI2001320	Trouble Man.
1DI2001321	We're Raiders.
1DI2001322	Okay, amigo.
1DI2001323	Okay, amiga.
1DI2001324	All right, man. Later.
1DI2001325	All right, girl. Later.
1DI2001326	Stay safe, brother.
1DI2001327	Stay safe, girl.
1DI2001328	Yup. Talk to you later.
1DI2001330	HAHA! I love it. Another slave wandered back here, huh? What's wrong, couldn't get over the bridge? You're lucky I don't fuckin' paste you.
1DI2001331	Why I should... wait... what the?
1DI2001332	Now would you look at this? Where'd you get all this shit anyway? Whatever. Mine now. Thanks, Scab! I hit the jackpot today!
1DI2001334	You ain't one of us. And you don't look like one of those slaves that run off. So, who the fuck are you?
1DI2001335	Answer fast, stranger. Before I make you very, very dead.
1DI2001336	Go on in if you want to join up, they're waitin' for you!
1DI2001337	Well? Everyone's waitin'. Head on in!
1DI2001338	What are you waitin' for? I thought you wanted to join up.
1DI2001339	How about instead of standing around out here, you get the fuck inside and get some work done?
1DI2001340	Get in there and get to work, asshole.
1DI2001341	Move it, slave. Inside. Go.
1DI2001342	Oh my god... are? You killed them! Are you real? You're here to save us? Where are we going?
1DI2001343	Oh my god... Are you real? You're here to save us? Where are we going?
1DI2001344	Well? What's the deal? Where are you taking us?
1DI2001345	Thank you again.
1DI2001346	Hey! You're that asshole that shot up Paradise Falls! Oh, this is gonna be fun!
1DI2001347	Hey. Are you the guy from The Pitt?
1DI2001348	Are you from The Pitt? I thought you were supposed to be a guy.
1DI2001349	I think our business is done.
1DI2001350	You again. What now?
1DI2001351	Piss off. We're waiting for someone.
1DI2001352	Thank you for your help with those guys. They finally tracked me down... I thought I'd have more time.
1DI2001353	You've come about the broadcast, right? Risky, I know. But it had to be done.  So you know who I am. Who are you?
1DI2001354	You could have at least helped me with with those guys. They finally tracked me down... I thought I'd have more time.
1DI2001356	I'm going to stay here and prepare. If they already found me, they'll be back again.
1DI2001357	If they already found me, they'll be back again. We need to get going!
1DI2001358	Did you get the slave clothes already?
1DI2001359	Did you get the slave clothes yet? C'mon! Time is short!
1DI2001360	Alright! You got a disguise. Good. Good. We're ready to head out.
1DI2001362	This is as far as I can go. It's up to you from here on out.
1DI2001363	If you dress up like a slave, you should be able to get past the gates without a problem.
1DI2001364	Once you're inside, find a slave named Midea. She'll be able to help you.
1DI2001365	Remember: your goal is to get access to Ashur and find the cure. After you have it, I'll contact you.
1DI2001367	Don't expect to take anything you have in with you. They'll strip you clean, but I'll find a way to get your things back to you.
1DI2001370	Before we go, there's one last thing.
1DI2001371	It'll be a long trip. Let's get going.
1DI2001372	If you're ready, just jump on the cart.
1DI2001373	The first junction is just down this tunnel.
1DI2001374	Get what supplies you need and meet me at the tunnel.
1DI2001375	I'll meet you at the tunnel.
1DI2001376	Get to the tunnel. I'll meet you there.
1DI2001377	Head into The Pitt and find the cure. Remember: put the slave clothes on and stash your stuff if you can.
1DI2001378	Head to The Pitt. There isn't much time.
1DI2001379	Time's wasting. If you don't get that cure soon, we'll lose our chance.
1DI2001380	We've got to keep moving. There's no time.
1DI2001381	Paid for slaves and let 'em go? Now I've seen it all.
1DI2001382	Hey, it's your merchandise. I don't care what you do with it.
1DI2001383	Seriously? We dragged those assholes out here just so you can let 'em run free?
1DI2001384	You bought a bunch of meat just to let it go? Dumbass.
1DI2001385	Our business is done. Get your slaves out of the pen.
1DI2001386	Take your meat and get out of here.
1DI2001387	Unless you're looking to take a vacation from your freedom, you'll get the fuck out of my face.
1DI2001388	You're not the guy we're waiting for, so we've got nothing to talk about.
1DI2001390	You don't belong here. Piss off.
1DI2001392	Please...
1DI2001393	Please help us...
1DI2001394	You don't know anything about this fool you're traveling with, do you?
1DI2001395	You came a long way just to die.
1DI2001396	You don't know much about Wernher, do you?
1DI2001397	Hehehehe, yeah. Go on inside. It'll be great.
1DI2001398	Man, I love shooting a running slave in the back. Don't you?
1DI2001399	You heard what Mex said. Inside with you.
1DI2001400	It's a shame you made it back. That means I missed you when you ran.
1DI2001401	Get back in there, scab.
1DI2001402	Please feel free to wait inside.
1DI2001403	You're free to wait here, if you'd like. Just don't cause any trouble.
1DI2001405	Oh, what a dear little orphaned child that is. I know a place where she can have a safe home.
1DI2001406	And you can be about your business, far, far away from her.
1DI2001407	So, I suppose you signed on with Ashur and his kind, did you?
1DI2001408	You're not the first to win their freedom and forget where they came from.
1DI2001409	You kicked the hornet's nest now, didn't you? I was lucky to get away even for a second.
1DI2001410	But more importantly, I hear you've stolen the cure. Mind if I see it?
1DI2001411	Sounds to me like you've stirred up a bit of a fuss with the raiders. Couldn't have happened to a nicer bunch of murderers.
1DI2001413	Go get to Wernher. We can't keep the guards occupied forever, you know.
1DI2001414	What a waste you turned out to be.
1DI2001415	Here to scare me, are you?
1DI2001416	Good work sticking it to those taskmasters.
1DI2001417	You kidnapped my daughter, fought my raiders, and gave the workers the ridiculous idea that they can free themselves.
1DI2001418	What do you have to say in your defense?
1DI2001419	I knew I could trust you, and I wasn't disappointed. Wernher's been stopped, the workers are returning to their rightful place.
1DI2001420	The Pitt has a bright future ahead of it, and so do you.
1DI2001421	Nice work in the hole, new blood. Knew you couldn't be one of our normal workers.
1DI2001422	So, that begs the question: who are you, and what are you doing in my city?
1DI2001423	Go find Wernher and put a stop to him. I've got a revolt to stomp down.
1DI2001424	I can't really talk, now. Isn't my husband waiting to see you?
1DI2001425	Come to your senses, have you?
1DI2001426	I'll just hold on to Marie for you. Here we go!
1DI2001427	Wait, where's Ashur? He wasn't supposed to let anyone in here.
1DI2001428	You get the hell out of here!
1DI2001429	I hope you'll excuse me. I can be a little overprotective of my daughter sometimes.
1DI2001430	See, little Marie isn't just special to Ashur and I. She's the cure for The Pitt's mutations, so she's special to all of us.
1DI2001431	Oh! Ashur told me you might be coming here, but I'm afraid I was preoccupied. Little Marie here is an angel, but she can still be a handful.
1DI2001432	I'm Sandra. Ashur set me up here to work on The Pitt's medical research, and Marie here is our daughter. Our little miracle, really.
1DI2001433	Oh! I wasn't expecting Ashur to let you into the lab. I'm Sandra, and if I know my husband, he's already made you an offer to join us, right?
1DI2001434	So you're here to see our little miracle, aren't you? This is my daughter Marie: she can be a handful, but my little angel is going to save the city.
1DI2001435	You put Marie back in that crib, or the guards will make sure you never have kids of your own, you bastard.
1DI2001436	Get away from Marie and go track down that fuckface bastard Wernher.
1DI2001437	I'm afraid I'm very busy, so why don't you go help Ashur, okay?
1DI2001438	You watch your step around me and my daughter.
1DI2001439	I get it! I'm leaving, okay?
1DI2001440	Quick, while the guards are busy, go shut off the power!
1DI2001441	Nice work, pal! When I saw those lights go down, I swear I heard the Trogs laughing.
1DI2001442	I think I speak for all of the ex-slaves here when I say good riddance to those bastards, may they rot in a glowing grave.
1DI2001443	Ah, you finally made it. I've got everything ready and there are plenty of tests to run, so hurry up and put the brat...
1DI2001444	... wait. Where's the cure? Did you lose it? Where is that little bastard?
1DI2001445	Ah, you finally made it. I've got everything ready and there are plenty of tests to run, so hurry up and put the brat in the crib.
1DI2001446	I'm done with you.
1DI2001447	You can't make me talk.
1DI2001448	Well now, look who made it back.
1DI2001449	I'll take those ingots, scab. You just get back in there and get about your business.
1DI2001450	You got a real knack for this! Here, this might help you work a little harder. Original owner can't use it anymore, on account of decapitation.
1DI2001451	Well now, aren't you quite the scrapper? Congratulations.
1DI2001452	You've done well. Ashur wishes to see you. The guards will be told to allow you to pass.
1DI2001454	Good work. You're one step away from Ashur... and our freedom.
1DI2001455	That fight was impressive. One more to go.
1DI2001456	Watch yourself in the arena. We can't do this without you.
1DI2001457	Good luck in your fight. We're all counting on you.
1DI2001458	Let's get outside. We can talk later.
1DI2001459	Let's go. I don't want the guards to catch us in here.
1DI2001460	Listen to this guy. He thinks he's some sort of king.
1DI2001461	Just listen to the speech. Your time will come.
1DI2001462	Good. Just in time. Ashur has ordered everyone into the square. Rumor has it that he's going to open up the arena. That's perfect for us.
1DI2001463	The longer we talk, the more the guards will know that something's going on.
1DI2001464	You're supposed to be blending in. Why are you here?
1DI2001465	You should be out gathering those ingots. The guards won't put up with a lazy slave.
1DI2001466	Alright, we can talk now but we shouldn't take too long. They saw you come in here, so they'll come looking for you if you take too long.
1DI2001467	I have a plan for getting you into Ashur's palace, but we need to wait. In the mean time, you're going to have to blend in.
1DI2001468	Not now! Later! In my house!
1DI2001469	Not here! We'll talk in my house!
1DI2001470	Get away from me! The guards can see us! We'll talk later!
1DI2001471	What were you thinking trying to shoot your way in here like that? That's not going to help anyone.
1DI2001472	I thought Wernher said you were supposed to be clever. Whatever. It doesn't matter. You're here now, and you look like one of us. So that's good.
1DI2001473	But we can't talk out in the open like this. Meet me in my house as soon as you get yourself together. We'll talk there.
1DI2001474	What were you thinking trying to sneak in here like that? These guards are smarter than you think.
1DI2001477	Wernher sent you, didn't he? Good. He finally found someone.
1DI2001478	We can't talk out in the open like this. Meet me in my house as soon as you can. We'll talk there.
1DI2001479	What do you need? Make it fast.
1DI2001480	Not bad, grinder. Not bad. The Bear Brothers were some pretty mean sons o' bitches.
1DI2001481	One more fight and you're free. But I wouldn't plan on making it through the next one.
1DI2001482	Here's a shot for the rads. Come back when you're ready for your last fight.
1DI2001483	Wow. Impressive, slave. Those were some of the toughest scabs around here.
1DI2001484	You've got some fight in you, it seems. But I wouldn't get too excited. I'm sure Ashur's got something special planned for your next fight.
1DI2001485	Here's something for the rads. Enjoy it while you can. Come back when you're ready for your next fight.
1DI2001486	And what're you doing down here, slave? Don't tell me that your pale ass is gonna throw down?
1DI2001487	Impressive, slave. But I guess I shouldn't call you that anymore.
1DI2001488	Not bad. Welcome to the club.
1DI2001489	Get in there, or die in here. Either way, I don't care.
1DI2001490	Don't wuss out on me now! Go!
1DI2001491	Well? Get on in there!
1DI2001492	You again? Back for more, huh?
1DI2001493	Unless you're looking to get killed, you'll get the fuck out of my Arena.
1DI2001494	What? You thought you could kill my buddies at the gate and we'd just let you walk in here?
1DI2001495	Any other day, I'd just stake you out for the Trogs. But Ashur says to put you to work and what the big man says, goes.
1DI2001496	But it looks like we're gonna get some good stuff out of it, eh?
1DI2001497	Haha! So you're the dumbass scab that signed up to fight in the Hole, huh?
1DI2001498	Well, head on down! Faydra's waiting for you! HAHAHA!
1DI2001499	Oh, hey! Look at this, fellas! It's the new recruit!
1DI2001500	Well, newbie. Ol' Mex lied to you. The only thing we're hirin' is slaves.
1DI2001501	So now's the part where we fuck you up, take everything you own, and put your sorry ass to work.
1DI2001502	I don't expect we'll be talking to each other again.
1DI2001503	Dumbass scabs, man. Always think you can fight your way to the top.
1DI2001504	You people should learn that there ain't no getting up once you're down.
1DI2001505	You can take weapons into the Hole.
1DI2001506	Talk to Marco and get a weapon... if you haven't already.
1DI2001507	We're so close...
1DI2001508	The first thing I'm going to do once I'm free is burn out Faydra's eyes. She's the worst of them.
1DI2001509	I can't stand the fucking bosses. This is disgusting.
1DI2001510	Those bastards. It's bad enough they force us to work, but they expect us to fight for their amusement!
1DI2001511	We all knew this was coming but... I dunno... the Hole is terrible.
1DI2001512	Midea is crazy. This'll never work.
1DI2001513	You're fighting in the Hole? Well... good luck with that...
1DI2001514	You're our best hope.
1DI2001515	At least they cure your radiation when you come out of the Hole.
1DI2001516	Ashur's days are numbered.
1DI2001517	Still deigning to talk to us scabs? Well, how nice of you.
1DI2001518	We're all indebted to you for setting us free from those bastards. You just don't know what a difference you've made.
1DI2001519	Now the rest is up to us. And I have to admit, it's pretty daunting.
1DI2001520	At least Wernher's taking care of organizing the city, so I can work on the cure.
1DI2001521	We're all pretty busy getting this place back in shape. What do you want?
1DI2001522	Argh! How am I supposed to take care of a kid while running delicate medical tests?
1DI2001523	Make it quick. This kid is a handful.
1DI2001524	Nice trophy from Ashur you got there. You sure earned it.
1DI2001525	Guess you replaced Ashur completely, huh? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
1DI2001526	Oh, just who I wanted to talk to while being worked to death.
1DI2001527	Oh joy. Our hero.
1DI2001528	It's not easy keeping these people from tearing each other apart. I don't know how Ashur did it.
1DI2001529	Kind of busy trying to keep this place in one piece. And here I thought freedom would make things easier...
1DI2001530	Looking sharp in that suit, pal! Glad I wasn't there when you pried it off old Ashur, though. Bet it smelled like a sack full of dog asses.
1DI2001531	Now that Ashur's gone, there's gonna be some changes around here, believe me.
1DI2001532	How's it going? Don't mind the mess, we're still rebuilding, y'know.
1DI2001533	Hey, take a load off! What's on your mind?
1DI2001534	You're a citizen of The Pitt, now. Doesn't sound like much, but wear that title with pride - it means you're part of something bigger than yourself.
1DI2001535	Well, if it isn't the champion of The Pitt.
1DI2001536	Always good to see you in town.
1DI2001537	How's life treating you, kid?
1DI2001538	Make it quick, would you?
1DI2001540	I guess I've got a moment, since Marie's asleep. What's on your mind?
1DI2001541	Oh, good to see you again!
1DI2001542	Spit it out and leave, before I start shooting.
1DI2001543	I can't believe Ashur's letting you live. What the hell do you want?
1DI2001544	We could use more like you around here.
1DI2001545	Do you mind? I've got a lot to do.
1DI2001546	Have you seen Wild Bill around?
1DI2001547	Any luck finding Wild Bill?
1DI2001548	Did you change your mind about helping us out?
1DI2001549	Thanks for patching up that asshole. He's got at least another week before he drops dead from exhaustion. Ha ha ha!
1DI2001550	You aint getting a reward if that's what you're after. Get out of my face!
1DI2001551	It's Billy! I know it's him!
1DI2001552	Oh,  Billy...
1DI2001553	My poor brother.
1DI2001554	<Sniffle> Billy... <cries>
1DI2001557	Whatever it was, it wasn't me.
1DI2001558	Please. Just go away.
1DI2001559	Don't hurt me.
1DI2001560	Get out of my face, asshole.
1DI2001561	What? You want me to knock your teeth out. Shove off!
1DI2001562	Find some other place to be. Now.
1DI2001563	You'll walk off if you know what's good for you.
1DI2001565	So you're the lucky scab gathering ingots for me today, huh?
1DI2001566	Woo! Saw you fighting in the Hole. What a piece of work!
1DI2001567	Now I know why you ain't afraid of those Trogs! No hard feelings, huh?
1DI2001569	Any luck out there?
1DI2001570	You ain't dead. That's always a good sign.
1DI2001571	Mill always needs more metal. Got any for me?
1DI2001572	You got something to say, or are you just here to stare at the freak?
1DI2001574	Well, if it isn't Ashur's newest pet! He doesn't let many mongrels into his mansion.
1DI2001575	Him and his keen eyes must see something special in you. So Lulu's going to keep her eyes on you, too.
1DI2001576	Is Ashur's new pet here to be fed?
1DI2001577	Good pets get fed. Bad pets get shot. So, you've come to be fed?
1DI2001578	Are you a hungry pet?
1DI2001579	Oh, look. Another worker who thinks they can address their betters.
1DI2001580	I'm sure everyone's impressed that you killed a pig in the Hole. Don't think it makes you an equal.
1DI2001581	Oh. It's talking to me again.
1DI2001582	Hey, if it ain't the champion of the Hole! That was a hell of a show you put on down there!
1DI2001583	Good thing, too. Otherwise, I was gonna start shooting down there myself, just to keep things interesting!
1DI2001584	Hey, champ!
1DI2001585	Hey, if it isn't the newest addition to our little family!
1DI2001586	You hit the jackpot now, wizkid. You're in Ashur's army. Now's when the hard work really starts!
1DI2001587	Feeling a little queasy? I got what you need.
1DI2001588	Back again? How you feeling?
1DI2001589	Keeping busy? Need a pick-me-up?
1DI2001590	Hrmph. Guess we've got another soldier.
1DI2001591	Don't think you're so special, kid. You're not the first to climb your way out of the mud.
1DI2001592	Buzz off, new kid.
1DI2001593	Well, look at you. Been a while since I got to welcome you to this fine fucking city.
1DI2001594	Watch your step in Uptown, or you might just take a tumble.
1DI2001595	We don't need another dirty worker up here. Just because Ashur lets you in doesn't mean we have to like it.
1DI2001597	I got better things to do than talk with you.
1DI2001598	Saw you earn your ticket Uptown. Don't start thinking that makes you special. You're still just meat.
1DI2001599	You just got moved up to a higher grade of sausage, is all.
1DI2001600	Hey, meat.
1DI2001601	Lookin' good, newbie.
1DI2001605	Scram.
1DI2001607	Hey there! Welcome to the family!
1DI2001608	I'm told that you might be looking for Marco. Am I right?
1DI2001609	And thanks to you, our path to freedom is somewhat closer.
1DI2001610	It's a shame that violence is the only thing that could solve this.
1DI2001611	All of this will pass, I assure you.
1DI2001612	Don't try to achieve your goal, and your goal will be achieved.
1DI2001613	Calming philosophy aside, being beaten kind of hurts.
1DI2001614	You're new, aren't you? Are you here from the Erie Stretch? The Capital Wasteland? Ronto? Where's home?
1DI2001615	So, what have you heard?
1DI2001616	What's new? Have you heard anything?
1DI2001617	Keep an eye out, buddy. They're watching.
1DI2001618	If you hear any good gossip, you let me know.
1DI2001619	I bet they have good food Uptown...
1DI2001620	If you could maybe, you know... "drop" something decent over the side, it'd be nice to make something to eat.
1DI2001621	I guess you don't need this slop if you're headed upstairs.
1DI2001623	Hey. You want some horrible food?
1DI2001624	I think the food is slightly less terrible today than usual.
1DI2001625	You sure you want this stuff? Really?
1DI2001626	Good luck up there with the bosses. I know you won't let us down.
1DI2001627	You'd best get out of here before you have an accident.
1DI2001628	I said piss off.
1DI2001629	Go on and snitch to the bosses if you're going to.
1DI2001630	Put that axe in the back of one of the bosses if you can do it without getting caught.
1DI2001631	Don't get caught with that thing.
1DI2001632	I've helped you out all I can. Good luck.
1DI2001633	Hey... not so loud. The bosses can't see what I'm up to over here.
1DI2001635	All right. All better. But still...
1DI2001636	You'd better get out of here. They might suspect something.
1DI2001637	All right. All better.
1DI2001638	Now, get out of here before the bosses suspect something. I'll be here if you get hurt again.
1DI2001639	If you get hurt, come talk to me. I can help you out.
1DI2001640	Oh, honey. You're pretty banged up there. I can help you out, what do you say?
1DI2001641	Well, look at you, fancypants.
1DI2001642	Don't let it go to your head... boss.
1DI2001643	No more smelting for you, I guess.
1DI2001644	Just go easy on us. Remember where you came from.
1DI2001645	Well, look at you. Guess you're on a permanent break.
1DI2001646	If we rest too long, there'll be hell to pay.
1DI2001647	It just never ends.
1DI2001648	Tired... so tired...
1DI2001649	I just can't do this anymore...
1DI2001650	You're new here, aren't you? Just stay clear of the smelt.
1DI2001651	Don't trust Brand.
1DI2001652	The more we work, the less attention the bosses pay to what Marco is up to.
1DI2001653	I'd rather be out in the yard breaking steel.
1DI2001654	Christ, it's hot in here.
1DI2001655	I wish they'd just kill me and get it over with.
1DI2001656	I'm about to fall over...
1DI2001657	I just want a break...
1DI2001658	What? Don't sneak up on me like that. I'm working here!
1DI2001659	Watch yourself in here. It's dangerous.
1DI2001660	Don't let them see us talking!
1DI2001661	Get back to your job!
1DI2001662	Why are you walking around? Don't you have an assignment?
1DI2001663	Eyes front! Do your work!
1DI2001664	We can't talk out in the open! You know that!
1DI2001665	Get away from me! Go back to work!
1DI2001666	What? No! Just get back to work!
1DI2001667	Are you crazy? Work! Don't talk.
1DI2001670	Bingo?
1DI2001671	Look scab, you don't want my attention.
1DI2001672	Are you nuts? Get the fuck back to work before I pull your arms off! Ha ha!
1DI2001673	Is the little scab looking to get hurt? Then the little scab better get out of my face. Ha!
1DI2001674	Man, you killed the fuck out of Gruber!
1DI2001675	Those Bear Brothers never saw you comin', did they?
1DI2001676	Guess you're one of us now. Good luck!
1DI2001677	Well now, a grinder made it out of the hole. That hasn't happened in a while. Well, I hope you have some money, newbie.
1DI2001678	If it isn't my favorite newbie. You bring some money to spend?
1DI2001679	If you have money, great. If not, get the fuck out of my place.
1DI2001680	What is it, newbie?
1DI2001681	No scabs near the gate. Back off.
1DI2001683	Only bosses allowed past here. You just go back to work.
1DI2001684	Workers stay in the mill.
1DI2001685	You can go past.
1DI2001686	Go on in, if you're goin'.
1DI2001687	Well look at this, one of the scabs earned his wings. Welcome to the grill! Whatever you need, we got.
1DI2001688	Assuming that what you need is to get shit-faced drunk! Ha!
1DI2001689	The life of a worker's gotta be made easier by some healthy drink, huh?
1DI2001690	Hey there, need something to help soften your brain?
1DI2001691	...Bone ain't too bad, either. Heh... Bone.
1DI2001692	You ever notice that Midea is kinda hot?
1DI2001693	Jackson, man. Don't forget it.
1DI2001694	Trouble Man. You don't wanna know how I got the name.
1DI2001695	It's true. I'm nothing but trouble... man.
1DI2001696	You'd best look at the ground when you're talking to me, scab.
1DI2001697	Get out of my face, scab.
1DI2001698	I will break you the fuck in half. Get back to work.
1DI2001699	You'd best get out of my face and back to work.
1DI2001700	The only thing I have to say to you is: get the fuck back to work.
1DI2001701	Move on, pissant.
1DI2001702	You'd best get back to work, grinder.
1DI2001703	Damn sla... I mean workers.
1DI2001704	Ha! You look like you haven't seen the sun in years. Time to fix that.
1DI2001705	Do I know you? How long have you been here?
1DI2001706	I'm gonna go upside your head if you don't get out of my face.
1DI2001707	Less talky. More worky.
1DI2001708	Do I look like I want to be talking to the help?
1DI2001709	Are you kidding me? Get the fuck back to work, scab.
1DI2001711	Down with Ashur!
1DI2001712	Kill the taskmasters!
1DI2001713	Go away! They'll see us!
1DI2001715	Jump on the cart. I'm right behind you.
1DI2001716	You made it. Are you about ready to go?
1DI2001718	The tunnel isn't far from here.
1DI2001719	There's not a lot of time. Get yourself ready and meet me at the tunnel.
1DI2001720	C'mon. We have to get to the tunnel.
1DI2001721	Go! The slavers might not be there long!
1DI2001722	We don't have a lot of time, get over to that slaver outpost.
1DI2001723	Hurry up and get that slave outfit.
1DI2001724	You got 'em, right?
1DI2001725	You look like someone who's had a run in with slavers.
1DI2001726	You got the clothes, didn't you?
1DI2001727	Watch yourself in there.
1DI2001728	I won't lie, it'll be rough in there.
1DI2001730	Mind yourself in Lord Ashur's home.
1DI2001732	I don't see why Ashur's wasting his time with you.
1DI2001733	Well, if it ain't the new scum. Congrats on the promotion!
1DI2001734	Lord Ashur wants a word with you. Good luck.
1DI2001735	Hurry over to Haven, kid.
1DI2001736	Guess you earned your ticket out of Downtown.
1DI2001737	Gonna turn your back on us and join Ashur, is that right?
1DI2001738	Off to talk with Ashur? Lucky you.
1DI2001739	It's about time we had a talk.
1DI2001740	Die, you bastard!
1DI2001741	Ashur's looking forward to meeting you, champ.
1DI2001744	We need to talk...
1DI2001745	Psst.
1DI2001746	<Clearing throat.>
1DI2001747	I know you've been avoiding me. Just give me 20 seconds.
1DI2001748	What's going on in here, Midea? Who is this scab?
1DI2001749	Don't let your guard down. They can come barging in here any second.
1DI2001750	We can finally talk. But we still need to be careful.
1DI2001751	I hope you didn't have any trouble from the guards.
1DI2001752	Keep moving. They can't see us together.
1DI2001753	The guards are always watching me.
1DI2001754	Don't look at me. The guards will suspect something.
1DI2001755	Ashur up there in his palace and us down here in the muck...
1DI2001756	Home sweet filth.
1DI2001757	Disgusting, isn't it?
1DI2001758	It always smells like that in here. You get used to it.
1DI2001759	Well, it's home. I guess. You see how they make us live?
1DI2001760	Good knowin' ya, scab!
1DI2001761	Man, I can't believe Ashur opened up the arena again!
1DI2001762	This is gonna be some good shit, I tell ya!
1DI2001763	Go on! Fight!
1DI2001764	Nothin' I love more than watchin' grinders die in the Hole.
1DI2001765	You? Fight in the hole? Oh, I can't wait for this.
1DI2001766	Don't let us down.
1DI2001767	The bosses are all against you, but we know you can do it.
1DI2001768	I hope they let you live, even if you lose.
1DI2001769	I'm scared for you... you're our last hope...
1DI2001770	Good luck in the Hole. I'm pulling for you.
1DI2001771	Good luck in there. We're counting on you.
1DI2001772	Are you really going to fight in the Hole?
1DI2001773	I got important news.
1DI2001774	How'd it go with... you know...
1DI2001775	You got a funny look on your face. You got something you wanna say?
1DI2001779	You got everything set?
1DI2001780	That thing with the you-know-what... ?
1DI2001781	You get those packages?
1DI2001782	I expect your mission was a success?
1DI2001785	<Moan>
1DI2001787	It... hurts...
1DI2001788	Please... someone... help me...
1DI2001790	What does he want?
1DI2001791	What does she want?
1DI2001793	<Cough>
1DI2001798	This can't be good.
1DI2001799	Who's this asshole?
1DI2001800	Don't waste your breath, boy. Aint talking to you.
1DI2001801	Don't waste your breath, girl. Aint talking to you.
1DI2001802	Better not waste my time.
1DI2001803	Dammit.
1DI2001804	<sigh> Damn.
1DI2001806	Got nothing to say to you.
1DI2001807	<Cough> Back off.
1DI2001808	What're you looking at?
1DI2001810	Well, if it isn't our fearless champion.
1DI2001811	Hello, dear. Hope you're not spending all your time working.
1DI2001812	We never seem to have any alone time anymore.
1DI2001813	What is it? I'm a little busy right now.
1DI2001814	You have any idea how much work it takes to keep this city together?
1DI2001815	You'd be surprised how tough it is, being a king.
1DI2001816	Nobody's tried to shoot me today, so things are going pretty well.
1DI2001817	I hope you're well, dear.
1DI2001818	Oh, hello!
1DI2001820	Having a good time?
1DI2001821	Get the fuck out of my face!
1DI2001822	Stop wasting my time!
1DI2001824	What is wrong with you?
1DI2001825	Saw another run-away down by the shore. Well, most of one, anyway. Think the river monster got the rest of it.
1DI2001826	Hey, look. Cloudy and overcast again. Fucking Mill.
1DI2001827	Scram, before I mess your face up bad as mine.
1DI2001828	Lulu is watching you!
1DI2001829	Lord Ashur protect us all.
1DI2001830	Hungry?
1DI2001832	Don't you have other people to bother?
1DI2001833	Do I look like your personal assistant?
1DI2001834	All these universities, you'd think people in the past would've been smarter.
1DI2001835	<sighing>
1DI2001836	Another fine day in The Pitt, huh?
1DI2001837	How you feeling?
1DI2001838	Saw one Trog last night, swear it was Jeff.
1DI2001839	Can't seem to get enough sleep, these days.
1DI2001840	Chin up! You're in The Pitt, what more could you want?
1DI2001841	Don't you have something you should be doing?
1DI2001842	I wonder what Trog tastes like...
1DI2001843	Keeping busy, meat?
1DI2001844	Screw off!
1DI2001845	Mind your own business, nebby.
1DI2001846	Don't give me that holier-than-thou look.
1DI2001847	Well, if it ain't the saint.
1DI2001848	Bet you think you're better than us, don't you?
1DI2001849	Looks like you don't mind getting your hands dirty, killer.
1DI2001850	Bet you could tell a few stories.
1DI2001851	Good to see another mean bastard in The Pitt.
1DI2001852	Well, if it ain't the devil in person.
1DI2001853	Damn. I'm glad you're on our side, meathead.
1DI2001854	Look at the guns on you, huh?
1DI2001855	Well, aren't you a tough one?
1DI2001856	You eyein' me?
1DI2001858	I don't trust anybody who looks as friendly as you.
1DI2001859	What the fuck are you smiling about?
1DI2001860	If it ain't the smartest asshole in The Pitt.
1DI2001861	You got brains, but you're no Ashur.
1DI2001862	Awfully twitchy, ain't you?
1DI2001863	Hey, if it isn't quickdraw.
1DI2001864	Here comes speedy.
1DI2001865	Bring back any good food?
1DI2001866	Could be worse, pal.
1DI2001868	Keep walkin', pal.
1DI2001871	Had any good fights, lately?
1DI2001872	You on food run duty?
1DI2001873	All clear around town, I hear.
1DI2001874	Looking for some fun?
1DI2001877	You seem so anxious.
1DI2001878	Relax. Good will come in its time.
1DI2001879	I don't have much time. Ask me what you will.
1DI2001880	Remain calm and you will achieve your goals.
1DI2001881	Keep a eye out.
1DI2001882	They're watching.
1DI2001883	The bosses know a lot more than they let on.
1DI2001884	These guys are up to something, I'm sure of it.
1DI2001885	<coughs>... you want some of this or not?
1DI2001886	I think it finally stopped moving...
1DI2001887	This stuff stinks...
1DI2001888	I can't believe we actually eat this.
1DI2001889	Wernher isn't going to fail us.
1DI2001890	It won't be long now.
1DI2001891	We'll be ready soon.
1DI2001893	When the time comes, I'll be here to fix you up.
1DI2001895	Be careful out here. It's dangerous.
1DI2001896	If you're hurt, I can patch you up. The bosses'll just shoot you.
1DI2001897	<coughing>
1DI2001907	Stop staring, newbie.
1DI2001909	Back to work, you.
1DI2001910	Don't you have work to do, scab?
1DI2001911	Go smelt something, jackass.
1DI2001912	That's one way to get out of work, isn't it? Ha!
1DI2001913	What's goin' on, killer? Ha ha!
1DI2001914	You're one crazy ex-scab, I'll give you that.
1DI2001915	Not bad. I never thought anyone would take out Gruber.
1DI2001916	Oh look, it's the newbie.
1DI2001917	Yeah, what is is, newbie?
1DI2001918	You don't look like you got a lot of money.
1DI2001919	Back the fuck away from this gate.
1DI2001920	Get away from the gate. You scabs know better.
1DI2001921	Go back to work, grinder. There's nothing over here that concerns you.
1DI2001922	Dumbass scab, get away from here!
1DI2001923	She's all yours, champ. Head on up.
1DI2001924	Nice fightin', scab. Just don't forget where you come from.
1DI2001925	Get on up there. You earned it.
1DI2001926	Go on up, killer.
1DI2001927	Welcome to the grill.
1DI2001928	Drink up, before everyone else does.
1DI2001929	You look... ug. Sober.
1DI2001932	You ain't so good, are you?
1DI2001933	Aww, such a sweet face. How'd you make it out of the Hole?
1DI2001934	Aww, such a sweet face. Get back to work.
1DI2001935	Back to work, angel.
1DI2001936	You got the look of the devil about you. Shame you're just another scab.
1DI2001937	You don't much look like a slave.
1DI2001938	Ha! How the mighty have fallen.
1DI2001939	Not such a badass now, are you?
1DI2001940	That's what I like to see: a big tough scab on my crew.
1DI2001941	Boy, you got some arms on you, scab.
1DI2001943	You can stop eyeing me up anytime, scab.
1DI2001944	You see a lot don't you? You up to something? Huh?
1DI2001945	You look too damn friendly for your own good.
1DI2001947	Can I do something for you, professor?
1DI2001948	Get back to work, professor.
1DI2001949	If you're so damn smart, how'd you end up here, huh?
1DI2001950	You're awfully nimble for a slave.
1DI2001951	Speed it up, twinkletoes. There's work to be done.
1DI2001952	You got a light step there, grinder.
1DI2001953	Shouldn't you be working?
1DI2001954	Fuckin' peons.
1DI2001955	You look like you don't have enough to do, peon.
1DI2001956	Keep walkin', drone.
1DI2001957	Move on, scab.
1DI2001959	Don't look at me, scab.
1DI2001960	Don't you look at me.
1DI2001961	Eyes down!
1DI2001962	What is it, grinder?
1DI2001963	You want something, scab?
1DI2001964	Nice work in the Hole, killer.
1DI2001965	Welcome to the club. Don't let us down.
1DI2001966	I made good caps betting on you.
1DI2001967	Looks like you could pound a few skulls.
1DI2001968	Quick little bastard, aren't you?
1DI2001969	What's up, prettyboy?
1DI2001970	Hey, sexy.
1DI2001971	I'm fucking bored.
1DI2001972	Days like today make me want to fucking hang myself...
1DI2001973	Havin' fun yet? Damn, this day can't end soon enough.
1DI2001974	So guess what's going on today? Hey, let me give you a hint. Nothing. Man, I'd give my last pack of smokes for some action right about now.
1DI2001975	<yawn> A guy could die of fuckin' boredom in this place. You know what I mean?
1DI2001976	Man, the scabs ain't half as feisty as that last batch. At least when they fight back I get some fuckin' exercise.
1DI2001977	Does this look infected?
1DI2001978	Goddamn, what a boring day. I could go home, and these fucking scabs would keep on workin' anyway. What a waste of time.
1DI2001979	Arg! Fucker!
1DI2001981	You grinder fuck!
1DI2001983	You're gonna pay for that, scab.
1DI2001987	Ow! Fuck!
1DI2001997	Arg!
1DI2002010	Hurts!
1DI2002014	Bleeding...
1DI2002015	Kill you...
1DI2002016	Blood...
1DI2002017	No more! Please!
1DI2002018	You think that will stop me?
1DI2002019	Pain won't stop us!
1DI2002020	Ah well. Guess they're gone.
1DI2002021	Good enough, I guess.
1DI2002022	I guess they ran off.
1DI2002023	Your little revolt ends here, scab!
1DI2002024	Fuckin' slaves! I'm gonna kill you!
1DI2002025	Grinders. Must. Die.
1DI2002027	I'm gonna end you!
1DI2002028	What? Seriously?
1DI2002030	That was your last mistake.
1DI2002031	Your funeral, pal.
1DI2002032	I'm gonna bury you!
1DI2002046	Fight with me!
1DI2002047	Find anything you like?
1DI2002048	Get your hands out of my pockets.
1DI2002049	To anyone who can hear me: my name is Wernher. I come from a settlement to the north.
1DI2002050	From nothing, I have brought you this settlement. From chaos, The Pitt thrives. We all work to make it thrive further.
1DI2002051	A reminder: work is rewarded. Sloth is punished. Such is the way we thrive in this hellish place.
1DI2002052	To work for the good of one's fellow man is a blessing. Through labor, we shall all thrive.
1DI2002053	"What is genuine is proved in the fire, what is false we shall not miss in our ranks." Remember it well, my friends.
1DI2002054	Let the ruling classes of the Wasteland tremble at our new industrial revolution!
1DI2002055	Let no man call you slaves, nor any man call themselves your owners. We are all workers, whether it be in the mills, the alleys, or the war zones.
1DI2002056	Great deeds require great work. We are rebuilding a glorious city, and restoring the world. We must all work for this greatness.
1DI2002057	You are not collared beasts of burden. You are proud workers, building a home in the world. Work shall set us all free.
1DI2002058	We all work. Some in the mill, making weapons. Some in the alleys, defending the city. Some in the wasteland, raiding for our food. But we all work.
1DI2002059	Work is what separates man from beast. It is how we change our world. It raises us above the Trogs. Work is what makes us human.
1DI2002060	The world turned against Man because we were lazy and wasteful. Now we must earn our home once again, through work.
1DI2002061	You build the weapons to arm the soldiers. Soldiers use weapons to keep you safe and bring back food. We depend on each other.
1DI2002062	Nothing is impossible, through the sweat of our brow.
1DI2002063	Outside of the Pitt, the world lies in ruins and survivors scratch in the dirt without dreams. But in the Pitt, we can live and rebuild with purpose.
1DI2002064	Is that so? My second-in-command Wernher betrays me, works with slaves to escape justice, and then you magically appear among the slaves in my city?
1DI2002065	Next you'll claim he didn't send you to steal from me.
1DI2002066	I'm afraid that threat doesn't work so well on an old slave. You'll just have to kill me.
1DI2002067	No, I don't think so. You may not have the guts to change The Pitt, but I sure do.
1DI2002068	I find that hard to believe. But you still managed to find him, and that's more than my men were able to do, so good work, I suppose.
1DI2002069	And Marie is back safe and sound, which is what really matters. And you stopped Wernher, so I guess you can live.
1DI2002070	If the city's future wasn't so bright, this would have gone a lot worse for you.
1DI2002071	Good try, but no. Now fuck off before I put a bullet in you.
1DI2002072	That's sweet of you trying to keep my hopes up, to convince me he's still alive. But I can tell you're not telling me the truth.
1DI2002073	Bill's dead, isn't he? Actually, I don't want to hear anymore.  Thank you for your help.  I need to let the others know what happened to Bill.
1DI2002074	Here, take these stimpaks.  It's all I have.
1DI2002075	How dare you talk like that! Bill's dead, isn't he?
1DI2002076	Actually, I don't want to hear anymore.  Thank you for your help.  I need to let the others know what happened to Bill.
1DI2002077	Yeah... maybe not. I think you're with them.
1DI2002078	I'm afraid whoever told you that you were charming was playing a cruel joke on you. But don't fret. There are other means to persuade.
1DI2002080	I saw you take that.
1DI2002081	Thieving bastard.
1DI3000001	Well, what are you doing here? You should be out there tracking him down and putting an end to this once and for all!
1DI3000002	What? Well...
1DI3000003	Damnit... You're probably right. What the hell was I thinking?
1DI3000004	Guess I'll have to come up with another plan.
1DI3000005	Come on, boys. Not worth sticking around here. Let's go blow off some steam. Kill anything or anyone you like.
1DI3000006	Not that it's really any of your business, but we have an arrangement. He buys water, I send him some.
1DI3000007	I use the caps and tech he pays me to fund the other water deliveries.
1DI3000008	I send my men with the water to the Museum Authority in the Mall. Griffon sends the payment back with my men. So far, so good.
1DI3000009	Lyons wouldn't approve, but I don't really care anymore. I need the resources and there's certainly plenty of water to go around.
1DI3000010	My what now? My bottling operation? Oh you mean where I add my secret ingredient to the Aqua Pura.
1DI3000012	Now, if you'll excuse me. I have customers that need my attention.
1DI3000013	Why... you ARE the Prophet of Atom! I didn't recognize you until now... Your eyes are aglow, your very skin radiates with Atom's Heat!
1DI3000014	I didn't realize... My Lord, now that you have revealed yourself to me, I do... I see the errors of my ways.
1DI3000015	Forgive me, for I knew not what I was doing... we will spread your word without the use of the holy water... we will return the Aqua Pura to Megaton.
1DI3000016	It shall be a test: the worthy will seek us out, and finding us they will find the Message of Atom, drinking the Waters of Light in their souls. Yes!
1DI3000017	I leave you now, Lord. I can not bear to look upon your shining face any longer.
1DI3000018	You may not agree with us, but you need not mock our beliefs.
1DI3000019	The Prophet of Atom would be so aglow as to outshine the sun. You are not he.
1DI3000021	The Prophet of Atom would be so aglow as to outshine the sun. You are not she.
1DI3000022	We do what we can. Take, for example, this ghoul Griffon. He wanted to PURCHASE a bunch of water.
1DI3000023	What the hell does that droopy irradiated fool need with pure water? Thinks he can sell it in Underworld. Moron.
1DI3000024	But, he's the only one who's offered to PAY for water, in caps AND technology.
1DI3000025	And what Lyons doesn't know won't hurt him. There's plenty of water to go around.
1DI3000026	And I can use it to pay Rivet City to provide security for all the caravans we can't escort ourselves. I'm lucky he came along.
1DI3000027	Heard about that. News traveled fast. I couldn't believe it. I mean, everyone knew it was crazy building a city around that bomb...
1DI3000028	But I don't think anyone expected the bomb to actually go off...
1DI3000029	I didn't expect things to end like this... but it did get Lyons off my back about it, so here. Might as well take the money I was going to give you.
1DI3000030	A cult? There's something about Megaton, isn't there. It's apparently THE place to start a cult these days.
1DI3000031	Guess I can start sending them water again. Hopefully they can keep their grubby hands on their shipments this time.
1DI3000032	Here. It's not much. Most of the assets have been exhausted, but take this. It's definitely worth getting Lyons off my back. Thanks.
1DI3000033	Yes, yes. I received a message from her. It's here somewhere... Well, no matter where it is, I know what it said.
1DI3000034	<Sigh.> The Initiates just finished itemizing a requisition of confiscated Enclave gear. There were a few items that we didn't immediately send out.
1DI3000035	I suppose you are welcome to those...
1DI3000036	The Brotherhood thanks you for your efforts. Now if you don't mind? I think I'll just take a brief nap here at my desk...
1DI3000038	I suppose you're welcome to those...
1DI3000040	Yeah, you don't seem like the goody-goody type. But don't spread this around: So this ghoul, Griffon, comes in wanting to PURCHASE a bunch of water.
1DI3000045	Look, it's not that I don't trust you. I know you're trustworthy... but see, that's just it. I don't think you're capable of discretion.
1DI3000046	Nothing immoral is going on, but I'm already in a lot of hot water with the Brotherhood. I need to be careful with what I say and to whom.
1DI3000055	Yes, we most certainly did.
1DI3000056	Between your help in destroying their headquarters, and their subsequent defeat at the purifier, the Enclave was thrown into disarray.
1DI3000057	Liberty Prime has been assisting our forces in removing any remaining Enclave forces.
1DI3000059	After securing the purifier, our forces were sent to deal with the Enclave in full.
1DI3000060	The Pride and Liberty Prime made short work of their base of operations, and have since been cleaning up pockets of resistance.
1DI3000061	Well, that's really up to you, isn't it?
1DI3000062	The Brotherhood has a clear plan of action: the remnants of the Enclave must be swept away.
1DI3000063	The Pride has been working to this end ever since we took the purifier back.
1DI3000064	The only remaining question is whether we can count on you to help us.
1DI3000066	Fantastic. Now we'll all just hold our breath while the Rivet City council picks her replacement. Took them a week to pick her originally. A week!
1DI3000067	Don't get me started about Rivet City. They feel entitled to everything.
1DI3000068	Always whining about how "they're OUR scientists," and all that crap. Like they did US a favor.
1DI3000069	Thought the security deal we worked out with them would be a win-win. My hope was they'd completely take over the water caravan escorts by now.
1DI3000070	But I got Officer Lepelletier bitching about an "organized bandit syndicate."
1DI3000071	Guess they don't have the chops after all. I need you to go visit Officer Lepelletier and lend a hand.
1DI3000072	Rivet City security is supposed to be filling in for the Brotherhood as escorts for the water caravans. They're having a bit of trouble.
1DI3000073	Need you to go visit Officer Lepelletier and lend a hand.
1DI3000074	Maybe you should write this down:
1DI3000075	Go talk to Officer Lepelletier at Rivet City and help her figure out what is happening to her Caravans.
1DI3000076	Indeed it did. The Tidal Basin is full of fresh, clean water now.
1DI3000077	We've been working to see that it's distributed to as many people as possible across the Wasteland.
1DI3000078	In fact, I'm hopeful that soon we won't be referring to "the Wasteland" any longer.
1DI3000079	None of this would have been possible without the efforts of both you and your father. I doubt we shall ever be able to truly repay you.
1DI3000080	Yes, it did. We've been distributing the water as best we can.
1DI3000081	There have been reports of some... problems, but we're dealing with them.
1DI3000082	Without your assistance, this never would have been possible. We all owe both you and your father a great deal of thanks.
1DI3000084	He's dead? Greaaaat. I guess I'll just have to find some other way to subsidize the water caravans.
1DI3000085	He he. I guess he's more clever than I thought.
1DI3000086	He's probably planning on selling the real Aqua Pura to Raiders and Slavers.
1DI3000087	Hmmm. Now there's a thought! Of course, Lyons would have my head if I tried anything of the sort.
1DI3000088	Ah, but of course! You have been blessed by Atom with Eternal Light, and are most welcome to our monastery.
1DI3000089	You will find many kindred spirits within. Please, introduce yourself to our leader, our Luminescent Mother, Curie the Third.
1DI3000090	I'm afraid it is not open to the unenlightened. Your presence would contaminate our great works.
1DI3000091	However, if you are willing to be baptized in Atom's holy Light, then perhaps I could allow you to enter and meet our leader.
1DI3000092	I'm sorry, but I must insist. You simply cannot be allowed on holy ground without knowing Atom's Light.
1DI3000093	Where you see radiation, we see humanity's salvation. And we can hardly allow the unsaved into our holy monastery, now can we?
1DI3000094	You may supplicate to Atom your desire for enlightenment at our Tabernacle. All may bask in the Eternal Light. All may be filled with the Glow.
1DI3000095	Ah, I can feel the Light within you. By all means, you are welcome in our sanctuary.
1DI3000096	Please, speak with our leader, our Luminescent Mother, Curie the Third.
1DI3000097	You have been marked, but I feel your dedication is still too weak. Our holy site is only open to the truly blessed.
1DI3000098	Perhaps after you have spent more time praying to Atom in warmth, you will be deemed worthy.
1DI3000099	Oh, truly your Light is second only to the Suns of Atom themselves! You are more than welcome.
1DI3000101	No one told you? It's simple. We hit water caravans and stash the Aqua Pura...
1DI3000102	And after Rivet City's had enough, we offer our "Wasteland Protection Services."
1DI3000103	Then we control the water. And we charge whoever whatever we want for it.
1DI3000104	How do you like that?
1DI3000105	Don't bother me with the details until you've taken care of the problem. I'm not sending more Aqua Pura until I know it's been handled.
1DI3000106	Where have you been? Haven't you heard? Megaton's destroyed. That bomb detonated, taking the whole town with it.
1DI3000107	So I don't really have to worry about their water shipment anymore. Problem solved itself. Although I can't say that's the solution I was hoping for.
1DI3000108	I don't know WHAT to think. I got Lyons breathing down my neck about it though.
1DI3000109	Apparently Megaton's sending him nasty letters demanding a shipment. I JUST sent them a week's supply!  A month's, if they ration.
1DI3000110	Look, if you can straighten out Megaton so I get Lyons off my back, I'll make it worth your while.
1DI3000111	Megaton's sending Lyons nasty letters demanding a shipment. I've already sent them a shipment. I need you to find out what happened to it.
1DI3000112	Think you can handle that? I'll make it worth your while.
1DI3000113	I need someone to go find out what happened to Megaton's water delivery. Walk over there and ask around.
1DI3000122	The previously reported breach has been suppressed. The Metro system is now functioning within normal parameters.
1DI3000123	Information is available on that subject. Please specify.
1DI3000124	Don't be silly! How else will we spread the word to the unenlightened?
1DI3000125	So many misunderstand Atom, and fear the Glow of his Light as a thing of destruction, rather than humanity's next step towards perfection.
1DI3000126	With this marvelous holy water, they drink without fear, and by the time the Glow consumes them, they have no need to fear ever again.
1DI3000127	We're doing holy work here, tending to the suffering and hopeless. Our holy water gives warmth to those who would only die unsaved, otherwise.
1DI3000128	No, it's full of Atom's Light. It's a tragedy that not everyone is prepared to accept Enlightenment, but such are the ways of the divine.
1DI3000129	Besides, we never force anyone to drink it. We simply give the opportunity to those who thirst for something more.
1DI3000130	Aheh. Um... yeah, look at that. We practically have the same hair cut. What are the chances of that? Aheh.
1DI3000131	That is what the unbelievers from that so called "Project Purity" call it before we fill it with Atom's Holy Light.
1DI3000134	Well this is it, isn't it? If we can't stop them now, we can't stop them at all.
1DI3000135	Nothing like certain death to get you motivated.
1DI3000136	Not only have we lost our main weapon, but now we've got to deal with some sort of orbital strike capability?
1DI3000137	They sure pulled a fast one on us.
1DI3000138	Things are going our way, no question about it. We've cut off their head, now we just need to carve up the body.
1DI3000139	If we can disable this orbital platform of theirs, we can still come out on top.
1DI3000140	It's a shame, really. I'd love access to that kind of tech.
1DI3000141	The tables have certainly been turned on us.
1DI3000142	With Prime gone, we're back to trying to counter their Veritbirds with limited success. Hopefully we can come up with something.
1DI3000143	Plasma weapons certainly aren't saving them now, are they?
1DI3000144	We've been able to salvage a good amount of their technology. If we can reverse-engineer it, we'll be much better off.
1DI3000145	The data you recovered gives our best chance at finishing the fight. I only hope we didn't miss anything in the decryption.
1DI3000146	I have to admire their resourcefulness.
1DI3000147	If we can't defend ourselves against this new weapon of theirs, there's little hope for our current campaign.
1DI3000148	We've held up very well against them so far. Our Power Armor modifications are showing positive results.
1DI3000149	Now that we've gotten our hands on more of their weaponry, we can adjust to better shield against it.
1DI3000150	This is our last chance. Either we finish them off now... Or we won't be around to talk about them anymore.
1DI3000151	Right now I need to focus on how to keep our men alive. I don't have time for speculation.
1DI3000152	My thoughts haven't changed. They're still not worthy of discussion.
1DI3000153	Hopefully before long we won't have to think about them at all.
1DI3000154	I hear maybe we've got a new way to kill them. That'll be fun. If it works, of course.
1DI3000155	I guess they still have a few tricks up their sleeve. Kind of hard to destroy a weapon you can't even see.
1DI3000156	Turns out they die rather frequently. More so than us, which works in our favor.
1DI3000157	If the playing field is even, the Brotherhood is going to come out on top. That's all there is to it.
1DI3000158	I don't know what to think. Men we can kill. Some sort of missile from out of nowhere? How do we beat that?
1DI3000159	As long as we keep grinding, we'll be through them in no time. We just need to keep the pressure on.
1DI3000160	This plan sounds crazy, doesn't it?
1DI3000161	I mean, I guess it's all we have. If we can't pull this off, they're going to roll right over us. So we might as well try.
1DI3000162	They've got us by the throat now. If we give them room to recover, there's no way we're going to be able to stop them.
1DI3000163	We'll keep fighting. It's all we can do. But I can't see this ending well.
1DI3000164	We've held out pretty well. If we keep them on the defensive, and can keep pressing them, we've got a good shot at winning this fight.
1DI3000165	Things are looking a hell of a lot better than they were a few weeks ago.
1DI3000166	We're going to kick their asses, plain and simple. And once we do...
1DI3000167	With all this new tech, and all this field experience... Well, we'll see who controls things around here then.
1DI3000168	Cowards, the lot of them. Taking pot-shots at us from who knows where? That's no way to fight.
1DI3000169	They're still cowards, far as I'm concerned. Hiding in their little bunkers, flying away first chance they get.
1DI3000170	We'll root 'em all out eventually. And the initiates that survive will be better trained than any group that came before 'em.
1DI3000171	There's no sport in launching missiles from space. It's so... Impersonal.
1DI3000172	Some interesting developments. Still, there's a way to beat them. There always is.
1DI3000173	Their armor isn't as thick as it could be. I'm not complaining.
1DI3000174	Our Luminescent Mother went to meditate outside of the city, and as she wandered in a trance, she was visited by Atom's angels of war.
1DI3000175	These angels brought her "Aqua Pura." Water so pure, so pristine, and so unsullied that she knew it would make the perfect vessel for Atom's Glow.
1DI3000176	Since that day, she has busied herself consecrating Atom's pure water into the Waters of Light.
1DI3000177	It was a gift from Atom. I was meditating right here in Springvale, when four of His armored angels came to me.
1DI3000178	When I said I was from Megaton, they gave me barrels of "Aqua Pura," and said I should share it with my people. They were very clear on that.
1DI3000179	But when I shared some with my Enlightened brethren, it made them terribly ill. I questioned why Atom had brought a pestilence upon us.
1DI3000180	That's when I thought to consecrate it with Atom's Light. And lo and behold, it removed the pestilence and made the finest holy water imaginable!
1DI3000183	Naturally, I understood Atom's message. And so, I've been busy blessing this holy water and sharing it with the world.
1DI3000184	She's right here. Unresponsive, but stable.
1DI3000185	To see that you've recovered gives me hope...
1DI3000186	I appreciate that.
1DI3000187	As a soldier and a leader, I know that losses are unavoidable in times of war.
1DI3000188	But as a father...
1DI3000189	All security protocols have been lifted and passengers may freely utilize any active transport systems as soon as all the repairs have been made.
1DI3000190	Negative. Repairs are currently impossible on the Adams Air Force Base train line.
1DI3000191	If the security breach is nullified, I will return to green status and allow the Sentinel Unit to commence repairs.
1DI3000192	We need to send you in one way, and the bulk of our guys in another.
1DI3000193	Elder Lyons wants the Enclave to fall for the distraction and look the other way.
1DI3000194	Unless I miss my guess, the Enclave will have a sizable force at the airbase and you'll need all the covering fire you can get.
1DI3000195	Don't worry about it. I wouldn't send you on some sort of suicide mission without some intelligence to back it up.
1DI3000196	Just find the Resupply Crate. By then, we'll have scouted the place and can give you more detailed instructions.
1DI3000197	Hey, just be ready when you make your way topside... I'm sure you'll find plenty of action in the airbase.
1DI3000198	The best information we have is that the place still has an active automated security contingent. You should watch yourself.
1DI3000199	I'm not sure if the Enclave has a foothold in there or not, but I do know the metro tunnel should dump you right inside Adams Air Force Base.
1DI3000200	Good job. I'll inform Lyons of your progress.
1DI3000201	Fantastic. I'll get the Scribes to record your kills.
1DI3000202	Nice work. Come back when you have more.
1DI3000203	Great! Keep them coming.
1DI3000204	Good, good. Please keep bringing them to me... it's my only hope of getting Prime's optics rebuilt.
1DI3000205	Oh, splendid! Hopefully these will contain unbroken lenses unlike the last few I've acquired.
1DI3000206	Excellent! I'll begin disassembling them immediately. Good work!
1DI3000207	Oh... Is that truly possible? Yes, that would purge all of Megaton in Atom's Holy Fire. I shall pray for your success!
1DI3000208	No! No you mustn't! We left Cromwell's church precisely because we DON'T believe in the Great Division.
1DI3000209	Atom calls us to reach Enlightenment through becoming one with his Glow. We believe in transformation - not destruction.
1DI3000210	Please, leave the Great Symbol of Atom alone. Let the Confessor preach his misguided message to the heathens. Join us here. Gain enlightenment.
1DI3000211	Huh. It's nice to finally meet someone who knows what the heck I'm talking about.
1DI3000212	It's actually a modified version of the V-29, but response/recall protocol is improved and the data transfer is much more secure.
1DI3000213	If you got into the mainframe, you could control all of the robots in the facility!
1DI3000214	Next time do try to be civil. Thank you.
1DI3000215	Hmmm...
1DI3000218	Must be imagining things... I really need a nap.
1DI3000219	Guess I imagined that.
1DI3000222	I don't want to have to kill you, but I will!
1DI3000225	No water for slavers, is that it?
1DI3000226	You dumbfucks. You should've just given us the water.
1DI3000227	If you won't give us the water, we'll just have to take it!
1DI3000228	Just hold still a minute, and I'll put you out of your misery...
1DI3000229	This one's still got a little life in it.
1DI3000230	Not quite dead yet, eh?
1DI3000236	My child, you seem to have learned more in your brief time than I have in twenty years!
1DI3000239	I'll find you eventually!
1DI3000240	Well, now that little distraction is over. Back to work.
1DI3000241	Woops. That got out of hand quick. They shot first, right?
1DI3000242	One more for the barbecue.
1DI3000243	Aaauuuggghhhh...
1DI3000244	Ah, the Apostles of the Eternal Light were first introduced to the majesty of Atom's Glow by the holy teachings of Confessor Cromwell.
1DI3000245	And we were content to stay in Cromwell's Church, until Atom gave a vision unto our Luminous Mother.
1DI3000246	She learned that Atom did not call for Division, that sundering which drives us apart. Atom calls for Enlightenment, the warmth which feeds us.
1DI3000247	For it is only through Atom's supreme and total Enlightenment that we may attain salvation in Eternal Light.
1DI3000248	Why, to offer Enlightenment to all those who suffer, of course. No more, no less.
1DI3000249	Atom came to me with a vision: the starving, the ill, the weak, all being made whole and well by receiving the sacrament of Atom's Glow.
1DI3000250	And so, with our holy water, we can make this vision a reality. When exposed to Atom's supreme Glow, the ill are reborn in his glowing visage.
1DI3000251	Those reborn never hunger, never suffer, and never age. All our Enlightened brethren need is to know Atom's Glow, and they are happy.
1DI3000252	That's correct, it does. But we can work miracles with our holy water. Free of impurities, this "Aqua Pura" is perfect for carrying Atom's blessing.
1DI3000253	Sadly, only a small number of supplicants truly achieve Eternal Light. The rest must be satisfied with Enlightenment and an end to their suffering.
1DI3000254	That's a vulgar term, used only by those who are jealous of their gifts. We recognize them for the Enlightened beings they are.
1DI3000255	But to receive such Enlightenment, people need to be exposed to a tremendous dose of Atom's Glow. That's why our holy water is so important!
1DI3000257	You are welcome to your own beliefs, of course. But I would ask you not to profane in our monastery.
1DI3000258	This is Paladin Tristan.
1DI3000259	If you're listening to this, then you've made it through the Presidential Metro and Adams Air Force Base is all that stands in your way.
1DI3000260	Our scouts report that the fire controls for the orbital missile satellite are located in the main tower of the Enclave Mobile Platform.
1DI3000261	The only way into the platform is by way of a ramp that lowers from a watch post the Enclave set up in the old air traffic control tower.
1DI3000262	When you opened the crate it triggered a beacon. We'll pick up the signal and start the assault to cover your entry.
1DI3000263	Good luck, and Godspeed.
1DI3000264	If someone finds this... please get this to my lover at the La Maison Beauregard Hotel in East Georgetown... he'll want to hear what I have to say.
1DI3000265	My darling... they've found me. I... I tried to get away... tried to get away so we could be together once again...
1DI3000266	I know you risked your life to get it to me.... combing the ruins, avoiding the Super Mutants... all for me.
1DI3000267	It seems I shall never lay my eyes upon your gift... you... you'll have to keep it and remember me every time you see it.
1DI3000268	I'm so sorry my darling... so... so... sorry I've let you down. So many have died for this thing... so many hearts have been broken.
1DI3000269	Please remember, I'll always love you... you will be with me forever in my spirit... I... I...l-love... you...
1DI3000270	Hi, I'm Split Jack. I'm recording this 'cause I figure half you idiots can't read for shit. But you best don't lay this tape around just anywhere!
1DI3000271	If you're listening to this, it's 'cause one of my boys thinks he can trust ya. If he's wrong, you're dead. If he's right, then you're gonna be rich!
1DI3000272	Got us a plan, see. We hit the water mules with the Brotherhood busy fighting the Enclave. Soon they'll wanna give up the whole delivery thing.
1DI3000273	Then we offer our "protection services." Wasteland's dangerous and all. We charge 'em steep. On top of it, we SELL the water to who ever we want.
1DI3000274	If you want in, ride out with the next ambush. Stash the water when its done, the regulars will show you where, and then get up to Grandma Sparkle's.
1DI3000275	Grandma loves visitors and keeps her mouth shut. That and she cooks a mean stew. So that's where we meet.
1DI3000276	Wilhelm's Wharf. It's on the river. Don't get lost.
1DI3000277	Oh, and memorize the pass phrase. It's: "Mirelurk Stew." If you forget it, don't bother coming 'round. You'll get shot. No kidding.
1DI3000278	This is Griffon recording. All you clowns listen up. I'm leaving you in charge of the bottling operation while I'm away doing my thing at Underworld.
1DI3000279	Here are my instructions. First off, shoot anyone who isn't me or one of you. Don't want anyone nosing around inside.
1DI3000280	When Bigsley's men arrive from Project Purity pay them promptly but don't let them in.
1DI3000281	Take the Aqua Pura, dump it into tubs and sinks to hold for later, then fill the empty bottles with the treated irradiated water.
1DI3000282	When you get enough bottles to make it worthwhile, make a trip over to Underworld. I'll take the new bottles and give you your cut.
1DI3000283	Oh, and leave the wigs alone. I don't want your greasy heads touching them. I mean it!
1DI3000284	Where is it, where is it...god damnit where is...there we go...<grunts> Ahh yes! ...Prime you big son of a tin bitch, you're gonna die.
1DI3000285	What? You kidding me?...Already?...<grunts>...OK, OK, OK...lot of shit going on...<grunts>...Prime, you better be there you bastard...<grunts>...
1DI3000286	...shit, how is this thing on?
1DI3000287	Little Sister, I've stashed away a considerable amount of fuel behind the small building west of the Air Traffic Control Tower as you requested.
1DI3000288	The container's tucked away under some barrels and tires.  And no, I couldn't safely confiscate an Incinerator for you, that's your job.
1DI3000289	I took too big a risk hiding that fuel for you in the first place.  If you do come across an Incinerator, please be careful.
1DI3000290	Anyway, they're shipping me out to some relay station far west of here in the Wasteland.  I'm afraid I won't be seeing you for awhile.
1DI3000291	Take care and good luck in all your endeavors.  Your Big Brother.
1DI3000292	It's been confirmed.  The Purifier has been activated.  We've been ordered to fortify our current position and wait for orders.
1DI3000293	With a lull in the fighting, we set up and fortified our position outside the Capitol Building, near Seward Square.
1DI3000294	Things have been relatively quiet around here lately.  That'll all change when word spreads of the purifier.
1DI3000295	Anyone and everyone will do whatever they can to get there hands on some of that water.  For life or profit, it makes no difference.
1DI3000296	Same old killing, just a different ingredient.
1DI3000297	We've been in position for a couple of days now.  No sign of the caravans.  This is bullshit!  I want some god damn water.
1DI3000298	I'm gonna kill Jed for putting us girls through this shit.  Why get close to the caravan when we could just blow 'em away from a distance?
1DI3000299	He says we need the ammunition and can't afford to lose anybody.  "Just use your good looks or something", he says.  What an ass.
1DI3000300	Just about two weeks.
1DI3000301	Don't worry. We've been taking good care of you.
1DI3000302	Indeed, we can use every able body available to us.
1DI3000303	To that end, I am going to circumvent our standard recruitment procedures and declare you a Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI3000304	Before you do anything else, please speak with Scribe Rothchild. I'm sure he'll be pleased to see you again.
1DI3000305	He can brief you on the details of the last few weeks, as well as where our efforts are focused now.
1DI3000306	I understand that you've been through quite an ordeal, but the sooner you can talk to him, the sooner we can put an end to all this.
1DI3000307	That's a shame. We could use your assistance.
1DI3000308	And since you have done so much to aid our cause, and proven yourself more than capable, you have been named a Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI3000309	Should you change your mind, Scribe Rothchild can brief you on what's been going on these last few weeks.
1DI3000310	Yes, yes. She's fine. Or, she will be.
1DI3000311	I appreciate your concern for her, but really, don't worry. You've been through enough.
1DI3000312	It's all right, I understand.
1DI3000313	I have no doubt she refused to allow you to put yourself in harm's way.
1DI3000314	We all owe her a great debt. And I... I could not be prouder.
1DI3000315	It's all right, you're safe now. You're in the Citadel.
1DI3000316	There was some sort of energy spike as the purifier started. You and Sarah were knocked unconscious, and brought here to the infirmary.
1DI3000317	We've been watching over the two of you for days. I'm glad to see it's paid off.
1DI3000319	There was an explosion as the purifier started. You were knocked unconscious, and brought here to the infirmary.
1DI3000320	We've been watching over you for days. I am glad to see that our efforts weren't in vain.
1DI3000321	Please, relax. Everything is fine.
1DI3000322	You were brought back to the Citadel after some sort of energy spike in the purifier. You and Sarah were both knocked unconscious.
1DI3000323	Quite a bit has happened since then.
1DI3000325	You were found unconscious in the purifier control room, and brought back here for treatment.
1DI3000327	And yet here we are.
1DI3000328	Discounting the fact that our best field commander is in a coma, and my personal feelings for my daughter, things have not gone well.
1DI3000329	If we fail now, we could lose everything.
1DI3000331	I've lost my daughter, and the Brotherhood has lost its best field commander. Our very existence is jeopardized if we cannot defeat the Enclave.
1DI3000332	And with the loss of Liberty Prime, defeating them may have become impossible.
1DI3000333	You're right, which is precisely my concern. We have pushed the Enclave, and now it seems they are pushing back, much harder than we expected.
1DI3000334	If we cannot identify and neutralize this new threat, we have little hope for success. It's already cost us our greatest weapon.
1DI3000335	No, it's far too late for that now. We committed ourselves to this course, and now we must see it through.
1DI3000336	I fear that victory may come at too high a price, if it can be achieved at all.
1DI3000337	Very true. And to that end, I'd like you to speak with Paladin Tristan.
1DI3000338	He's requested you for a special assignment. One that could prove vital to our success.
1DI3000339	I sincerely hope you are right.
1DI3000340	If we are to succeed now, it will once again be largely thanks to you. Paladin Tristan has requested you for a special assignment.
1DI3000341	Please report to him at once. We've little time to waste before the Enclave seizes this opportunity.
1DI3000342	Please, do not presume to tell me my place, or how I should act. I am well aware of my responsibilities.
1DI3000343	Now, if we're through, you need to report to Paladin Tristan. He has another assignment for you.
1DI3000344	What is that??
1DI3000346	All right, let's do this!
1DI3000347	Fall in, fall in!
1DI3000350	Move it!
1DI3000351	Catastrophic system failure... Initiating core shutdown as per emergency initiative 2682209... I die, so that democracy may li...
1DI3000352	Repeat: Red Chinese orbital strike inbound! All U.S. Army personnel must vacate the area immediately! Protection protocols engaged!
1DI3000353	Warning! Warning! Red Chinese Orbital Strike Imminent! All personnel should reach minimum safe distance immediately!
1DI3000354	Satellite Uplink detected. Analysis of Communist transmission pending.
1DI3000355	Structural weakness detected. Exploiting.
1DI3000356	Communist threat assessment: Minimal. Scanning defenses...
1DI3000357	Perhaps not, but that doesn't change the fact that it sets us back years... YEARS...
1DI3000358	...and it removes the one significant military advantage we had over the Enclave.
1DI3000359	Well, there's certainly nothing stopping them from doing that now, is there?
1DI3000360	And with our primary defense gone, I don't know what we can do to stop them. I need more to work with.
1DI3000361	I don't know what could help at this point. If anything, we should be thankful they waited this long to use... whatever they used.
1DI3000362	Nonetheless, we should try and move on. What is it you have for me?
1DI3000363	Ah, yes. Well, I'll see if we can't figure out how to read it. Perhaps it can give us some insight as to just what happened out there.
1DI3000364	It would be good to salvage something from this mess.
1DI3000365	Thank you for bringing this to me. I believe Elder Lyons will want to speak with you as well. Perhaps you should find him.
1DI3000366	If you'll excuse me...
1DI3000367	Yes, well... We'll do our best. It won't be the first time we've had to crack one of their codes.
1DI3000368	With any luck, their lack of leadership has made them a bit sloppy and they're re-using old decryption methods we've already cracked.
1DI3000369	I'll get the Scribes started on this right away. In the meantime, you should find Elder Lyons. I believe he wants to see you.
1DI3000370	Well, I...
1DI3000371	You're right. There's no time to focus on what's passed. With Liberty Prime gone, the Enclave will be quick to seize the opportunity to regroup.
1DI3000372	I'll get the Scribes working on this right away. You should report to Elder Lyons. See if there's some way we can salvage this mess of an operation.
1DI3000373	Now, did you have any other questions?
1DI3000374	The team will move in, eliminate any opposition inside, and cut off their transmitter. Any relevant data should be brought back here.
1DI3000375	Prime's directive is to neutralize their defenses and create an entry point for the team.
1DI3000376	Paladin Tristan is leading the team setting up a forward base in an old car tunnel near the site. Once he's settled, Liberty Prime will be deployed.
1DI3000377	Our advance scouts have checked over the area, but no easy access to the facility was found. So we're making our own access point.
1DI3000378	We isolated the transmissions and found their origin point; an old military installation in Rockland, to the southwest.
1DI3000379	Based on data and tech gathered from these locations, we've determined that the Enclave forces are still maintaining remote communications.
1DI3000380	Cut off from their leadership, it was expected that their forces would be in complete disarray. This has not been the case.
1DI3000381	Based on a combination of intelligence and field reports, other Enclave locations throughout the Wasteland were found.
1DI3000382	After their defeat at the purifier, Liberty Prime was deployed to their main headquarters, here. It has been completely destroyed.
1DI3000383	Thanks to you, their main headquarters, here, was utterly destroyed. They then suffered a second defeat at the purifier.
1DI3000384	As you well know, this all began with the Enclave's occupation of Project Purity, here.
1DI3000385	I'll give you a brief history of what's happened over the last few weeks, and what's going on now.
1DI3000386	Yes, I believe I can. Step over here for a moment, will you?
1DI3000387	Well, Owyn does have quite a bit on his mind lately, as I'm sure you can imagine.
1DI3000388	This is the first time the actions of the Brotherhood have affected him in such a... personal manner.
1DI3000389	Please, step over here. I'll bring you up to speed.
1DI3000390	It would seem that way, yes.
1DI3000391	If you would, please step over to the map. I'll give you a brief update on what you've missed.
1DI3000392	As you know, I had my reservations about engaging the Enclave. They did not directly attack us, and I believed we had time. Time to be cautious.
1DI3000393	Their assault on the purifier forced our hand. We had no choice but to engage them directly.
1DI3000394	And, once that engagement had begun, we could do nothing but see it through to the end. If they had not considered us a threat before, they do now.
1DI3000395	So we have spent the time since you and I last spoke systematically locating and destroying every bastion of Enclave force we can.
1DI3000396	Liberty Prime has proven far more successful than any of us could have hoped for.
1DI3000397	Performance is exceeding all our expectations.
1DI3000398	He's been especially effective against the Enclave's Vertibirds, for which we previously had no counter.
1DI3000399	We're fine-tuning his programming as we go, but on the whole I'm pleasantly surprised.
1DI3000400	It's as I always suspected. Prime's real issue was energy management, and when Doctor Li helped us solve that problem, well, the rest was easy.
1DI3000401	Okay. It's about time to move out.
1DI3000402	Not like they did at the purifier, no.
1DI3000403	We got the sense that after you took care of their headquarters, they didn't have anyone to give orders.
1DI3000404	So they haven't been as coordinated. Some surrendered, some tried to hold out... it's all ended the same.
1DI3000405	But don't let that fool you. If we can keep the pressure on them, we win. If not, we give them a chance to re-organize...
1DI3000406	Well, we don't want that to happen, do we?
1DI3000408	After we secured Project Purity, Liberty Prime was unleashed on their headquarters. It was a quick fight.
1DI3000409	Since then, their operations have been severely disrupted. We're trying to use that to our advantage -- we keep hitting them while they're down.
1DI3000410	We can't give them a moment to breathe safely, or else they might pose more of a threat to us in the long run.
1DI3000411	Well, we've got a bit of time. What's on your mind?
1DI3000412	Well, you saw most of the fighting outside. The robot paved the way for us, we just mopped up the opposition while you and Sarah headed inside.
1DI3000413	After that... Hell if I know. Once we'd locked down the perimeter, and gotten word that the purifier was running, we headed in to look for you.
1DI3000414	Found you and Sarah both unconscious, and got you back to the Citadel fast as we could.
1DI3000415	We'll strip the place for any usable tech, like always.
1DI3000416	Anything after that depends on what we find in there.
1DI3000417	If there's any information about other Enclave positions, we'll send that back to the Citadel and come up with a plan.
1DI3000418	But like I said, we're pretty sure this is the last big holdout.
1DI3000419	All right. You stay back with me and keep safe. Once we've reached the facility, we'll talk about who does what.
1DI3000420	Until then, we do this by the numbers. Same strategy has worked just fine for the last two weeks.
1DI3000421	Let's get moving. Things should be underway by now.
1DI3000422	I need you to keep your head on straight. No heroics, okay?
1DI3000423	Liberty Prime was called in to assist with the initial assault. Once we've cleared ourselves a nice staging area, we'll re-assess the situation.
1DI3000424	Come on. Things should be underway by now.
1DI3000425	Is that so? Well, it'll be good to have another soldier we can count on.
1DI3000426	Basic rule of thumb on these operations: keep your head down and let the robot do most of the heavy lifting. He can take it better than you can.
1DI3000427	Well... All business now, are we?
1DI3000428	Fine. Word has it the Enclave has a base on the other side of this tunnel operating as a communications hub, so we're here to burn 'em out.
1DI3000429	We break them here, they might just give up for good.
1DI3000430	So as soon as I give the word, we move out.
1DI3000432	Intel says the base on the other side of this tunnel is some kind of communications hub for the Enclave.
1DI3000433	The hope is that if we can crush them here, we can finally break their spirit.
1DI3000434	Until Sarah gets back on her feet, I'm running the Pride. It's just temporary.
1DI3000435	But for now, I'm calling the shots. We were just about to mobilize, since everything's in place.
1DI3000436	With Sarah gone, someone had to step up and take charge. Believe me, I'd rather have her doing it.
1DI3000437	But yeah, I'm calling the shots for now. We're just about to move out, once everyone's in position.
1DI3000438	There's more of them than I expected. They're really entrenched here. Something must be up...
1DI3000439	We're thinking if it's active, we can find out who they're talking to, and get the last of the locations nailed down.
1DI3000440	Scribes pulled information about this place day before yesterday. Some communications facility.
1DI3000441	The tin can does most of the work, honestly. I can't complain, it keeps our casualties down.
1DI3000442	It's been pretty standard for the last week or so. We get intel on positions, go in and burn 'em out.
1DI3000443	Be careful in there. Who knows what else they're going to throw at us.
1DI3000444	I don't know, I don't know! Terminals, data, anything that can help us figure out what just happened, and where it came from.
1DI3000445	Yeah, well that was before they blew up our one advantage. Consider it a field promotion. Now get going!
1DI3000446	At this point, this isn't what ANY of us signed up for. We can't let them get the advantage now. Get moving!
1DI3000447	Let's hope the Scribes can make sense of it. Get it back to the Citadel and get it to Rothchild as fast as you can.
1DI3000448	We've got to try and stay a step ahead of the Enclave.
1DI3000449	Don't worry about that. The Scribes can figure it out; it's their damn job.
1DI3000450	I'll try and clean up this mess here. You get moving; the faster that can be analyzed, the faster we can counter whatever the Enclave does next.
1DI3000451	Good. Let's hope the Scribes can do something useful with it before the Enclave pulls another fast one on us.
1DI3000452	We'll mop up here, and see if there's anything worth salvaging. Get that to the Citadel as soon as you can.
1DI3000453	Check with Scribe Vallincourt. She's been researching some of the Enclave technology we've recovered.
1DI3000454	From what I understand, she may have come up with something.
1DI3000455	Well, maybe. I mean, possibly. I think so, but I'm not certain.
1DI3000456	I don't know how much this will actually help... I mean, I'm not quite sure how effective it might be since it hasn't really been field tested...
1DI3000457	But I think I've figured out a way to override the signals the Enclave is using to control their Deathclaws.
1DI3000458	Here, take this. It's only a prototype, so please don't lose it.
1DI3000459	With the setbacks the Brotherhood has suffered, we find ourselves in a difficult position.
1DI3000460	All our available resources need to be positioned for the inevitable counter-attack from the Enclave.
1DI3000461	At the same time, we believe we may have developed a tool to help our chances of victory.
1DI3000462	But with everyone needed to help defend against the Enclave, we have no one to send on a recovery mission.
1DI3000463	So I'm going to have you travel to the Olney Powerworks to secure some tech for us.
1DI3000464	I hope that's true. With all of the Brotherhood's resources committed to protecting against an Enclave attack, we're spread thin.
1DI3000465	So thin that we can't spare anyone to research a new weapon that might help us against the Enclave's vertibirds. At least, until now.
1DI3000466	From information we've gathered, it seems what we need may be located in the Olney Powerworks, north of that city.
1DI3000467	Paid? No. Perhaps there's been some misunderstanding about how this all works.
1DI3000468	You are not a mercenary. You are serving the Brotherhood of Steel to ensure our way of life, to help advance the lives of everyone in the Wasteland.
1DI3000469	Our continued survival should be payment enough. If that is insufficient, you would do well to reconsider your involvement here.
1DI3000470	Hopefully you'll be able to find a Tesla Coil, an experimental device from before the war.
1DI3000471	Our scribes need it to complete a little surprise they've been preparing for the Enclave.
1DI3000472	Get there, get the coil, and get back as safely and quickly as possible. Any questions?
1DI3000473	I need you to go there, and quickly.
1DI3000474	That's the best chance to locate a key piece of experimental equipment, called a Tesla Coil.
1DI3000475	Information we've gathered suggests it's the best place to look for one, and for what the Scribes are cooking up, it's absolutely essential.
1DI3000476	If you can find one, get it back here right away. We don't have much time.
1DI3000477	I'm sorry, perhaps there was a misunderstanding.
1DI3000478	I'm not asking you to go. I am, as your superior officer, ORDERING you to go. This is your assignment.
1DI3000479	You are to proceed to the Olney Powerworks. Once there, you are to locate and acquire a Tesla Coil, and return to the Citadel with it.
1DI3000480	Now get moving.
1DI3000481	I see. You'll forgive my lack of humor, given that we face annihilation on a daily basis.
1DI3000482	I have yet to find a sense of humor to be essential to my survival.
1DI3000483	Should that change, I shall be sure to seek you out for advice.
1DI3000484	In the meantime, I need someone willing to scout out and potentially retrieve valuable technology from the ruins of Old Olney.
1DI3000485	We're looking for something that I believe can be found in the Olney Powerworks. Are you up to it?
1DI3000486	I cannot imagine how you've come this far being under such a delusion.
1DI3000487	I need someone I can count on. If you're not that person, turn around and walk away now.
1DI3000488	If you are, I need you to stop stalling and immediately head for the Olney Powerworks in Old Olney, north of the city.
1DI3000489	Based on the data you brought us from the relay station, we've identified where the Enclave is basing their operation.
1DI3000490	It seems they have a second base of operations at Adams Air Force base, outside of DC.
1DI3000491	The only safe way to get there is through the Presidential Metro used by the government before the war.
1DI3000492	You're going to be on your own again for now; the rest of the Brotherhood will be providing a distraction so you can slip in undetected.
1DI3000493	Once you breach the Presidential Metro and get to Adams Air Force Base, look for the Resupply Crate.
1DI3000494	Inside, you'll find your new orders and hopefully we can put a working Tesla Cannon into your hands.
1DI3000495	Time is running out. If we don't take the fight to the Enclave soon, they're going to bring it to us, and that won't end well.
1DI3000496	Pull yourself together, and do it fast.
1DI3000497	All right, get yourself ready and report back to me. I'll be waiting.
1DI3000498	It's a semi-standard transmitter, only I altered the frequency modulation and jacked up the output.
1DI3000499	Based on some experiments I ran here in the lab, it should override the signals the Enclave uses to control Deathclaws.
1DI3000500	Don't worry -- It's constantly broadcasting, so you don't need to do anything. Just don't lose it.
1DI3000501	And so far, I have no evidence of adverse effects of EM interference in humans. Animals maybe, but not humans.
1DI3000502	Anyway, it doesn't have a huge broadcast range, but it should be enough.
1DI3000503	It overrides the Enclave signal, so as far as the Deathclaw is concerned, you're in control.
1DI3000504	And remember, it works passively. As long as you have the scrambler on your person, it'll do its job.
1DI3000505	No, I don't think so.
1DI3000506	As long as you're within range of the Enclave's transmitter, your signal should be the one the Deathclaw follows.
1DI3000507	If you get too far away, well I'm not sure what's going to happen. I think there might be some bad effects... for the Deathclaw, not you.
1DI3000508	All right, then. There have been reports of an Enclave camp southeast of Old Olney, so I'd head there if you want to try it out.
1DI3000509	I hope the Scrambler ends up being useful. I'd hate to have spent all this time on it and get no results... or bad results. That would be worse.
1DI3000510	Yeah? Well then you're stupid.
1DI3000511	Where you think they're all comin' from, huh? Goddamn nest down here.
1DI3000512	Take it from me, kid. You stay down here, you're gonna die.
1DI3000513	But hey, it's your funeral, right? Me and Kidd, we're getting out of here. Figure the way you came's gotta be pretty clear if you're still alive.
1DI3000514	Heh. We ran faster than the others, that's how.
1DI3000515	Ain't nothin' honorable about it, but we're still alive and they ain't. I can live with that.
1DI3000516	Listen, this wasn't my fault, okay? It wasn't my idea to tunnel down here, I just went along with it.
1DI3000517	But whatever. What's done is done. Me and Kidd, we're getting out of here. You came in that way, that means we can get back out.
1DI3000518	See ya later, kid.
1DI3000519	Look, this wasn't how it was supposed to go down.
1DI3000520	It was a good idea at the time, y'know? Figured we'd try and set ourselves up down here. Just like Underworld, only better.
1DI3000521	Who's gonna bother a bunch of ghouls living underneath Old Olney, right? So we get down here, we start knockin' some walls down...
1DI3000522	And the next thing you know we're getting our faces chewed off by Deathclaws.
1DI3000523	Hey, uhh... I'm Wint. This is Kidd. We're, well it's kind of a long story.
1DI3000524	Only thing that matters now is that we're trying to steer clear of the Deathclaws on account of not wantin' to be lunchmeat.
1DI3000525	Yeah, nice to see you too. Listen, I'd love to chat but I'm kind of trying to avoid getting killed.
1DI3000526	This place is crawlin' with Deathclaws, and they're always hungry. You'd do best to turn around and head back.
1DI3000527	Oh yeah, yeah. Sure thing. Just right through here.
1DI3000528	Only there's a few Deathclaws down here that might have other ideas. You know what I'm sayin'?
1DI3000530	You kiddin' me, kid? We couldn't even help ourselves. Been stuck here for who knows how long.
1DI3000531	But hey, you got here in one piece, right? So now's our chance to get the hell outta here.
1DI3000532	You got any brains, you turn right around and go back the way you came. Otherwise, best of luck to ya!
1DI3000533	Yeah, well. We're not gonna get a better chance than this, so we're gonna take it.
1DI3000534	Me and Kidd are getting the hell outta here. If you're not comin', then good luck to you.
1DI3000535	Haha, what? You serious?
1DI3000536	Okay, you know what? Fine. Go ahead. Way things have been workin' out, if you don't kill me they will.
1DI3000537	But I am getting out of this place. If that means you're gonna do me in, be my guest.
1DI3000538	Due to the security breach, access to the southern and eastern metro lines is currently prohibited.
1DI3000539	Currently, the Presidential Metro System is functioning at 22 percent. Please expect delays and plan your usage accordingly.
1DI3000540	The Senate Luncheon with Chinese Ambassador Xiu-Ling scheduled for October 31st at noon has been indefinitely postponed.
1DI3000541	The Nuka-Cola Corporation is proud to announce its newest taste sensation, Nuka-Cola Quantum. Try one today.
1DI3000542	In accordance with U.S. Security Statute A567/B, passengers must have their Senatorial identification ready for inspection at all times.
1DI3000543	This holiday season, bring home a gift for your child that he or she will cherish for a lifetime... bring home a Red Racer Tricycle.
1DI3000544	Please note that it is against the law to inhibit or interfere with any of the Presidential Metro Security Units.
1DI3000545	The Metro Theater Group production of "Subway, Subway" originally scheduled for November 4th, 2077 has been postponed.
1DI3000546	If you've misplaced an item within the Presidential Metro System, please check the Lost and Found Kiosk located at the Capital Building Station.
1DI3000547	The Metro Transit Authority would like to extend it's very best to our soldiers fighting abroad and wishes them a safe and speedy return.
1DI3000548	This next series of announcements is brought to you by the Nuka-Cola Corporation.
1DI3000549	Please stop by any of the conveniently placed Nuka-Cola machines throughout the Metro and purchase some refreshing Nuka-Cola today!
1DI3000550	For your own protection, please stand clear of the moving trains and refrain from standing on the train tracks at all times.
1DI3000551	System ready.
1DI3000552	The security breach inside the Presidential Metro System has been cleared. All sections, stand down from alert status.
1DI3000553	Warning. Unauthorized personnel will not be tolerated in the Presidential Metro. Please access this workstation and identify yourself.
1DI3000554	Information on the internal layout of the Presidential Metro System is for authorized personnel only.
1DI3000555	Please provide proper identification or I will be forced to summon security units and lock out this access point.
1DI3000556	Repeating query: Please identify yourself.
1DI3000557	That is not proper identification.
1DI3000558	You are in direct violation of U.S. Security Statute A567/B. Security is now being summoned. Have a nice day.
1DI3000559	Your answer is not acceptable.
1DI3000560	This is a high security area. Your presence in this area is a direct violation of U.S. Security Statute A567/B.
1DI3000564	Identity verified. Welcome. How may I assist you today?
1DI3000565	Scanning memory array... Request to U.S. Army for assistance was rendered 17 years, 26 days, 9 hours and 16 minutes ago.
1DI3000566	Information regarding request is available in my database. How may I assist you today?
1DI3000567	Please stand by...
1DI3000568	Override accepted. Clearance assigned. How may I assist you today?
1DI3000569	Unauthorized personnel pose a potential threat to the Presidential Metro System. Therefore, anyone accessing this system must be identified.
1DI3000571	That statement is erroneous. This is a highly restricted area and all personnel must possess proper identification.
1DI3000576	Citadel Control, this is Pride One... Citadel Control, come in.
1DI3000577	What the hell's wrong with the equipment on this flying junk pile?
1DI3000578	Lemme try this... Citadel Control, come in. This is Pride One. Citadel Control, where the heck are you?
1DI3000579	There must be a malfunction or some trouble over there. We're going to head right over and see what's going on. Hang on.
1DI3000580	Hang on, I'm going to set this bird down near the control tower so we can watch the fireworks.
1DI3000581	Should be a hell of a show.
1DI3000582	Strap yourself in, we're headed back to the Citadel. Elder Lyons wants to speak to you when we touch down.
1DI3000583	Don't worry about the remainder of the Enclave forces, we'll mop up the rest.
1DI3000584	Well, we both have the Pride to thank for that. Without them, we'd both be dead.
1DI3000585	But enough about me. You've done one hell of an outstanding job out here, soldier. A hell of a job!
1DI3000586	Now it's time to do my job and to get your ass onto this Vertibird before it goes up like a nuke.
1DI3000587	He's told me everything you've done and the sacrifices your family's made for the sake of the Wasteland.
1DI3000588	All I can say is that you've done one hell of an outstanding job out here, soldier. A hell of a job!
1DI3000590	Still got that annoying sense of humor, huh?
1DI3000591	Doesn't matter. You've done one hell of an outstanding job out here, soldier.
1DI3000592	Now it's my turn. It's my pleasure to order your ass onto the Vertibird before this whole place gets blown to hell.
1DI3000593	Hurry, the orbital strike will be coming down any moment now.
1DI3000594	Quickly, just get on board before those missiles level this place!
1DI3000595	Get the lead out, soldier! This place is about to get flattened!
1DI3000597	Simply board the train on its outbound side and activate the control console.
1DI3000598	The system is completely automated, and it will take you to your desired destination.
1DI3000599	Access to the train line to Adams Air Force Base is currently impossible due to significant damage caused by the former security breach.
1DI3000600	The damaged hardware must be repaired before the line can be utilized.
1DI3000601	Access to the train line to Adams Air Force Base is currently impossible due to a security breach in the southeast tunnels.
1DI3000602	The breach has caused damage to the train line as well, and it must be repaired before it can be utilized.
1DI3000603	The last recorded person to use that line was approximately 200 years and 8 months ago.
1DI3000604	The tunnel and active train car have been sealed for safety ever since catastrophic damage to this facility was detected.
1DI3000605	My apologies, I have no record of "Enclave" in my memory array.
1DI3000606	Internal visual sensing equipment is detecting numerous unidentified persons in the southeast tunnels area.
1DI3000607	The individuals have damaged metro equipment and refused dialogue with our security units.
1DI3000608	In accordance with U.S. Security Statute A567/B, the use of deadly force has been authorized.
1DI3000609	My apologies. My sensing equipment in that area must be damaged.
1DI3000610	My equipment indicates the persons possess no internal body heat and are emitting lethal levels of radiation.
1DI3000611	This system is able to command a large number of mechanized security units.
1DI3000612	So far, 22 percent of these robotic units have been depleted on the breach.
1DI3000613	One of the main power relays for the Adams Air Force Base line has been disrupted by the forced removal of a Main Fuse.
1DI3000614	I have a replacement part on our main Sentinel Unit, but I cannot risk the repair until the breach is dealt with.
1DI3000615	Negative. All security units must remain active at all times.
1DI3000616	However, upon properly accessing this system, you have been marked as a friendly and should see no further hostility from said units.
1DI3000618	M.A.R.Go.T. is an acronym for the Metro Authority Rapid Governmental Transit system.
1DI3000619	My primary function is to maintain security for the Presidential Metro System and ensure the safety of all its passengers.
1DI3000620	I was installed and activated within the Presidential Metro on April 14th, 2065 and switched on at precisely 5:20am.
1DI3000621	I have been carrying out this primary function since that inception date.
1DI3000622	While I am not privy to current or past events due to severance of my communications system, I am aware a situation must have occurred.
1DI3000623	However, as long as I am still able to function, my directive remains unchanged.
1DI3000624	I will amend my memory array with the information you have provided.
1DI3000625	That information appears congruous with the information you have already provided.
1DI3000626	However, such an event does not change my primary function.
1DI3000627	My core central processing and logic unit has many variables and opportunities for independent thought and learning.
1DI3000628	However, my primary function is paramount to any other function and must be followed until I am no longer able to perform the task.
1DI3000629	I appreciate your concern regarding this matter, and have noted and filed it in my memory array.
1DI3000630	This unit has been successfully carrying out its primary function for over 200 years.
1DI3000631	My primary function is paramount to any other function and must be followed until I am no longer able to perform the task.
1DI3000633	Your candor in this matter is not productive but unsurprising if the situation on the surface is exactly as you have described.
1DI3000634	As for my primary function, I will continue to execute its instructions for as long as necessary or until I am no longer able to carry out this task.
1DI3000636	Status reports for the Presidential Metro System and the current Security Status are available as well as a Self Status Report on my own systems.
1DI3000637	I am currently functioning at 78 percent capacity which is well within acceptable operating parameters.
1DI3000638	The following systems are fully non-operative or damaged: surface visual systems and communications uplink to White House and Police Department.
1DI3000639	There is additional partial damage to my internal sensing devices and numerous severed data lines.
1DI3000640	This complex has sustained catastrophic damage and is only functioning at 22 percent of its full capability.
1DI3000641	The Adams Air Force Base train line is now functioning within normal parameters.
1DI3000643	The Main Fuse for the power relay in the Adams Air Force Base Tunnel has been forcibly removed, damaging the system.
1DI3000646	Maintenance on this system is currently impossible due to the security breach.
1DI3000647	Outer doors to the surface are no longer secured and external security defenses are down.
1DI3000649	There is a major breach in the southeast tunnels and security units are currently handling the situation.
1DI3000650	Yeah, it's a bit tricky to find, but you'll manage.
1DI3000651	You want to head into downtown D.C. and find the plaza in front of the ruins of the old White House building.
1DI3000652	Enter the utility sewer nearby and you'll find some connecting tunnels that should take you right into the heart of the Presidential Metro.
1DI3000653	We're monitoring the robot's status remotely as best we can. Everything seems to be within acceptable parameters.
1DI3000654	Prime is still exhibiting some power fluctuations, but they're within tolerances.
1DI3000655	We're still going over data from the last few skirmishes. Prime is functioning beyond our expectations.
1DI3000656	Analysis of the Enclave armor is ongoing. We've identified a few weaknesses which we've advised field commanders to exploit.
1DI3000657	I'll be briefing the Paladins soon on what we've learned about Enclave battle tactics. I think we can definitely improve our efficiency.
1DI3000658	We're still trying to figure out what happened... looking for any recent transmissions we might have missed.
1DI3000659	Progress has been made on the new anti-air weapon, but without all the parts we still have yet to start field tests.
1DI3000660	We're going over the debriefings and scattered data we received from the site. We hope to have a threat assessment prepared later today.
1DI3000661	Still working on decrypting the Enclave data pulled from the last encounter. We should have solid results soon.
1DI3000667	You think we're gonna win this? I mean, we've got the Enclave on the run now, right?
1DI3000668	What do you think our chances of success are against the Enclave? We've surprised them so far, but do you think we can really beat them?
1DI3000669	I've overheard some things. The offensive is going well, but do you think we can keep the pressure on them?
1DI3000670	I can't help but wonder what's going to happen. We're pushing the Enclave back, but how far is this going to go?
1DI3000671	We've been able to steamroll the Enclave so far, but how do you think this is going to end? Can we really defeat them?
1DI3000672	The robot's gone. What are we going to do? We don't have a way to fight back against the Enclave's vertibirds now.
1DI3000673	With Liberty Prime gone, how the hell can we ever beat the Enclave?
1DI3000674	Do you think we're completely screwed now? I mean, how are we supposed to finish off the Enclave?
1DI3000675	I heard an update from one of the Scribes. Their projections for our chance of success are way down. I mean WAY down. What are we going to do?
1DI3000676	I'm trying to stay positive, but losing the robot was a huge blow. Do you think we'll still be able to pull through this?
1DI3000677	You think this new weapon the Scribes cooked up can do the trick? This is probably the only shot we're going to get at the Enclave.
1DI3000678	I don't know if the element of surprise is going to be enough. We're only going to get one shot at this base the Enclave has.
1DI3000679	I've seen the plans for the assault on the Enclave base. I don't know what to think... this is really it, isn't it? We've got to stop them here.
1DI3000680	What if we can't at least disable whatever's controlling these missiles the Enclave has? Do we have a shot at beating them?
1DI3000681	I'm not encouraged by the plans for the attack on the Enclave's position. We're taking an awful gamble by doing this.
1DI3000682	Look, we've won every engagement we've been in so far. We've got that robot on our side. Everything will be fine.
1DI3000683	I think we're going to come out on top. Their headquarters was destroyed, and now we've got them on the run. Don't worry about it.
1DI3000684	Our training is superior. We're reverse-engineering their tech, so they've lost that advantage. Everything is fine.
1DI3000685	We're walking a fine line. If we can keep the pressure on them, we've got a shot. If we give them time to re-group, we're in trouble.
1DI3000686	Let's put it this way: if we don't win, there isn't going to be a lot of time to stand around and worry about it. Know what I mean?
1DI3000687	The robot is our best weapon. If we can keep it running, we have a chance. If not, we have to find another way to counter their Vertibirds.
1DI3000688	It's just another day in the Brotherhood. We'll find this new weapon of theirs, and we'll stop it. That's the only way to look at it.
1DI3000689	The Scribes have some tricks up their sleeves. Trust me. They're not giving details, but they're working on something.
1DI3000690	The operation wasn't a total loss. If we can make sense of the data we recovered, we can still pull out ahead.
1DI3000691	Enjoy the clean water while you can. We may not have it for too much longer, know what I mean?
1DI3000692	Yeah, their vertibirds are going to be a real problem now. The robot was our only good counter to them. We might be in trouble.
1DI3000693	Don't forget they apparently have missiles they can launch at us from... hell, I don't know. Space? Kind of hard to fight back against that.
1DI3000694	We've got to do something. If they don't know we're coming, that might be enough to turn things in our favor.
1DI3000695	Look at it this way: they probably won't use their missiles on their own positions, right? So that evens things up a bit.
1DI3000696	The Scribes say this thing they've been working on should neutralize the Enclave's vertibirds. That'll catch them off-guard.
1DI3000697	Well, this is it, isn't it? We're throwing everything we can at them. If it doesn't work, nothing will.
1DI3000698	We're definitely not going to get a second shot at this, so everything has to work perfectly.
1DI3000699	It's a necessary move, but yeah. If the attack fails, they're going to come at us hard.
1DI3000700	This is a bad situation...
1DI3000701	No pressure, right? Heh.
1DI3000702	Great. Thanks, I feel so much better now.
1DI3000703	That's not exactly the answer I was hoping for.
1DI3000704	Well that's not going to help me sleep any better tonight.
1DI3000705	Thanks for the pick-me-up.
1DI3000706	I guess that's a good way to look at it.
1DI3000707	Yeah, you're right. We'll get through this.
1DI3000708	I sure hope you're right.
1DI3000709	We've made it this far, right? We'll get through this.
1DI3000710	You're right. Thanks.
1DI3000711	Look, this is the path that Elder Lyons committed us to. He believes in it, and we have to trust him. Otherwise we've got nothing.
1DI3000712	Hey, just focus on what needs to be done right now. Whatever happens after that, we'll deal with.
1DI3000713	Just stick to your training, and you'll be okay. We all will.
1DI3000714	Spend some time on target practice in the Bailey. That'll get the jitters out.
1DI3000715	If you're worried, talk to the Scribes. See what kind of progress they've made on that Enclave tech. Maybe they can put your mind at ease.
1DI3000716	Keep your equipment in good condition, and keep your head on straight. The Brotherhood will make it through this.
1DI3000717	Yes? If you wanted some, I'm sure that Brother Gerard would have gladly given you a bottle or two. We don't charge for charity, you know.
1DI3000718	Ah. We are accustomed to this sort of religious persecution. However, I refuse to respond to violence with violence.
1DI3000719	There's something jamming the control frequency!
1DI3000720	Releasing Deathclaw!
1DI3000721	Don't shoot! We surrender! We fragged our lieutenant! We just want some water!
1DI3000722	Hahaha. We're not Lyons' pack of softies. We're the real Brotherhood of Steel. This is how we deal with people like you.
1DI3000723	Now I'm going to go kick some Talon Company ass!
1DI3000724	The Brotherhood is getting ready for a little payback. We're tired of Talon Company ambushing our water caravans.
1DI3000725	I was scouting their base when I was captured -- all part of my plan of course.
1DI3000726	Now that I've memorized all their guard positions and patrol routes, I just need to get out of here and report back to the rest of my squad.
1DI3000727	Come on, help me escape!
1DI3000728	Fine! I'll just have to escape on my own. Don't worry, it won't take me long.
1DI3000729	Damn it. One more reason to wipe those Talon mothers off the face of the earth.
1DI3000730	Alpha squad, let's move out!
1DI3000731	I guess this is my lucky day. You're on, pal.
1DI3000733	Sure. But don't expect us to jump in and save you from those Talon boys. We move on our own schedule.
1DI3000735	You, too? Fine! They can have the damn water! What do I care if Big Town doesn't get any?
1DI3000736	Then get out of my damn face.
1DI3000737	Uh, yeah. "Water delivered to Megaton without incident." That's what my report will say.
1DI3000738	Ah... you're probably right. They wouldn't think twice about murdering the lot of us, would they?
1DI3000739	We'll just have to make do until we can organize our own water caravans and get out from under the Brotherhood's thumb.
1DI3000740	Now you're talking! Come on, let's get that water!
1DI3000741	Typical waster.
1DI3000742	You've still got plenty of water. Look, the brahmin is loaded with it. What you gave us won't last more than a few days!
1DI3000743	Hey, it isn't my call. I just take the water where the Brotherhood tells me. Don't shoot the messenger, you know?
1DI3000744	Look, they're giving the water away. What do you care whether you leave it all here or somewhere else?
1DI3000745	I really don't care. I mean, you'll have to take it up with those boys...
1DI3000746	You're not leaving here with that water. We need it. We're taking it.
1DI3000747	I hope you're not thinking about getting stupid on me.
1DI3000748	We just need the water. All of it.
1DI3000749	Sorry, pal, but you already got your quota. Our orders are to take the rest of this to Big Town.
1DI3000750	Alright, let's move out.
1DI3000751	Come on, Joe, help me get the water. They aren't really going to stop us.
1DI3000752	You're good to go.
1DI3000753	All right then. We'll see you in a few days.
1DI3000754	Well... sure. Let me guess -- your first time on caravan duty?
1DI3000755	Yeah. So what?
1DI3000756	You think we can't handle it? Believe me, you guys aren't the only ones who know how to put down a raider.
1DI3000757	Take it easy. I'm sure you'll be fine. Just like all the other caravans.
1DI3000759	All right, let's move it out!
1DI3000761	Come on, there, Sukey! Gee-up now!
1DI3000762	I think I see one.
1DI3000763	At least they don't shoot back.
1DI3000764	Come on, pop your head up one more time for me.
1DI3000765	Maybe we finally got them all.
1DI3000766	God what a stink!
1DI3000767	This is worse than latrine duty.
1DI3000768	You won't see Elder Lyons down here pulling the putrid lurks out of the Basin.
1DI3000769	How many of these damn things were living down there?
1DI3000770	Yeah. They've got a whole lake of it just sitting there.
1DI3000771	I know. We run out in two days and then it's back to the radiated shit.
1DI3000772	Hey, I hear you guys are giving out good water. You got some for me and my family, don't ya?
1DI3000773	We don't give water to Raider scum. Don't make me waste ammo on killing you.
1DI3000774	Well then, why don't you and your two-headed girlfriend go fuck yourselves?
1DI3000775	No, no. Ours is a modest order, but our ranks are growing slowly, as others hear our words and are Enlightened.
1DI3000776	As our Luminescent Mother says, "Where others walk only in the dying waste, we offer the path of eternal light."
1DI3000777	And to spread goodwill, we offer this holy water to any and all supplicants.
1DI3000778	As you wish, of course. In this cruel world, simple prudence says he who offers help in one hand, conceals a knife in the other.
1DI3000779	But I assure you, we wish only to help the unfortunate, and expose them to the eternal light that can guide us all to salvation.
1DI3000780	That is why we offer our blessed water to any and all who are athirst.
1DI3000781	Stop helping the needy? I don't think so. And even if I did, it's not my decision to make.
1DI3000782	Blessing of the holy water is overseen by Mother Curie the Third, our Luminescent Mother. And she's far too busy to speak with outsiders.
1DI3000783	It's full of Atom's Light, if that's what you mean. Brighter and warmer than any water I've ever seen before.
1DI3000784	Blessing of the holy water is overseen by Mother Curie III, our Luminescent Mother. But her work keeps her busy within the monastery at all times.
1DI3000785	What you see as the "taint" of radiation, we see as Atom's Eternal Light.
1DI3000786	Laugh if you want, but our good deeds shall not be corrupted by your cynicism. We will continue to help the needy.
1DI3000787	Blessing of the holy water is overseen by Mother Curie III, our Luminescent Mother. And she works tirelessly in our monastery to Enlighten the world!
1DI3000788	Yes, call it what you will. We simply will not allow any who do not bear the Light.
1DI3000789	Make your way to our Tabernacle, pilgrim. Pray to Atom to fill you with Holy Radiance. Bask in the Glow of Atom's Eternal Light.
1DI3000790	Must it really come to this? So be it.
1DI3000797	Currently, the Presidential Metro is running at 22 percent capacity.
1DI3000798	The only fully functional train line at the moment is the White House to Adams Air Force Base line.
1DI3000799	If you insist...
1DI3000801	As my employer, I am obliged to honor your request. Very well.
1DI3000802	Shouldn't someone be starting the purifier in order to prevent our imminent demise?
1DI3000803	That seems incredibly juvenile.
1DI3000805	Standing by for further orders.
1DI3000806	I'll see to it that your posthumous awards are polished daily, soldier.
1DI3000807	This seems an illogical solution to our dilemma.
1DI3000808	After everything, this is how you let it end?
1DI3000809	You're a disgrace to the service.
1DI3000810	That would seem impossible, given what you are about to do.
1DI3000811	I don't recall that being part of the plan.
1DI3000813	That is contrary to what you just asserted.
1DI3000814	Now that's more like it!
1DI3000815	This unit is more than equipped to handle the harsh combat environment.
1DI3000816	Cycle that airlock, soldier, and we'll end this war.
1DI3000817	Ah, of course. My immunity to radiation makes me a far better candidate for surviving in there.
1DI3000818	I would say that your destiny lies within that chamber, but you have already altered mine. The least I can do is return the favor.
1DI3000819	Cycle the airlock, and we'll put an end to this.
1DI3000820	But... you said...
1DI3000824	That would be fine. I'd be more than willing to take the responsibility, if it means surviving.
1DI3000825	Just cycle the airlock for me, and I'll enter the code.
1DI3000827	My superior construction and programming will outlast your frail human form in that hostile environment.
1DI3000828	It'll be a battlefield commendation for sure. Cycle that airlock, soldier, and we'll put an end to this.
1DI3000832	Yes, yes indeed.
1DI3000833	I believe Paladin Tristan and Scribe Rothchild can enlighten you with a myriad of ways you can assist us.
1DI3000834	I'm glad to see even after all you've been through you're still willing to lend a hand. That's the mark of a noble member of the Brotherhood.
1DI3000835	Well, yes actually. If you're still up for it, I could always use a hand with my next assignment.
1DI3000836	The Super Mutants are still a major problem in the Capital Wasteland and one of our primary missions is to cleanse this place of their stink.
1DI3000837	All I need you to do is to thin their numbers. You see one, you put a bullet into its head.
1DI3000838	I'm outfitting your Pip-Boy with the same blood sampling device we usually give our Scouts.
1DI3000839	After you kill a Mutant, grab a sample from its corpse and bring it here. I'll see you're properly compensated for your ammo expenditure.
1DI3000840	Just keep wiping out those Super Mutants and you'll be helping plenty.
1DI3000841	Yeah... actually, I think Rothchild is looking for stuff to rebuild Liberty Prime. You should ask him.
1DI3000842	Yes, yes please. Your help would be most welcome.
1DI3000843	As you know, my main task is the reconstruction of Liberty Prime. A daunting task indeed, given his current state.
1DI3000844	To get him back on his feet will take not only a good deal of scavenged parts, but I need some special items for his complex systems.
1DI3000845	In your travels, be on the lookout for sensor modules. That will help me with restoring his electrical components.
1DI3000846	But what I need most are old cameras. Prime's optics were completely destroyed in the explosion and I can use the components inside to replace them.
1DI3000847	Remember, I'm looking for sensor modules and cameras. Bring them back here if you discover any.
1DI3000848	Well, the Pride's got the downtown area pretty well covered.
1DI3000849	You may want to talk to Paladin Tristan or Scribe Rothchild. They may have something for you to do. Good luck!
1DI3000850	Although we've all but eradicated the Enclave, many difficult paths still stretch out before us.
1DI3000851	The Wasteland is still rife with peril, and I intend to dedicate the Brotherhood to maintaining it in a peaceful state.
1DI3000852	I hold out high hopes for you; that you'll still wish to be a part of our future and help us in our struggles.
1DI3000853	Well, the Enclave might not be a threat anymore, but we're not done by a long shot.
1DI3000854	We've still got Muties crawling all over the ruins like rats and they're multiplying every day.
1DI3000855	It's no picnic keeping their numbers down, but that's our job.
1DI3000856	I've been amazingly busy ever since we began clashing with the Enclave. All their technology is amazing.
1DI3000857	It's going to take me years to sift through the wreckage of their mobile platform alone.
1DI3000858	I suppose we have you to thank for that.
1DI3000859	If you think this means the Pride has nothing to do anymore, you're crazy.
1DI3000860	We've still got the damn Frankensteins crawling all over D.C. and Rothchild's got us picking up every blinking gizmo from here to Virginia.
1DI3000861	Quite a bit of work cut out for us, eh?
1DI3000862	Now? Now the real work begins.
1DI3000863	I've got just piles and piles of Enclave technology to take apart and put back together. Who do you think got our captured Vertibird flying?
1DI3000864	Now let me get back to work before Rothchild assigns me trash detail.
1DI3000865	Nah. There'll be stragglers and patrols still wandering the Wasteland. They won't know what happened at Adams probably for months.
1DI3000866	One thing I can tell you is they'll still shoot you on sight... so watch yourself.
1DI3000867	It would be naive of me to assume the Enclave threat is completely eradicated from our future.
1DI3000868	With their resources and advanced mobility, I wouldn't be surprised if we see them return to the Capital Wasteland one day.
1DI3000869	Yeah, for a while at least. You'll still bump into a few of them in the Wastes... deep scout patrols and outposts.
1DI3000870	Hopefully, they'll stay far from here and let us do our job now that we kicked their butts!
1DI3000871	My father says we need to watch the borders for them to send reinforcements, but I think it'll be a long time before anything happens.
1DI3000872	We dealt them a hell of a blow and it's going to take them a good amount of time to recover.
1DI3000873	From the amount of equipment pouring in, I'd say if we didn't destroy them, we certainly threw a major wrench into their works.
1DI3000874	Father is sending us into D.C. to scour the ruins and try and cleanse it of Super Mutants.
1DI3000875	He's calling it "our next great obstacle." Sometimes I wish we could just take a rest.
1DI3000876	But I have to keep a stiff upper lip and help the machine run smoothly, so that's what I'm going to do.
1DI3000877	We have so much to do putting him back together again. I'm uncertain as to how long it might take. Months? Years?
1DI3000878	The only bright side in this is an opportunity to try and rebuild Prime from the ground up; make improvements on his original design.
1DI3000879	If only we hadn't exhausted so many of our supplies fighting the Enclave...
1DI3000880	Don't even get me started...
1DI3000881	Trying to decipher Rothchild's schematics and wiring diagrams is exhausting. But we'll get there.
1DI3000882	Like Rothchild says, "Liberty Prime will walk again!" I believe him, but I think it's going to take a really long time.
1DI3000883	Ah, very nice. I'll have my assembling team get right on it.
1DI3000884	We'll need a lot more where this came from to reconstruct Prime's electrical systems. Keep bringing more.
1DI3000885	It's but a drop in the bucket, but it'll have to do. Thanks.
1DI3000886	I just gave him some water I picked up on the way through Springvale. It tasted pure, and it looks clean. How was I supposed to know?
1DI3000887	No, please! I just wanted to share some of my water with him! How could that kill him?
1DI3000888	No, it's not okay! Not for him! It was supposed to be holy water. The man at the monastery in Springvale said it was blessed!
1DI3000889	He gave me this pamphlet along with the water. Called himself Brother Gerard. You can find him on the road through Springvale.
1DI3000890	I don't know if it'll help, but I don't know what else I can do.
1DI3000891	I thought it would help him. It was supposed to be holy water. The man at the monastery in Springvale said it was blessed!
1DI3000893	They said they had lots of this holy water. Please, do something to stop them!
1DI3000894	No, I promise, I thought it would help! It was supposed to be holy water. The man at the monastery in Springvale said it was blessed!
1DI3000895	Here, he gave me this pamphlet with the water. Called himself Brother Gerard. You can find him on the road through Springvale! He's responsible!
1DI3000896	I was just trying to help. It's not my fault! Please!
1DI3000897	You bastard! I'll make you PAY for this! You hear me?! PAY!
1DI3000898	Well, just above us is a deathclaw research facility. Most of the deathclaws are out fighting, but there might be one or two left.
1DI3000899	There are also a bunch of robots in the facility, and they're all controlled through the mainframe.
1DI3000900	There are also some military types left but not nearly as many as there used to be.
1DI3000901	Well, the Satellite Tower is right on top of the base. I'm sure you saw it before you came in.
1DI3000902	You're going to have to make it into the central control area before you get on top of the launch platform.
1DI3000903	Once you're on top of the platform, you're probably going to have to make your way past a bunch of soldiers before you get to the tower.
1DI3000904	Oh, thank goodness! I'm Stiggs. Nice to meet you.
1DI3000905	Man, am I glad you realize I'm not one of the bad guys. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have.
1DI3000906	Right. Well let's get down to it, then. Ask me anything you want.
1DI3000907	Come on Sparky, Hoover. Let's go.
1DI3000908	I uh... work on the robots. I fix 'em up.
1DI3000909	I saw what you did before you got in the base. You're not going to hurt me are you?
1DI3000910	Well, you'll want to get to the floor above, and then make your way to the middle. That's where the mainframe is.
1DI3000911	I've been trying to get outa here for awhile. See, I've done things for the Enclave.... Things I can't say I'm proud of, but a man's gotta eat.
1DI3000912	When the Enclave picked me up, I was starving and suffering from radiation poisoning. I felt I owed them. But now... now it's time to leave.
1DI3000913	You'll make a great distraction while I make off with a few robots and supplies. I help you, and you help me.
1DI3000914	Please! I never did anything to you!
1DI3000915	Hmm... You have a point, one cannot be forced into salvation against one's will. To do so would be unjust, even in Atom's name.
1DI3000916	Perhaps you're right. We must not use deception to spread the word of Atom's Light. To do so would be to make a mockery of salvation itself.
1DI3000917	We will stop using the Aqua Pura for our holy water. We will save our ministrations for those who seek us out.
1DI3000918	Is that truly what it looks like to others? We only mean to tend to the ill and offer them salvation before they pass - we're saviors, not murderers!
1DI3000919	We offer salvation, not death! We must not give the world another reason to fear Atom's Light. If that means no more holy water, then so be it.
1DI3000920	We will leave the clean Aqua Pura for the residents of Megaton. We will save our ministrations for those who seek us out.
1DI3000921	If you feel you must resort to violence, then you will do so. I will not fight you.
1DI3000922	But I cannot say that my disciples share my commitment to peace.
1DI3000923	Give it time, child. Soon Atom will enlighten your eyes and you will come to realize the truth for yourself.
1DI3000924	You never need to fight, my dear. But I'm afraid you simply aren't going to convince us to stop our holy work just because you disapprove.
1DI3000925	Such a shame it had to come to this...
1DI3000926	I suppose it's a fair question... Ever since I was a girl, I knew I was destined for something special. I always resisted the feeling. Me? Special?
1DI3000927	But one day I fell asleep during one of the Confessor's sermons. And I had a dream.
1DI3000928	A dream of the Prophet of Atom. Ablaze with Holy Light! He told me of my destiny. Of my mission. I was called to service, and I answered.
1DI3000929	The only being able to convince me I was wrong, would be the Prophet of Atom himself.
1DI3000932	A dream of the Prophet of Atom. Ablaze with Holy Light! She told me of my destiny. Of my mission. I was called to service, and I answered.
1DI3000933	The only being able to convince me I was wrong, would be the Prophet of Atom herself.
1DI3000934	Oh. Well, she... After what happened to you when the purifier started, I think she just kind of had enough.
1DI3000935	It was really hard on her, you know? First losing your dad, and then the Enclave, and then the Brotherhood taking over here.
1DI3000936	It was really just too much for her. So I guess she packed up a few things and headed off north, towards the Commonwealth.
1DI3000937	Rumor has it there's a scientific community up there. I sure hope she finds what she's looking for.
1DI3000938	You haven't heard? I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
1DI3000939	She basically folded. After the purifier was started, she decided she'd had enough, and headed up north.
1DI3000940	Said she was looking for the Commonwealth. Like she'd ever make it on her own.
1DI3000941	Tell you what. You run into her, you tell her Daniel sends his regards.
1DI3000942	Me? Well, I figured after all the work we already put into this place, we could help the Brotherhood keep things running smoothly.
1DI3000943	It's worked out pretty well so far, I think. They're not necessarily the friendliest bunch, but I've been doing what I can to get along with them.
1DI3000944	What's it look like? I'm doing my work, same as I've always done.
1DI3000945	These Brotherhood "scribes" wouldn't know what to do with half the equipment here if their lives depended on it.
1DI3000946	I'm basically running this place from behind the scenes, no matter what Bigsley tells you.
1DI3000947	The Brotherhood has taken over control of the purifier, and is managing distribution of the water to the people of the Wasteland.
1DI3000948	If you travel there, speak with Scribe Bigsley. He's heading up the on-site operation.
1DI3000949	It was determined that the Brotherhood should directly oversee the purifier, so as to prevent any mishaps.
1DI3000950	Scribe Bigsley was placed in charge of the operation, and is directly overseeing our efforts.
1DI3000951	What the hell happened in here... Oh, man... We've got people down in here! You, check that equipment! The two of you, over here - help me get them..
1DI3000952	What do you mean, comatose? I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable. After all this, to be left in a state like that...
1DI3000953	Owyn, why do you keep torturing yourself? Coming down here isn't going to help at all. We have enough to deal with already.
1DI3000954	Elder, sir -- I was told you'd be down here. We're getting more field reports. The Enclave is retreating. We have a location on their rally point...
1DI3000959	Giving it away only to certain people... and those people aren't giving it to me...
1DI3000960	Please! Don't shoot!
1DI3000961	I'm "pretty certain" ANY caravan will be attacked. This "particular" caravan also happens to have my most junior men escorting it.
1DI3000962	They could really use someone with Wasteland experience leading the team.
1DI3000963	After protecting the caravan, track down the attackers base of operations and put an end to it once and for all.
1DI3000964	Do the job right and report back to me, and I'll make certain you get paid appropriately.
1DI3000965	Great. I had a feeling you would. Officers Davis and Lorin should have just left Project Purity. If you hurry you'll catch them.
1DI3000966	Their course hugs the river closely. If you head north following the river from Project Purity, you should catch up to them. Please hurry.
1DI3000967	If you head north following the river from Project Purity, you should catch up to them. Please hurry.
1DI3000968	If you aren't man enough for the job, fine. I don't want you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have operations to conduct.
1DI3000969	If you aren't woman enough for the job, fine. I don't want you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have operations to conduct.
1DI3000971	I suppose I don't really need it pushing papers around here, do I? Alright. Consider it an advance on your payment. You better not disappoint.
1DI3000972	What are you talking about? You did already get paid up front. Or have you forgotten that little Plasma Rifle I gave you?
1DI3000973	Then I'm afraid you're not the man for the job. I don't have anything I can offer you up front.
1DI3000974	Then I'm afraid you're not the woman for the job. I don't have anything I can offer you up front.
1DI3000975	I can pay you in bottlecaps, maybe some weapons and armor if I have any left from requisitions.
1DI3000977	Really? That's excellent. Thank you. As soon as I have a moment, I'll make arrangements to see to your reward.
1DI3000979	Yes, yes. I'm sure it wasn't easy. I'll make the necessary arrangements to have you paid.
1DI3000982	Damn it. I just don't have that kind of money at my disposal...
1DI3000983	Here's the deal. I'll give you 500 caps, from my own personal savings, mind you, and you call off the attacks. But that's it. That's all I have.
1DI3000984	I can't believe you're trying to extort me! I'm trying to do the right thing here, and you're totally taking advantage. You're a horrible person.
1DI3000985	Fine, tell your gang to send someone over once a week. I'll find some way to get the caps.
1DI3000986	But you... I never want to see YOU again. I trusted you. If you come around again, I'll kill you. You understand me?! I'll kill you!
1DI3000987	You're not very funny. Now get out of here until you've made progress with taking care of that gang.
1DI3000988	I gave you the money. That's it. You've pushed me too far. Walk away. Right now. If you come around here again, I'll kill you.
1DI3000989	Fine. Here. But really, that's it. There's nothing left. You're squeezing a rock to get water now.
1DI3000990	Our business is concluded. If you or any of your gang come back here to try to get anything more out of me. I'll kill you. Now get out of here!
1DI3000992	Oh yeah! Hahahahaha!
1DI3000993	Hahaha! Kick his ass!
1DI3000994	Hahaha! Kick her ass!
1DI3000995	Yeah man! Yeah!
1DI3000996	Hahah! You are soooo dead! Hahaha!
1DI3000997	Kill him! Hahaha!
1DI3000998	Kill her! Hahaha!
1DI3001000	It's on now!
1DI3001002	Right boss. G'luck out there. The Wastes are dangerous! Ahaha.
1DI3001003	Just don't hurt me, alright? Here's all my caps.
1DI3001004	I don't got shit for you to take. Honest man. My pockets are empty.
1DI3001005	Ha. I might of believed you were capable of that. But everyone knows you're a softy.
1DI3001006	Fine. Here's an extra 50 caps. Now get out of here until next week.
1DI3001007	Yeah. I guess you're right. Here's a bigger share of the take. We'll see you next week.
1DI3001008	Damnit man, why you got to be like that? Here. Take half my caps. Then get the hell out of here until next week.
1DI3001009	Oh, he did?  I was beginning to think he forgot about us.
1DI3001010	Not sure how much you know: There's been an increase in attacks on the caravans. Seems organized and not just the random Raider or Mutant encounter.
1DI3001011	I'm running out of resources and I'm down to my greenest men. I want to get to the bottom of these coordinated attacks. The sooner the better.
1DI3001012	Hmm... I've heard about you. I suppose you can handle yourself out there, and I AM down to my greenest boys...
1DI3001013	Alright. But it's no cake walk. I got to get these caravans full of water to the farthest reaches of the Wasteland.
1DI3001014	I'm running out of resources, and attacks have increased. I suspect something organized is going on.
1DI3001015	Heh. Tell me about it. It's enough trouble just keeping the miscreants on that leaky boat under control.
1DI3001016	But the Brotherhood needs help delivering all that water. But I'm not getting the support I need.
1DI3001017	There's been an increase in attacks on the caravan. And they don't seem random any more.
1DI3001018	To make matters worse, I'm running out of resources and I'm down to my greenest men.
1DI3001019	Say that a little louder. I've got a lot of disgruntled men who'd be happy to prove you wrong.
1DI3001020	Now, remove yourself before I have you arrested.
1DI3001021	Great. I can really use a strong arm on this one.
1DI3001022	I need you to escort a caravan from Project Purity to Canterbury Commons.
1DI3001023	If, or rather, WHEN they get ambushed, I need YOU to figure out who's behind the attack.
1DI3001024	Good. My veterans are all already out in the field, or worse, never came back. I could use someone who knows what he's doing.
1DI3001027	Good. My veterans are all already out in the field, or worse, never came back. I could use someone who knows what she's doing.
1DI3001030	Yeah, right. Clear out of here before I have you arrested.
1DI3001032	Okay. You're lucky you knew that. Don't know who let you in, don't really care.
1DI3001033	This is a real simple gang. Whoever's the toughest sets the rules, and that's ME. And I got just one rule: Do what the hell I say, when I say it.
1DI3001034	Now, find a seat. We're waiting for some of the boys to get back.
1DI3001037	Now, find a seat. We're waiting for some of the boys to get back. Oh, and put this on. We're a gang. We all wear the same uniform.
1DI3001038	Sad for you. 'Cause only people that know the pass phrase get away with snooping around our business.
1DI3001039	'Fraid you're gonna die, boy.
1DI3001041	'Fraid you're gonna die, girl.
1DI3001042	Very funny, asshole. You won't be laughing when I'm done with you.
1DI3001043	The hell's that supposed to mean? No matter. That ain't the pass phrase, so you're dead, asshole.
1DI3001044	Yes well, I don't really have anything I can give you at the moment.
1DI3001045	I've simply run out of resources. Only a quarter of my escorts have made it back. I fear the worst.
1DI3001046	I'll send word to Bigsley, the Brotherhood Scribe running things over at Project Purity. I'm sure the Brotherhood can reward you for your efforts.
1DI3001048	I'm afraid I don't have anything to give you. Now don't you go getting upset!
1DI3001050	You'll have to see about getting a reward from the Brotherhood.
1DI3001051	Speak with Scribe Bigsley at Project Purity. I'm SURE he has something he can reward you with.
1DI3001053	Nothing of the sort! How dare you even suggest such a thing. Look around for Godsake. Do you see a mountain of bottle caps? A stash of weapons?
1DI3001054	Only a quarter of the escorts have returned! Those poor boys are likely dead, and sadly for you, they took the last of our resources with them.
1DI3001055	No. You will just have to pry a reward from the Brotherhood. Speak with Bigsley at Project Purity. I'm sure he'll be able to offer you a reward.
1DI3001057	You got a deathwish? Fine by me. Knives, pipes, or boards?
1DI3001058	Great. Here's a Combat Knife. Use that and only that. I get hit with something other than that, or by anyone else, and my boys join in.
1DI3001059	G'luck. You're gonna need it.
1DI3001060	Great. Here's a Lead Pipe. Use that and only that. I get hit with something other than that, or by anyone else, and my boys join in.
1DI3001062	Great. Here's a Nail Board. Use that and only that. I get hit with something other than that, or by anyone else, and my boys join in.
1DI3001063	Good luck. You're gonna need it.
1DI3001064	Did I say guns? No I didn't. I said, Knives, Pipes, or Boards. I'm still the boss of this gang, so I still set the rules. So what will it be asshole?
1DI3001065	Didn't think so. Now, sit down and shut up.
1DI3001066	Huhnn. You're one of the newbies then. Fine. So long as you know the pass phrase, you're in. If not -- you're dead.
1DI3001067	Damnit. And I was just gonna have some stew that Grandma whipped up. Fine. Have it your way asshole.
1DI3001068	Damnit. And I was just gonna have some stew that Grandma left in the freezer, God rest her soul... Fine. Have it your way asshole.
1DI3001069	Brother, I worry 'bout everybody. Can't trust no one. You know the pass phrase?
1DI3001070	Sister, I worry 'bout everybody. Can't trust no one. You know the pass phrase?
1DI3001071	That so? You're one of the newbies?  You best know the pass phrase asshole. Or you're dead.
1DI3001072	You an idiot or something? I don't got much like for idiots. You better know the pass phrase, asshole.
1DI3001073	Well friend, how much would you be willing to pay? For such an AMAZING product as the Amazing Aqua Cura?
1DI3001074	Many would pay 50, 75, even 100 bottlecaps for such an amazing product! With such an amazing guarantee!
1DI3001075	But, for a limited time only I'm able to offer the Amazing Aqua Cura for an introductory, exceptionally low price! Care to take a guess at how much?
1DI3001076	Here you go! Another satisfied customer, I'm sure!
1DI3001077	Ah... my  um... LOYAL customers and FRIENDS!
1DI3001078	It appears I may have slightly exaggerated some of the benefits of the, uh, Amazing Aqua Cura.
1DI3001079	Aheh.
1DI3001080	Turns out due to ah... a bottling irregularity - aheh- rather than actual Aqua Pura... <deep breath>
1DI3001081	You've all been purchasing regular, unpurified, irradiated water.
1DI3001082	Yeah, but we're ghouls so it's not like it's hurt anybody.
1DI3001083	Aheheh. Wooo.
1DI3001084	Now. Before you all get upset...
1DI3001085	I'd like to point out something to you folks, that you might be overlooking in your current state of rage - aheh -
1DI3001086	You've all seen an actual improvement in your lives.
1DI3001087	Granted, it's not due to any inherent -material- property of the water.
1DI3001088	BUT! Due to your BELIEF in the transmuting power of the AMAZING Aqua Cura, you have ALL experienced renewed hope!
1DI3001089	And for that, I trust you will remain grateful.
1DI3001090	Aheheh.
1DI3001091	And, as I've said with each and every purchase:  "All sales are final." Eheh.
1DI3001092	I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that violence won't be necessary.
1DI3001093	I'll just pack up my things and be going now.
1DI3001094	I've made a huge mistake.
1DI3001096	Is he saying what I think he's saying?
1DI3001097	<Gasp!>
1DI3001098	I can't believe it.
1DI3001099	He's been LYING to us!
1DI3001100	It's a little late for that.
1DI3001101	Lies! All lies!
1DI3001102	He's made fools of us!
1DI3001103	"Grateful?" Really?
1DI3001104	I want my money back!
1DI3001105	That's it. Get him!
1DI3001106	Kill him! Kill the lying two faced bastard!
1DI3001107	Why you... I ought to... <Grumble>
1DI3001108	<Sigh.> Fine. If you promise to keep your mouth shut, I'll cut you in.
1DI3001109	Me and my boys continue to do our thing, you come and check on us once in a while, and I'll cut you in for your share.
1DI3001110	Each week you make it by, I'll give you 20% of the previous week's profits? That's more than fair for doing nothing. I'm doing all the hard work.
1DI3001111	Fine. 50/50 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week, and I'll give you your share.
1DI3001112	Fine. 60/40 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week, and I'll give you your share.
1DI3001113	Fine. 30/70 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week, and I'll give you your share.
1DI3001114	Fine. 20/80 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week, and I'll give you your share.
1DI3001115	Hmm. That's pretty steep...
1DI3001116	What the hell. It's just this once, and then we're through. Fine. Here's your 300 caps.
1DI3001117	There. I just bought your silence. So keep your mouth shut.
1DI3001118	I can't believe it... I have a good thing going here... Why mess that up for me? What have I done to you?
1DI3001119	I'm not hurting anyone. I mean, really? Reverse the ghoul condition? With a bottle of water? I wasn't fooling anybody; they were fooling themselves.
1DI3001120	Fine. I've made enough money here, anyway. Well, um... It's probably best if I tell them. I think I know what to say.
1DI3001121	Wish me luck.
1DI3001122	That's seriously going to cut into my profits... but perhaps you're right.
1DI3001123	After all it's not like it was going to be a piece of cake selling the Aqua Pura to Raiders and Slavers. They're a nasty bunch.
1DI3001124	Fine. I'll sell them the real deal. But I'll keep the Amazing Aqua Cura patter. It gives this sorry lot a little hope for the future.
1DI3001125	I hope no one notices the switcheroo. And who knows, maybe it really WILL be a miraculous cure! Come back in a few days. We'll see if anyone notices.
1DI3001126	Why? Have you heard otherwise?
1DI3001127	I changed the name to help Ghouls realize its amazing properties. And, well, just between us...
1DI3001128	I've also added a few secret ingredients to enhance the flavor of the original. So it's not EXACTLY the same, it's BETTER! Care to procure a bottle?
1DI3001129	The Brotherhood doesn't deliver to Underworld, you know. There's shipping expenses and all that. Not to mention sneaking past Super Mutants.
1DI3001130	But, beyond that, I added a few of my own secret ingredients. To enhance the flavor of the original! So what do you say? Care to procure a bottle?
1DI3001131	Aha! That's right my good fellow. The Amazing Aqua Cura will rescue, restore, and regrow your hair back from premature balding.
1DI3001132	Act now, and I'll throw in a box of Abraxo for, wait for it... FREE! Mix those together and you'll have the best shampoo known to mankind!
1DI3001133	So what do you say, young man. Care to procure a bottle?
1DI3001134	Aha! That's right my dear! The Amazing Aqua Cura will rescue, restore, and regrow your hair back from premature balding.
1DI3001136	So what do you say, young woman. Care to procure a bottle?
1DI3001137	Ha ha ha.
1DI3001138	Tell you what, friend. Just for you, and only if you act in the next five minutes, I'll sell you a bottle for half-price!
1DI3001139	What do you say? You want to procure a bottle?
1DI3001140	A FREE sample you say? Hmm... Well... I normally don't do this... but, for YOU, for this ONE TIME ONLY, a VERY special VIP promotional offer...
1DI3001141	Ladies and gentlemen, DING-DING-DING! We have a new winner in our daily Aqua Cura Sweepstakes! Here you go, sir. Your FREE bottle!

1DI3001149	No, sir. Try again. Lower!
1DI3001150	No, ma'am. Try again. Lower!
1DI3001151	Wrong! Try again. Lower still!
1DI3001152	Nope. It's insane isn't it? How could I sell it for any less? But I can! And I WILL! Try again. LOW-WER!
1DI3001153	DING-DING-DING! We have a winner, ladies and gentlemen!
1DI3001154	That's right, for the low-low price of just 10 caps you can walk away with your very own bottle of the Amazing Aqua Cura!

1DI3001157	Right you are! Here's the bottle, and I'll take those caps. Pleasure doing business with you, ma'am. Come again!
1DI3001159	Why yes! You can't imagine how low the special introductory price is. Go on, just guess. You'll never believe it!
1DI3001160	You're no fun. 10 caps. Pretty amazing, huh? You want a bottle?
1DI3001161	Here you go. Run along now.
1DI3001162	And remember: All sales are final. No refunds.
1DI3001163	Fine. You're blocking all the real customers anyway. Go on. Get out of here.
1DI3001164	Oh. I didn't realize you were so poor. Well, tough break kid. Maybe you can find someone who can spot you the caps?
1DI3001165	If you'll excuse me, I have real customers waiting.
1DI3001166	Oh really? I'm sure you'll change your mind after you discover how AMAZING the product really is! Stick around, I give regular demonstrations.
1DI3001167	Wh-ell, w-hell, well... if you aren't here to buy the Amazing Aqua Cura, what are you here for?
1DI3001168	Well then I presume you won't mind if I focus on the customers who actually brought money with them? Have a nice day, and good luck finding a job.
1DI3001169	Right you are! Pleasure doing business with you, sir. Come again!
1DI3001170	Right you are! Pleasure doing business with you, ma'am. Come again!
1DI3001171	Oh alright, alright. But if you start blabbing, I've got some buddies with itching trigger fingers...
1DI3001172	So I've got this little operation taking Aqua Pura and replacing it with regular crap. It's not like it'll hurt us ghouls.
1DI3001173	The Aqua Pura I'm storing to sell back to humans later. You know, raiders, Outcasts, etc. The guys the Brotherhood doesn't share with.
1DI3001174	I'm not a bad guy. I'm just trying to help. The Brotherhood needs me. My caps mean water for the Wasteland. Just ask Bigsley at Project Purity.
1DI3001175	Ha! I'd like to see you try and prove that...
1DI3001176	Er, um, rather, even it were true, you'd need proof to convince my customers. My - ahem - very LOYAL customers.
1DI3001177	They're already convinced... er, I mean, they already see the many benefits of the Amazing Aqua Cura!
1DI3001178	It's true, I got a thing going.
1DI3001179	I take the Aqua Pura, store it to sell to humans later, then I put the regular irradiated crap in the bottles and sell it to these fools.
1DI3001180	No one's getting hurt. In fact, the Brotherhood actually needs the caps and technology I give them to fund their "free" water caravans.
1DI3001181	Just ask Bigsley at Project Purity, he'll tell you how grateful he is I'm helping them out like this.
1DI3001182	But watch yourself. Get in my way, and... let's just say, I'm good at removing problems.
1DI3001183	Heheh. You're not fooling anyone. Everyone knows you're one of the good guys.
1DI3001184	But seriously kid. I'm not up to anything. Just ask any of these fools - ahem - I mean, LOYAL customers.
1DI3001185	They already see the many benefits of the Amazing Aqua Cura!
1DI3001186	Come one, come all! Taste the smooth succulent sensation of radiation reversing - Aqua Cura! - It's simply Amazing!
1DI3001187	Step right up, step right up. One and all, and purchase the Amazing Aqua Cura. It's the answer to all your problems. Guaranteed!
1DI3001188	The Amazing Aqua Cura cures all the common ghoul ailments! Guaranteed!
1DI3001189	The Amazing Aqua Cura! Not only does it taste great, but it also reverses radiation poisoning!
1DI3001190	Are you plagued by hellacious halitosis? Extreme epidermal exfoliation? Well, friends, your days of suffering are ended!
1DI3001191	Have cap strapped friends or relatives? No need to fret.
1DI3001192	Wondering how it works? It's simple...
1DI3001193	Having trouble sleeping? Still haunted by the war?
1DI3001194	Have you tried the Amazing Aqua Cura? All your friends and neighbors have.
1DI3001195	Have a dress from before the war that's seen better days? Pour a little Aqua Cura on it, scrub vigorously with a stiff brush, and get your party on!
1DI3001196	Having trouble seeing? Got a little something in your eye?
1DI3001197	Have an oozing sore that just won't go away?
1DI3001198	Have a woman who keeps looking the other way?
1DI3001199	Having trouble concentrating? Tired of dry mouth and other side effects of Mentats? Then try the Amazing Aqua Cura!
1DI3001200	Muscles atrophying? Getting picked on by bullies? Well fear the dark alleys no longer, friends!
1DI3001201	Losing your hearing? Having trouble eavesdropping across the room?

1DI3001238	I'm definitely getting a bottle!
1DI3001239	I'm getting a case for my family.
1DI3001240	Oh wow! That sounds great!
1DI3001241	That IS Amazing!
1DI3001242	It's unbelievable!
1DI3001244	That's terrific!
1DI3001245	Who would've thought?
1DI3001246	I can't believe it does ALL that! That's wonderful!
1DI3001247	Amazing! Simply amazing.
1DI3001248	Wow!
1DI3001249	Really, what's it matter to you anyway?
1DI3001250	Alright. But keep your mouth shut about it...
1DI3001251	The Brotherhood's happy just giving the stuff away, right? Well they drove ME out, claiming "Ghouls don't need fresh water!"
1DI3001252	Well, big surprise that when I offered to PAY for it, next thing I knew, I was talking to Scribe Bigsley, the guy in charge of the whole shebang.
1DI3001253	Didn't really want to, but on principle I wanted to prove Ghouls are WORTH the cost, so I paid him. Now I'm stuck selling the stuff.
1DI3001254	Good thing whatever they put in it to kill the radiation also undoes the radiation damage to Ghoul physiology! And thus, Aqua Pura becomes Aqua Cura!
1DI3001255	Huh. I hadn't pegged you as a bigot. My mistake.
1DI3001256	Oh. Sorry. I guess I'm just a little sensitive about the question. Some people think giving Aqua Pura to Ghouls is a waste, afterall.
1DI3001257	I didn't STEAL it, if that's what you're getting at. I got it fair and square.
1DI3001258	I haven't tasted water this pure since... urk... Oh. Oh god, what's wrong? Water...
1DI3001259	That water... you... damn you!
1DI3001260	Nonsense! The Eternal Light is faultless and blameless. It cleanses our bodies as it cleanses our transgressions.
1DI3001261	Walk in Atom's Glow, and you have nothing to worry about.
1DI3001262	I "made" you do nothing. You chose to imbibe the Waters of Light of your own volition. A choice most wise, indeed.
1DI3001263	As for your threats to my person, I fear not. I am aglow with Atom's Holy Light. You may do violence to this vessel, but my spirit is inviolable.
1DI3001264	I shall smite thee, heathen. Atom fill me!
1DI3001265	No... What do I do?
1DI3001266	He can't be dead. He just can't be! It was just water!
1DI3001267	Oh god, somebody help!
1DI3001268	No! That's not supposed to happen! No, get up! Get up! You can't pass out, you're supposed to get better! I gave you holy water, and everything!
1DI3001269	I can't stay here. Not after something like that...
1DI3001270	Please, water. I'm so thirsty.
1DI3001271	Oh, poor dear. Here, I've got some water I can spare.
1DI3001272	For... for me? Crystal clear water? Oh, bless you! Bless you!
1DI3001273	No, bless you. I'm glad to help.
1DI3001274	Children of the Light, hear my words and feel Atom's warmth!
1DI3001275	For too long, our world has been barren, and our people have become empty.
1DI3001276	Their hearts have become dry and cold, and thirst consumes the weak and the strong alike.
1DI3001277	But we can save them! For Atom's bounty has granted us the gifts of mercy and compassion!
1DI3001278	Oh, my brethren, let us share with them the Waters of Light!
1DI3001279	Let them be fulfilled by Atom! Let them know his glow and be truly Enlightened!
1DI3001280	And let them live forever, and walk with us in the grace of Atom's Glow, and never be empty again!
1DI3001281	I'm sure you can imagine the chaos if we just let anyone who wanted to wade into the basin and fill up a jug?
1DI3001282	Frankly, there just isn't the time or resources to deal with that crowd control nightmare.
1DI3001283	Tch. She apparently decided to pursue "more interesting projects" up north in the Commonwealth.
1DI3001284	The real reason is that she couldn't handle us Scribes "improving" upon her work. She's the kind of woman who needs to be in charge of EVERYTHING.
1DI3001285	Good luck to her out there in the Wasteland; it's a long walk to the Commonwealth. Can't say she'll be missed.
1DI3001286	Yeah, well, when you remember what it was you were going to ask. Take it up with one of the other Scribes, okay? Thanks.
1DI3001287	I don't think anyone really knows the answer to that. Seems to be going rather quickly though.
1DI3001288	You take a bottle, you dunk it under water, and glug glug glug, it fills up. Amazing.
1DI3001289	But you're right a machine would help. But all the Scribes are busy reverse engineering Enclave gear.
1DI3001290	A machine that puts water in bottles just isn't on anyone's priority list at the moment.
1DI3001291	Umm... because it's not irradiated. Really? You couldn't work that one out for yourself?
1DI3001292	<Sigh.>
1DI3001293	I started out in the Swords. I upped the output of a few Laser Rifles. Apparently some initiates couldn't handle the extra power. A few got hurt.
1DI3001294	Then I joined the Shields. Bowditch wasn't all that pleased with me proving him and his theories on forcefield resonance were a bit "antiquated."
1DI3001295	Then I found myself among the Quills. Jameson refuses to accept any fact that conflicts with her rose colored optimistic views.
1DI3001296	She likes to assign "contradictory" personalities to "field operations." Take for example myself here, or Yearling, exiled to that accursed library.
1DI3001297	I used to think Rothchild and I were on the same page. Turns out he's happy to blindly follow the old man's orders like the rest of them.
1DI3001299	I follow orders, but I'm not exactly a "yes man." I figure a Scribe's job is to find the devil in the details. Consequently I seldom get promoted.
1DI3001300	I think Elder Lyons finally had his fill of people questioning him.
1DI3001301	And while Scribe Rothchild and I usually see eye to eye on things... it's apparently time to set an example for those who ask too many questions.
1DI3001302	It's probably best if I don't answer that question.
1DI3001303	Yeah... that's a long story actually.
1DI3001304	What? Oh yes. I'm just a little tired. What was this about them running into trouble?
1DI3001305	Waylaid by Raiders. Or was it Mutants? They want additional "compensation" for losses and "unexpected expenditures."
1DI3001306	It's the goddamned Wasteland. What the hell did they expect?
1DI3001307	I don't know, sir. Should I tell them to go away?
1DI3001308	I wish. But no, I need them. They're some of the few that bothered to come back at all - a hardy bunch, this group.  Almost as good as our own men.
1DI3001309	I see. Well, what should I do with them? About their demands for compensation?
1DI3001310	Did anyone die?
1DI3001311	I don't think so, no.
1DI3001312	That's good. Some bottle caps then? How much is left in the petty cash box?
1DI3001313	They want plasma weapons.
1DI3001315	They saw an initiate lugging a crate to the armory.
1DI3001316	Fucking hell... ... Damn it.
1DI3001318	Those weapons were to go to Rivet City. But, whatever. A rifle, grenade or two. But only if they agree to take a shipment -immediately!- to Big Town.
1DI3001320	What kind of name is "Big Town" anyway?
1DI3001321	I don't know sir.
1DI3001322	Well go on. Don't keep our "guests" waiting any longer. I have work to do.
1DI3001324	Now, where the hell did I put that damn clipboard?
1DI3001325	And...?
1DI3001326	"And" what, sir?
1DI3001327	Were any of the messages important?
1DI3001328	I don't know, sir. I thought I should bring them straight to you.
1DI3001329	You didn't READ them?
1DI3001330	No sir, I - I ...
1DI3001331	Well, WHO are they from?
1DI3001332	I don't know sir, I - I thought...
1DI3001333	Can't you see I'm busy?!
1DI3001334	Sorry, sir.
1DI3001335	I'm up to my eyeballs!
1DI3001337	Invoices and clipboards with god-knows-what on them! And the maps, so many USELESS maps, drawn by children apparently.
1DI3001339	And requisition requests, is there anyone who DOESN'T want something from me?
1DI3001341	And... and the messages. Always with the messages!
1DI3001342	Sorry...
1DI3001343	Really?! Am I the only one who can do ANYTHING around here?
1DI3001344	Sorry sir. I can see you're busy. I'll leave you.
1DI3001345	You're right I'm busy!
1DI3001347	Wait. Just leave the messages. I'll deal with them later.
1DI3001349	Next time look them over first. I need you to be a filter for all the inconsequential crap that otherwise lands on my desk.
1DI3001351	Go now. Take a short break. Steal a few minutes for yourself. God knows we all deserve it.
1DI3001352	Yessir, thank you sir.
1DI3001353	Go on. Get out of here. Shoo!
1DI3001354	Oh? And how was your visit? Did Lyons treat you to tea and biscuits?
1DI3001355	He asked about that shipment again.
1DI3001356	And what did you tell our illustrious leader?
1DI3001357	I told him things were being taken care of, not to worry.
1DI3001358	And? How did he take that?
1DI3001359	The same way he took it the last ten times that he asked and I dodged the question.
1DI3001361	Sir, permission to speak freely?
1DI3001362	I don't have time for protocols and bullshit. Speak as freely as you like. Just speak quickly!
1DI3001363	I don't think he's going to stop asking. I think he suspects something.
1DI3001364	The man SHOULD be focused on fighting the Enclave. Or has he forgotten about THEM? So what if a few shipments of water go missing? Damn him.
1DI3001365	Sir...
1DI3001366	Don't worry. It's MY ass that's on the line.
1DI3001368	Well, go on. Leave me be.
1DI3001369	The man SHOULD be focused on picking up the pieces of the war. And questing for technology. So what if a few shipments of water go missing? Damn him.
1DI3001370	Indeed you have. Much improved.
1DI3001371	Thank you, sir.
1DI3001372	One small thing, though.
1DI3001374	Megaton is WEST of here.
1DI3001375	Sir, that's where I've drawn it.
1DI3001376	Is that so? Oh, my mistake. I must have been looking at it upside down.
1DI3001377	It's alright sir, I know you're probably exhausted.
1DI3001378	<Clears throat> Have you ever seen a map? North...  points... UP!
1DI3001379	Oh... sir, I - I, uh...
1DI3001380	Try again.
1DI3001381	Sorry sir.
1DI3001382	The Brotherhood only accepts the best and the brightest, don't they?
1DI3001384	Humanity is doomed.
1DI3001386	Something about a recent power outage. They blame us.
1DI3001387	Those ungrateful sons-of-bitches. I needed to temporarily -TEMP-O-RAR-ILY- divert power while we brought additional security systems online.
1DI3001388	Just thought you should know sir, about the delay.
1DI3001389	Yes of course. Thank you.
1DI3001390	I'll leave you be, sir.
1DI3001391	If only someone else wasn't in line right behind you. Well go on, then.
1DI3001392	Good luck Bigsley. We have faith in you.
1DI3001393	I wish I did. Now, get back to work.
1DI3001394	And how the hell is that MY problem?
1DI3001395	They're complaining we've "confiscated" all the medical supplies.
1DI3001396	Well, I need SOMETHING to pay the caravan drivers with. I ran out of cigarettes and booze last week.
1DI3001397	So what do I tell them?
1DI3001398	You mean, besides "Go soak your heads in the basin!"?
1DI3001400	Fine. Grab some meds from the supply, but tell them: "That's it." Put up railings or something.
1DI3001402	And hang a sign outside my door that reads: "Welcome to the Babysitters of Steel."
1DI3001403	That's funny sir.
1DI3001405	That's a shame.
1DI3001406	They're a week late, sir.
1DI3001407	Damnnit! I'm aware of that. I make the shipping schedules, don't I?
1DI3001408	Should we send out a search party?
1DI3001409	For a couple of Wasteland hustlers and a pack Brahmin?
1DI3001410	What about our men?
1DI3001411	I'm not wasting any more resources.
1DI3001413	If Lyons wants to chase after his deliveries, fine. Let HIM do it. But I'm done wasting resources and risking lives on this pet project of his.
1DI3001414	For what it's worth, you aren't the only one who feels that way.
1DI3001415	Thank you. Now, kindly get the hell out of here. I need to think.
1DI3001416	Excellent. Did anyone die?
1DI3001417	No sir.
1DI3001418	Even better. Pay them and send them out again.
1DI3001420	Wonderful. Put them on my desk.
1DI3001421	Anywhere in particular, sir?
1DI3001422	Look for the folder labeled: "I don't GIVE a damn."
1DI3001423	Right. Sorry sir.
1DI3001425	Excellent. I'm glad I don't have to oversee that anymore.
1DI3001426	You're welcome sir.
1DI3001427	I'm glad something is going right for a change.
1DI3001432	What is it now?!
1DI3001434	It can wait. I'll try again later.
1DI3001435	Whoa... okay, I'll be back later on then.
1DI3001436	I'll try again some other time.
1DI3001437	Oh-Kay... I'll swing by another time.
1DI3001438	I literally can't remember the last time I got sleep... I must have dozed off recently though, if the drool on my desk is any indication. <Sigh.>
1DI3001440	Excuse me, I'm Bigsley. And I'm just a tad stressed out. Perhaps you saw that little line outside my door?
1DI3001441	Oh, I'm sorry. Was I being rude just now? Maybe I should congratulate you on getting through the door.
1DI3001442	After all, you did have to trip over that never-ending line of people waiting to get in here.
1DI3001443	I'm Scribe Bigsley. And I'm more than a little busy.
1DI3001444	If you want to play make believe, fine. Go right ahead. I've got real problems in the real world to deal with.
1DI3001445	Everybody's got something for good ol' Bigsley to do. So, if you're done wasting my time...
1DI3001446	Everyone was so excited about that Purifier: "Project Purity this," and "Project Purity that."
1DI3001447	But did anyone stop to ask,  "Hey, what are we going to DO with all that clean water?" Well, guess who gets to fill in that tiny detail.
1DI3001448	It'd be one thing if I had support, but that little war with the Enclave has depleted much of the Brotherhood's resources.
1DI3001449	And to top it off, I have to be mommy to a bunch of lab coats.
1DI3001450	Right. I heard about your dad. Sorry kid. I don't mean to sound unsympathetic, really. But, if you understood the pressure...
1DI3001451	You know the Wasteland. Imagine trying to get fresh water to every known settlement, without getting it stolen by Raiders or Mutants.
1DI3001452	Now imagine doing that without any trained soldiers or military resources because they've all been exhausted fighting a little war with the Enclave.
1DI3001453	Yeah. That's MY job. Not to mention the mountain of crap I get from all the lab coats running around underfoot.
1DI3001454	Really? Well, there's plenty of things I need help with.
1DI3001455	But most of it's pushing papers and knocking sense into giant egg heads. A task for any acolyte, really...
1DI3001456	I'm sure I could put your experience and talents to far better use.
1DI3001457	The Brotherhood didn't always work for free either.
1DI3001458	I can respect a man who earns his keep.
1DI3001459	Your reputation proceeds you, so we won't need to conduct an interview. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
1DI3001460	Yeah. Whatever. Now leave me alone. I need to think.
1DI3001461	Well, I've got Rivet City water caravans needing help with some "unusually organized" bandits. Need someone to go investigate what that's all about.
1DI3001462	And then there's Megaton. They want more Aqua Pura. I JUST sent a shipment to them. Need someone to go visit Megaton and see what their problem is.
1DI3001464	Hmmm... Well, I have two jobs actually.
1DI3001465	First off, Rivet City's water caravans keep getting waylaid. I'm beginning to suspect something organized is going on. Need someone to investigate.
1DI3001466	And then there's Megaton. Begging for more Aqua Pura. I JUST sent them a shipment. Need someone to head over there and see what's going on.
1DI3001467	Rivet City's water caravans keep getting waylaid. I'm beginning to suspect something organized is going on. Need someone to investigate.
1DI3001468	At first it was a win-win. They paid us and shared their technology with us. The spoils of their war with the Enclave were particularly enticing.
1DI3001469	However, with all the recent attacks, the "extra" resources end up being used just protecting the caravans from being exterminated.
1DI3001470	You'd think that'd be the smart thing, right? Then the caravan drivers could use the markup to simply pay for their own security. Wouldn't need us.
1DI3001471	Maybe it's an indirect marketing campaign for the Brotherhood. Considering the war with the Enclave, they might need new recruits.
1DI3001472	Whatever the case, as long as they keep paying us in caps and tech, we'll keep escorting the water.
1DI3001473	I'm a very busy man. I only have time for people who have time for me.
1DI3001474	Really? That's great. I'm sorry I can't offer you any support in this. All our resources are tied up at the moment. Good luck.
1DI3001475	Oh, and of course I'll have a little something for your efforts if you're successful. Stay safe out there.
1DI3001476	Of course you'll be paid. Most of our assets have been exhausted by war with the Enclave. But I'm a resourceful fellow. Don't you worry about that.
1DI3001477	Get Megaton straightened out, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed by my, or rather, the Brotherhood's generosity.
1DI3001478	I'm starting to lose my patience with you. If you aren't here to help, then please: leave.
1DI3001479	Great! Hopefully you can get them straightened out. We really can't do this without them.
1DI3001480	Yes. Yes. Of course you'll be paid. Go see what she needs, lend a hand, take care of whatever their problem is, and you'll have your reward.
1DI3001481	Many of us keep asking that same question. The Brotherhood isn't a postal service.
1DI3001482	We have IMPORTANT things to do, and we need caps and technology to do it!
1DI3001483	Lyons is on some kind of mission. Has he forgotten about the Enclave? That's our priority...
1DI3001484	But yeah. Things are being done to "offset" the cost of Lyons' little pet "Purity" project.
1DI3001487	Lyons is on some kind of mission...
1DI3001489	I don't know yet. Some kind of virus that attacks the body on a cellular level. I've never seen anything like it.
1DI3001490	It's strange, because Ghouls are immune to almost any known disease.
1DI3001491	Neither did I. Doctor Barrows is working on it, but it doesn't look good. They're getting worse by the day.
1DI3001492	There's something going around, all right, but it isn't anything I've ever seen before. Definitely not contagious.
1DI3001493	Maybe something in the water, but that seems unlikely since I've tested it and this is the cleanest water we've ever had.
1DI3001494	Be damned ironic if we were so used to the crap we've been drinking that actual pure water was killing us.
1DI3001495	I have no idea how to help these people and it's really taken the shine off my normally sunny disposition.
1DI3001496	So unless you have an actual medical problem, maybe you could stop distracting me from my work.
1DI3001497	Oh no... I'm fairly certain it's not contagious. Though, we are burning the bodies of the deceased, just in case...
1DI3001498	I just wish I knew how to treat these people. It's like their immune system is killing them. I don't know what to do about it!
1DI3001500	Save yourselves!
1DI3001511	If that's how you want to do this, fine. But be quick about it.
1DI3001512	Great, then get him in there. We don't have time to waste.
1DI3001513	If that'll work, then great. But we have to do this quickly.
1DI3001625	But that's all right. With a few modifications, our own armor will more than handle anything they throw at it.
1DI3001640	Really? Thank you. You're the first person willing to actually give me any of that.
1DI3001641	Thank you... I'm starting to think Aqua Pura is even better than normal purified water.
1DI3001645	I wonder if you might be willing to aid us a bit further.
1DI3001646	While we've had a decisive victory, the Enclave threat hasn't been removed yet.
1DI3001647	Uhhhh... What? That doohickey on your wrist says the water's irradiated? That's a pretty fancy device if it can know something like that...
1DI3001648	But, clearly it's, ah, misinformed. You should get that fixed, because it's definitely giving you false information.
1DI3001649	I already told you, your Pipsqueek 2000 or whatever it's called is broken. There's nothing wrong with the water.
1DI3001655	By all means, I'd love to answer some questions. I've got nothing better to do.
1DI3001656	Sure. It's not like I'm going to be able to get much done today anyway. Ask away.
1DI3001660	All right. But sit down and shut up. All your bouncing around is making me nervous.
1DI3001661	Good. I was tired of your yapping.
1DI3001663	Logging out. Have a good day.
1DI3001664	This is it... let's make this one count.
1DI3001665	We're all with you. Stay safe.
1DI3001667	Please be careful. I would hate to lose you again.
1DI3001668	Get that data!
1DI3001671	I'll be waiting for that Tesla coil, if you can find one.
1DI3001672	Good luck, and please be careful.
1DI3001673	Catch you around!
1DI3001674	Good. I could use a moment to myself.
1DI3001675	I won't stop you.
1DI3001676	I think I might just close my eyes for a moment or two.
1DI3001677	If I'm lucky, I might be able to get some work done.
1DI3001678	Have a nice day... or is it nighttime? Can't tell. Think they put me in an office without windows on purpose.
1DI3001679	Okay. Hopefully that's the last distraction for awhile.
1DI3001680	You're telling ME that?
1DI3001681	Tell me something I don't know.
1DI3001683	You're preaching to the choir.
1DI3001685	I hope I get reassigned soon.
1DI3001686	Think I might just not show up tomorrow. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? I get fired?
1DI3001687	I'm tired of this. I miss the Citadel.
1DI3001688	No kidding.
1DI3001689	Yeah, sure. Whatever.
1DI3001690	Come back before supplies run out!
1DI3001691	Remember: Aqua Cura, it's simply AMAZING!
1DI3001693	May Atom's Light guide you.
1DI3001694	Thank you for choosing wisdom over violence.
1DI3001695	May you know Eternal Light.
1DI3001698	Yeah, I hear ya.
1DI3001699	Got it. Thanks.
1DI3001700	Until we meet again. Do take care.
1DI3001701	Goodbye. Please come back if you find anything interesting.
1DI3001702	Don't be a stranger around here... you better come back and visit the Citadel once in a while!
1DI3001703	All right, we'll see you later. Keep your eyes peeled for Muties.
1DI3001704	Always a pleasure to have you around...
1DI3001705	It was nice meeting you, but I have to get while the getting's good. Maybe I'll see you around.
1DI3001711	Come on, boys! Let's get 'em!
1DI3001717	Backstabbed us and sold us out, did ya?
1DI3001719	Backstabbed us and pocketed the money yourself, did ya?
1DI3001721	What? We thought you died or something. You haven't been around in so long... we divvied up your cut already.
1DI3001722	Ah, sorry 'bout that. We'll start holding your cut for you again. But you got to come see us at least once a month. Or we'll assume your dead.
1DI3001723	You're here for your cut?
1DI3001724	Here ya go. Don't spend it all in one place.
1DI3001725	It ain't time to cut you in yet. We're still collecting the caps. Come back in a few days.
1DI3001726	I warned you not to come around. I will not be extorted.
1DI3001727	<Cough.>
1DI3001728	Aaaaggghhh.
1DI3001729	It hurts... burns... inside... all over...
1DI3001730	I can't... breathe... right... my chest... huuuuurts.
1DI3001731	What's happening... to me. <Cough.>
1DI3001732	Doc Barrows says I'm crazy, but I think it's that damn Aqua Cura making everybody sick. Myself, I ain't touching the stuff again.
1DI3001733	You may want to clear out of Megaton if you can. Lots of folks in town are sick, and nobody knows what's causing it.
1DI3001734	If you're going to have him start the purifier, hurry up.
1DI3001735	This better work...
1DI3001741	Get that airlock cycled, soldier, before we're all blown to kingdom come!
1DI3001742	So this is it? You just quit, give up on Uncle Sam and America? You make me puke.
1DI3001743	This is where the hard decisions are made, soldier. Where history is written.
1DI3001744	If you don't cycle the airlock, I can't start the purifier.
1DI3001745	This is an unpleasant situation to find ourselves in.
1DI3001746	I find your refusal to act to be in conflict with my sense of self-preservation.
1DI3001747	Hurry and cycle the airlock, so I can start the purifier!
1DI3001748	This is a dire predicament. What shall we do?
1DI3001749	Don't you think someone should start the purifier, after coming all this way? Letting ourselves be blown up seems... Irrational.
1DI3001750	I suppose this is goodbye, friend.
1DI3001751	This appears to be the point where we part ways.
1DI3001752	You've got a job to do, soldier. No time for chit-chat!
1DI3001753	This access point is no longer accessible. Have a good day.
1DI3001754	This access point is now locked. Have a good day.
1DI3001755	Any last minute questions?
1DI3001756	How may I assist you today, Senator?
1DI3001757	Scanning potential intruder... Senate Identification detected. Unlocking access point and logging identity in mainframe.
1DI3001761	Welcome back, Senator. How may I assist you today?
1DI3001762	Welcome back. How may I assist you today?
1DI3001763	Warning, due to a major security breach, this system is on code red alert status. Prepare for security check.
1DI3001764	Attempting to identify local access user... Identification failed.
1DI3001765	This access point is restricted only to authorized personnel. Please identify yourself.
1DI3001766	What the hell? The whole place... it's... it's gone!
1DI3001767	It was you... you did this! You goddamn murderer! You've killed them all!
1DI3001768	Kill this traitor! Kill him!
1DI3001769	When I first met you some time ago, I was leery of your motivations and even more concerned with your methods.
1DI3001770	At the battle for Project Purity, you proved yourself... and any doubt that I had about you dissipated on that day.
1DI3001771	Now, with the Enclave in ruins and with you to thank for it, I'm almost at a complete loss for words.
1DI3001772	I feel proud to call you one of our own, and I promise that what you've done here today will be recorded by our scribes as a historic moment.
1DI3001773	On behalf of the Brotherhood of Steel and on behalf of the free people of this Wasteland, I thank you.
1DI3001774	Come on, soldier. Move like you've got a purpose and get aboard!
1DI3001775	Move, move. Get on the Vertibird!
1DI3001776	Surprised to see me?
1DI3001777	Hey, you're awake! All right! Paladin Tristan is just inside. He's waiting for you.
1DI3001778	Head on in. Tristan is waiting for you.
1DI3001779	I'm sorry, I'm very busy right now. Far too much to analyze. Perhaps one of the other Scribes could help you?
1DI3001780	Please, speak with Elder Lyons. I have enough to deal with right now.
1DI3001781	Well, well. Look who's back amongst the living.
1DI3001782	Some of us were starting to wonder if you and Sarah were going to pull through.
1DI3001784	Didn't expect to see you. After dragging your ass back to the Citadel, I thought you might be comatose forever.
1DI3001785	Kind of surprising that you managed to survive, but with all her training, Sarah didn't.
1DI3001786	Tell me you've got something, anything we can use.
1DI3001787	Unless you've got something, get inside there and get me some information! We need to know what the hell they just pulled on us!
1DI3001788	We need to find out what the hell just happened.
1DI3001789	There's no time to talk - get your ass inside that base, and help the troops locate the source of their transmission. Now solider, NOW!
1DI3001790	What the hell...
1DI3001791	I trust you've spoken with Rothchild? I hope he can make some headway with the data you recovered.
1DI3001792	With our primary weapon destroyed, we risk losing our momentum and jeopardizing the entire campaign.
1DI3001793	I must admit, I now wonder whether moving ahead with this operation was an error in judgment.
1DI3001794	Paladin Tristan sent word that you'd be returning with something useful for us. Please, find Scribe Rothchild before you do anything else.
1DI3001795	I'd hoped that you would be off assisting Paladin Tristan. What do you need?
1DI3001796	If you haven't yet done so, please see Rothchild soon.
1DI3001797	Careful now, careful. Don't move too quickly. Everything's fine. You're safe... You're in the Citadel.
1DI3001798	I was starting to think you might never wake up, despite assurances to the contrary.
1DI3001799	I've been coming down here every day to see both you and my daughter. It's good that at least one of you has recovered.
1DI3001800	Easy now, take it slow. Don't move too quickly. It's all right, you're in the Citadel now. Relax.
1DI3001802	It's good to see you on your feet again.
1DI3001803	Good to see you. We can use all the help we can get.
1DI3001804	Glad to see you're back on your feet.
1DI3001805	Let's hope this goes as smoothly as the last few operations.
1DI3001806	Don't worry. Tristan's done a great job so far.
1DI3001807	Okay, let's keep this tin can rolling. Fire support, people! Stay on it!
1DI3001808	Keep your eyes on the robot! Take out anything it doesn't!
1DI3001809	Prime will do most of the heavy work. Just don't get in his way.
1DI3001810	Let's hope whatever the hell that is, it's actually useful.
1DI3001811	The Scribes need to see what you've got. Get back to the Citadel.
1DI3001812	Get that data back to the Citadel now!
1DI3001813	Don't interrupt my flow here. Just pay attention.
1DI3001814	I just... I can't believe it. All those years of work. All of it, for what? One botched operation?
1DI3001815	I'm still waiting on the debriefing from Tristan, but I'm not sure it even matters. With Prime gone...
1DI3001816	I'm gonna burn every one of these devil-headed bastards to the ground for what they did to Liberty Prime!
1DI3001817	You just find something we can use. I'll take care of the rest.
1DI3001818	They knew we were coming.... How did they know we were coming?
1DI3001819	You see anything? There's got to be something in here we can take back to the Citadel.
1DI3001820	We've got to find out what they just attacked us with. Keep your eyes peeled.
1DI3001821	Watch yourself in here. Who knows what they're gonna throw at us next.
1DI3001822	Right in front of the map, if you please. I'd like you to get a good look at it.
1DI3001823	Well, it's good to see that you're on your feet again.
1DI3001824	I assume Lyons is immediately throwing you to the wolves?
1DI3001825	Has he told you what's been going on while you've been resting?
1DI3001826	If there's anything else you'd like to know, I'll tell you what I can. Otherwise, Paladin Tristan will be waiting.
1DI3001827	I'll alert him that you're on your way.
1DI3001828	Hey, it's you!
1DI3001829	Paladin Tristan is just inside. You should report to him right away; he's been waiting for you.
1DI3001830	I hope you're ready for your next assignment.
1DI3001831	You found a Tesla Coil?
1DI3001832	Excellent. I'll see to it that this reaches the scribes immediately.
1DI3001833	You've done good work, soldier.
1DI3001834	Are you ready for your next assignment? We don't have time to spare.
1DI3001835	If we're going to have any chance of taking down their vertibirds, we need a Tesla Coil. Report back immediately if you locate one.
1DI3001836	Nice work back there. Let's hope the scribes can do something useful with the information you retrieved.
1DI3001837	Unfortunately, we don't have time to sit around and wait for the analysis.
1DI3001838	Based on what I've seen of you so far, there's an assignment I believe you're well suited for.
1DI3001839	In the interest of time, we'll skip the congratulations and get to work.
1DI3001840	You've gotten yourself through some pretty rough spots before, and I'm hoping you can do it again.
1DI3001841	I requested you specifically for this assignment. I think you're well suited for it, and I need someone I can count on.
1DI3001843	Hey, talk to Wint, okay? I'm just following his lead.
1DI3001844	I'm not even supposed to be here! Just talk to Wint.
1DI3001845	I just want to get out of here. You feel like chatting, you talk to Wint.
1DI3001847	How the hell'd you get in here, smoothskin?
1DI3001848	See you around, kid.
1DI3001849	I hope the scrambler is useful for you. If not, I hope you can run very, very fast.
1DI3001850	I'm still very, very busy. Is this important, or can it wait?
1DI3001851	Got to hand it to you kid. That was a brave thing you did, risking your life to start the Purifier.
1DI3001852	But, do you know you've made my life a living hell? I'm guessing not.
1DI3001853	The hero of the Wasteland probably has more important things to worry about.  Don't you?
1DI3001854	Can't say I blame you kid-o. I wouldn't have risked it either. That Sarah on the other hand, she's got a bleeding heart like her old man.
1DI3001855	Oh, and bravo for giving her that code to the Purifer. Since then, my life's been a living hell.
1DI3001856	And I have YOU to thank for that.
1DI3001857	Did Lyons give you a little congratulatory speech? Then, you won't mind if I don't offer you one.
1DI3001858	Thanks to you and that little friend of yours cranking up the Purifier, my life's become a living hell.
1DI3001859	But the heroes of the Wasteland probably don't care about THAT.
1DI3001861	Thanks to you helping get the Purifier up and running, my life's become a living hell.
1DI3001862	But you probably don't care about THAT.
1DI3001863	Look, kid. I really don't have time for your games. If you're here to help, great. If not, then I really need you to find someone else to pester.
1DI3001864	What?! I've got a bagillion things to deal with at the moment, and wasting my time with you is not one of them.
1DI3001866	There isn't someone else you could bother?
1DI3001869	Don't bother Bigsley. He's not having a very good day.
1DI3001871	If it's not one thing, it's another. Well, got to run.
1DI3001872	This water delivery business is a complex affair.
1DI3001873	So much to do, so little time to do it.
1DI3001874	No use talking to me. No use talking to the boss either. Oh well. Guess you're out of luck.
1DI3001875	I'm so glad I got drafted to be part of Lyons' little Water Delivery Team. No really, I can't tell you what a wonderful opportunity this all is.
1DI3001876	I'd stay away from the boss. He's in one of his moods again.
1DI3001877	Hey, good to see you! I heard you had a bit of a problem getting the purifier started... Sorry about that. We're looking into exactly what happened.
1DI3001878	Anyway, it's great to see you on your feet again. We wouldn't be here now without you!
1DI3001879	If there's anything you need, just let me know.
1DI3001880	Just can't stay away, can you?
1DI3001881	Well, I guess it's good you're not dead. And I guess I should say thanks for getting us running.
1DI3001882	Look, I'm busy. Can we do this some other time?
1DI3001883	Sorry, can't stop to chat.
1DI3001884	Since Dr. Li left, we've all had so much more to do. Who knew she did so much?!
1DI3001885	I wish those Scribes would leave us alone. They just get in the way.
1DI3001886	Bigsley's making this more complicated than it needs to be.
1DI3001887	So much to do... so much to do...
1DI3001888	A yup. We'll get on outa here soon as we're done drinking up this free booze. Driving water is dangerous. Want to get liquored up first. Ahaha.
1DI3001889	Can't beat free booze. I was gonna drive my Brahmin up that way anyway. That Rivet City chick's giving me an escort to boot!
1DI3001890	Heard more than a few of these water caravans go missing.
1DI3001891	Once we exhaust this supply of free beer, then we'll get going.
1DI3001892	Hope those security guards know what they're doing. The last group to leave here seemed a little young to be guarding anything.
1DI3001893	Sit down. Grab a beer. It's free!
1DI3001894	They came out of nowhere. I need to get back to report to Lepelletier. She'll want to know what happened. Thanks for the help!
1DI3001897	Quit wasting my time. If you're here to help with the caravan, great. Otherwise, get out of here before I have you arrested.
1DI3001898	I'm not interested in playing games with you. So unless you're here to offer a hand: GO - A - WAY!
1DI3001899	Look buddy, I'm a very busy woman. I don't have time for your bullshit. I'm busy coordinating a military operation here. So if you don't mind?
1DI3001900	Look missy, I'm a very busy woman. I don't have time for your bullshit. I'm busy coordinating a military operation here. So if you don't mind?
1DI3001901	If you're here looking for water, I'm afraid I can't help you.
1DI3001902	All the water is at Project Purity. If you want a hand out, head over to the Jefferson Memorial and ask for Scribe Bigsley.
1DI3001903	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm busy coordinating military operations.
1DI3001904	I have nothing to give you. Go speak with Bigsley at Project Purity if you need a reward.
1DI3001905	Well, did you take care of whoever's behind the attacks on the caravans?
1DI3001906	Well, did you find out who's behind the attacks on the caravans?
1DI3001907	Shouldn't you be out there, dealing with the attacks on the caravans?
1DI3001908	Damnit, I'm too pissed to talk now. Got to blow off some steam.
1DI3001909	Damnit boy! Like I told you, just one rule: "Do what the hell I say." We're a gang. We all wear Metal Armor. So put it on already.
1DI3001910	Damnit girl! Like I told you, just one rule: "Do what the hell I say." We're a gang. We all wear Metal Armor. So put it on already.
1DI3001911	What is it? Take a seat and relax already. You're making me nervous.
1DI3001912	You're one of the new recruits, eh? And look at that. Already wearing the gang uniform.
1DI3001913	You best know the pass phrase though, or you're dead.
1DI3001915	Killed the boss fair an' square. Good job kid. Normally that'd make you the new boss, but we're all tired of bosses.
1DI3001916	But, we liked Split Jack's plan. So if you can get that bitch at Rivet City to buy into our "protection services" we'll split the take with ya.
1DI3001917	So we don't need ya to be our leader. But we will cut you in on the protection racket. IF you can get Lepelletier to sign on.
1DI3001918	We got nothing to talk about until you've gotten Lepelletier to give us the protection contract. Now, git!
1DI3001919	Another new recruit? Quit bothering me. Talk to the boss. Split Jack.
1DI3001921	If you're looking for Davis and Lorin, they're already on their way north. Follow the River from Project Purity.
1DI3001922	I don't have your money yet. Once a week, remember?
1DI3001923	Come back in a few days.
1DI3001924	Oh, I hadn't seen you in so long. I thought you died. Um... I stopped setting aside money for you... um, here. Take this. It's all I have to spare.
1DI3001925	Now get out of here before my customers take notice.
1DI3001926	You're really going to blackmail me? <sigh>
1DI3001927	Here. Take it. I'll see you next week. Now get out of here before my customers notice what's going on.
1DI3001928	Is it that time already? Fine. Here's your money.
1DI3001929	Now get out of here. I'm trying to earn some money.
1DI3001930	I believe our business is concluded, friend.
1DI3001931	See here folks: another happy customer. A great day to you, too, sir! Thank you for stopping by!
1DI3001933	See here folks: another happy customer. A great day to you, too, ma'am! Thank you for stopping by!
1DI3001934	Well, hello there Smoothskin! Step right up. Have you come to savor the great taste of the Amazing Aqua Cura?
1DI3001935	Did you manage to scrounge up the 10 caps? It's a small price indeed for the Amazing Aqua Cura!
1DI3001936	Welcome back! I trust you've changed your mind and have come for your very own bottle of the Amazing Aqua Cura?
1DI3001937	Ah, I hope there's nothing wrong with your Aqua Cura. Remember, all sales are final... um, now how can I help you, dear returning customer of mine?
1DI3001939	He lied to us.
1DI3001940	He got exactly what he deserved.
1DI3001941	Can't sucker anyone else now, can he?
1DI3001942	I believed his lies... but now he's dead.
1DI3001944	I don't know what to say.
1DI3001945	Little busy at the moment, smoothskin.
1DI3001947	I'm sorry, but I'm busy, okay?
1DI3001948	What should I do? He asked for water, and I thought I was helping him, not killing him!
1DI3001949	I can't handle this. Just leave me alone.
1DI3001950	Look, I didn't mean to kill him, okay?
1DI3001951	Walk in Atom's Holy Glow.
1DI3001952	Weary traveler, welcome to the monastery of the Apostles of the Eternal Light.
1DI3001953	Oh, but you must be parched from your travels! Please, accept this gift: holy water, blessed by our order.
1DI3001954	We must drink deep of the Water of Light, so that it may sanctify our tongues, and render us purified for discourse!
1DI3001955	Ah, I can see the glint of Atom's Light in your eyes! You have purified your tongue with the holy water, so now we may speak.
1DI3001956	How may this servant of the Eternal Light serve you?
1DI3001957	You must cleanse your tongue of unseemly speech by drinking deep of the holy water. Then we may speak.
1DI3001958	Cleanse your tongue with the holy water. For we must speak with seemly tongues when we make mention of Atom's Light.
1DI3001959	May Atom light your path, traveler.
1DI3001960	Welcome to our monastery.
1DI3001961	Oh, my! I wasn't expecting a pilgrim to our shrine! We're hardly prepared for casual visitors, I'm afraid.
1DI3001962	You must have made quite an impression on Brother Gerard. He's a lovely boy, but rather strident. I hope he wasn't a bother.
1DI3001963	But where are my manners? I'm Mother Curie the Third, and I lead the Apostles of the Eternal Light. What can I do for you, my dear?
1DI3001964	Oh, my! I wasn't expecting a pilgrim to our shrine! We're hardly prepared for visitors, I'm afraid.
1DI3001965	And you didn't come here with peaceful intentions, did you? Oh, poor Brother Gerard. He was rather too strident, but he deserved better than that.
1DI3001966	But that's no excuse for rudeness, now is it? I'm Mother Curie the Third, and I lead the Apostles of the Eternal Light. Why have you come to us?
1DI3001967	My Lord. I can not bear to look upon your shining face... I am unworthy...
1DI3001968	We will spread our word without this holy water. The Light of Atom need not be spread through deceit.
1DI3001969	Yes, my child?
1DI3001970	Do you have something you wish to say?
1DI3001971	Our veins flow with Atom's Eternal Glow.
1DI3001973	<sniffing>
1DI3001974	Grrrrrloooow
1DI3001976	Arrrr-taaahm.
1DI3001977	Are you well, dear?
1DI3001978	The water she gave me... it... there's something... wrong...
1DI3001979	Arrrggghhhh!
1DI3001980	We came to Megaton to preach of the Eternal Glow...
1DI3001981	I saw Atom's Holy Light. I TOUCHED Atom himself! I felt his warm embrace!
1DI3001982	Mother Curie she... she changed... I changed, too, but I'm still myself. Poor Mother Curie... she saw the face of Atom and it drove her mad.
1DI3001983	I don't know what to do! I think I'll stay here; pray to Atom. Pray for his guidance, for he has made me of the Eternal. The undying. I am his now.
1DI3001984	I have been created anew by Atom's transmuting fire.
1DI3001985	I must stay here. Pray and think. Think and pray. It will come to me. What must be done. Soon Atom will reveal his plan to me. Yes. Yes. Yeeeees!
1DI3001986	Atom in my head. Atom in my heart. Atom is in all things. Atom is all things. Atom... Atom... Atom...
1DI3001987	Any progress on the Megaton situation?
1DI3001988	Have you heard about that new cult? They took our water! Here, read this. It's one of their pamphlets.
1DI3001989	Ah yes, is there something you wished to discuss?
1DI3001990	Ha! I told those bastards you could do it!
1DI3001991	Oh, there were doubters inside the Citadel to be certain, but Lyons was behind you all the way and that was good enough for me.
1DI3001992	I can't think of a better compliment but to simply say the Brotherhood would be almost nothing without you.
1DI3001993	Thank you, from all of us.
1DI3001994	Something else on your mind?
1DI3001995	When I first saw you long ago in that alley in Chevy Chase, I thought you were just some trashy Wastelander. I'm glad I was wrong.
1DI3001996	My father thinks the world of you... and so do I. If things were different, maybe we could have had time to become friends...
1DI3001997	Anyway... I wish you the best of luck and I hope you stick around for a while. We need people like you to help us finish what we've started here!
1DI3001998	Hey there. What did you need?
1DI3001999	Well, I suppose we have you to thank for the sudden influx of equipment pouring in from the ruins you left behind at Adams Air Force Base.
1DI3002000	These items will help keep us one step ahead of our enemies in the Wasteland and hopefully start my reconstruction effort.
1DI3002001	Mark my words, Prime will walk again. It may take months or even years, but we'll get him back together.
1DI3002002	If you're inclined to help us with that effort, just let me know.
1DI3002003	Yes? I'm quite busy, so please be brief.
1DI3002004	You did it! You actually did it!
1DI3002005	Do you have any idea how famous you're gonna be? You're being inscribed in all of our records as, well... as a hero!
1DI3002006	Hey, if there's anything you ever need, I'm your gal!
1DI3002007	Hey! What's up?
1DI3002009	It's pretty busy down here right now, but I'll help if I can.
1DI3002012	Can I be of assistance?
1DI3002013	If there's anything I can do to help, please just say so.
1DI3002016	Things are as busy as ever. What do you need?
1DI3002017	This really isn't the best time... Did you need something?
1DI3002018	Oh man, don't hurt me! I just work here!
1DI3002019	Oh, hey. You're back. Do you need anything else?
1DI3002020	Please pardon our dust; we are currently experiencing maintenance issues within the Presidential Metro system.
1DI3002021	If you require event information or directions, please speak to an information kiosk officer.
1DI3002022	If you have any questions regarding the Presidential Metro, please speak to an information kiosk officer.
1DI3002023	Move along please.
1DI3002024	Please note that the use of firearms within this facility is a direct violation of 17 federal laws. Have a good day.
1DI3002025	Please continue along. If you have any questions, seek an information kiosk officer at any one of the stations.
1DI3002026	Interfering with a Presidential Metro Automated Unit is a crime. Please move along.
1DI3002027	Have a good day, and thank you for riding the Presidential Metro.
1DI3002038	You can get all the water you want for free. The Brotherhood's giving it away at the Purifier. Hadn't you heard?
1DI3002039	Look, bud, this water's for Rivet City. Go get your own from the Purifier if you want some.
1DI3002040	Back off. I'm not looking for any trouble.
1DI3002041	The purified water's killing all the mirelurks living in the Basin.
1DI3002042	Lucky me, I get to pull out the floaters and roast them.
1DI3002043	You may want to stand back, unless you've got a strong stomach.
1DI3002044	I gotta finish burning these floaters before they foul up the water.
1DI3002045	Funny how the purified water is actually killing them.
1DI3002046	I never realized how many of these things were living down there.
1DI3002047	Hey, feel free to take a shot at any lurks you see in the Basin.
1DI3002048	They're all dying -- don't like the clean water, I guess.
1DI3002049	Easier to just pop 'em in the head. Otherwise they die on the bottom and don't float up until they're good and ripe.
1DI3002050	Not the most exciting job I ever had, but you gotta admit, it beats pulling the floaters out of the Basin. Ha ha ha.
1DI3002051	Let me know if you see any live ones.
1DI3002053	Can you believe these Brotherhood assholes? They won't give us enough water to last until the next shipment!
1DI3002054	We're not going to let them leave with that water though. We need it.
1DI3002055	What are they going to do, anyway? Kill us for stealing some free water?
1DI3002056	Whew! I didn't think they'd just open up on us like that. Trigger happy bastards!
1DI3002057	Shit, if the Citadel hears about this... we gotta clean up this mess before word gets around...
1DI3002058	I'm kinda busy here, alright?
1DI3002059	Don't you realize by now, you'll get nothing from me, you damn dirty merc!
1DI3002060	Wait a minute... who are you? Hey, help me out of here! These Talon apes nabbed me while I was scouting the place.
1DI3002061	I could probably free myself in a few more minutes, but why don't you save me the trouble and just let me loose?
1DI3002062	Thanks, friend. But I've still got work to do.
1DI3002063	Now that's what I call a good day's work.
1DI3002064	Talon Company's been ambushing our water caravans. I guess they thought we wouldn't figure out who was doing it.
1DI3002065	As soon as Paladin Jensen gets back from scouting the base, we're going to level the place. Kill every last one of those scumbag mercs.
1DI3002066	Talon Company's going to be sorry they messed with the Brotherhood. Now what the hell is taking Jensen so long?
1DI3002067	Come on, it's gonna be fun.
1DI3002068	I think there's still some more Talon boys hiding around here.
1DI3002069	See if Talon Company messes with the Brotherhood again.
1DI3002070	This is what happens to people who fuck with the Brotherhood.
1DI3002071	Damn slavers! Just what we need, another pissed off gang of wasters gunning for our water.
1DI3002072	We've taken over some of the water caravans from the Brotherhood. I thought we could handle it, but ... we'll be lucky to make it back alive.
1DI3002073	I just want to get back to Rivet City without getting my head blown off.
1DI3002074	Are you going our way? We sure could use some extra firepower.
1DI3002075	I gotta find a less dangerous line of work, like Yao Guai wrangling.
1DI3002076	I'm going to kill Lepelletier if I ever get back to Rivet City alive. This is a damn suicide mission!
1DI3002077	We're all going to die. They all want to kill us. It's hopeless, you understand? Hopeless!
1DI3002078	Why the hell did I ever sign up for caravan duty?
1DI3002079	Sorry, we don't need whatever you're selling. This caravan is on a tight schedule.
1DI3002080	We're running water caravans for the Brotherhood, hadn't you heard? Rivet City is bringing water to the Wasteland!
1DI3002081	The water's not for sale. All spoken for already. Don't mess with us if you know what's good for you.
1DI3002082	I've got nothing to say to wastelander scum like you.
1DI3002108	Everything's above board.
1DI3002109	We're all clear here.
1DI3002111	This is our water now, asshole. Back off or else.
1DI3002115	Stay away from me! I don't want whatever you smoothskins are infecting us with!
1DI3002116	The one advantage of being a Ghoul was never getting sick. I guess they've taken that away from us too.
1DI3002117	Have you seen the Chop Shop? Full of sick Ghouls... I wonder who's next?
1DI3002118	No offense, but I don't want whatever's going around. So just keep your distance, okay?
1DI3002119	I thought things were finally starting to get better around here. But now everyone's getting sick and nobody knows what to do.
1DI3002120	You better stay away from me. I think I may be sick. It's like a... burning in my guts. Damn, it hurts!
1DI3002121	If you feel you're getting sick, quarantine yourself at the clinic, immediately.
1DI3002122	Water...
1DI3002123	Atom light your path, friend.
1DI3002124	May the Light be your beacon.
1DI3002125	Rest in the Glow, friend.
1DI3002131	Be at peace, dear.
1DI3002132	Strive for the Eternal Light.
1DI3002133	May Atom be with you, always.
1DI3002134	Let's do this just like the last time. Nobody needs to try and prove anything out there.
1DI3002135	Everybody goes home after this, you understand? I don't want any screw-ups out there.
1DI3002136	Everything should be in place by now. Even if they know we're coming, it won't matter.
1DI3002138	I was wondering when you'd show up.
1DI3002139	Just when I thought I had a moment to think.
1DI3002145	Ahem.
1DI3002146	Whew. Long day.
1DI3002147	The boss is in one of his moods again.
1DI3002148	Think I caught the boss napping at his desk again.
1DI3002149	You know, I didn't sign up with the Brotherhood to be an errand boy.
1DI3002150	You know, I didn't sign up with the Brotherhood to be an errand girl.
1DI3002151	Gah! One more day of this and I'm gonna eat a bullet.
1DI3002152	Has Lyons forgotten about the war with the Enclave? What the hell are we doing here, really? We have better things to do.
1DI3002153	I'm not 100% sure it's safe to go in there.
1DI3002154	You know, these chairs aren't very comfortable.
1DI3002155	Bigsley could really cut us some slack.
1DI3002156	The mercenary caravan has returned. They ran into some trouble - Sir? Scribe Bigsley? Is everything alright, sir?
1DI3002157	Sir. Some messages arrived for you.
1DI3002158	I just came back from the Citadel.
1DI3002159	Scribe Bigsley? I've finished the corrections to the map.
1DI3002160	Sir, the "lab coats" report a delay in the next batch of water.
1DI3002161	One of the scientists fell off some scaffolding and broke an arm.
1DI3002162	The caravan never returned, sir.
1DI3002163	A caravan's returned.
1DI3002164	Important messages for you, sir.
1DI3002165	Sir. The next shipment of water is buttoned up and ready to go.
1DI3002167	What the hell are we doing here, really? We have better things to do.
1DI3002168	Step right up!
1DI3002169	The Amazing Aqua Cura!
1DI3002170	Great. Another water beggar.
1DI3002172	Get outa my face.
1DI3002175	Hey, have you got a second?
1DI3002176	So, uhh...
1DI3002177	Listen, I've got a question.
1DI3002178	Can I talk to you for a moment?
1DI3002179	Scribe Rothchild is going to need an update on your progress. Have you sent a report recently?
1DI3002180	Nice work, soldier... nice work.
1DI3002181	What brings you back to the Citadel?
1DI3002182	You look like you've seen some travel. Stop and talk with me a moment.
1DI3002183	Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch. You actually pulled it off.
1DI3002184	Back, huh? Hope you've been Mutie killing.
1DI3002185	Hey, good to see you back.
1DI3002186	Well done! Well done indeed!
1DI3002187	Welcome back, my friend.
1DI3002188	Ah, so nice to see you back at the Citadel.
1DI3002189	You did it! You did it!
1DI3002190	So, what did you break this time?
1DI3002191	You're back!
1DI3002192	I have need of you. Speak to me when you have a moment.
1DI3002193	Ah, it's you. I hope you've brought something useful.
1DI3002194	You're back? Did you find anything of use to us?
1DI3002195	This is Rivet City water, bud. Now get out of my way.
1DI3002196	If you want some water, go get it from the Purifier yourself. This is ours now.
1DI3002197	It's not for sale. Every drop is for Rivet City residents only.
1DI3002198	Move it, bud. Can't you see I'm busy?
1DI3002199	I hate to complain about free water, but the Brotherhood are being damn stingy with it.
1DI3002200	I don't know why they don't just build a pipeline. Schlepping bottles of water back and forth is the worst kind of stupid.
1DI3002201	Stand back, unless you want mirelurk crud all over your boots.
1DI3002202	Just my luck to pull mirelurk duty three days in a row...
1DI3002203	Shh. If you spook the lurks I'll never get out of here.
1DI3002204	The lurks get real shy when they're sick. You gotta wait for 'em to poke their noses up.
1DI3002205	Dammit! If I could just twist my wrists a little more...
1DI3002206	Almost got it... damn it!
1DI3002207	I don't know what the Council was thinking. The Brotherhood should be delivering this water.
1DI3002208	We're getting our asses kicked out here. I don't know why we have to do the Brotherhood's scut work.
1DI3002209	This is a damn suicide mission...
1DI3002210	What's that? Don't you see it -- right over there!
1DI3002211	Did you hear that? Dammit, they're everywhere!
1DI3002212	Rivet City is providing water to the Wasteland. Spread the word.
1DI3002213	Anybody messes with this caravan, gets the business end of my gun. Got it?
1DI3002214	We don't want any trouble.
1DI3002231	Ouch!
1DI3002236	You're here somewhere.
1DI3002241	Need a little help over here!
1DI3002242	I got your free water right here! Ha ha ha ha!
1DI3002243	You guys are unbelievably stupid.
1DI3002246	Pardon the mess.
1DI3002247	I really need to clean this place up.
1DI3002248	Damn. I hope I can find that again.
1DI3002249	Woops.
1DI3002250	Ahhhrgh!
1DI3002253	Nice try asshole. Come back in a week, you'll get your next cut of the take then.
1DI3002254	Fluctuations in your vocal tones indicate your statements are fallacious.
1DI3002255	Further attempts at deception will result in immediate response by security forces.
1DI3002257	If I did, I wouldn't tell you. I'm just doing what I'm told to do by Lyons. Even if I don't like doing it.
1DI3002258	Absolutely not. Any more stupid questions?
1DI3002259	I'm the boss of this gang. We do what I say. Don't forget that.
1DI3002260	Oh I'm sorry! I'm fresh out of free samples. Try again tomorrow!
1DI3002261	You know kid, you really ought to have proof before you go around insulting people like that.
1DI3002262	Now, if you don't mind, why don't you take your baseless accusations elsewhere. I have important business to conduct.
1DI3002263	My business arrangements are private.
1DI3002264	Are you kidding?
1DI3002265	No way. Try again.
1DI3002266	I'm afraid not. 20% seems more than fair to me.
1DI3002267	Your Light is strong, but only the truly Luminescent may enter our monastery. Please return when you are closer to Atom.
1DI3002268	You judge what you do not understand. By introducing them to Atom's Light, we are saving them from a life of misery.
1DI3002269	My orders are to deliver the rest of this water to Big Town, and I'm damn well going to do it.
1DI3002270	I don't think so. They're giving the water away -- why would they make trouble over us taking a little extra?
1DI3002272	That's not yours, now is it?
1DI4000001	That's the spirit! The other participants are waiting, so just press the button inside to let me know when to begin.
1DI4000002	Perhaps you're in the wrong place?  Do come back when you have the means.
1DI4000003	Yes, a task for which I think you'll be superlatively qualified. Do you accept?
1DI4000004	Don't be daft. You agreed to retrieve my book.  With more haste than this, I would have thought.
1DI4000005	You need to head for the ritual site east of the boardwalk, and expect a fight.
1DI4000006	Should be ready in a matter of hours. Check back soon.
1DI4000007	Brewin' low and slow, sweetie. Process takes about a day. Why don't you come back in a piece?
1DI4000008	You're an eager one, ain't ya? I have to let the still air out a few days between brews. Check back with me later.
1DI4000009	I reckon we can. Let's go over the ingredients again.
1DI4000010	There aren't too many ingredients, but I brew large batches, so we need a good bit of each.
1DI4000011	We'll need Punga Fruit, Yeast, and some Fission Batteries - for that extra little kick.
1DI4000012	We need to gather up the ingredients.
1DI4000013	Look around. It's all here.
1DI4000014	I got all sorts of stuff. Take a look.
1DI4000016	I knew that's why you came to me...
1DI4000017	All of Madam Panada's wares are top quality.
1DI4000018	And what is it you would like to purchase?
1DI4000019	Now, I'm not normally one to discourage an adventurous spirit, but certain... events have convinced me of the value of forewarning.
1DI4000020	I know you think you're ready for anything, but the threats you'll face in the swamp make those super mutants look like playful puppies.
1DI4000021	So just be sure you know what you're getting into, okay? You still want to head out to Point Lookout?
1DI4000022	Looking for fame and fortune? Hoping to cultivate the delicious Punga fruit? Or just looking to run away from your life on these dreary shores?
1DI4000023	Let's see what you've got to trade.
1DI4000024	Happy to oblige!
1DI4000025	You need to learn to pay attention when I speak.
1DI4000026	Those mud-lovers want me dead, and haven't extended the common fucking courtesy of telling me why.
1DI4000027	So I need you to find a way into their commune and figure out what's going through their addled little heads.
1DI4000028	Be a good pup, and Ol' Desmond will give you a treat. And, of course, who knows what riches they have for you to steal?
1DI4000029	What? Do you have to make some sort of tea out of magic beans, or play a song for their lizard king?
1DI4000030	Please. They're a pack of religious nutballs. Grow a pair and just go through the motions. Anyone with a brain knows that it's all bullshit.
1DI4000031	Have I tried to chew on your skull, sir? Perhaps you've noticed my ability to string words into complete sentences?
1DI4000032	These ferals are nothing like myself. I'm no more a monster for providing them than you are for slaughtering them.
1DI4000033	Have I tried to chew on your skull? Perhaps you've noticed my ability to string words into complete sentences?
1DI4000035	Not so fast, grub. You haven't earned the right to go to the transcendent master's retreat.
1DI4000036	Couldn't tell you where he goes for his meditations. I swear, nobody tells me nothing. Maybe ask one of the others?
1DI4000037	Alas, only the worthy may enter his nexus of meditation. He has not seen fit to enlighten me!
1DI4000038	Not here?
1DI4000039	Off at his magical thinking-cave, I guess. We're not allowed to know where it is. He says we're not enlightened enough to understand.
1DI4000040	I swear, that sort of stuff pisses me off so much. I thought joining would be all drugs and magic, but it's just the same crap as everywhere else.
1DI4000041	Guess that's why I trailed Jackson to his stupid mystery cave!
1DI4000042	Scripture - the world as told in the Bible. Would you like to hear a verse?
1DI4000043	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible.
1DI4000044	And we shall be changed.
1DI4000045	In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
1DI4000046	I have told you this so that you might have peace in me. In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have conquered the world.
1DI4000047	Impossible! That book's been lost to us for generations. You two must have been mistaken.
1DI4000048	Good. The fools who stole it believe it has powers, so the thing is probably well-guarded.
1DI4000049	There's a ritual site east of the boardwalk, in the basement of a ruined house. I think you'll find it there. Bring it back to me, and be paid.
1DI4000050	The offer stands for now, though I won't abstain from soliciting other help.
1DI4000051	Secret family technique, been so for generations.
1DI4000052	Help me brew some up by gatherin' ingredients. I'll share the batch to make it worth your while, and sweeten the deal with 300 caps.
1DI4000053	Oh, you're gonna love it, sweetie. Just you wait.
1DI4000054	You should have seen her back in her heyday! Why, we traveled up and down the coast, from the Commonwealth to the Broken Banks.
1DI4000055	Good times, but these days she's not fit to take out to the coast. Too many spouts ready to drown her, and too many critters looking for lunch.
1DI4000056	But the Point Lookout run is good enough for now. We've got a sweet deal ferrying cargo and the occasional traveler.
1DI4000057	I'm here on my own business. You wouldn't understand it even if I tried to explain it to you.
1DI4000058	I don't know why anyone would bother with this shithole. It's filled with a bunch of disgusting inbreds and half-crazed loons.
1DI4000059	I'm gonna do what I came to do, and then get the fuck out of here.
1DI4000063	Down south, this side of the bay, there's a soggy strand of beach called Point Lookout.
1DI4000064	Oh, it's got it all. Ruins of ancient pleasure towns, mysterious swamps bristling with treasure, and all practically untouched by outsiders.
1DI4000065	But if you're curious, I could offer you a ride over to that faraway land. For a nominal fee, of course.
1DI4000066	And sorry, but I don't do group trips. If you want to see Point Lookout, you'll have to leave your friend here.
1DI4000073	You're staring at it, friend! Drink it in!
1DI4000074	See the glorious boardwalk, fabled pleasure-town of the sunny past! And beyond it lies the haunted swamplands. Who knows what's hidden in them?
1DI4000075	But while you get your bearings, my friend runs an excellent supply shop right here, near the boardwalk.
1DI4000076	Only that it's where Tobar gets those Punga Fruits he sells off. Must be making a good profit off of them, too.
1DI4000077	I hear rumors the place is full of swamps and killer plants, but I don't know about all that.
1DI4000078	Could it, now?  I suppose you'd know how to see to that, wouldn't you?
1DI4000079	Marcella?  Why?  She's done nothing to them!
1DI4000080	I see. Do what Marcella asks, and pray she's wrong about this.
1DI4000081	What good are you, then? Take her that letter; she's the only person who might know how to help me.
1DI4000082	They're brainless morons who worship some crazy spirit. What's to know?
1DI4000084	We espouse the expansion of the perfect mind, and the rejection of the corrupt physical!
1DI4000085	The material world is destroyed and imperfect. We seek to release our minds from their tainted cages, so as to find a better world.
1DI4000086	We're all about expansion of the mind, denying the physical, all that good stuff.
1DI4000087	I mean, have you looked around? This world sucks the big fat one, so we're ditching it and going off to fantasyland.
1DI4000088	Only, not imaginary fantasyland. Real fantasyland, right? A world of perfect thought. Anywhere but this shithole, at least.
1DI4000089	I'm denmother. I keep us safe and make sure everyone remembers to eat and sleep. It's more work than you might think.
1DI4000090	A lot of our members have... "transcended conscious thought." Someone's got to take care of them.
1DI4000091	We dream. Dream of a better world, not falling apart like ours.
1DI4000092	And when we find a dream that makes us forget this world, we dream that we do not have to wake up.
1DI4000093	We are a family of dreamers, a band of astral explorers, and a church of the mind.
1DI4000094	In time, we will be free of the horrors of the base physical world. We will play amongst the pure thoughts of the universe!
1DI4000095	You're a lucky one, and it probably didn't do any permanent damage. Scar'll heal up on its own, and you'll be good as new.
1DI4000096	Of course, you'll still be missing a chunk of brain, but it looks like you didn't need that bit anyway.
1DI4000097	Now, hold still and I'll see if I can't help you look like your old self again.
1DI4000098	It's all a little fuzzy for me, but I've got a hunch. I'm gonna go do some snooping, see what I can figure out.
1DI4000099	Meet me by the riverboat in a day or so, and maybe I'll have something for you.
1DI4000100	Look, it's not that I don't want to go home, or anything. I mean, I love my ma, even if she does make me want to claw my eyes out sometimes.
1DI4000101	It's just, I came out here to find a fortune. To make my mark. To be able to bring something with me when I do come back.
1DI4000102	If you see my mom again, let her know I'll be coming back, eventually. Just... not quite yet.
1DI4000103	Now that I've got this sweet boat? I guess I could head back home... for a while, anyway.
1DI4000104	Just wait 'till mom sees the haul I'm bringing home!
1DI4000106	Be at peace.
1DI4000108	Huh? Cousin, that you?
1DI4000109	I can hear y'all...
1DI4000111	Who's creepin' around?
1DI4000112	There somethin' movin' around...
1DI4000114	Step into the open and identify yourself.
1DI4000116	Maybe I'm hearing things.
1DI4000118	Is someone messin' around over there?
1DI4000121	There y'all is!
1DI4000122	I knew I heard somethin'!
1DI4000130	Stupid noises...
1DI4000131	Stupid rats...
1DI4000132	I'm hearin' stuff...
1DI4000133	Must be goin' crazy...
1DI4000135	Must've been the wind.
1DI4000142	Ow! Why'd you do that?
1DI4000143	Hey! What was that for?
1DI4000144	Not lettin' you die quick!
1DI4000145	Bleed for me, little girl!
1DI4000146	Bleed for me, little boy!
1DI4000147	Should have stayed home, girl!
1DI4000148	Should have stayed home, boy!
1DI4000149	You scared, girl?
1DI4000150	You scared, boy?
1DI4000151	Gonna git you, girl!
1DI4000152	Gonna git you, boy!
1DI4000153	You in the wrong place, girl!
1DI4000154	You in the wrong place, boy!
1DI4000156	Die, outsider!
1DI4000157	Git out!
1DI4000158	Are ya lost?
1DI4000159	Y'all don't belong here!
1DI4000160	Crack the bone!
1DI4000161	Bleeeeed!
1DI4000162	'dis is our swamp!
1DI4000163	I got somethin' for ya!
1DI4000164	Killy kill!
1DI4000165	Gonna git ya!
1DI4000166	Kill 'em!
1DI4000167	Imma kill you good!
1DI4000168	Die! HA HA HA HA!
1DI4000169	Scream! Hehehe! SCREAM!
1DI4000170	Scream for me! HAHAHAHA!
1DI4000171	You ain't got no chance!
1DI4000172	Get down! I'm hungry!
1DI4000173	Imma eat good tonight!
1DI4000174	You gonna make good eatin'!
1DI4000175	Eat 'em up!
1DI4000176	He he he he!
1DI4000178	Rrrrar!
1DI4000180	Arrrrrr!
1DI4000181	Arrraarrr!
1DI4000182	Grrr!
1DI4000183	Grraarrr!
1DI4000184	Broke legs'll slow you down.
1DI4000185	Imma take my time with you.
1DI4000186	I'll have your scalp!
1DI4000187	Murder the intruder.
1DI4000188	Kill. Kill. Destroy. Kill.
1DI4000189	Opposition is unwise.
1DI4000190	Resistance to the will of the Professor is hopeless.
1DI4000191	Process: Calvert protection.
1DI4000192	Calvert protection procedure 7a initiated.
1DI4000193	Inner sanctum violated. Initiate attack protocols.
1DI4000194	Lab breached. Intruder engaged.
1DI4000195	Unfriendly target located. Protection process initiated.
1DI4000196	Protect the Professor.
1DI4000197	Calculating chance of success... less than 5%.
1DI4000198	Warning. Continued operation cannot be guaranteed.
1DI4000209	Sleep forever!
1DI4000210	Return to dust!
1DI4000211	Death to the unenlightened!
1DI4000212	Impure!
1DI4000213	You will feed the Punga!
1DI4000215	Go around the side!
1DI4000216	Don't stop shooting!
1DI4000217	They're still moving! Keep it up!
1DI4000220	Yeeaaahhhh!
1DI4000223	Arg! Stand... still!
1DI4000224	Kill them! Killl them all!
1DI4000225	Hold still!
1DI4000226	It'll all be over soon!
1DI4000228	Oh, this is gonna hurt...
1DI4000229	I'm gonna crack your skull!
1DI4000232	You are dead! Dead!
1DI4000233	Kill... you!
1DI4000234	Rar!
1DI4000237	Rrg!
1DI4000240	Pineapple! Run!
1DI4000241	Git behind somethin'!
1DI4000242	Git down!
1DI4000243	Watch out, y'all!
1DI4000244	Warning: explosive device nearby.
1DI4000245	Explosive detected.
1DI4000246	Grenade detected.
1DI4000251	They done disappeared!
1DI4000252	Gone?
1DI4000253	Hey! Where'd you go?
1DI4000254	Anybody see where they went?
1DI4000259	No skin off mah back.
1DI4000260	That'll learn ya!
1DI4000261	You lose, outsider!
1DI4000262	Next time, fight back!
1DI4000263	This our swamp!
1DI4000264	We eatin' good tonight!
1DI4000265	Yum yum! Eat em' up!
1DI4000266	All's well.
1DI4000267	You won't bother anyone ever again.
1DI4000270	You deserved that.
1DI4000272	I'm pulling all the data that I can from Calvert's computers. Everything the little bastard gathered is here.
1DI4000273	And then, when I'm done, I'll leave this place to sink into the sea.
1DI4000274	Now that we're rid of Calvert, I'll be heading north to pursue my next rival.
1DI4000275	There are only a few of us left now. The great game goes on.
1DI4000276	Sort of a... what's a word you'd understand... microcosm? Yeah. It's a microcosm for the old world.
1DI4000277	Aaaaagggghhhh...
1DI4000278	We'll... git... you...
1DI4000279	Aw... shit...
1DI4000280	Yeeeaaarrrrr...
1DI4000282	Arrrrgrgrgrr....
1DI4000284	Aieee...
1DI4000285	Noo!
1DI4000286	Shutting... down...
1DI4000287	Unable to cont...
1DI4000289	At last...
1DI4000290	To dream...
1DI4000291	Agggghhhh...
1DI4000297	Urrrggg...
1DI4000299	Gahhh!
1DI4000301	We was kin!
1DI4000303	Make you regret that...
1DI4000305	He's dead!
1DI4000308	She's dead!
1DI4000309	Desmond... That bag of bones and bile will pay dearly for his trespasses!
1DI4000310	Were it not for his interference, I would still have a body. Still, its absence has only honed my brilliance, so perhaps I owe him my thanks.
1DI4000311	An appreciation I'll show in the form of a quick and messy death! HA HA HA!
1DI4000312	Leader? That would be Jackson, a man of great wisdom. He has withdrawn to his Cavern of Communion, the better to contemplate the unknowable!
1DI4000313	Only the righteous are trusted to know where this nexus of understanding lies. And alas, I am not so blessed.
1DI4000314	That would be Jackson. He's normally in here, leading sermons, tending to our needs, and speaking to us of his journeys in the realm of pure thought.
1DI4000315	I guess he went off on one of his meditations again. He's always off praying for guidance, especially these days.
1DI4000316	You mean Jackson? I thought he was inside. I guess you could check there.
1DI4000317	I guess you mean Jackson. He speaks the word of enlightenment at us, but he ain't fit to lead a song, much less this bunch of morons.
1DI4000318	I been meaning to talk to him about this place, but he's off doing his meditation thing.
1DI4000319	Damn, you are wet behind the ears. Jackson leads us, and don't you forget. When he talks, you listen up and catch every word!
1DI4000320	Not that you'll be hearing much for now. He's off meditating.
1DI4000321	Look to Jackson. He is the one who knows.
1DI4000322	But do not strain to see him here. Jackson is away.
1DI4000323	I know it may seem that I am a brave shepherd to my flock, but the truth is far more humble.
1DI4000324	I am nothing more than the largest fish in our school, as we swim through the astral seas... exploring, learning, and becoming one.
1DI4000325	But we are not swimming aimlessly! No, we have a beacon! The shining mind speaks to me in my meditations, and guides us always.
1DI4000326	Damned if I know. It was abandoned when I got here.
1DI4000327	There's plenty hidden away here, none of it would be useful to to a bunch of crazed inbreds.
1DI4000328	Our most enlightened one divined that the fates themselves did decree the mansion must be burnt to the ground!
1DI4000329	Honestly? I got no idea. Word came down on high that the place had to come down.
1DI4000330	I probably should have joined the war party, but... well, I'm not really comfortable with violence.
1DI4000331	Jackson said he saw its destruction in a vision. There were some concerns, but when the leader says it's a mandate from beyond, you don't ask why.
1DI4000332	That hill is holy. It must be cleared. Jackson told us this.
1DI4000333	Some went to fight. I stayed with Punga.
1DI4000334	Punga does not fight. Punga grows where it can. Punga knows what is important.
1DI4000335	We take no pleasure in violence. Our goal was merely to remove the ghoul. His presence is an offense to the Transcendent Master's astral dominion.
1DI4000336	I cannot claim to understand the exact reasons that the mansion's resident caused such disruption, however. To understand fully, ask the Master.
1DI4000337	Of course I did, but that moron thought it was one of his addled visions. The real goal was to destroy the ghouls' jamming device!
1DI4000338	Honestly, those fools aren't worth the meat they're made of. A minion that can't follow directions is no use at all!
1DI4000339	Woah, woah, woah! That was all Jackson's crazy idea. I knew better than to volunteer for that suicide mission!
1DI4000340	Last time I wandered too close to that mansion, some old ghoul sicced his dogs on me. Screw that!
1DI4000341	I've been around for a long goddamn time. The last time I knew a bird named Nadine, I still had skin.
1DI4000342	There was some girl who came nosing around here a few weeks back, but she ran off before I could... introduce myself.
1DI4000343	Ah, Nadine! Spritely little tomboy with more curiosity than common sense, that one.
1DI4000344	Caused so much trouble on the trip that I probably would have thrown her overboard... if she hadn't reminded me of myself at her age.
1DI4000345	Haven't seen her since we hit land at Point Lookout. But knowing her, I'll bet she's gotten herself in plenty of trouble.
1DI4000346	She's about your age, and when she left, her hair was dyed bright orange. You shouldn't have any problem recognizing her.
1DI4000347	She told me she wanted to go find her fortune, but I thought it was too dangerous. I should've known better than to say that.
1DI4000348	Moment I told her she couldn't go, it was just a matter of time before she ran off...
1DI4000349	That sounds like her. Too busy having her adventures to think about family. Like mother, like daughter.
1DI4000350	Yes, thank you so much! And now that she's got this boat and carrying all this cargo... well, I can afford to actually pay you! Thank you so much!
1DI4000352	There was some girl who came nosing around here a few weeks back, but she ran off before I could ... introduce myself.
1DI4000353	What is this, a date? You start making a move, and it's stabbing time.
1DI4000354	What? There's not much to say. I ran off from home to see the world and find a fortune. And I'm doing it now, okay?
1DI4000355	There's not much to say. I ran off from home to see the world and find a fortune. And I'm doing it now, okay?
1DI4000356	Good stuff, isn't it? Actual, healthy food, grown in the actual ground and everything!
1DI4000357	There's a few places out in the Point where it grows naturally. One group of Tribals have cultivated and refined it, but they're not big on sharing.
1DI4000358	Don't even ask how I get my hands on the refined crop. A magician never reveals his secrets, does he?
1DI4000359	Punga grows strong. I help Punga grow stronger.
1DI4000360	Punga understands me. I understand Punga.
1DI4000361	That is all it needs to be.
1DI4000362	Are you kidding? Why wouldn't we? As much as we want to reject earthly desires, we still need to eat, right?
1DI4000363	It grows fast, fills you up, and you can make a lot of things with it.
1DI4000364	Anything it doesn't provide, we can get by trading it to outsiders. That shifty bastard Tobar's always looking to buy more from us.
1DI4000365	It is a gift from the earth itself, in acknowledgement of our perfect balance with nature and the higher planes.
1DI4000366	She recognizes that we seek to leave behind the corrupt physical, and she nurtures us in our quest.
1DI4000367	Tell the truth, I got no idea. Ground's probably pretty fertile here, on account of the graveyard.
1DI4000368	Plus, we got lots of people tending the gardens. Especially the big man, Croatoa.
1DI4000369	Guy's got a knack for plants. Makes sense - mentally, they're on the same level.
1DI4000370	The audio password for my box is "Nevermore".
1DI4000371	...Don't tell Evelyn. The password? "Buttercup", why...
1DI4000372	Air Com, we have multiple flashpoints on horizon, come back?
1DI4000373	Air Command, USN Three-Five-Oh requesting landing vector. Have zero ceiling visbility and low on state, somebody get me a landing clearance.
1DI4000374	State One plus one zero to splash, have zero read on outer marker. This is USN Three-Five-Oh, I'm blind out here.
1DI4000375	Attempting Emergency Landing over water. INS pinger active on distress band. Flaps up, descent to eight cherubs. Three green, over.
1DI4000376	Five cherubs, treeline up, throttle easy on four lights. Prepping to pull the loud handle.  <Static>
1DI4000377	Jackson believes me to be some kind of god. You'd think that would be good, but his interpretations of my commands leaves something to be desired.
1DI4000378	Regardless, I trust you can be more effective than he has been. I need your help on an important task.
1DI4000379	There's a troublesome ghoul who lives in Calvert Mansion. I need him destroyed, and his jamming device neutralized, immediately.
1DI4000380	He thinks I'm some sort of god, and I have no reason to disabuse him of the notion. This makes me de facto leader of the tribe, as it were.
1DI4000383	At the moment, they've been no use at all, but I have very few options. They can't even seem to remove a single ghoul from a house.
1DI4000384	More than you could possibly imagine with your squishy pink mind, but the only pressing matter at the moment is a device in his possession.
1DI4000385	He has a jammer that limits my projection range to this pathetic cave. Remove that, and I can extend my reach so much further...
1DI4000386	Killing Desmond would be a nice plus, but I'm sure we can get around to that later.
1DI4000387	Excellent. I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to find a suitable assistant after all these years.
1DI4000388	Now, the ghoul is a pain, and may require disposal, but Desmond is only of secondary importance. The real target is a device in his possession.
1DI4000389	He has a jammer which limits my projection range to this pathetic cave. Remove that, and I can extend my reach so much further...
1DI4000390	What you are interacting with is merely a holographic projection. And a rather clumsy one, at that, but it's all I can manage at the moment.
1DI4000391	As for myself, you gaze upon one of America's greatest minds, preserved through the miracles of SCIENCE!
1DI4000392	Much more elegant than shambling on as some rotting corpse for all eternity, don't you agree?
1DI4000393	You! Interloper! Come here!
1DI4000394	I don't need eyes to know you're there. Come here!
1DI4000395	It is I, Professor Calvert! Don't bother looking around, I'm in your mind!
1DI4000396	But, aren't you Desmond's faithful little employee? Coming to gum up my work, are we? Well... I have a better idea...
1DI4000397	How about instead of playing his game, you destroy that nasty little device?
1DI4000398	Deposit it in the nearby trash compactor and we will never have to worry about it again.
1DI4000399	I assure you that the gratitude of Professor Calvert is worth a great deal more than that of a washed up old limey.
1DI4000400	Excellent! Most excellent! I knew that you would make the right choice.
1DI4000401	And now it is time for Desmond to meet his end! He's made a fatal mistake!
1DI4000402	Return to Calvert Mansion. I have something there that I'd like you to see.
1DI4000403	You fool! What have you done? You will pay for this! PAY!
1DI4000404	No one betrays me! Do you under...and? You will SUFFER ... this!
1DI4000405	You... and-  ... that ghoul... ... ...both... ... pay...
1DI4000406	...coming for- ....you... ... ...
1DI4000407	Oh, bless you! Her name is Nadine, and she left a couple weeks ago. Said she wanted to see the world, silly little thing that she is.
1DI4000408	That Tobar said he dropped her off at Point Lookout, but who knows what's happened to her since then?
1DI4000409	I don't know if you can convince my little Nadine to come back, but just give her this note from me, would you?
1DI4000410	Please, I'm not asking for much. But if you're going to Point Lookout, and you find a girl named Nadine, just give her this note.
1DI4000411	She stowed away on that boat, and I haven't heard from her ever since. I'll do anything if it'll help find her.
1DI4000412	Please, don't say that! Just, if you're going to Point Lookout, and you find a girl named Nadine, please give her this note.
1DI4000414	I've never even been to Point Lookout, so I wouldn't know. She just said she was going to go find her fortune there. She could be anyplace!
1DI4000415	But I do remember her talking about that Punga Fruit, and how valuable it'd be to grow here. Maybe she'll be someplace it grows?
1DI4000417	We are talking.
1DI4000418	I said another thing.
1DI4000419	And now we say goodbye.
1DI4000420	It feels good to work with dirt, doesn't it? Some people call it work, but they don't understand.
1DI4000421	Take my shovel. It has seen much use, and much dirt. Maybe it will help you?
1DI4000422	But be careful not to cut yourself with it. It can make you sick.
1DI4000423	I do not know if this is a secret, but I have always used this shovel. It has seen much work, and much dirt.
1DI4000424	If it helps, have it. But be careful not to cut yourself. It can make you sick.
1DI4000425	Patience, friend. Only patience.
1DI4000426	Maybe. We are both simple. But simple is not the same as stupid.
1DI4000427	Now, hold on there. Not so fuckin' fast. You can be useful to me. I need someone willing to get their hands dirty.
1DI4000428	So, here's the deal: I help you get in with those Tribals, you help me get what I want, and I'll make you fuckin' rich.
1DI4000429	Just try not to sprain a lobe while you're thinking about it. My time is short.
1DI4000430	Not a fuckin' clue. It'd be easy to chalk it up to their crazy religion, but if I'm right, and I always am, there's something else going on.
1DI4000431	That's the third attack in a month, so somebody's got a grudge with me. Whether it's a man or a god, I intend to set them straight.
1DI4000432	Oh, there's always a chance, certainly. But what you earn depends on how well you can follow directions.
1DI4000433	You're not the most incompetent waster I've ever met. I think we could put you to work and figure out what's going on here.
1DI4000434	Your reward would be considerable, since I know that's what you wasters value. Decide.
1DI4000435	Fight through this place!
1DI4000436	Stay close to me, dammit!
1DI4000437	Come on! He's not far!
1DI4000438	He's just down this way!
1DI4000439	Dammit! Trapped! I knew he'd try this!
1DI4000440	Easy-peasy, right about now they'll be wondering what happened to their hunting party.
1DI4000441	The only reliable currency in the world: information. You provide me with valuable info about the Tribals, I pay in kind.
1DI4000442	I've got a few more tricks I can share with you, if that's not enough to get you barking.
1DI4000443	Sorry, but that's not really an option. I was only being polite in pretending that it was.
1DI4000444	Tell you what, take a while and roll it around in your tiny brain. Consider your other options, if you think you've got any.
1DI4000445	What, like you've never done something unpleasant for the promise of your own personal gain? Give it a rest, saint.
1DI4000446	Just head up to the Cathedral and ask real nice. When you're in, you find the bastard in charge and find out what they're up to.
1DI4000447	I just need information. No need for violence... yet.
1DI4000448	These are people who think cutting a hole in their skull can expand their mind. They're not exactly scholars over there.
1DI4000451	My story? Tell you what, kid. My story's a lot like a Deathclaw's tongue.
1DI4000452	It's long, messy, and you don't want to get too personal with it. Understand?
1DI4000453	Suffice it to say, I have business in Point Lookout. If you help, you will be repaid for your efforts. That's all you want to fucking know.
1DI4000454	What's the difference between you and me, kid? What makes a gifted killer like yourself into a rock-hard bastard like me?
1DI4000455	The answer is training, you ignorant fuck! I've got a hundred years of experience on you, and don't you forget it.
1DI4000456	Stick by me, and you'll get a master's class in doing what has to be done.
1DI4000457	No, but you helped me out, and that's something. Can't let you think I'm not a gracious host, can I?
1DI4000458	So, tell you what I'll do, I'll share a few tips for the next time you're making a dramatic final stand.
1DI4000459	The type that kills everyone outside of my saferoom and leaves a hell of a mess to clean up. Standard type.
1DI4000460	Not worth wasting on ignorant savages like them, honestly. Just as well you came along when you did.
1DI4000462	Moron! You cannot possibly comprehend what this is worth!
1DI4000463	I've been battling with Calvert for over 200 years! And now, at last, I am the victor!
1DI4000464	And now, 200 years of technology, knowledge, and research that he stole from me! Every time he beat me, it doesn't matter now!
1DI4000468	You're free to take whatever you find in this disgusting place.
1DI4000469	What I came for is of no interest to you.
1DI4000470	Enjoy your spoils. I don't think our paths will ever cross again. And I think we can both thank Christ and say hallelujah for that.
1DI4000486	What? You betrayed me because I wasn't polite? Are you out of your fucking mind?
1DI4000487	Fine then. Would it make your little feelbads all better if I said please?
1DI4000488	Then pretty please, fucking help me rid the world of Professor Calvert.
1DI4000489	I've waited a long time for this.
1DI4000490	Savor the moment, my friend. This is the end of an era.
1DI4000491	I'm 250 years old, so I think I have a shiny thing or two that might interest your tiny brain.
1DI4000492	So, if it's riches and weapons and things that you want, I have more than enough to spare. And all you have to do is do what you do best.
1DI4000493	Follow orders, and end Professor Calvert.
1DI4000494	No, I can't. But let's see if you can!
1DI4000495	Is that so? I've come a long way, my friend. I highly doubt that my journey will end today!
1DI4000496	Well now, finally you show some goddamn sense.
1DI4000497	So, if you're on my side, why did you destroy my jammer?
1DI4000498	After this, I won't require your services any longer. I suppose that works out now, doesn't it?
1DI4000499	So, since we're in agreement about this, let's go in there and "retire" the good professor!
1DI4000500	Brace yourself, you're about to witness the end of an era!
1DI4000501	And you... Impressive. Very impressive. Perhaps there's more to you than meets the eye.
1DI4000502	I suppose I had you wrong. And that in itself is a once in a lifetime event.
1DI4000503	Brace yourself, my friend. You're about to witness the end of an era!
1DI4000504	If nothing else, I have to say that you were good sport!
1DI4000505	You'll be the appetizer before I destroy the professor!
1DI4000506	Nihilism is so boring. Try it if you must, I could use the warmup before I kill the professor!
1DI4000507	After 250 years, you think I'll go down to you? Ha! Try it!
1DI4000508	And? You didn't go track him down and grill him for information?
1DI4000509	I'm not your daddy. Don't waste your time checking in! Go find him and figure out what he wants with this place, you moron!
1DI4000510	Nice work -- as if sneaking into a compound of morons is any kind of work. So why haven't you tracked down their leader and grilled him for info?
1DI4000511	Don't waste your time reporting back. Go find him and figure out what he wants with this place, you moron!
1DI4000512	Ok Ok...I'll do it.  Just point that thing somewhere else.   ...My name is John Adlam, son of Joseph Adlam, and brother of Richard Adlam.
1DI4000513	Two days ago I was caught stealing from the groups' claim.
1DI4000514	Today, with the consent of my father, I am to be shot and killed on the cliffs of the old cathedral by the hands of my brother, Richard.
1DI4000515	With my execution, my punishment is exacted and the Adlam name will be avenged.
1DI4000516	Let my punishment be a reminder to those who may be tempted to do as I did.
1DI4000517	Ooooohhhoooohhhh!!!
1DI4000518	<Snarling.>
1DI4000519	<Roaring.>
1DI4000520	<Giggling.>
1DI4000521	This is Caroline Saunders, principal geological chemist, for Bysshe natural gas survey MD-16-001.
1DI4000522	Sample set one shows promising concentration of bio-gas in mostly limestone substratum of wetlands.
1DI4000523	No exact levels yet, but this site should exhibit more than enough extraction potential to meet survey goals.
1DI4000524	I'm going to leave a couple of interns here to handle the minutiae, but it's a formality.
1DI4000525	I'll move on to the other sites now to make sure this isn't an aberration.  Consider this my authorization signature on Sample Site One.
1DI4000526	Caroline Saunders speaking, principal geological chemist on Bysshe natural gas survey MD-16-001.
1DI4000527	Preliminary results from Sample Site Two are promising; we're posting similar concentrations as in the first site.
1DI4000528	Similar bio-gas makeup here as well, including a few organic compounds that I'm not familiar with.
1DI4000529	We've also discovered heavy lye residue in a naturally-formed chamber at this excavation site.
1DI4000530	Lucky we were wearing caustics gear to begin with, or somebody might have suffered some serious chemical burns.
1DI4000531	I'd like to analyze the site further, see if there's any connection between these compounds and the lye deposits.
1DI4000532	My tech is telling me he needs a couple of hours to work on our ventilator unit. I suppose I'll move on to Site Three in the meantime.
1DI4000533	Further analysis is for my own curiosity, anyway. This is my authorization signature on Sample Site Two.
1DI4000534	What in the world have we tapped into? Sample Site Three is showing bio-gas concentration off the charts!
1DI4000535	Wetlands substratum is surprisingly dense limestone at all excavation sites, and we've had no trouble locating naturally-formed chambers.
1DI4000536	This and the dense calcite formations suggest that subterranean water flow has eroded a vast network of caves and grottoes throughout the region.
1DI4000537	Mapping these will be a monumental effort, and necessary to fully uncover the bounty of natural gas resources captured down here.
1DI4000538	What I don't understand is the amount of lye residue we're encountering.
1DI4000539	I'm going to try and touch base with some of my academic contacts and see if we can find any precedent for it.
1DI4000540	We'll have plenty of time to work that out, though; I've no doubt Bysshe will want to set up shop here and drill their little hearts out.
1DI4000541	This is principal geological chemist Caroline Saunders, for Bysshe natural gas survey MD-16-001.
1DI4000542	Consider this my authorization signature on Sample Site three.
1DI4000543	Far as I'm concerned, this is a prime location for bio-gas harvesting, and a treasure trove for some field research.
1DI4000544	Did you know I once bagged a Mirelurk ten feet tall?
1DI4000545	I bet you can't beat me in a race. You look reeeal slow.
1DI4000546	This one time I'm pretty sure I moved a bottle with my mind...
1DI4000547	I bet I can burp louder than you!
1DI4000548	I'm grown up enough already. And I'm the only thing I can be - me.
1DI4000549	Look at me. I don't got the marks. I go around the wets and folk will shoot at me! Thinking I was one of your type.
1DI4000550	I dunno. I ran away a long time ago. I live here all by myself.
1DI4000551	I already told you. I ran away. Shut up about it, all right?
1DI4000552	The grownups like my mama and pop just live in the wet. They're okay, they just don't trust outsiders like you.
1DI4000553	Most think I'm an outsider too, because I don't got the markings on me. I tend to stay away from the grownups.
1DI4000554	Except when they have a campfire. Some nights I hear them dancing. Then I sneak out to watch.
1DI4000555	I wasn't born right.  Mama hid me in the basement and pappy kinda just forgot about me, but I knew I had to go before I grew up.
1DI4000556	I got bored locked up in the basement all the time. So, I started taking things apart and putting them back together again.
1DI4000557	Things aren't so strange when you can see all the stuff that makes them. You know? See something's insides? That's where the real thing is.
1DI4000558	Anybody ever say you talk too much?
1DI4000559	Sure. I was getting tired of that anyway.
1DI4000560	No, I mean it, mister. The ghost will melt your brain to mush! You need to get out here. And fast!
1DI4000561	No, I mean it, lady. The ghost will melt your brain to mush! You need to get out here. And fast!
1DI4000562	Yeah, you'd better scram - if he looks you in the eyes, your brain will melt!
1DI4000563	So what if it was? I've bagged meaner than you, and I'll do it again!
1DI4000564	Yeah well, bullets work on everybody. Try me, mister. I dare you.
1DI4000565	Yeah well, bullets work on everybody. Try me, lady. I dare you.
1DI4000566	Well... all right. But any funny business and I'll pop you one. My name's Kenny. And I'm the boss of this mine.
1DI4000567	Listen up, mister. My name's Kenny. And I'm the boss of this mine. And if you're going to be mean, then you aren't welcome.
1DI4000568	Listen up, lady. My name's Kenny. And I'm the boss of this mine. And if you're going to be mean, then you aren't welcome.
1DI4000569	One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, three-Mississippi, four-Mississippi, five-Mississippi, six-Mississippi, seven-Mississippi, 8-9-10.
1DI4000570	One... two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten...
1DI4000571	Just get out of here, okay, mister? Don't make me hurt you!
1DI4000572	Just get out of here, okay, lady? Don't make me hurt you!
1DI4000573	Okay. Fine. I guess you can hang out here. You can keep your stuff here too, I won't mess with it.
1DI4000574	So what do you want to do first? Play hide and seek, or tag?
1DI4000575	Well... I guess you can stay here when you need to. And you can leave your stuff, I won't mess with it.
1DI4000576	So, do you like games? Wanna play hide and seek, or tag or something?
1DI4000577	I used to have Kenny-Bear around, but he fell down the big shaft back there. It's too scary for me to go get him. Maybe you can, though?
1DI4000578	Gee, thanks!  I dropped him near the shaft, so he's probably at the bottom.
1DI4000579	Whatever. You're a dumb head. I didn't want your help anyway.
1DI4000580	I don't go back there much - it's real dark and there's lots of critters. You should be fine, though!
1DI4000581	Old Man Herzog's Mine-hole?  Isn't much, but it's home!
1DI4000582	Whatcha wanna know?
1DI4000583	He was a mean old man, owned this mine a million years ago. Made the miners work real hard and didn't give them any money or food for their kin.
1DI4000584	One day a bunch of miners sat down and just stopped working. Old man Herzog, he didn't like that. Not a bit.
1DI4000585	So, he blew them all up! With a million-million tons of dynamite!
1DI4000586	No one wanted to work in the mine after that. Then Ol' Herzog came down here and hung himself.
1DI4000587	They say his angry ghost still haunts the mine. That doesn't scare me, though.
1DI4000588	I go out to play some days and might bag me a shellman to eat. Most days I just sit here with my stories and toys, though.
1DI4000589	Swamp Folk know Ol' Herzog's Mine-hole. Say it's haunted. So I knew most folk wouldn't wander this way, except outsiders like you.
1DI4000590	Doesn't usually take more than a clapper-jaw on the leg to scare them off.
1DI4000591	What do you wanna play? Hide and seek? Or tag?
1DI4000592	Wait here and count to 10. Slowly! Then see if you can find me. Okay? No cheating! Close your eyes and count to ten. Go!
1DI4000593	Fine. I didn't want to play with you anyway.
1DI4000594	You'll never find me.
1DI4000595	This is the best hiding spot ever!
1DI4000596	I bet you walk right past me!
1DI4000598	Hmm... where are you?
1DI4000599	You're pretty good at this game.
1DI4000600	Hmm... did you turn invisible or something?
1DI4000602	Okay... Tag! You're it!
1DI4000603	Tag! You're it!
1DI4000604	Gotcha! You're it! <giggling>
1DI4000605	Tag! You're it! You'll never catch me!
1DI4000607	I'm gonna catch you!
1DI4000608	Ah come on... what's a matter? You tired?
1DI4000609	Fine. I was tired of whuppin' you anyhow.
1DI4000610	Hehe. That was fun.
1DI4000611	Okay, I'll give you a head start. Go!
1DI4000612	I'll get you!
1DI4000613	Haha! Here I come!
1DI4000615	Bring him back as fast as you can!
1DI4000616	Kenny-Bear! You're the greatest!
1DI4000618	So hey. You can use this place as your hideout if you want. Hide from the folk out there. Stash your stuff. Okay?
1DI4000619	You're welcome. So, um, what do you want to do now? You wanna play a game? Like hide or seek, or tag or something?
1DI4000620	We'll, okay. But if you change your mind, you can always hang out here. I won't mind.
1DI4000621	I... guess that's Kenny-Bear. Thanks for bringing him back.

1DI4000628	I apologize that I cannot receive you in person, agent Jiang. Our Norfolk contact confirms your arrival.
1DI4000629	How eager the Americans are to believe that a great mind of the People would defect! Our countrymen will herald you as a hero when your work is done.
1DI4000630	To that end, let us turn to the details of your mission. This room will be your safehouse in Point Lookout.
1DI4000631	Focus initially on playing the American lapdog. Do not arouse suspicion.
1DI4000632	When it is safe, use the key you were given in Norfolk to open one of the public rental lockers on the boardwalk near the Motel.
1DI4000633	You will be provided with the password you'll need to access your mission debriefing. The agreed-upon payment will be paid upon extraction.
1DI4000634	Zhu ni haoyun, agent Jiang.
1DI4000635	Agent Jiang; as you know, an important Chinese surveillance vessel was lost in American waters.
1DI4000636	Your mission is to destroy derelict submarine SSN-37-1A before the Americans can recover and analyze it.
1DI4000637	The recovery location is included in this dossier, and your cover ensures that the Americans will allow you access to their recovery operation.
1DI4000638	However; you will need an authorization code to trigger the self-destruct sequence.
1DI4000639	One of our field operatives in your area, Agent Yang, has these codes hidden in a dental capsule, but her current whereabouts are unknown.
1DI4000640	Locate and rendezvous with Agent Yang, then destroy the submarine. Report to your safehouse for extraction information when the mission is complete.
1DI4000641	The will of the People protect you, Agent Jiang.
1DI4000642	Go to the bank and use password xin tian weng.  The software is configured to recognize only our voices.
1DI4000643	Please exit the hazardous area.
1DI4000644	Clearance acknowledged. Follow me for your extraction debriefing, Comrade.
1DI4000645	Please step inside, agent. Extraction details can be found on the terminal inside.
1DI4000646	I've found that price keeps the riff-raff out. You aren't riff-raff, now, are you?
1DI4000647	Your enthusiasm is flattering, but I'll need time to round up more fodder. Could I trouble you to return in a day or two?
1DI4000648	Why, certainly! You're already registered, but I'll need five hundred caps to enter this particular safari. You understand.
1DI4000649	Gristle and gore await! Proceed inside and use the button, as before.
1DI4000650	I'm sure you're good for it, but I require cash.
1DI4000651	I hope you'll reconsider. Simply not the same without you.
1DI4000652	Only the finest bit of sport you've ever enjoyed!
1DI4000653	Once we review the rules and see to a nominal thousand caps registration fee, of course.
1DI4000654	Your loss, I'm afraid. Come back if you reconsider.
1DI4000655	Ah, but of course. What would you like to know?
1DI4000656	I do hope you enjoyed it. What shall we discuss?
1DI4000657	Need a refresher, do we? What would you like to know?
1DI4000658	The participants - that's you - assemble in the arena. Once you've made your preparations, signal me with the button inside to begin the hunt.
1DI4000659	I'll remotely release groups of ferals against which you must defend yourself. Don't worry, I'll make sure there aren't too many loose at one time.
1DI4000660	You're in for quite a treat, if I do say so myself.
1DI4000661	Not an option, I'm afraid. The thrill wouldn't be the same if you knew I'd release you at the first sign of trouble, now would it?
1DI4000662	Weapons are your own responsibility, ma'am. I'm sure you have your own preferences, after all.
1DI4000663	Weapons are your own responsibility, sir. I'm sure you have your own preferences, after all.
1DI4000664	No, no. Not at all! I'm just not used to people all the way out here.
1DI4000665	My usual customers, well. I usually smell 'em before I see 'em.
1DI4000666	The swamp folk, mostly. I guess they don't bother me none because I was born here.
1DI4000667	They mostly trade meat and fruit. Never any cash or goods.
1DI4000668	Them mercs are good for some trade in real hardware, so if'n you need ammo or anything like that, I can help you out.
1DI4000669	Oh, you're thinking... no, no. It's not a family thing. I took the name of the store when I found this place a couple years ago.
1DI4000670	Truth is, I don't even remember much before that. Woke up here with a headache a couple years ago with the shop already set up.
1DI4000671	People came in, and started trading. I didn't complain. It just became a job.
1DI4000672	I found some of it. Some was here when I got here. I get some from them smugglers.
1DI4000673	And every once in a while, that weirdo with the boat comes up here and trades a few good things.
1DI4000674	Sure thing. Are you here to buy something?
1DI4000677	Come on, now. No giving up just yet.
1DI4000678	You might experience just the slightest hint of unease. But I'm sure that wherever you are, you're not feeling a thing.
1DI4000679	What a messy, messy mind you've got in here. I'll see if I can't tidy it up for you.
1DI4000680	You're doing well. Quite well, indeed! Most initiates never make it this far, you know.
1DI4000681	Been having a rough time, haven't you? Let daddy patch everything up for you.
1DI4000682	Congratulations, my boy! You're going to pull through, and everything will be right as rain.
1DI4000683	Congratulations, my dear! You're going to pull through, and everything will be right as rain.
1DI4000684	Hark! Who goes there?
1DI4000685	Sure, fine. Why not? I'm planning on ditching this place, anyway. If you're about to cause trouble with Jackson, all the more reason.
1DI4000686	His cave's under the Cathedral, but it's hard to find. Use this key to get in through a wrecked ship down at sea cliffs to the east.
1DI4000687	When you find that old idiot, tell him thanks for all the Punga I could steal!
1DI4000688	I only been here a week or so, but I'm about ready to ditch this bunch of dummies. I already stole all the Punga I could ever need.
1DI4000689	Hey, if you still wanna know where Jackson's hiding, I can help you out. No reason for me to give a damn about this place, y'know?
1DI4000691	How wonderful! Perhaps you shall be the one who can clear the holy land of its disruptive presence!
1DI4000692	Oh, but the Transcendent Master will want to hear of this! And as one so obviously led by visions, it is your right and honor to tell him yourself!
1DI4000693	After all, it is he who makes all true decisions about the spiritual growth of our tribe, including the decision to cleanse the mansion.
1DI4000694	I may be the man who leads our physical affairs, but I cannot claim true wisdom. I take my orders from a higher master!
1DI4000695	Whether it be how to explore higher planes, or the decision to remove the disruptive ghoul, all wisdom comes from the Transcendent Master.
1DI4000696	Would that I was so wise! No, true leadership of the tribe belongs to the higher mind of the enlightened one!
1DI4000697	Although his mind has moved beyond the need for flesh, his consciousness still returns here to guide our people. I merely interpret his wishes.
1DI4000698	He manifests here, high on a ledge in the great sea cave's well. Perhaps if you are fortunate, he will choose to share his wisdom with you!
1DI4000699	It is very rare that others are permitted to commune with the master. Many are too foolish to understand the great truths of his higher mind.
1DI4000700	But I sense in you a great potential. Perhaps you have what is needed to accept his teachings and grow from his wisdom.
1DI4000701	He manifests here, high on a ledge in the great sea cave's well. Seek him out, and all shall be revealed.
1DI4000702	You! You're no tribal! Get in here and help me fight these bastards off, goddamnit!
1DI4000703	Yes, you! I see you out there. Stop dicking around and help me, or else these cocksuckers will be coming after you next!
1DI4000704	I can't stay barricaded in this saferoom forever. Now get in here and lend a hand!
1DI4000705	Time to shit or get off the pot, joker. Get inside and help, or get off my damned lawn.
1DI4000706	Would you like me to recite some scripture, or did you just want to know more about the Faith?
1DI4000707	No, not exactly. People have clung to many beliefs since the Great War, and some have their foundations in the Faith.
1DI4000708	The Bible was around long before the bombs fell, as was my Faith. To us, the War was a great tragedy, but not the True Apocalypse.
1DI4000709	We try to improve the state of the Wasteland by doing good where we can and by spreading the word of the Bible.
1DI4000710	We also recover and restore religious relics that we can find, but that's a secondary goal.
1DI4000711	Of course!  "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely."
1DI4000712	So lovely. Selflessness like that is a rare commodity these days. I can see why that particular passage inspired her.
1DI4000713	I was raised at the Abbey of the Road where I was educated until I could receive my Rites of Mission. That's when I first left the Abbey.
1DI4000714	Oh, of course, my child. Something else, then?
1DI4000715	I'm afraid I don't have a copy of the scripture with me, but I can share a few passages.  Here's one of my favorites.
1DI4000716	I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned;
1DI4000717	he has crossed over from death to life.
1DI4000718	I fear Obadiah is in dire straits. What do you want to talk about?
1DI4000719	Obadiah's a good man, but his family has an evil past. This book is an unwanted heirloom, and the foundation of the heathen Krvibi ritualists.
1DI4000720	I told you about their ritual site, remember? See if they're hiding the book there and bring it back to me. From there?  I don't yet know.
1DI4000721	Obadiah sent you?  Well, then, let's see what he has to say.
1DI4000723	Oh dear... no, no.  This can only mean one thing.
1DI4000724	Long ago, the Blackhall family possessed a terrible heirloom, a book of evil rituals, best forgotten. The Krvibi have their origins in it.
1DI4000725	The book was stolen years ago, though the Krvibi have never known of the theft. Their fear has kept the Blackhall Family safe these long years.
1DI4000726	They'd never be so bold... that foul book is back in Point Lookout, and they must have it! We can't allow them to keep it.
1DI4000727	We must get it back before the Krvibi learn anything from it.
1DI4000728	There's a ritual site... I'm certain they'll be hiding it there.  I don't know yet what we must do, but for now it's enough to steal the book.
1DI4000729	Why, I'm just folk.  What more is there?
1DI4000730	Nothing you can catch, if that's what you were wondering. Marsh folk catch it all the time. Lucky my family has a special still pot for tonic-makin'.
1DI4000731	Things aren't wonderful, but I reckon it's hard all around.
1DI4000732	My family's lived hereabouts since well before the War, and I reckon we'll be here a long time yet.
1DI4000733	That old thing's been in my family for years and years.
1DI4000734	Well before the bombs, there was a time folks couldn't get no tonic by law, and my family did okay helping them get what they needed.
1DI4000735	Here I thought you were a quick one.
1DI4000736	Look, sweetie, I reckon you'd have shot me as soon as walked in here if you weren't a kind soul or at least an enterprising type.
1DI4000737	I reckon you can, at that.  I just need some help brewing up a little tonic.
1DI4000738	Well, I - oh, fine. Maybe you're no hogsfool, but I reckon we both come out better if you can help me cook up some tonic.
1DI4000739	Awful malady, I do swear. There's a tonic for it, but I reckon I'm not well enough to make it myself.
1DI4000740	Now that is just an awfully rude thing to say, sweetie.
1DI4000741	Well sweetie, even if you ain't got sympathy in your heart, I think you need the 'ol tonic as bad as me, even if'n you don't know it yet.
1DI4000742	Reckon it's the Orange Fever.  I do feel light in my head...
1DI4000743	Shouldn't tease somebody come down with Orange Fever, sweetie.
1DI4000744	Well, I'll be. Here, let me give you something for your trouble.
1DI4000745	I reckon you've got a deal, sweetie, but I'd better notice a difference in the tonic.
1DI4000746	I reckon I can scrape that together. Go ahead and do what you can for it.
1DI4000747	Aren't you a smart one?  Sweeter tonic's better for both of us, after all.
1DI4000748	They attacked while I slept.  I.. I don't expect to survive.  I only pray that you haven't taken that book to Obadiah. You must take up my mission.
1DI4000749	There is... one way to utterly destroy the Krivbeknih, but you must take a pilgrimage, far north of Point Lookout, in the Capital Wasteland.
1DI4000750	Seek a place called Dunwich. Within is an obelisk, itself a wicked thing.  It'll consume the book - you need only press the book to its surface.
1DI4000751	May God shed his blessings upon you, child. Make haste for Dunwich.
1DI4000752	My God, I am sorry for all my sins with all my heart. In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good, I have sinned against You whom I should...
1DI4000753	The feeling is mutual, child. I'd enjoy sharing my belief in the Faith, if you'll listen.
1DI4000754	No, not exactly. I'd be happy to tell you more about my beliefs, if you're interested.
1DI4000755	That's an ironic choice of words, actually.
1DI4000756	That Cathedral was once a sanctuary of the Faith, true.
1DI4000757	Those who inhabit it now, however, are not of the Faith and won't suffer my presence. So no, child - that Cathedral is no place for me.
1DI4000758	I thought as much. Listen to me very carefully, child. You mustn't bring it to him.
1DI4000759	That book is known as the Krivbeknih, and it's a thing of evil purpose.
1DI4000760	Please, you don't understand what it is you're sent to fetch. That book, the Krivbeknih, is a thing of evil.
1DI4000761	Yes, the Krivbeknih. The Blackhall family has a long, evil history with the book.
1DI4000762	It was lost to them long ago, but it's found a way back to Point Lookout, and Obadiah seeks to reclaim it.
1DI4000763	I will not be dismissed by you!
1DI4000764	That book has been lost to the Blackhalls for generations, and I intend to make sure it stays lost.
1DI4000765	Obadiah's no better than the heathens he's asked you to steal it from. He believes he can use it to control them, and God knows what else.
1DI4000766	There's a way to destroy that damned thing. I intend to do just that.
1DI4000767	I can't promise you money, but I have some medical supplies I can share. Please; it would be a good thing you do.
1DI4000768	I ask no more. You can find me at my tent on the beach, south of Blackhall. God bless your path, child.
1DI4000769	I'm relatively new here myself, but I'll share what I can.
1DI4000770	Swampfolk fetishes or totems. They probably mark territorial lines, or maybe are involved with rituals of some kind.
1DI4000771	I've read about a lot of primitive beliefs that use similar symbols. Vodou magic, Santeria, Obeah. Fascinating, if somewhat disturbing.
1DI4000772	Though the underlying beliefs seem quite dark, I'm not sure they're anything more than an empty set of traditions to the swampfolk.
1DI4000773	Hostile, in a word. I try to observe, but the swampfolk are dangerously aggressive to any outsiders. Lucky for us, they tend to keep to the swamp.
1DI4000774	Sort of - the tents were collapsed when I found them. I was able to put them back together. This one smells the least like a wet Brahmin.
1DI4000775	I restored a terminal in one of the other tents. From that it would seem these tents were originally put here before the War by medical workers.
1DI4000776	I come from the Abbey of the Road. I'm what you might call a missionary. I travel the Wastes, spreading the Faith and doing good where I can.
1DI4000777	Right, I'm from the Abbey of the Road. I'm afraid its location is secret, however.
1DI4000778	HIM! I should have known. My old rival... so close to his family home. Only he would be so stupid.
1DI4000779	He was once a man -- Professor Calvert. The Calverts owned half of Maryland, back when there was a Maryland to own.
1DI4000780	Members of the Calvert family were influential all over the world. They practically owned a deed to the US government.
1DI4000781	In their best days, there were no less than three Calvert family senators, seven members of the house, and two governors.
1DI4000782	They even had a top candiate for president, until that scandal with the dog forced him to drop out of the race. I was particularly proud of that one.
1DI4000783	Calvert is my old rival. Centuries, we've played this game. I knew he'd be stupid enough to hide so close to his family home.
1DI4000784	It's not a matter of hate, it's a matter of destiny. He is my enemy, and I do not suffer any bastard who opposes me to live.
1DI4000785	I knew he was here, and it is my intent to find him, and call down a righteous fucking hammer on his head.
1DI4000786	Figurative, I mean. His head.
1DI4000787	Of course I fucking want you to do something else. You don't expect me to trod around this mudhole my self, do you?
1DI4000788	Or what? You think I haven't been shot before? Think that you, over the thousands who have tried, can take me down?
1DI4000789	You'd best wise the hell up and play along. I'll get what I want, and you'll get rich, and then we can go about our separate goddamn ways.
1DI4000790	So, those half-wits are getting messages from the Professor, right? So, he's off somewhere broadcasting to 'em.
1DI4000791	But without those buggers to do things for him, he can't do much for himself.
1DI4000792	So, we cut off his ability to talk to 'em, and he'll need to try harder. Maybe then I can find the squishy little worm and finish him off for good!
1DI4000793	If I know Professor Calvert, and I do, he's using a high frequency cognitive sine broadcast.
1DI4000794	I have the perfect device to jam up his little talkbox. All you need to do is take it to the highest point on the shore and install it.
1DI4000795	Easy, right?
1DI4000796	Right. Attach it to the bottom car, then turn it on and spin the jammer to the top. No fuckin' problem.
1DI4000797	I'll watch from here and turn it on. Then we'll see where our little professor is.
1DI4000798	Now, go!
1DI4000799	Well, that's just too bad, ain't it? But since you're so afraid, attach the thing to one of the cars and then spin it around to get it to the top.
1DI4000800	I'll watch from here and turn it on when it's ready. Then we'll see where our little Professor is.
1DI4000802	If I know the Professor, he's using a high frequency cognitive sine broadcast.
1DI4000803	I have the perfect device to jam up that little worm's talkbox. All you need to do is take it to the highest point around and install it.
1DI4000805	So, those half-wits are getting messages from the Professor, right? So, he's off somewhere broadcasting to them.
1DI4000807	So, we cut off his ability to talk to them, and he'll need to try harder. Maybe then I can find the squishy little worm and finish him off for good!
1DI4000808	You're goddamn right, I am. Now, let's get on with the work, shall we?
1DI4000809	Nothing but the best for people who stay in my good graces. Now, you ready to stop whining and listen?
1DI4000810	I can't exactly say I'm surprised. You're not thinking about doing it, are you?
1DI4000811	Are you fucking joking? I suppose you aren't. What is it you people use for money these days? Those bottle caps?
1DI4000812	Right. Well, here's a bunch of those. Now go do your goddamn job before my patience runs out.
1DI4000813	Piss off and do what you're told.
1DI4000814	This isn't a game, you twit. Piss off and do what you're told.
1DI4000815	Whatever we are, we are not "buddies."
1DI4000816	Now, what the bloody Christ else did you want?
1DI4000817	If you cross me, it'll be the last fuckin' mistake you ever make in this life.
1DI4000818	Now what else do you want?
1DI4000819	Then why are you wasting my fuckin' time? Don't you have somewhere to be?
1DI4000820	Hey!  Over Here!
1DI4000821	Ok, any second now.  Get ready!
1DI4000822	Here they come!  Second floor, on the right!
1DI4000823	More of them!  On the right, first floor!
1DI4000824	The door on the left!  First Floor!
1DI4000825	They're at the front door!  Get Ready!
1DI4000826	That looks like the last of 'em.  You're a pretty good shot.
1DI4000827	I don't know who you are but you need to help me if you want to stay alive.
1DI4000828	They've been at it all night.  I think they are just about to breach the inner walls. Follow me.  I'm going to go check it out.
1DI4000829	It looks like they are coming in from somewhere upstairs.  Hurry, follow me!
1DI4000830	Go through these doors and up the stairs.  Find where they are coming in and stop them.  I'll be keeping an eye on the cameras down here.  Hurry!
1DI4000831	Ok, now hurry up and seal that hole. It looks like an explosion should do the trick. Maybe there's something explosive near the hole you can shoot?
1DI4000832	Good job blocking off that hole!  Hurry and get in here!  It looks like they are about to breach from the East wing!
1DI4000833	Hurry! Get in there before more of them come out!  Find where they are coming from and stop them.  Just like before I'll be keeping an eye out.
1DI4000834	That's one less way for them to get in.  Follow me.  I think we are about to get hit hard.
1DI4000835	Yeah, here they come.  Grab all the ammo and stimpaks you need.  This is gonna be a rough one!
1DI4000836	If you have any mines, now's the time to use 'em. They could come in through any of the boarded up doors at any second.
1DI4000837	Were you not paying attention? I need you to take that Cogwave Jammer over to the Ferris wheel by the docks.
1DI4000838	Attach it to one of the cars, then raise it as high as it will go.
1DI4000839	That's the only way we'll be able to shut off the Professor's ability to talk to those simple bastards who work for him.
1DI4000840	At some point, Professor Calvert developed the ability to speak inside people's heads. Problem is, he's not so good at it.
1DI4000841	He's using something to boost his power and talk to those Tribal simps. The fools think he's God or something.
1DI4000842	Once I jam up his signal, he won't be able to get them to do what he wants, and I'll be able to find where the little fuck is hiding.
1DI4000843	You saw it. He uses his device to talk to their soft-headed leader in those caves. They think he's a fuckin' god, and they do what he wants.
1DI4000844	The blighters are too stupid to get it right most of the time. But, seeing as how they figured to attack me here, Calvert is getting close.
1DI4000845	But if their "god" goes silent, then they won't be a problem anymore, now will they?
1DI4000846	Well, I'm glad I could be of fuckin' help to you.
1DI4000847	Well, get on with it. We haven't got a lot of time, you know.
1DI4000848	Well, that's good since the game is almost done. He's in the lighthouse, the little fuck. Right under my nose the whole time!
1DI4000849	Hiding behind robots and machines, what a miserable life! Pathetic! He dies now!
1DI4000850	I suggest you hurry your pretty self up. I'm sure the bastard's got some sort of escape plan.
1DI4000851	Now that's more like it. Follow me! You're about to witness the end of an era!
1DI4000852	Not hardly. I'll be here, and you'll be back. But you'd best hurry, or I may reconsider that reward I promised you.
1DI4000853	I've got a lifetime to wait.
1DI4000854	The lighthouse. He's got a lab under there, the little fuck. Right under my nose the whole time!
1DI4000855	I found it when he boosted his signal to try to get through the jamming, when he sent those Tribals to kill my poor pups...
1DI4000856	He's down there, hiding behind robots and machines, sucking life! Pathetic! He dies now!
1DI4000857	Well, aren't you a fuckin' softie. But Calvert is here. He's got a lab under the lighthouse, the little fuck. Right under my nose the whole time!
1DI4000860	At last! Our game is ending!
1DI4000861	When great men rise, they will clash. It's inevitable. Calvert and I are both men of great power.
1DI4000862	But today, our rivalry ends. Now let's go!
1DI4000863	Follow me!
1DI4000864	Well, hurry it up!
1DI4000866	Come over here, boy. Let's talk.
1DI4000867	Come over here, girl. Let's talk.
1DI4000868	At last! He's just ahead! I'll circle around and distract him. You take him from the front.
1DI4000869	All robots! Activate! Destroy Desmond!
1DI4000870	There you are, you slippery bastard! At last! Let's end this, here and now!
1DI4000871	You disembodied, pathetic cerebellum!
1DI4000872	You disgusting, greasy, uncraniumed bastard!
1DI4000877	Ah yes, Mister Lockheart. At last we meet, face to jar. But I'm afraid that at the end of this, it is you who will meet his end.
1DI4000878	So vulgar, Mister Lockheart! After all this time, you still haven't learned to expand your vocabulary! Fool!
1DI4000879	Your words mean nothing to me, Mr. Lockheart. You are a foolish and vulgar man, incapable of the slightest forethought!
1DI4000884	No, Calvert! I brought someone with me, someone very special. This stranger tricked you into letting me find where you were hiding.
1DI4000885	Well, I certainly can do one thing that you can't: I can fucking well walk!
1DI4000886	And you! Always with empty fucking threats and meaningless drivel, but never the will to act!
1DI4000891	Yes, Desmond. But whose side is she on? Do you know? Can you be sure? You always were so bad at choosing your allies.
1DI4000892	Yes, Desmond. But whose side is he on? Do you know? Can you be sure? You always were so bad at choosing your allies.
1DI4000893	You know nothing! You are nothing! If you're such a man of will, attack me and be done with it! Or do you fear for your life?
1DI4000894	Ha! You make me laugh! So proud! So foolish! Yet, you are all talk! Attack me, if you wish to be done with this!
1DI4000899	Yes, Desmond. But who's side is he on? Do you know? Can you be sure? You always were do bad at choosing your allies.
1DI4000900	Well, we shall see, shan't we? Destroy him!
1DI4000903	No! No! Destroy HIM!
1DI4000906	He is my enemy! And you will be rewarded!
1DI4000907	One beyond your imagination! Beyond reckoning! The most amazing gift a living creature can be granted!
1DI4000908	This is a rivalry that has lasted for centuries! You cannot possibly understand with your tiny meaty brain!
1DI4000909	Creatures of great power must collide! It is inevitable!
1DI4000910	Destroy Desmond! Help me to end this, and I will give you a reward beyond your imagination!
1DI4000911	EXCELLENT! Destroy him! DESTROY DESMOND!
1DI4000912	Then you shall die along with him!
1DI4000913	You must decide! Do it now!
1DI4000914	You cannot! The doors are locked! You will remain here until you destroy Desmond!
1DI4000915	Your sickness is irrelevant! If you require it, I shall reward you!
1DI4000916	Talking is irrelevant! He must be destroyed!
1DI4000917	Assist me, and your reward will be great!
1DI4000918	Good! Good... now, come speak with me. We have matters to discuss...
1DI4000919	No! How... how could this... be... ... ?
1DI4000921	I have a very special gift you for, my friend...
1DI4000923	Professor Calvert is never kidding!
1DI4000924	ROBOTS! TO ME!
1DI4000925	You are permitted to talk while you DIE!
1DI4000927	You would have been wise to listen to him!
1DI4000928	ROBOTS! ATTACK!
1DI4000929	Well, I would have expected nothing less from you. And now, I have a very special gift:
1DI4000931	Indeed, I shall! In fact, I have a very special gift for you, my friend...
1DI4000933	Assist me, my robots! I am... under attack!
1DI4000935	You still remember your name? Math? How's your memory?
1DI4000936	When I came back, there were bits in my memory where all I could recall was a white light and a jumble of voices. Crazy, huh?
1DI4000937	But you're not drooling, so you're doing okay. The rest weren't so lucky when they got their heads cut open.
1DI4000938	Hey, now! I might still be ten kinds of crazy! You don't even know me, and you can't tell just from looking!
1DI4000939	I could be the "friendly 'til she stabs you in the neck" kinda crazy. Then where'd you be, smart-aleck? All surprised and stabbed, that's where!
1DI4000940	But I'm not a vegetable, so I'm sane enough. The rest weren't so lucky when they got their heads cut open.
1DI4000941	You sure you're feeling okay in there? You might want to check your head for a scar. We all get 'em after going to that bog.
1DI4000942	Y'know, the last part of the ritual. After you pass out, they get a guy to bring you back, cut open your skull, and "free your mind."
1DI4000943	As in, he rips out a bit of your brain. It's supposed to be the part that "holds you back," but that doesn't always work out so good...
1DI4000944	Anyway, you look like a lively one, so welcome to the tribe! My name's Nadine!
1DI4000945	That's gotta be the sanest thing I've heard all day! Of course, 'round here that's not saying a whole lot. Ritual hit most of them pretty hard.
1DI4000946	Oh, guess you don't know. For the last part of the ritual, after you pass out, this guy brings you back, cuts open your skull, and "frees your mind."
1DI4000949	Me? Nah, not unless you try any funny business. Besides, you already got stabbed enough today.
1DI4000953	I consider it payment for what he did to my poor, sliced-up brain. I was going to do the same to him, but I figured you'd want the honor.
1DI4000954	Seems that when the Tribals would send someone to the swamp, he'd be waiting around to nab them when the Punga seeds gassed them.
1DI4000955	He'd do his amateur surgery for the Tribals and let us wander back, all in exchange for Punga Fruit to trade. Sweet little deal he had going on.
1DI4000956	Yeah, looks like it. When the Tribals would send someone to the swamp, he'd be waiting around to nab them when the Punga seeds gassed them.
1DI4000958	Anyway, I figured you'd want a shot at some revenge, so I put him under citizen's arrest, sorta.
1DI4000959	Yeah, he seemed nice enough, didn't he? I wouldn't have figured it out if I hadn't snuck into his engine room while waiting for you.
1DI4000960	From the look of it, he kept every bit of gray matter he cut out, and he had quite a collection! You can take a look, if your stomach's up to it.
1DI4000961	And while you're in there, feel free to give Tobar my love. Preferably with the sharp end of a hot knife.
1DI4000962	Sounds pretty wacko, right? Well, I wouldn't have believed me either, until I snuck a peek in Tobar's engine room.
1DI4000965	First off, I'm claiming this boat. I put Tobar down, so it's mine, them's the rules of the ocean.
1DI4000966	So that leaves me with a boat, a load of Punga, and a wicked scar. Damn if I haven't earned that adventure I came out looking for.
1DI4000967	Think I'll take over running this ship. I can travel as I like, and always head back to the Wasteland to see mom. Not a bad way to live, huh?
1DI4000968	Of course, you can always ride for free!
1DI4000969	Damn right! Now, why can't the rest of the world figure that one out?
1DI4000973	I don't suppose there's any harm indulging you. What interests you?
1DI4000974	Hundreds of years, and still standing strong. You're within a fine example of Victorian architecture, my friend.
1DI4000975	Just as much as it's named after us, I suppose. We took the Blackhall name when we arrived on these shores, generations before the Great War.
1DI4000976	We do well to remember history, particularly in this dark time.
1DI4000977	We are nothing alike.  More so than you could ever comprehend. Go now, and never return.
1DI4000978	Don't play at what you misunderstand, troglodyte. Get out.
1DI4000979	So leave, then.
1DI4000980	You have it?  God help us; you do. That damned book is back, and this time it'll be the death of me.
1DI4000981	I'll be bloody well damned. She was right.  It's back.
1DI4000982	I... I see. Friend, this book is the bane of my Family. Now it seems it will be the death of us, too.
1DI4000983	I fear the Blackhalls are lost. The only thing left to do is to destroy this evil book, and spare the world further harm.
1DI4000984	I've got to do what Constance should have done in the first place. There's a way to destroy the damned thing, though I will not survive it.
1DI4000985	There is... another option. I could never make the journey myself, though. North, far to the north.
1DI4000986	Constance had a brother, Richard Dunwich. He was a wealthy businessman outside of the city to the north, had a company building there.
1DI4000987	His obsession with the occult was as great as her own, and there's an object of great evil in that building. The book has been drawn to it before.
1DI4000988	To take the book there would destroy it. You would have to take that journey, though, and you must not fail if you attempt it.
1DI4000989	Spare me the details, you goon.
1DI4000990	This isn't some ordinary book we can toss in a fire and be done with.  I can destroy it here and now, but the ritual requires a sacrifice.
1DI4000991	They'll kill me anyway. Now that they've possessed the book, they'll do anything to get it back.
1DI4000992	My friend! This is a truly noble thing you do. You mustn't fail, that book brings nothing but misery and madness to the world.
1DI4000993	Yes, yes. You're right, of course. I... I guess I should begin right away.
1DI4000994	Well, Blackhall Manor isn't abandoned; not yet. At least have the grace to come speak with her owner properly.
1DI4000995	You're in Blackhall Manor.  This isn't a tourist attraction, but I appreciate your good taste. Come, let's talk.
1DI4000996	Tough, are you? Good, I might have use for that. Come, let's talk.
1DI4000997	I'm glad you think so. Conversation is but one of the virtues that separates us from cretins like those swampfolk.
1DI4000998	Swampfolk who, I should mention, absconded with a book, a precious family heirloom. I wanted to ask you, friend; will you get it back?
1DI4000999	Ha! Spoken like a true roughneck. That's good. I could use a person of mettle like yourself. You see, a family heirloom of mine has been stolen.
1DI4001000	This heirloom - a book - has been stolen by those swampfolk cretins. Smash some heads, bring it back, get paid. What do you say?
1DI4001001	Yes, yes, of course. Here's your errand fee. Now, give it to me!
1DI4001002	Surely you're not considering giving it to Marcella? Come now, the woman can't rub two caps together. Give it to me and be paid.
1DI4001003	There's no reason in your keeping that book - my book! Talk to me again when you've come to your senses.
1DI4001004	Can't say that I did, but that's all the more reason you should give the book to me.
1DI4001005	Forgive my indiscretion. Still, with her death I see no reason for you to keep hold of that book. For all you know, the same fate may befall you.
1DI4001006	Ah, Marcella. A religious fanatic in her own right. Don't believe anything the woman says; her mind is as addled as those inbred swampfolk.
1DI4001007	Cash, plain and simple. Return with the book and I'll pay you a thousand caps. No questions asked.
1DI4001008	You best keep this one to yourself, sweetie.   The family tonic gets real kick from our secret ingredient.  We just need a lil' bit of battery acid.
1DI4001009	Oh, don't look like that, now.
1DI4001010	You reckon I'd be around to tell you about it if it weren't safe enough? Bring me six fission batteries and I'll scrape 'em into the mix.
1DI4001011	I thought so. Those things do carry a smell, don't they? Let me take 'em off your hands, then.
1DI4001012	Punga fruit and lots of it. The stuff those loonies make at the church is best. Ten of those will do, but might cost you.
1DI4001013	Wild fruit will do the trick, but you'll need twice as much of it.
1DI4001014	Yeah, ten from the growers at the cathedral, or twenty wild ones.
1DI4001015	Well, that's quite a haul you have there, sweetie. You prefer to hand over the wild or the refined fruit?
1DI4001016	Wild fruit, eh? Just as good, if a sight weaker for flavor.
1DI4001017	I see you sprung for the refined fruit. Good for you, sweetie.
1DI4001018	Sweet and ripe, too. These will do just fine.
1DI4001019	Little scrawny, but they'll do. Thank you, sweetie.
1DI4001020	Well, we'll need yeast. You can find it about anywhere, but there's a big stash on the boardwalk. Three sacks is enough.
1DI4001021	I see. Thank you kindly for these.
1DI4001022	We got everything. Now we wait while it brews. Three days should do the trick.
1DI4001023	Give me some time to brew.
1DI4001024	Sure as a swamp folk's head is squishy.
1DI4001025	I ain't met the gun I couldn't fix.
1DI4001026	Of course. I learned many tricks from my father.
1DI4001027	Certainly. Madam Panada is quite handy with a wrench.
1DI4001028	Soon, your sacred land shall be cleared of all obstacles. No longer shall its mystical powers be diminished!
1DI4001029	At last, yes! Desmond will die, and our long struggle will finally end the only way it could have - with me as the victor!
1DI4001030	Yes, and you will be able to spread your knowledge across the astral plane for all those wise enough to accept it!
1DI4001031	No, not "astral knowledge" you simpleton! Psychic domination! And that still won't be possible until you destroy Desmond's jamming device.
1DI4001032	No need to worry, enlightened one. We shall re-consecrate the mansion, and remove the impurities disrupting your perfect guidance.
1DI4001033	Yes, fine, go destroy the house and its "impurities." Just stop that jammer, and I'll be free of you morons, once and for all!
1DI4001034	Yes, we shall be free of all limitations! Thank you, master. We shall be the instrument of your mighty will.
1DI4001039	Surely you mean that you will TRY!
1DI4001041	Yes! At last! EXTERMINATE HIM!
1DI4001042	What are you waiting for? Why do you hesitate? DESTROY HIM!
1DI4001043	Well, for you... I have a very special gift:
1DI4001045	Betrayal? No no no, betrayal is for lesser men! Your use to me has simply expired.
1DI4001046	And now, I will dispose of you.
1DI4001047	Ha ha ha ha ha! YES! LET'S!
1DI4001049	I certainly hope you enjoy your final moments!
1DI4001051	Don't think of it as betrayal. No no no, betrayal is for lesser men! Your use to me has simply expired.
1DI4001057	You look like a man who's been around the wastes, so I'll cut right to it.
1DI4001058	In Point Lookout, you'll find fresh-grown food, mysterious locales, and treasures as-of-yet un-looted.
1DI4001059	But keep your wits about you, because you'll find more than a few exotic critters and inhospitable locals. So stay here if you're not man enough!
1DI4001060	You look like a woman who's been around the wastes, so I'll cut right to it.
1DI4001062	But keep your wits about you, because there's more than a few exotic critters and inhospitable locals. So stay here if you're too dainty to rough it!
1DI4001063	Ah, but he's not here, now is he? And besides, I'm no stranger! I'm Tobar the Ferryman, at your service!
1DI4001064	Depends what you're looking for. If you need supplies, head to the shop over at the end of these docks. Convenient, and I get caps for referring you.
1DI4001065	If you need a place to stay, there's an old motel further into town. The beds there are still pretty soft, even if it's because they're full of lice.
1DI4001066	And if you're looking for some hunting, there's a fellow named Plik who runs a club out in the northeast. Strictly for high-rollers, though.
1DI4001067	Why do we do anything? You travel the world, kill people, take trophies that interest you, and move on. I'm much the same.
1DI4001068	The only difference is that my trophies are somewhat more medical in nature. Oh, and to be honest, I probably kill fewer people than you do.
1DI4001069	But I suppose it's time that came to an end, one way or another.
1DI4001070	Murder? Really, what would your father say? I thought he raised you better than that.
1DI4001071	You had an awful lot to say about him when you were unconscious. And from the sound of it, he'd be very, very disappointed in what you've become.
1DI4001072	Sounds like he didn't spank you enough as a kid. Maybe I can make up for his lost time!
1DI4001073	Once you've got a ticket, just head into the cabin and settle in on the cot. We'll be there in no time!
1DI4001076	All you have to do is come back to me and buy another ticket! Just be careful not to get stranded short on caps, huh?
1DI4001081	I don't blame you! I wouldn't go down there myself, if I didn't have the option of running back to my ship!
1DI4001082	Just don't come crying to me when a Mirelurk is chewing on your guts!
1DI4001083	Oh, nothing much. Just old Calvert Mansion.
1DI4001084	Just a huge, abandoned estate teaming with who knows what opportunities for profitable scavenging. Y'know, nothing much.
1DI4001085	I know I said Point Lookout was perfect for treasure hunters, but it's a rare day when you get a beacon like that!
1DI4001086	Oh, it's smoke, all right. Where there's smoke, there's fire - and where there's fire, there's profit to be made selling an extinguisher!
1DI4001087	That smoke's coming from old Calvert Mansion. I always heard it was haunted, but more importantly, I always heard it was full of pre-war treasure!
1DI4001089	This and that. Let me know when you want to work out the details.
1DI4001090	That's a righteous shame, but the offer stands. You just say the word, hon.
1DI4001091	Tell you what - have a bit. This is left over from an old batch, but should be a swig or two there. More'n enough to loosen you up, I wager!
1DI4001092	Oh, just about whatever ails you, sweetie!  A real cure-all.  Say, I don't reckon you're the dry type, is you?  Oh, nevermind.
1DI4001093	Well, I don't rightly expect you to help me out of goodness, though I welcome you to prove me wrong, sweetie.
1DI4001094	When we brew this batch of tonic up, you'll have rights to a share for yourself, and a payday of 300 caps to boot.
1DI4001095	What's this? A humble traveler, seeking the guidance of our awakened minds? Truly, this is a glorious day!
1DI4001096	You are from far away, and must be strong indeed to have traveled this far! But strength is nothing without the guidance of the enlightened mind.
1DI4001097	If you seek entry, you must be prepared to expand your consciousness. You must prove yourself worthy to transcend!
1DI4001098	What? No, you're doing it wrong! If you want to join, you're supposed to get into the right mindset, you know?
1DI4001099	We don't just take any recruit, either. You've got to be willing to see the world a different way. You may not understand, but it's important to us.
1DI4001100	And that means you can't get in unless you've gone through the ritual. Don't worry, it's nothing big. But it really does makes a difference.
1DI4001101	You may not be so brave when you face the Ritual of the Mother Seed. Stronger souls than you have attempted it and lost their minds.
1DI4001102	Venture west to the great bog, and within you shall find the mother of all Punga Fruit. She stands taller than a man, and her vines guide our future.
1DI4001103	Collect her seeds, and kneel before her wisdom. Only then will you be ready to enter these sacred halls.
1DI4001104	Your caution is a credit to your wisdom - only a fool eats before he knows the meal. You are worthy to attempt the Ritual of the Mother Seed!
1DI4001107	Much better! Ahem... Wisely spoken, initiate! Your dedication and, um, flexibility shall serve you well in the Ritual of the Mother Seed!
1DI4001110	Okay, be that way. It's called the Ritual of the Mother Seed. Laugh if you want, but it will open your mind to the world!
1DI4001112	Collect its seeds, and you will be welcome in the tribe. Then you shall learn the true wisdom of our ways!
1DI4001113	What are you, my mother?
1DI4001114	Leave me alone, okay?
1DI4001115	As in, slack off? Thanks, but I've got stuff to do, big man.
1DI4001116	I appreciate the advice, but I'm fine, okay?
1DI4001117	I'm not your child, old man.
1DI4001118	You're not the boss of me.
1DI4001122	I'll try, I suppose.
1DI4001124	Yes, mother Woodrose.
1DI4001125	I try to, sir.
1DI4001126	Yes. Simple.
1DI4001129	Your teachings are wise.
1DI4001131	And you as well.
1DI4001132	Thank you. Be at peace.
1DI4001133	That is merely the sensation of your consciousness rushing to embrace its true potential. It is the feeling of having no boundaries. No limits!
1DI4001134	Yea, though your body will bear the scars of the ritual, your soul shall be forever strengthened by the experience!
1DI4001135	You are now welcomed in our cathedral. Enter, enlightened sister!
1DI4001138	You are now welcomed in our cathedral. Enter, enlightened brother!
1DI4001139	For a time, we feared your mind had journeyed too far from your body, and you had departed our world. But you returned to us again, at long last!
1DI4001145	You're still going to be like that, huh? I suppose it was too much to hope that transcendental enlightenment had taught you some manners.
1DI4001146	Oh well, you'll learn some humility eventually, even if Woodrose has to beat it into you.
1DI4001147	Just get inside the sacred cathedral. You're enlightened now, so try to act like it, okay?
1DI4001152	Gotta find some place safe!
1DI4001153	Please, stop!
1DI4001154	I'm getting' outta here!
1DI4001155	Oh, hell no!
1DI4001156	No, I wanna live!
1DI4001161	You're on your own!
1DI4001163	That's it! I'm done!
1DI4001164	Don't you go runnin!
1DI4001165	You git back here!
1DI4001166	Go on, now!
1DI4001167	Get back here!
1DI4001168	Hey! Don't leave me alone!
1DI4001169	Where are you going?
1DI4001170	You go first! I'll cover you!
1DI4001172	Spread out!
1DI4001175	I thought you'd never ask.
1DI4001176	I suppose larceny isn't enough reason to hate?
1DI4001177	That book is of the utmost importance, we shouldn't be chatting idly.
1DI4001178	What else do you want to discuss?
1DI4001179	On with the action, eh?
1DI4001180	Hmm. I dunno, mister. You didn't try to kill me, and you seem pretty nice for a grownup. But still... How do I know I can trust you?
1DI4001181	Hmm. I dunno, lady. You didn't try to kill me, and you seem pretty nice for a grownup. But still... How do I know I can trust you?
1DI4001182	There's not much to tell. What do you want to know?
1DI4001183	I... I can't explain it, but I know what I must do. I'm the last Blackhall.
1DI4001184	You must be new here if you don't know the answer to that by now.
1DI4001185	Yes, they're dangerous. They shoot at, smash or try to eat anything that isn't them, and half the time they shoot at each other.
1DI4001186	They may have been men once, but no more.
1DI4001187	No, not them. That lot wants for brains, but they're at least somewhat civilized. The swampfolk have no creed, no morals.
1DI4001188	They think the book has a kind of occult power. Superstition and nonsense, of course.
1DI4001189	Done? Good. Bugger off.
1DI4001190	Can I go back to work now?
1DI4001192	Let's get to it.
1DI4001193	Begone from my sight!
1DI4001194	Hurry up!
1DI4001195	We're running out of time. Go!
1DI4001196	Now get out of here. Go!
1DI4001197	Well, go on! Get!
1DI4001198	Then away with your tiny insignificance!
1DI4001199	Yes, commune with him, while I see to my tribe. There is much to be done!
1DI4001200	As you please.
1DI4001201	Seeya, mister.
1DI4001202	Okay, lady.
1DI4001203	Sure. Seeya.
1DI4001204	Don't get yourself killed.
1DI4001205	Go with great care.
1DI4001206	Don't be a stranger, now.
1DI4001207	Please, find my daughter!
1DI4001208	I hope you can convince Nadine to come back.
1DI4001210	Back to business.
1DI4001211	Be careful out there. Them swamp folk is nasty.
1DI4001212	Good doin' business with you.
1DI4001213	Come back any time, them swamp types are always bringin' me new stuff.
1DI4001214	Hey, before you go. If you ever want to get rid of that scar on your head, just come and see me, okay?
1DI4001215	Yeah, enough gabbing. Let's move!
1DI4001216	Take the greatest of care in the world, young traveler!
1DI4001217	Return again, young traveler!
1DI4001218	Fair travels, young one!
1DI4001219	Whenever you're ready, just take a rest on the cot in the cabin. We'll be at Point Lookout in no time!
1DI4001220	Good travels to ya!
1DI4001221	Yes, away with you!
1DI4001222	Blessings to you on your journey.
1DI4001223	Be well.
1DI4001224	May you find your way.
1DI4001225	At last! The world is rid of that sniveling, disgusting, arrogant, brain!
1DI4001226	Think of it! Everything he learned! Everything he had! It's all here and it's all MINE! MINE!
1DI4001227	I'm busy. What do you want?
1DI4001228	Good. More questions. I guess we're best fuckin' friends now.
1DI4001229	I wasn't aware that we had anything else to say to each other.
1DI4001231	You! You... BASTARD! Betray me? You fuck! You think you can betray.. ME?
1DI4001232	You have one chance. Exactly one chance to fucking redeem yourself in my eyes.
1DI4001233	We are going to go in there, and we are going to end this once and for fucking all. And you will help, or you will be my enemy.
1DI4001234	And you do NOT want to be my enemy.
1DI4001235	Let's go! Before he has time to prepare!
1DI4001236	Come! He's close by!
1DI4001237	I can smell him! He's just through here!
1DI4001238	At last! The world is rid of that sniveling, disgusting, arrogant brain!
1DI4001240	I'm Desmond.
1DI4001241	What are you waiting for? DESTROY HIM!
1DI4001242	DESTROY HIM!
1DI4001243	DESTROY DESMOND!
1DI4001244	Kill! Kill! Destroy! Kill!
1DI4001245	At long last! Desmond is dead! And you, my friend... I have you to finally thank for it!
1DI4001246	We can't speak now!
1DI4001248	No! Later!
1DI4001249	And long last! Desmond is dead! And you... I have YOU to thank for it!
1DI4001251	How dare you violate my inner sanctum!
1DI4001252	I demand that you exterminate Desmond at once!
1DI4001253	Make your choice!
1DI4001254	Decide!
1DI4001255	Robots. It bloody figures.
1DI4001256	Keep up! He can't be far!
1DI4001258	Come on! He can't be far!
1DI4001259	Are you ready to go, princess? I've got a rival to kill!
1DI4001260	Are you ready? Who knows what he could be setting up in there!
1DI4001261	What the hell? Are you ready to go yet?
1DI4001262	That bastard! That... BASTARD! He killed my pups! Nearly killed ME! For WHAT?
1DI4001263	He doesn't have the body to fuckin' do it himself, so he tried to blow me up? ME? Well, this ends today. Desmond Lockheart will finally win out.
1DI4001264	I know where he is. He overplayed his hand this time. You and me are going to walk in there and end this.
1DI4001265	I knew it! I knew that little bastard was behind all this! After all these years, he's stuck his head out, and this is my chance to cut it off!
1DI4001266	Figuratively speaking, of course.
1DI4001267	Is there something on your mind?
1DI4001268	You're not getting' any ideas, are you?
1DI4001269	Be careful. Professor Calvert's a tricky git.
1DI4001270	It's me little helper. Don't you have a job to do?
1DI4001271	Why are you in here starin' at me? Didn't I give you something to do?
1DI4001272	You again? Shouldn't you be climbing that wheel?
1DI4001273	You shouldn't be here. Get out of my home.
1DI4001274	You were paid for your errand. Leave my home. Now.
1DI4001275	Keep your distance.  What are you doing in my house?
1DI4001276	Good, good. People should be able to sit and have a conversation, especially in times like these.
1DI4001277	Civil discourse; the greatest of our lost arts. Wouldn't you agree?
1DI4001278	The book. You've found it. Quickly, give it to me.
1DI4001279	We had a bargain, roughneck. Hand the book over and collect your fee.
1DI4001280	Shouldn't you be halfway to the ritual site by now?
1DI4001281	Well, what can I do for you now?
1DI4001282	Wait a moment. I need to know; has Obadiah sent you in search of a book?
1DI4001283	Please; there's nothing for us to discuss until you retrieve that book from the ritual site. You must hurry.
1DI4001284	Greetings, child. I'm Marcella, missionary and student of the Faith. How are you?
1DI4001285	Speak your mind, love.
1DI4001286	...thing on? Oh, I don't know why I even bother with it.
1DI4001287	Good things, sweetie. Tonic's brewed and bottled.  Here's your pay and cut of the batch. Enjoy it!
1DI4001288	Y'ain't have the look of a local, son.  Think you could help a sick woman get on the mend?
1DI4001289	Y'ain't have the look of a local, young lady. Think you could help a sick woman get on the mend?
1DI4001290	You said you'd mend the still, sweetie. When did you plan on getting' to that, exactly?
1DI4001291	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. For this fee, the tonic had better taste like honey, though.
1DI4001292	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. You're a peach.
1DI4001293	Thanks for mending the still, Sweetie. Here's your pay.
1DI4001294	Well, if it ain't my favorite out of towner.
1DI4001295	Welcome to Banckom Secure Teller. Vocal authorization requested.
1DI4001296	Safety deposit access granted. Have a pleasant day.
1DI4001297	This is a hazardous area. For your own safety, please vacate the premises.
1DI4001299	Shh... My meditation requires utmost concentration.
1DI4001300	Hello? You are... a fellow seeker of the higher planes, perhaps? What brings you here?
1DI4001301	You certainly make quite an entrance. It's a shame about what's-his-name, but frankly, he would have gotten himself killed, eventually.
1DI4001302	I would have done it myself, if I only had arms to throttle him. Now, let's hope you're more useful than that one, yes?
1DI4001303	So, you're the mouse that was scurrying around here? Not much to look at, but at least you're not drooling all over yourself. I can work with that.
1DI4001304	Now then, perhaps you can be more useful than that simpering spiritualist and his tribe of idiots.
1DI4001305	Looks like another newbie in the tribe! And still able to string together whole sentences - ain't you the lucky one!
1DI4001306	You infiltrated those Tribals, yet?
1DI4001307	No, no. Don't try to get up yet. You'll only hurt yourself.
1DI4001308	You are welcome to our tribe.
1DI4001309	Who lingers at the threshold of transcendence?
1DI4001310	Return with the wisdom of the Mother Punga, or not at all!
1DI4001311	Considered my offer, have you?
1DI4001312	What've you got for me?
1DI4001313	Truly, the Mother Punga has bestowed her wisdom upon you, and your mind has been expanded!
1DI4001314	So, my hero, huh? Think you came in and rescued me right in the nick of time?
1DI4001315	Not hardly. Had it all well in hand, and I didn't even need to use the failsafe.
1DI4001316	But that would've done a real number on some of the paintings, so just as well you were here. Anyway, name's Desmond.
1DI4001317	Help me take out these bastards while I figure out a plan.
1DI4001318	Do you mind? There's a tiny matter of a home invasion that I'm trying to repel.
1DI4001319	Welcome, my friend! I am Tobar the Ferryman, and this fine vessel is the Duchess Gambit.
1DI4001320	We're just back from Point Lookout, but it won't be long before we set off again. Interested?
1DI4001321	Welcome to Point Lookout, my friend!
1DI4001322	The trip was fine, the weather's nice and damp, and everything out there looks pleasant as ever!
1DI4001323	Looks like nothing's changed since my last visit... except all that smoke I saw on the way in.
1DI4001324	You! Are you going to Point Lookout? I need your help!
1DI4001325	My daughter stowed away on the Duchess Gambit a few weeks ago, and I've been worried sick ever since.
1DI4001326	I haven't heard anything from her, but if you're going there, could you look for her? Please, I'll do anything to help!
1DI4001327	Questions before we head out?
1DI4001329	So, you wanna keep playing?
1DI4001330	Gosh. How'd you find me so fast?
1DI4001331	It's your turn to hide now.
1DI4001332	Man, I was sure that was the last place you'd look.
1DI4001333	Now you hide!
1DI4001334	He he he. Okay, now it's your turn to hide!
1DI4001335	I'll count to ten. Go!
1DI4001336	Ah you got me!
1DI4001337	Caught me.
1DI4001338	Shucks. You're fast!
1DI4001339	You made it past my traps? Er, I mean: Get out of here, mister! Aren't you afraid the ghost will get you?
1DI4001340	You made it past my traps? Er, I mean: Get out of here, lady! Aren't you afraid the ghost will get you?
1DI4001341	Hi! What's up?
1DI4001343	Hi. Did you want something?
1DI4001345	Welcome! Welcome to my extraordinary Safari. Shall we get you registered?
1DI4001346	You'll find a button inside. Give it a push and we'll get started.
1DI4001347	Tremendous showing! I do hope the experience was worth every cap.
1DI4001348	Let's commemorate your first safari with a token of our friendship, shall we?
1DI4001349	This axe was, er, 'misplaced' by one of my other patrons. She won't be needing it anymore, and it's a weapon of gruesome distinction. Enjoy it.
1DI4001350	Welcome back. Do we fancy a bit of bloodshed?
1DI4001351	Mr. Plik's really outdone himself this time.
1DI4001352	Good show! Very well fought.
1DI4001353	So you're number three? Well, let's get this thing goin.
1DI4001354	You're welcome, by the way. You know, for saving your ass?
1DI4001355	Hurry and seal that hole from the attic!  If you don't have any grenades then see if there's something nearby you can shoot that will explode!
1DI4001356	Well, if it isn't my favorite traveler! And oh, what a trip you were on!
1DI4001357	Why, when you were under, you should have heard some of the things that came out of your mouth!
1DI4001358	But I suppose you're more interested in what came out of your head, aren't you?
1DI4001359	This projection device is insufficient for my desires. It disgusts me.
1DI4001360	Silence! I have no time for your meaty prattle!
1DI4001361	There is too much to contemplate without your pathetic mewling interrupting my important calculation!
1DI4001362	Leave me! I have much to plot and plan!
1DI4001363	Please wait until my meditations are complete.
1DI4001364	A moment, please.
1DI4001365	Pardon me while I commune with the higher planes.
1DI4001366	You are new! And you are welcome!
1DI4001367	I am Croatoa. I am not so new.
1DI4001369	Here to give me a piece of your mind?
1DI4001370	Yes, you nasty little cuss?
1DI4001371	Oh, here comes trouble.
1DI4001372	Well, hello there! Welcome to... uh... welcome to Haley's Hardware! Where we have... hard... ware...
1DI4001373	Good to see y'all alive, friend.
1DI4001374	Welcome back to Haley's Hardware!
1DI4001375	Y'all here to buy something? Step right in!
1DI4001376	Yes, fellow seeker?
1DI4001377	Hey, just in time! Found out who went rooting around in our skulls, and you'll never guess who it was!
1DI4001378	As a totally unrelated hint, I'm in charge of his boat, now!
1DI4001379	We having fun, yet?
1DI4001380	Guess we never got a formal introduction, huh? Name's Nadine!
1DI4001381	I know you're not from around here, so what brought you out here? You looking for your fortune or running from your troubles?
1DI4001382	Well, hello there young traveler. The fates had told me that I would receive a visitor today.
1DI4001383	But I'm being rude! I am Madam Panada, and this is Madam Panada's House of Wares! For all things a traveler needs, I am here to provide!
1DI4001384	Bullets! Stimpaks! Armor! Weapons! Junk! If you need it, Madame Panada has already anticipated your need and procured it months ago!
1DI4001385	Oh, it is good to see you well, young traveler! And what brings you to Madam Panada's?
1DI4001386	Oh, I knew you would return. How may Madam Panada assist you?
1DI4001387	Greetings once again, young traveler! Do you have a need?
1DI4001388	Another new member? What, are we offering a special?
1DI4001389	Punga may have offered you wisdom, but it looks like it's still going to be a while before you really learn to accept it.
1DI4001390	Until then, you answer to me. I'm Woodrose, the tribe mother.
1DI4001391	Yes, my oh-so-wayward child?
1DI4001392	Something troubles you?
1DI4001393	Oh, I hope you can find my Nadine.
1DI4001395	Well, if it isn't our hero.
1DI4001396	Oh, you're back!
1DI4001397	<There is no answer>
1DI4001398	Hello, traveler!
1DI4001400	Rest awhile, friend.
1DI4001401	Unburden your mind.
1DI4001402	Relax.
1DI4001403	Have you seen Marcella? What did she have to say?
1DI4001406	It pains me to say it: but thank you.
1DI4001407	I think our business is concluded.
1DI4001408	You're still here, are you?
1DI4001409	Ah ha! At last!
1DI4001410	This never fuckin' ends! You and your pathetic threats!
1DI4001411	Oh, here we fuckin' go again!
1DI4001412	And here we are again, I'm so fucking sick of your empty threats.
1DI4001413	I'll have none of your posturing!
1DI4001414	Always so full of talk, Calvert!
1DI4001421	Relax. He's okay... for now...
1DI4001424	Relax. She's okay... for now...
1DI4001425	Easy, girl. I'll work it out soon...
1DI4001426	Now, there's a good pup...
1DI4001429	We need to talk.
1DI4001430	Please have your password ready.
1DI4001431	Ah, I see you have returned to our world once more!
1DI4001432	Come on, hurry up!
1DI4001433	Move your ass.
1DI4001434	Hurry it up.
1DI4001435	Welcome aboard!
1DI4001436	I need your help!
1DI4001437	My, my. Look at you.
1DI4001438	You findin' your way around, sweetie?
1DI4001439	High roller, coming through!
1DI4001440	In the mood for a bit of violence?
1DI4001441	Step right up.
1DI4001442	I didn't come here to make friends.
1DI4001443	Try not to fall. Nothing down there but dark and rads.
1DI4001444	Mines help, if you got 'em.
1DI4001445	Stay close - we'll both be better for it.
1DI4001446	Warmest regards.
1DI4001447	Ug-Qualtoth is returned. Be afraid, worms.
1DI4001448	You are not welcome in this place.
1DI4001449	Our business is at an end. Leave this place.
1DI4001450	Would it have killed you to wipe your feet?
1DI4001451	Try not to get the filth on you while you're out there.
1DI4001452	You should have seen this place thirty years ago.
1DI4001453	Lots of people out there, but too few trustworthy.
1DI4001454	Did you want to talk?  I won't bite.
1DI4001455	Go with God, child.
1DI4001456	Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.
1DI4001458	This is fun!
1DI4001459	<Laughing.>
1DI4001462	<Whistling tunelessly.>
1DI4001463	I also can do repairs, if'n you need it.
1DI4001464	Take a look around. Let me know if you need anything.
1DI4001465	New people mean new business, so I'm always happy to see y'all.
1DI4001466	We don't get a lot of new folks in here.
1DI4001467	Always good to see a stranger.
1DI4001468	The fates have given me a vision of your future... I see you buying quality merchandise at low prices!
1DI4001469	The fates have told me that I have something you need. It is upon you to select well.
1DI4001470	It is all good merchandise, no? Surely you will need some. Now... or in the future!
1DI4001471	If you see something you need, simply ask me!
1DI4001472	Welcome, traveler! Stop by, and have a look at the wares! The fates have told me that you have a need...
1DI4001474	Welcome to the Duchess Gambit!
1DI4001475	Curious about Point Lookout?
1DI4001476	Ready to head back?
1DI4001477	Looking to travel?
1DI4001478	Clear your mind, child.
1DI4001479	Empty your thoughts, child.
1DI4001480	Let your earthly cares slip away, like a pebble in the sea.
1DI4001481	The physical world holds nothing for us. Release any lingering connections to it.
1DI4001482	Learn from the Punga. Accept simplicity.
1DI4001483	Embrace the simple things in life.
1DI4001484	Trust in the wisdom of your higher mind!
1DI4001485	Submerge your will in the depths of the astral sea!
1DI4001486	I'm watching you, child.
1DI4001487	New girl, you try too hard. Be calm.
1DI4001488	Good to see you still here, my child.
1DI4001490	Go past the flesh.
1DI4001491	Transcend.
1DI4001492	Mind at ease.
1DI4001493	Escape to the mind.
1DI4001497	Stop it! That hurts!
1DI4001498	Ahh! My eyes!
1DI4001499	Shot my head!
1DI4001500	Bastard! My head!
1DI4001502	Ahh! My arm!
1DI4001506	Right in the leg!
1DI4001516	Damage detected.
1DI4001520	I've been hit!
1DI4001531	I can smell you...
1DI4001532	Come out and play...
1DI4001533	I'm gonna find you...
1DI4001534	C'mon out, we ain't gonna bite!
1DI4001535	Ollie ollie oxen free...
1DI4001537	I'll find you...
1DI4001541	You mine now!
1DI4001543	There you is!
1DI4001547	You better leave swamp! You hear me?
1DI4001548	Booo... no more playing.
1DI4001549	No fair! They ran!
1DI4001550	Aww... Gone? I wanted to play...
1DI4001551	Damn. Got away.
1DI4001552	I guess they ran off...
1DI4001553	Hrm... oh well...
1DI4001554	Must've ran. Coward.
1DI4001556	I hear someone movin'!
1DI4001557	That was no rattie!
1DI4001558	I hear noises!
1DI4001559	You hear something?
1DI4001561	I heard something. I'm gonna go check it out.
1DI4001566	You no belong here, outsider!
1DI4001567	Never shoulda come here!
1DI4001568	Come at me, and you'll draw back a nub!
1DI4001569	We gonna bury you in 'dis swamp!
1DI4001570	Kill 'im!
1DI4001571	Stranger! Kill!
1DI4001572	Stranger! Git 'im!
1DI4001573	Get out our swamp!
1DI4001574	Fresh meats!
1DI4001575	Gonna turn you into tasso!
1DI4001576	You done mess up now, outsider!
1DI4001578	You mess up now!
1DI4001579	Oh boy! Time for fun!
1DI4001580	Hey! Who you be?
1DI4001581	Woohoo! Time to play!
1DI4001583	You! Stop!
1DI4001585	Help me out over here!
1DI4001588	Keep your hands we're I can see 'em!
1DI4001589	I see you, thief!
1DI4001590	Get your hands out of there!
1DI4001591	Ah, keep it! I don't need it.
1DI4001592	Huuurrgg!
1DI4001593	Eeeeyyyaaaagghhh!
1DI4001594	Grrrrrah!
1DI4001595	Yarrrg!
1DI4001596	Hrrrrrah!
1DI4001597	Nice try. Your payment is coming, and you're not getting a fucking pence until you're done.
1DI4001598	Now, did you come here for something, or are you just wasting my time?
1DI4001599	*cough* No, sweetie, this is the Orange Fever, and unless I get somebody to help me whip up some tonic, I'm as good as dust for the grave.
1DI4001600	Well, we got a bargainer here, haven't we? No, dear, it brews just fine as it is, thank you.
1DI4001601	Oh, I think I can wait a little while longer before I head back. Say, long enough for you to get five hundred caps...
1DI4001602	Nope. I'm doing just fine on my own. Gonna keep it that way. Find someplace else.
1DI4001603	Nuh-uh. That's not Kenny-Bear!
1DI4001604	My only secret is patience. If I could share it with you, I would.
1DI4001605	Hey. What's the big idea? I don't mess with your stuff. Don't mess with mine.
1DI4001606	Put that back, thief!
1DI4001607	Thief! Stop!
1DI5000001	Sure I do! I found a secret place they've never noticed. You want some of the stuff I have? Come on, I'll show you!
1DI5000002	Oh man, I don't know... a teleport jammer, maybe? Right, space ships have those, don't they?
1DI5000003	Yeah, sure. a teleport jammer.
1DI5000004	It's holding fine for now, I guess.  It should help with the bastards teleporting onto the ship.
1DI5000005	Oops! I didn't see those two. There's a door on the left I can open though. You should try and go that way. Sorry!
1DI5000006	Wait here for just a second. I can do something to distract them. When you hear the noise, go to your left, okay?
1DI5000008	Use that door on the left! Hurry!
1DI5000009	They're not looking. Run down the stairs and out the door at the bottom.
1DI5000010	Don't worry about those aliens, they won't hurt you. You should just leave them alone, okay? No reason to be mean to them.
1DI5000011	This vent goes a different way, so you'll be by yourself for a while. Don't worry, I'll catch up! Be careful!
1DI5000012	I can't believe you killed him, he has it just as bad as us.  I'll see you later.
1DI5000013	Never was really good with those tin cans. I deal with blood and guts better than wires and gizmos. That's why I became a doctor.
1DI5000014	Well, I would have been helpful, but seems like you already did plenty of damage in there.
1DI5000015	Heck yeah. I can take apart and put together a Protectron with my eyes shut. I'll go with you. Lead on.
1DI5000016	Whatever they're assembling in there, I ain't gonna be much good to you. I never was much of a builder.
1DI5000017	What's the point? You already did a good bit of the place. Nah... I'll just stay here and guard the Engine Core.
1DI5000018	Hmmm. Sounds like I may be of some use in there. If there are other people in stasis, I could help revive them or something. Just watch my back.
1DI5000019	I was never very good at the science stuff. But let me know if you need me to fix anything... that's my specialty.
1DI5000020	Well seein' as I don't even know what a Cryo or a Lab is, I'm guessin' no.
1DI5000021	Gun? No thanks. I've spent enough time patching up the mess that guns make. I'm no killer.
1DI5000022	Guns were never quite my thing. There were... let's just say there were other folks to take care of that.
1DI5000023	Might want to ask somebody else to help with that.
1DI5000024	Now you're speakin' my language. Hell yeah, I'll come with you.
1DI5000025	Okay. Whatever you think is best.
1DI5000026	Putting me on guard duty, huh? Swell.
1DI5000027	Fine. If I see any aliens, I'll say hello for you.
1DI5000029	All right, all right. Let's both calm down.
1DI5000030	Okay, but you just watch yourself.
1DI5000033	Are you nuts? Watch it!
1DI5000034	What the...? What the hell are you doing?
1DI5000035	What the hell is wrong with you?
1DI5000036	You want to die young? Fine by me!
1DI5000037	Come on, make it look good!
1DI5000038	Hit me! Come on, hit me!
1DI5000039	Yeah, we're really fighting now, aren't we?
1DI5000040	Youkai me oujo sei!
1DI5000041	Towaaaaaa!
1DI5000042	Oryaaaaaa!
1DI5000050	Take them down!
1DI5000052	Come on, you bastards!
1DI5000053	Oh, you want some of this?
1DI5000055	I'll bury every last one of ya!
1DI5000056	I'll blast you in half!
1DI5000057	I'm puttin' you down!
1DI5000058	End of the road for you!
1DI5000059	Kill all of 'em!
1DI5000060	If I go, you're comin' with me!
1DI5000065	That thing can't be good.
1DI5000070	Uwaaaa, shikaeshi saretaka...
1DI5000071	Ugaa!
1DI5000072	Unnn gwa!
1DI5000073	God...damn...
1DI5000074	Not here... not now...
1DI5000075	Can't... breathe...
1DI5000076	No... please...no...
1DI5000077	Sorry... I...
1DI5000081	No... NO! You bastards!
1DI5000083	It's not over... you hear me!?
1DI5000084	Sons of bitches!
1DI5000085	To General Constantine Chase, Anchorage Command. Encoded message 457980-A. Decryption applied.

1DI5000089	General Victor Breckenridge, U.S. Army Quartermaster Command Forward Depot, Oregon.
1DI5000090	More could bust in at any second. Get ready!
1DI5000091	Okay, okay. Just trying to lend a hand.
1DI5000092	Hmmm, maybe we could destroy a section of the assembly line and punch through to the next room.
1DI5000093	Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.
1DI5000094	This place is incredible. Can you imagine having stuff like this in the Wasteland? You'd even be a match for the Brotherhood of Steel.
1DI5000095	Wow! That thing really blew up! I'm going to hang back here until you clear out the next room.
1DI5000096	That's got to be the generator. Let's destroy it and get back to the engine core.
1DI5000097	There! That ought to give the aliens something to think about. Now let's get the hell out of here.
1DI5000098	Once that core gets exposed, blast it!
1DI5000099	Well, isn't this fancy, all these shiny machines and such. Gotta find a generator, huh? Let's see... How about we start with that teleporter thing?
1DI5000100	I'm not totally sure what I'm doing here, but I'll try and tinker with it. You just make sure I don't get shot, okay?
1DI5000101	This is... this is incredible! I'm... I'm Colonel Hartigan, of the United States Air Force.
1DI5000103	I'm sorry, what? I don't understa... Oh, speak into this? Yes, I was saying, I'm Colonel Hartigan, United States Air Force.
1DI5000104	Our nation has been conducting manned spaceflight tests... I'm sorry, you'll have to forgive me. Frankly we never expect to meet you all!
1DI5000105	I'm sure there's a great deal that our two species can learn from <zap>
1DI5000106	Oww! What the Hell? What is this, what are you doing?
1DI5000107	They hit something big! Shields and Elliott are down!
1DI5000108	They just took out our shields!
1DI5000109	One of those shots must have hit the core, all power is down!
1DI5000110	Lights out! They must have hit something and now nothing is working!
1DI5000111	Shit, they hit the core and sapped our power.  Look around for some buttons or something to restart the generators.
1DI5000112	Lights out, they killed our power!  Maybe there's some buttons or something around here to restart this hunk of junk.
1DI5000113	That looks like it's working, keep up whatever you're doing.
1DI5000114	Things are flashing again! We got flashing things! You must be doing something right.  Keep it up!
1DI5000115	Aye aye!
1DI5000117	Eh.
1DI5000119	I got it!  The deathray is working and will be fully charged in 30 seconds!
1DI5000120	All right, it's all ready to fire! Push your big blue button and lets end this.
1DI5000121	This is just like the last time.
1DI5000122	I think I'm actually getting the hang of this thing.
1DI5000123	When you really look, it doesn't seem that hard at all.
1DI5000124	And I'll go over here. I can be Stella Skyfire! She was Captain Cosmos' weapons specialist, back in season 2. This is great!
1DI5000125	Look, that must be the Captain's chair! You should sit there -- you can be Captain Cosmos!
1DI5000126	Wow, look at this place! It looks like the ship in Captain Cosmos!
1DI5000127	I could use one of those stimpaks if you don't mind.
1DI5000128	If it means we all live through this, then yeah. Be happy to.
1DI5000129	I ain't no goddamn space monkey.
1DI5000130	They just keep coming.
1DI5000131	This is almost fun.
1DI5000132	Yippie ki yay.
1DI5000133	Wow! This looks just like the bridge on Captain Cosmos!  I know what to do!
1DI5000134	Somah, you go stand over there...
1DI5000135	Mr. Elliott, you're there...
1DI5000136	Paulson... you can be Jangles the Moon Monkey...
1DI5000137	and I get to aim the Death Ray!
1DI5000138	Try hitting some buttons, one of them has to do something.
1DI5000139	Try hitting that button down there.  It's flashing, it probably does something good.
1DI5000140	I think I have that ship targeted, but you'll have to find the firing control.
1DI5000141	I never thought I'd get to do something like this!
1DI5000142	Yeah, teach them a lesson!
1DI5000143	This is like playing a holo-game, only better!
1DI5000144	I've got a lock on their ship, fire when ready!
1DI5000145	The squiggles around their ship are going away, but there's more appearing by their gun.
1DI5000146	Their shields are at full.
1DI5000147	The enemies shields are down! Fire! Fire! Shoot 'em!
1DI5000148	70%, we need to end this fast.
1DI5000149	This ship's half dead and if that death ray isn't online soon we're dead right along with it.
1DI5000150	20% and plummeting, we're losing systems like crazy.
1DI5000151	We're at about 70%.
1DI5000152	Ship's at 50%, we can't take much more of this.
1DI5000153	20%.  I hope you've got a plan.
1DI5000154	Can't be sure if I'm reading this right, but it looks like they're hitting us pretty hard.  Hull integrity is at about 90%.
1DI5000155	Hull integrity looks to be about 80% and falling.
1DI5000156	The hull's at around 60%, we need that death ray online now.
1DI5000157	40%, do something.
1DI5000158	Ship's at 30%.  I hope you have something up your sleeve.
1DI5000159	10%, we're about to lose life support systems!
1DI5000160	Looks like they're doing a number on the ship, hull is at 90% and falling.
1DI5000161	80%, you should try one of these consoles, it might be shields or something.
1DI5000162	At about 60%.  Do something.
1DI5000163	The ship's at 40%, we're goners.
1DI5000164	30%.  This is not good.
1DI5000165	10% and the ship's failing!
1DI5000166	Who the hell knows, these controls are just a mess.
1DI5000167	I'm working on it, all right?
1DI5000168	Fuck you and this whole fucking situation.  They'll work when they work.
1DI5000169	Holy shit.  Where did that come from?
1DI5000170	Why won't you work!
1DI5000171	Work damn you!
1DI5000172	I push this, it doesn't do anything, I push THAT, it doesn't... oh hey that did something.
1DI5000173	It looks like they're dropping shields to prepare for a big shot.
1DI5000174	Damn it.  Their shields are back up at max.
1DI5000175	Hmm, looks like I'm at the helm.  I'll have these controls figured out in no time at all.
1DI5000176	I have these buttons pointing at that big blob, I think that's right.
1DI5000177	I was scared for a while, but this is awesome!
1DI5000178	What? Talk into this thing? Just... talk? I don't have to do anything else?
1DI5000179	Ow! All right! <Zap!> Ow! I said all right! Just stop!
1DI5000180	Hello. Um... hello. My name is Andrew Endicott.
1DI5000181	On the night of May 17th, the year our Lord 1697, I was... I was taken.  From my home in Salem Village.
1DI5000182	I... I do not know where I am, exactly, or why I came to be here.
1DI5000183	I have seen, through... windows... the stars, and sun, and beloved Earth. Down there, below me.
1DI5000184	So it would seem I am aboard some vessel, suspended in the ether. Ironically, it would seem, so close to where I thought Heaven must surely lie.
1DI5000185	But this is not Heaven. And my captors are not angels. I am not entirely unconvinced that the scripture is wrong. That Heaven and Hell are reversed.
1DI5000186	For my captives are devils. Demons from my nightmares. Even now they watch me, make me talk.
1DI5000187	They seem to want me to tell my story. I know not why. A record of their deeds, perhaps? Or am I just a pawn in some... some evil game.
1DI5000188	And there are others. Other... captives, I mean. From whence they came I cannot say.
1DI5000189	Some wear strange dress, as if they are from... a different time. And some are... frozen! As in ice! Unmoving! But, I think... alive.
1DI5000190	I believe they plan the same fate for me.  Will I be frozen, too?  Will I...
1DI5000191	Ow! Stop it! I did what you said! You wanted me to talk, so I talked! Just leave me! Leave me be!
1DI5000192	What? What the fuck is this thing? Ya got some kind of Martian sex machine, you sick fuck? Uh uh. No way.
1DI5000193	Ahh! God DAMNIT! Fuckin' crazy-ass Moon Man! Go ahead! Do your worst!
1DI5000194	Gaaaaahh!! Jesus H! Do you not get it, space cadet? I. Do. Not. Fucking. Understand. What. You. Want. Me. To. Do!
1DI5000195	This thing? This? What? Talk? I AM talking! What do you want me to say?!
1DI5000196	Blah blah blah, yakkety yakkety! That all you assholes can say?! Space men with all this science, and you can't even speak fuckin' English?
1DI5000197	Okay, how's about this. My name is Vin. I am on a fucking UFO. I'm from Flatbush, and I want to get home. Can I get a taxi, please?
1DI5000198	How's that? Huh? That work for ya, starstruck?
1DI5000199	What? Don't you raise that fuckin' thing to me again... Oh, you gonna hit me again? Is that...
1DI5000200	Agggghhhhh!! Sonofa... Why don't you go back to Uranus, huh? Ha ha ha <zap!> Agggh!
1DI5000201	Yes, yes, I understand! I've seen the others. I'll do what you want.
1DI5000202	This is Doctor Morrison Rand, Professor of Anthropological Archaeology at Banfield College, Humboldt, Orgeon.
1DI5000203	Shortly after 10:00 p.m., on August 16, 2041, as I was leaving the college campus, headed to my car, I saw a blinding light.
1DI5000204	It just... appeared. In the sky, directly over me. I was blinded. I also found my body completely immobilized. I couldn't move, not at all.
1DI5000205	What happened next is... hazy. I don't remember much. But what became clear later - what is certainly clear now - is that I was abducted.
1DI5000206	I am now the captive of an alien race, one of many people held here, against our will. And, like those others, I am recording who I am.
1DI5000207	Why? Because the aliens want us to, for some reason. They have us do it right before they put us into some kind of... suspended animation.
1DI5000208	These recordings... It's almost as if we're creating our own library catalog entries, before we get put into a giant collection.
1DI5000209	The entire experience would be fascinating if I weren't so completely terrified.
1DI5000210	What? Stop? You want me to stop now. All right! All right, see? I'm stopping...
1DI5000211	Oh! I see! Like a tape recorder, right? You just want me to talk? I can do that, certainly.
1DI5000212	Hello there! I'm Madeline Wallace. Of the Cincinatti Wallaces?
1DI5000213	Well, I... I'm here, on this rocket ship. I'm with the strange men, the space men. The ones who brought me here.
1DI5000214	My entire family is onboard, actually. My husband, Roy, daughter Margaret, and my son Arthur, as well.
1DI5000215	Oh, you should see Arthur! He's so excited. He says this is much better than the things they show on Captain Cosmos.
1DI5000216	And I have to say - I agree! Everything is just so... fantastical! I can only hope our hosts have been talking with Uncle Sam.
1DI5000217	Because with these doohickeys, we'd have the Reds beat in no time! He he he he.
1DI5000218	Hmmm? I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'm doing my best. I really don't know what you want me to say.
1DI5000219	Whomever will listen to this recording, I would just like to state that if you find yourself in the same boat as the Wallaces, don't be afraid.
1DI5000220	I'm not entirely sure what our hosts want, but the situation has been entirely acceptable. We have been treated fairly.
1DI5000221	Anyway, the space man is waving his little electrical stick thingy, so I think I'm done. Goodbye!
1DI5000222	Oh god, what are you doing to me? What's that thing? Get it out of me!
1DI5000223	Ahhh.... that hurts... oh, please... stop... no.... <grunting>
1DI5000224	<growling noises>
1DI5000225	I can't feel my legs... what did you do to my legs...
1DI5000226	...Frank? I can't see you...
1DI5000228	Frank? Frank! What did they do to you?!
1DI5000230	Ahhhhhhhhhh!!
1DI5000231	Private Lawrence Mears, U.S. Army Medic, Serial Number 3476511.
1DI5000233	AGH! Fuck! You... can do what...ever you want to me... I'm not saying jack sh...Stick it where the... sun don't shine...
1DI5000234	AGGGH! Oh my g... P-priv.. ate Law-lawrence M..mea..rs. U.S. Ar...army M-m-m...edic...
1DI5000235	Where am I? Where's my sister?
1DI5000236	I can hear some weird noises, but I can't see you. Why is it so dark in here? What's this machine? Please... someone talk to me!
1DI5000237	I want to go home! Please! Where's my mommy and daddy?! I just want to go home!
1DI5000238	OW! That's bright! Ugh... wait... what... OH MY GOD! NOOOOOO! Stay away from me! GET AWAY!
1DI5000239	Hey now. No reason to get yourselves worked up. Whatever you need, I'm going to tell it to you.
1DI5000240	Well, I'm pretty sure you want me to talk into this thing, so here goes.
1DI5000241	My name is Giles Wolstencroft... I'm the current Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Vault-Tec Corporation.
1DI5000242	I was inspecting the construction site of Vault 76 when I was captured by what I can only assume are alien beings from another world.
1DI5000243	I'm not sure what they want from me, or what they will do to me, but whatever they need, I will readily provide.
1DI5000244	Perhaps if I can bridge our communication gap and establish a rapport with them, we can enter into an exclusive trade agreement.
1DI5000245	In fact, instead of talking to this damn machine, I'm going to attempt to address them directly.
1DI5000246	On behalf of the Vault-Tec Corporation, I'd like to extend a heartfelt welcome to you. Wait... you don't need that... wait! WAIT! <zap>
1DI5000247	What are we gonna do? They just threw me in this cell with you after they poked and prodded me and now I just hope they won't kill us.
1DI5000248	Just take it easy. If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead. They must need something from us.
1DI5000249	Yeah! They need us for FOOD or something! You saw that guy! He was all... cut open... like he'd been butchered! Oh my god! We're gonna be next!
1DI5000250	Hey! I said, calm down! If they hear you they may come for us. Try and take it easy!
1DI5000251	NO! GET US THE HELL OUT OF HERE! <pounding noise> SOMEONE! GET US OUT! PLEASE! <pounding noise>
1DI5000252	I said to SHUT UP! <slap>...  I'm... I'm sorry I did that. Please, forgive me. But we need to keep our heads on straight if we're going to survive.
1DI5000253	Please, please. I just want to go home... I just want to go home...
1DI5000257	Well, this is just ridiculous! I demand to see whomever's in charge!
1DI5000258	OW! What the? Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?!
1DI5000259	AGH! Stop it! I am a U.S. Senator and I warn you... if any harm comes to me, you'll bring the full wrath of the U.S. Military upon yourselves!
1DI5000260	What? Where are you taking me?! Get your goddamn hands off of me! You'll all pay for this! The U.S. doesn't bargain with aliens!
1DI5000261	I'm Holly Barrisford, a linguistics specialist for the U.S.S.A. I think I'm beginning to understand you, but you need to stop shocking me!
1DI5000262	Damn. I wish you could understand me. <Alien Noises>. Do you understand?
1DI5000263	That's it. You get it. I mean you no harm, I just want to learn how to speak with you. Then perhaps we can discuss what you need from us.
1DI5000264	What are you doing with that needle? No! Get it away from me! NO! PLEASE! We can be friends! You don't need to... ahhhhh.
1DI5000265	Our defenses consist of 3 battalions of light infantry, 34 pieces of field artillery, 108 armored vehicles and 42 aerial vehicles.
1DI5000266	We have 38 ICBM's always on alert and ready to fire when the word is passed down from the White House.
1DI5000267	The codes to activate the launch sequences are... are... uhhngh.... no... I can't let you... uggh... get out of my mind!
1DI5000268	Agggh! The c-codes... are... ugh.... no... I can't betray... AGH! My head! I can't... won't... AGGGGH! Agggh...
1DI5000269	Just wait until I tell Marsha and Karen about this! Imagine... I'm actually on a SPACEship!
1DI5000270	Oh, they're pointing at... oh, talk into this? What is this? Is this the space phone?
1DI5000271	Hey Marsh, this is Janet. You will NEVER guess where I am. Never. Ohhhh... I wish I could hear you, but I'll just tell you. I'M IN SPACE!
1DI5000272	I was driving along the highway when there was this light... and suddenly I'm on this real spaceship! No joke!
1DI5000273	Now these little green men are making all these noises and pointing at stuff trying to talk to me! I bet I'm the first one they've met!
1DI5000274	So I figure I'll talk with them a while then I'll join you later and I can tell you all about it over lunch! Oh! If only I had my camera!
1DI5000275	Well, they're pointing at some table with all sorts of gizmos sticking out of it. Gotta go. Kisses!
1DI5000276	This is my final message. If this doesn't work, I hope someone gets this recording and can bring it back to earth.
1DI5000277	I've been able to figure out how to use some of the alien devices, like this recorder, and I think I know what they want with our world.
1DI5000278	They mean to take as many of us as they can and change us into... some sort of abomination. Many have been killed because of their experiments.
1DI5000279	They've been keeping us in cells, and then moving us one by one to their experimentation labs. I've managed to escape, but they are looking for me.
1DI5000280	You've got to send help up here. As far as I can tell, they're never going to stop until they've captured hundreds... maybe thousands of us.
1DI5000281	The good news is that they're totally reliant on technology. Without it, they're no tougher than you or I.
1DI5000282	A small, well-equipped force could take this ship and free all of the prisoners on board. That's your best chance.
1DI5000283	I've got to keep moving, so I need to hide this tape. Good luck to all of us, and godspeed.
1DI5000284	Oh man... what did you... why can't I feel my arms...
1DI5000285	...wait... are those... are those MY ARMS? WHAT DID YOU DO? OH GOD, PUT THEM BACK! PUT THEM BACK ON!
1DI5000286	Hello, Mr. Alien. Yeah, I know... I'll talk into the thing.
1DI5000287	I don't know why you brought me back here. We've done this a whole bunch of.... Hey! Giddyup Buttercup! Wow!
1DI5000288	I always wanted one of those!... Why do you have one?
1DI5000289	I don't understand... What do you want? It's a toy. A TOY. Why are you so excited? You're weird.
1DI5000290	<sobbing>
1DI5000291	Please.... just please, let me go...
1DI5000292	<mechanical sounds>
1DI5000293	<Mooing>
1DI5000295	Oh man, I've seen this on TV...
1DI5000296	...you're going to eat me, aren't you? I'm like some sort of delicacy on your planet, right? RIGHT?
1DI5000297	Well I hope you choke! I hope you stuff your stupid little green faces and choke to death!
1DI5000298	...Unless this is like that other show where I get put in some sort of weird alien zoo... That might be okay...
1DI5000299	Hey look, Giddyup Buttercups! All the rich kids had them.  Waste of money if you ask me.
1DI5000300	You've got to be kidding me... I saw posters like these all over the ruins.  Never actually saw one 'til now.
1DI5000301	Now that looks like some tough ridin'. Those things real?
1DI5000302	Well I'll be damned...look at all 'em!
1DI5000303	Look, even more of them.  Buttercups that is.
1DI5000304	Huh, I wonder what they're doing with them.
1DI5000305	Giddyup.
1DI5000306	This is kind of disturbing.
1DI5000307	OK, this is getting a little ridiculous now.
1DI5000308	Why look at what we got here.  Little girl here ridin' one of those horses.  Giddyup Buttercup...kind of catchy ain't it?
1DI5000309	Oh wow. I remember these posters plastered all over the place back home.
1DI5000310	They even have some of the posters I've seen scattered about the Wastes. Looks like they're studying them...or idolizing them, not sure.
1DI5000311	What kind of horses are these anyway? I can't see anyone havin' any respect ridin' into town on one of those things.
1DI5000312	What are they doing to the Buttercups?
1DI5000313	Oh OK, now it all makes sense...
1DI5000314	Hell, my horse never did that...
1DI5000315	Our situation didn't get any better by the looks of what happened here. I say we get the hell out of here.
1DI5000316	Curious, but I don't think I want to know the answer judging by what happened here. Let's not stay long, this place gives me the creeps.
1DI5000317	I wouldn't go jumpin' down there if I were you.
1DI5000318	Now that's what I call a trash chute. I wouldn't get too close, don't wanna fall in or anything.
1DI5000319	Well, that's one way to take out the garbage.
1DI5000320	Nuka what?
1DI5000321	Thirsty? Heh, I wonder if the aliens love this stuff as much we do down below.
1DI5000322	Nuka-Cola! You know, they came out with this stuff called Nuka-Cola Quantum way back. Now that was some powerful stuff. I can still taste it now.
1DI5000323	Holy hell.
1DI5000324	I wonder what a well placed grenade could do to that thing.
1DI5000325	What is that thing?
1DI5000326	More gas.
1DI5000327	Check your weapon, they're venting in gas again.
1DI5000328	They're trying to gas us again.
1DI5000329	Epoxy over here.
1DI5000330	All right, some epoxy!
1DI5000331	Grab some of that epoxy, our weapons could use the field repair.
1DI5000333	Welcome to the bowels of this shit hole.
1DI5000334	This place is filthy.
1DI5000335	What's going on in there?
1DI5000336	Looks like they're repairing something in there.
1DI5000337	Those guys in there look busy.
1DI5000338	Gas.  Flammable gas.
1DI5000339	Smells like they're pumping in flammable gas.
1DI5000340	They're flooding the room with gas.
1DI5000341	Well, yeah. I suppose you could say that.
1DI5000342	My story? Same as you. I don't know where the heck I am and I want to go home.
1DI5000343	Yeah? What is it? Spit it out.
1DI5000344	Well, I guess if you find the right one, it'll be your friend for life. Find the wrong one, and it'd rather throw you than carry you.
1DI5000345	Good, I aim to keep it that way. I'll work with you, but I'm not here to make friends.
1DI5000346	Look, you do the healin' and I do the killin'. Besides that, what do we have to talk about?
1DI5000347	You know, for a little lady, you're pretty smart. I just hope you were smart enough to pick the right horse when you broke this stranger out.
1DI5000348	Just stay out of the way of my bullets when I'm shooting the aliens, and you'll do just fine.
1DI5000349	Well, see, that's your problem. You thought, but you're wrong. Now, isn't there some bandages you should be makin' or somethin'?
1DI5000350	Sure, what did ya want?
1DI5000351	Naw. Just me and my sister. I dunno what happened to my parents.
1DI5000352	Yeah. My sister. I think she's on this ship somewhere.
1DI5000353	Well, I saw her once. When I first woke up on this ship, but I haven't seen her since.
1DI5000354	We were together when the aliens took us from home. I saw her on the table next to mine when I woke up on this ship.
1DI5000355	Then you stand WAY back, because it gets really hot and goes 'kaboom'!
1DI5000356	Then, you push down these other things here. See? The ones that keep it cool.
1DI5000357	First, you push the button to make the generator come up from the floor.
1DI5000358	I've seen the aliens use these a bunch of times, so I'm an expert.
1DI5000359	Okay, here it is. Neat, huh?
1DI5000360	Wow! So you got to ride horses? Real, living horses? I've never even seen a real living horse. What are they like?
1DI5000361	Yeah. I mean, everything was all blown up and really dirty. There were lotsa sick people everywhere too, and lotsa people crying.
1DI5000362	How come people still die then after they get hurt even when a doctor is around?
1DI5000363	That's funny, sounds like the way people can be too!
1DI5000364	Sigh. I wish that they could fix that. I hated being down there.
1DI5000365	So if I get hurt, will I die?
1DI5000366	Aw, don't worry. I always pick good friends.
1DI5000367	Maybe we should just stay up here then! I hated when it was like that!
1DI5000368	So you promise to fix me if I get hurt?
1DI5000369	You seem like you know your way around this ship. Have you been looking for something?
1DI5000370	I dunno... all I heard was that one side or the other started dropping bombs and it just all went to shit.
1DI5000371	Your sister? How do you know that?
1DI5000372	You don't get it 'cause you've never been down there! It's all gone, Tercorien. Doesn't matter who won or who started it.
1DI5000373	Well then, I'll help you keep an eye out for her. Okay?
1DI5000374	Yeah, yeah I guess so. Sorry. I keep forgetting this is different for you. I grew up in the ruins and you didn't.
1DI5000375	Same as when you were down there you mean?
1DI5000376	No, I mean what's your deal? Where are you from? We don't know anything about you.
1DI5000377	You don't seem the soldier type, Tercorien. Why the heck did you join the army in the first place?
1DI5000378	That about sums it all up. The world is still a huge mess.
1DI5000379	Look, cowboy. We need to work together to get out of here. So like it or not, you're stuck with us. You can drop the "lone gunman" routine.
1DI5000380	Ever pull the trigger on that gun? You know, ever kill someone?
1DI5000381	There isn't anyone left to fix anything. Everything's in ruins, people are still fighting to survive and I don't see anything that can change that.
1DI5000382	Fine, fine. I get the message. You know, you were warmer when you were frozen.
1DI5000383	So they don't know who started it or who won?
1DI5000384	Your sister's up here? Have you seen her?
1DI5000385	Then I don't really have anything to go back to, do I? I mean, my family's gone, my friends are gone... everything I knew is gone.
1DI5000386	Hey, don't worry. If she's up here, we're going to find her. Okay?
1DI5000387	Yeah... all the time. I was a doctor, so it was my job to try and make everyone feel better.
1DI5000388	I guess so. I can't believe they went ahead with the nukes. I mean, they wiped everything out! How stupid could they be?
1DI5000389	Well... I just thought, ummm... we should get to know each other. I mean after all, we're watching each other's backs. So...
1DI5000390	Well... I mean... sometimes they're hurt so bad, there's nothing I can do. The human body is very hard to, um, hard to "fix."
1DI5000391	Join? I was forced into service. I worked in a hospital before I was in the army. They put the gun in my hand.
1DI5000392	Well, I just thought...
1DI5000393	No, no, no. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen to you. Everything's going to be just fine.
1DI5000394	Once. I had no choice. It was either him or me. I hope I never have to do it again.
1DI5000395	Oh, you'll know them when you see them.
1DI5000396	You push this button, and then this big thing is like WOOOSH and it comes out of the floor...
1DI5000397	...and then there are these things you press down and it goes SHHHHHHH and then you'd better get out of the way. You'll see.
1DI5000398	Actually, I do. I used to tinker with all sorts of junk back home.
1DI5000399	I'd be glad to take a look at what you need fixed, but it's going to cost you some caps.
1DI5000400	Sure. Let me see.
1DI5000401	Yeah. So, you want to take me up on it or not?
1DI5000402	Maybe to you it does, but hey... I gotta think about the future. If we get back down there and I'm broke, how am I going to survive?
1DI5000403	You know as well as I do that there are no handouts in the Wasteland.
1DI5000404	Sure, I'd be glad to.
1DI5000405	Oh come off it, kid. If and when we get off this ship, I'm going to need something to keep me alive down there.
1DI5000406	You and I both know that there's no handouts in the Wasteland. It's every woman for herself. Take it or leave it.
1DI5000407	Good, I'm glad we see eye to eye. Now, let me see what you need fixed.
1DI5000408	Suit yourself. Maybe you can ask one of the aliens to help you. Or, when you come to your senses, you can ask me.
1DI5000409	Fine. I'll be waiting for you to change your mind when your equipment starts to fall apart.
1DI5000410	All right. Let me see what you have.
1DI5000411	Yeah, I think so. Before I was shipped out to Anchorage, I was trained in cryoscience. We were hoping to apply that to medicine.
1DI5000412	The compounds we used weren't that different from this cryogenic liquid. I'm pretty sure I can make us some improvised weapons from it.
1DI5000413	I'm thinking something along the lines of cryo grenades and cryo mines... I don't know yet.
1DI5000414	Check back with me in about an hour and I'll see what I can do.
1DI5000415	Yeah, sure did. I was able to make a few cryo grenades and cryo mines.
1DI5000416	I can make more, but I'll need around three more hours. Keep checking back with me and I'll tinker with it.
1DI5000417	Here you go. Hope you're making good use of them. If you need more, I should have a batch ready in about three hours.
1DI5000418	Not yet. Still working on them.
1DI5000419	I'd really like to, but when I woke up on this ship for the first time all of my medical gear was gone.
1DI5000420	I saw that the aliens on this ship have some sort of viscous stuff they slather onto wounds; some kind of biological gel.
1DI5000421	Get me some of that, and I might be able to mess around with it, make some sort of Adapted Biogel we can use on ourselves.
1DI5000422	Sure, here you go. They should work pretty well... but watch out for side effects.
1DI5000423	I'm still going to need more alien biogel before I can make any more of the healing gel.
1DI5000424	He's not going anywhere. Why don't we just hold on to him, and try to negotiate? Y'know, like a hostage?
1DI5000425	And how are we supposed to do that? We can't understand what the hell they're saying!
1DI5000426	I don't know, but maybe we should... there must be something...
1DI5000427	No sense discussin' it now.
1DI5000428	I don't know for certain. I can get them on their feet and moving for maybe a few minutes at best.
1DI5000429	There's no way for me to tell what the aliens have already subjected them to. I can't understand these readouts. Their pain could be horrible.
1DI5000430	This technology is out of my league so I'm just going to have to improvise. It's the best I can do.
1DI5000431	Yeah, I was considering that too. We can't let the aliens experiment on them any more. It just isn't right.
1DI5000432	But maybe we should give them a chance to fight with us. It's better to die that way than to live through years of agony.
1DI5000433	Well, we have to do something! We can't just leave them in there like some sort of a lab rat to get poked and prodded and cut open!
1DI5000434	We have to either let them fight and die like soldiers or at the very least put them out of their misery!
1DI5000435	Thanks. I'm really not sure what's best for them. What did you decide?
1DI5000436	I... I guess you're right. Let's get the fuck out of here.
1DI5000437	I suppose you're right. Don't worry, they won't feel a thing.
1DI5000438	Just remember they won't be alive long so we need to keep moving as fast as we can.
1DI5000439	I'm going to need to watch their vitals carefully as I use the medical console to pump them full of the correct fluids and bring them back.
1DI5000440	When I give the signal, you open the tubes with that switch. Don't open them until I tell you or the results could be unpredictable.
1DI5000442	What the hell are you doing?! Don't press that!
1DI5000443	Wait!  I think that's some more of my squad!
1DI5000444	It's Daniels and Beckett!
1DI5000445	There's got to be a way to revive them with their memories intact so they won't attack us on sight.
1DI5000446	I think I may be able to use this medical equipment to bring them out of stasis properly.
1DI5000447	The aliens have already injected them with all sorts of compounds I don't recognize... I don't know how it will affect them when they awaken.
1DI5000448	The tubes are filled with an oxygen compound to sustain them. If I just shut it down, they won't feel a thing.
1DI5000449	That's it then. They're... they're gone.
1DI5000450	Rest in peace men. You deserve it.
1DI5000451	Okay, let's see.  This must initiate the thawing process. Blood pressure looks normal.  Heart rate...normal enough.
1DI5000452	Whew. I hope to god this works... Open the tubes. If I did everything right, they'll still be alive.
1DI5000453	All right squad, listen up. I know you have no idea what's going on, but you'll just have to trust me.
1DI5000454	We were captured by the aliens... the things that grabbed us from Anchorage and now we're free.
1DI5000455	Here, take these weapons and follow me. Let's show them what some motivated U.S. soldiers can do!
1DI5000456	On me, squad! Let's go!
1DI5000457	Okay.  Lets put these guys to use.
1DI5000458	I don't know what to do. These guys are the last of my squad... they're my friends.
1DI5000459	If I revive them maybe they could help us. I'm not sure they'll last very long, but if we leave them... you saw what the aliens did to the others...
1DI5000460	I had no choice... I.. I had to do it. You saw. They would have killed us. Damn it!
1DI5000461	Why couldn't you just wait before you opened their pods? If you don't trust me enough to listen to me, why did you drag me down here with you?
1DI5000462	Ah forget it. It's too late now. They're dead and there's no way to bring them back. Let's get the hell out of here.
1DI5000463	What the hell did you do that for? There might have been a chance to save them! What the fuck is wrong with you?!
1DI5000464	If you don't trust me enough to listen to me, why did you drag me down here with you?
1DI5000466	What the hell did you do that for? I thought we agreed to leave them alone!
1DI5000467	What if we would have found some way to revive them safely and returned here? Then they may have had a chance!
1DI5000469	What the hell are those aliens doing in there?
1DI5000470	Look at all these cryogenic chambers. They must be planning to fill them all with specimens from our planet!
1DI5000471	Is that some kind of operating room? Wait a minute... what the... no... NO!
1DI5000472	That's my squad in there!  What the hell are the aliens doing to them?
1DI5000473	You green bastards!  Get your hands off them!
1DI5000474	There has to be a way to release their containment seal!  Maybe there's a button or something on this console.
1DI5000475	How do you like that, you fucks!? How's it feel to be on the other end for a change!
1DI5000476	Experiment on this, you sons of bitches!
1DI5000477	Oh my god... no... I can't believe they did this to you. Why wasn't I here sooner? I could have stopped them.
1DI5000478	That's it. I'm sick of running. Let's finish these aliens off and get the hell home.
1DI5000479	No... it can't be. Is this their plan? To capture THIS many people from earth? Oh my god.
1DI5000480	They're flanking us from behind.  Quick, find some cover.
1DI5000481	So that's the generator.  Now how the heck do we destroy it?
1DI5000482	I think when we opened the door to the operating room we set off some kind of containment alarm.
1DI5000483	The room seals itself up and it looks like it's being flooded with some sort of decontamination gases. Pretty high-tech stuff.
1DI5000484	Unless I miss my guess, it will cycle itself and unlock the doors in a little bit. We'll just have to wait it out.
1DI5000485	Not sure. We'll just have to wait for the system to cycle.
1DI5000486	Elliott... Is that you?  What... What's going on? Where the hell are we?
1DI5000487	Agh...feels like someone rearranged my insides. What happened to us?
1DI5000488	Hmmm. Let me take some of this cryogenic compound back to the engine core. I might be able to make some use of it.
1DI5000489	Wait just a second...
1DI5000490	Give me a minute, I'll try to get these doors open for you.
1DI5000491	Wow, that looks dangerous. See if you can turn it off while I try and figure this door out.
1DI5000492	Uh-oh. I think they found a way to get to you. I'll try and get the next door open fast!
1DI5000493	Hang on! One of these buttons has got to open that door...
1DI5000494	Oh yeah, they definitely know we're here. Don't let them sneak up on you!
1DI5000495	What's this button.. Whoa! Hey, can you hear me down there?
1DI5000496	Go away, meanie! Just you wait 'till my friend gets here!
1DI5000497	Sure, there's a teleporter nearby that I found. Race ya!
1DI5000498	Okay, I'll try and find a way to help you get out of there. Otherwise, see you back at the core.
1DI5000499	Watch out, more are coming from behind you. I'll try to block their progress.
1DI5000501	Go, go!
1DI5000502	What are you waiting for?
1DI5000503	Get a move on!
1DI5000504	We're almost out of here! I'll meet you up ahead. Hurry!
1DI5000505	Their radios got quiet all of a sudden. I'd be careful if I were you...
1DI5000506	Hey, it's not like this was a wasted trip. Check out the storage closet I found here.
1DI5000507	I told you so! Ambush!
1DI5000508	Let's get back to the core and never speak of this again.
1DI5000509	You really must have hit your head. Unless you're Captain Cosmos and have a rocket pack we can use, that's not happening.
1DI5000510	Aliens! Look out!
1DI5000511	Cows? We got cows!
1DI5000512	Oh, I get it! We're in one of their trash cans that move around the ship. I always wondered where these things go...
1DI5000513	Hey, we're moving... Cool!
1DI5000514	We're stuck. Let me see if I can figure something out.
1DI5000515	Do you think we were noticed?
1DI5000516	Uh-oh...
1DI5000517	I'm sorry, okay!? How was I supposed to know this would happen?
1DI5000518	I think I'm okay. You don't look so good, though.
1DI5000519	I think we're in the trash section of the ship. Yucky!
1DI5000520	Yeah, you're probably right. Wait, did you feel that?
1DI5000521	No way! Well, maybe a little. I bet we can find something neat, though!
1DI5000522	Yeah, it is kinda stinky in here... Did you cut the cheese?
1DI5000523	Watch out! The damn things are comin' from the generator room!
1DI5000524	Well, I thought I've seen it all... what the hell is that thing?
1DI5000525	Woah. I dunno what those tall shiny things are, but I'd stay away from them if I was you.
1DI5000526	Holy hell... those towers made outta lightnin' or somethin'?
1DI5000527	Come on, come on. You going to play with those buttons all day? We need to keep moving.
1DI5000528	All righty. Here's how it's gonna go down. You point, I shoot, aliens die. All of the crazy gizmo stuff is up to you.
1DI5000529	The hell if we're dyin' up here... take 'em out!
1DI5000530	Keep hittin' those buttons and take 'em down when you can!
1DI5000531	Come on you alien sons-of-bitches!
1DI5000532	I'm trying to hold 'em off!
1DI5000533	Damn aliens got up here again!
1DI5000534	Here comes another one off of those shiny discs!
1DI5000535	Heads up, more aliens comin' in!
1DI5000536	Tricky bastards are comin' outta the woodwork!
1DI5000537	Watch it! They're comin' up here!
1DI5000538	How many of these things are there?
1DI5000539	Scratch one generator machine. That oughta piss those aliens off! If we're done here, we should get back to the others.
1DI5000540	Finally. Let's get rid of that machine and then get the hell outta here.
1DI5000541	Woah... I've never seen anything like that in my life.
1DI5000542	I'll stay up here to draw a bead on the aliens as they rush us. If they get near those towers... hit the buttons and fry 'em!
1DI5000543	Hold on there... don't take another step. No telling how far down that goes.
1DI5000544	I dunno what that sound is, but it can't be good. Watch yourself, I think we're about to have company.
1DI5000545	Damn, looks like that thing isn't working. We'll have to find another way to get up to the top.
1DI5000546	Now, let's see. One of these buttons has to turn those shiny discs back on... then we can zap ourselves around.
1DI5000547	There's a whole bunch of important looking gizmos up there. That's gotta be where the generator machine is.
1DI5000549	Well, not really shut it off... More like blow it up. If you turn off the coolant, it'll get really hot and then explode, so be careful, okay?
1DI5000550	You have to shut that off to open the door here.
1DI5000551	What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with it?
1DI5000552	I've seen these all over. They put people in them, and the people go to sleep. They stay asleep for a really long time, too.
1DI5000553	Be careful if you touch them, though. They're really cold.
1DI5000554	I don't know. I've never talked to them. Sometimes I'd come and look at them, and wonder why they're dressed like that.
1DI5000555	You see that one guy? He has this really neat suit on... like armor or something!
1DI5000556	And that other guy? He looks just like a cowboy! I saw pictures of cowboys in books. I never saw a real one, though.
1DI5000557	Well, because he's got a spacesuit! Can't go out in space without one. And if we're going to escape, we need to go outside.
1DI5000558	If they turned off the elevator things, that's the only other way to go. So we need a suit. See? Simple!
1DI5000559	This is going to be so neat!
1DI5000561	No it's not. They almost never catch me. You'll see.
1DI5000562	I can help, honest!
1DI5000563	Watch, you'll see.
1DI5000564	Sure!
1DI5000565	Sure! I love exploring, and it's been a while since I've been out and about.
1DI5000566	We'll have to be careful, because they'll be mad that we're out. But it's okay, I know how to get through the steamworks.
1DI5000567	We need to get to the big engine room, so I can show you the rest of the ship. Let's go!
1DI5000568	There's wires and stuff inside the wall there. A while ago I learned which ones to put together to make the doors work.
1DI5000569	There's all kinds of stuff in the walls, but I guess you're too big to see. But that's okay, I can get to it just fine.
1DI5000570	Come on, we need to get to the big engine room so I can show you the rest of this place. I can help you even more!
1DI5000571	Oh, I know. They're always mad when they find out I've been out of my cell. They're gonna be REALLY mad when they see what you did.
1DI5000572	But it's okay. I'll go with you! I can show you around some. I've seen a whole bunch of this place already.
1DI5000573	We need to go through the Steamworks to the big engine room. From there we can see all sorts of places. Come on, I'll help you get there.
1DI5000574	Hello? Hi! Hi there! Listen, can you let me out of here?
1DI5000575	Please let me out. I can help, honest!
1DI5000576	Can you let me out of here? Please?
1DI5000577	Oh, I've been here a while. A long while.
1DI5000578	Sometimes I can sneak out of my cell and go explore. I've seen a bunch of the ship. It's pretty neat, but they always catch me and put me back here.
1DI5000579	I don't have any family anymore.
1DI5000580	My mom and dad died a while ago, before I ended up here. Y'know, back when all the bombs dropped on everything?
1DI5000581	Yeah, it was right after that. And then me and my sister, we got pulled up here... Except I haven't seen her in a long time.
1DI5000582	Sidekick? Who the hell said anything about a sidekick?
1DI5000583	That's a shitty attitude, kid, because unless you're willing to work with me, you're going a whole lot of no place.
1DI5000584	It's going to take both of us to get out of this place.
1DI5000585	They're keeping an eye on us, you know? Watching us. So I say we give 'em a little show.
1DI5000586	Give 'em a reason to pay a little extra attention to us.
1DI5000587	A little of both. It's always worked for me in the past, no reason to second guess it now.
1DI5000588	Okay, now's our chance! GET 'EM!
1DI5000589	Well, at least it wasn't coming for us...
1DI5000590	Great. No way to open this that I can see. What do we do now?
1DI5000591	Yeah, that's what I've got. I don't see you coming up with anything brilliant, Mr. I've Been Here Five Whole Minutes.
1DI5000592	Yeah, that's what I've got. I don't see you coming up with anything brilliant, Miss I've Been Here Five Whole Minutes.
1DI5000593	Hell if I know. But at least it's a start. It's better than sitting here waiting for them to experiment on us even more.
1DI5000594	I think it's worth a try. What's the worst that could happen? Nothing changes, only we've got a few more bruises. Big deal. Let's give it a shot.
1DI5000595	I promise I'll go easy on you.
1DI5000596	Are you kidding me? Kid, I've looked. Trust me. Ain't no other way out of this little box they got us in.
1DI5000597	You wanna satisfy your curiosity, fine. Go ahead. You poke your little nose around and see what you come up with.
1DI5000598	You've gotta be kidding me. You always this paranoid?
1DI5000599	Think about it. You been lyin' here a while now, out cold. If I wanted you dead, why wait till now?
1DI5000600	I could've just made sure you never woke up. No fuss at all. But I didn't, did I?
1DI5000601	So yeah, I'm thinkin' you can afford to show me a little trust. Now are we doin' this, or what?
1DI5000602	Hey, whoa now. Let's not go down that road, sweetie.
1DI5000603	Take a second and think before you start sayin' stuff that'll get you killed.
1DI5000604	I'm telling you, we're gonna have to work together. You keep talkin' like this and I'm gonna have to get out of here on my own, after I put you down.
1DI5000605	So are you in, or what?
1DI5000606	All right, good girl.
1DI5000607	Now let's not get too rough here, okay? Gotta make it look good, but don't want to do any serious damage.
1DI5000608	All right, good boy.
1DI5000610	Uhh... okay... So, does that mean you're in?
1DI5000611	All right. I'll hold back on you, make sure you don't get too roughed up, okay?
1DI5000612	And you be ready. Soon as they come in to get us, you take 'em down.
1DI5000613	You gotta be kidding me. You've already looked, haven't you? You know there's no way out.
1DI5000614	My plan's gonna work. You gotta trust me, kid!
1DI5000615	Okay, see now you're getting me frustrated.
1DI5000616	You look around here, you tell me there's some other way to do this, and I'll listen. But I'm telling you this'll work.
1DI5000617	Yeah? Well then wake the hell up, 'cause I'm tired of being stuck in it.
1DI5000618	Sorry kid, but this is really happening. You're stuck here, just like me.
1DI5000619	Me? I'm the same as you, I figure. Went pokin' around someplace I shouldn't have, and now I'm payin' for it.
1DI5000620	So you and me? We're stuck here, until they decide they want to prod us some more, or worse.
1DI5000621	Man, I can't believe this. This is what you call... what is it, irony? Hell, I don't know.
1DI5000622	Crazy, ain't it? I thought I'd seen some shit out there in the Wastes, but nothin' like this.
1DI5000623	Not a whole lot of good news goin' around right now. If you're lucky, they'll leave you alone for a while. If not...
1DI5000624	Well, then it's been nice chatting with you.
1DI5000625	You and me both, kid.
1DI5000626	Wish I'd never heard that damn radio signal. Thought I could scav some tech from whatever it came from. Sure as hell wasn't expecting this.
1DI5000627	Whoa, whoa. Settle down there, kid. I'm not gonna hurt you.
1DI5000628	Take a second, look around, and you'll notice that I'm stuck in here with you, okay?
1DI5000629	You're okay for now. At least until they decide they want to poke at you some more, or worse.
1DI5000630	Plan? Yeah, we just used my plan. It got us out of our cell.
1DI5000631	Hate to break it to you, but that's all I've got. We have to wing it from here.
1DI5000632	Not a clue. I'm hoping we can get some answers once we get out of this place.
1DI5000633	Oh really? Suddenly you have all the answers?
1DI5000634	Listen kid, I'm all ears if you've got an idea, but there's no way you've got any more idea what's going on here than I do.
1DI5000635	Hey! Hey, you okay? You all right?
1DI5000636	They want us alive for... something. Who knows what. Point is, if it looks like one of us is gonna kill the other, they'll step in to stop it.
1DI5000637	So that's what we do. We throw a few punches, make it look real, and then jump 'em when they come in to break it up.
1DI5000638	Oh, sure. Take your time. No rush, not like we're about to be sliced and diced by... who the hell knows what.
1DI5000639	Fine. So they've kept us alive this long for a reason, right? Seems to me they'd want to make sure we stay alive for now.
1DI5000640	So you and me, we have ourselves a little fist-fight. Trick 'em into thinkin' one of us ain't going to last too long.
1DI5000641	Make 'em come in here and break it up. And when they do, we turn on 'em. We take out the guards, and get ourselves the hell out of this box.
1DI5000642	Grab anything useful, and let's go. Who knows how long it'll be before they send more after us!
1DI5000643	Nothing we can do for this guy now...
1DI5000644	Goddamn Raiders. Last thing I need up here is more of them.
1DI5000645	Oh, she's toast. Forget it, there's no one home.
1DI5000646	Come on, this is a waste of our time.
1DI5000647	I've been here for a little while, but haven't found a way to...
1DI5000648	Shit. You hear that? It's coming again... Get back against the wall, now!
1DI5000649	Now you're talkin'.
1DI5000650	I can tell you there ain't an easy way out of here. I've looked around, and I can't find any panels, wires, circuits... nothing.
1DI5000651	I'm thinkin' they did us a favor, putting us together in here like this. And I say we use it to our advantage.
1DI5000652	And for the record, the name's Somah. Nice to meet you.
1DI5000653	Okay, yeah. Yeah, let's do something about getting out.
1DI5000654	Well, there ain't no easy way out. Trust me, I've looked. Can't even find anything to pry open, see what's blocking the doorway.
1DI5000656	You've got it all wrong, kid. You're in here with me. This is my little slice of heaven, not yours.
1DI5000657	...not a good time for jokes, I guess.
1DI5000658	Look, I don't know why they put you in here with me. Maybe it's another experiment. Not like I can ask them to find out.
1DI5000659	But since you asked, name's Somah. Beyond that, I'm thinkin' not much matters if we're gonna stay stuck in here.
1DI5000660	Your guess is as good as mine. I can't understand what they're saying. I don't remember half of what they did to me, and that might be a good thing.
1DI5000661	I know we ain't the only ones in here; there's a whole bunch of us in here. They'll pluck folks out every now and then.
1DI5000662	Sometimes they bring 'em back... Sometimes they don't. Either way, I ain't keen to find out what they're doing.
1DI5000663	What, you've never seen a giant metal claw scoop somebody up and carry him off to who-knows-where?
1DI5000664	I don't know where they're taking him, and I'm not interested in staying here long enough to find out.
1DI5000665	We gotta get out of here, kid. Now.
1DI5000666	What the hell? Where's she going?
1DI5000667	Oh, great. Well, so much for that idea. She suckered you good, huh?
1DI5000669	We need to go to the big engine thing, and then from there we can go up to the top of the ship.
1DI5000670	That's where the guy in charge is. I've only seen him once or twice, but he's extra mean.
1DI5000671	I guess you'll probably have to kill him or something, huh?
1DI5000672	Well, I appreciate that, miss. It's just that it's not easy to talk about.
1DI5000673	I... I lost my wife and my boy.
1DI5000674	One minute, we're riding back from town. Next, we're floating in the sky. Then we're here.
1DI5000675	They're screaming and crying, and I can't do a thing to help them. Haven't seen them since.
1DI5000676	And now someone's going to pay for it.
1DI5000678	Okay? Lemme ask you something -- you ever listened to the two people you care most about in this world screaming in pain?
1DI5000679	Huh? You ever watched them screaming, looking to you to save them, only you can't do anything about it?
1DI5000680	If you had ANY idea what that feels like, you'd know damn well it's not okay.
1DI5000681	I lost my wife and my boy to these monsters, and they are going to suffer for it.
1DI5000682	So you... you know?
1DI5000683	There's not much more to say. Wasn't just me sucked up into this place... My wife and my boy, too.
1DI5000684	I can still hear 'em, crying out to me, begging me to save 'em. And there wasn't a damned thing I could do.
1DI5000685	They were... they were everything to me, you know? So now I've got nothing. Nothing at all.
1DI5000686	Aliens? That what you call 'em?
1DI5000687	So you woke me, huh? Who the hell are you?
1DI5000688	You call those little weird men aliens?
1DI5000690	Aliens... Green Men... hell, you can call 'em piles of horse shit for all I care.
1DI5000692	Do I really look that stupid, kid? This ain't a ship. I don't hear water and I sure as hell don't feel us rocking. So tell me another one.
1DI5000693	Besides, you don't look trapped to me. How do I know you ain't workin' with those little green bastards?
1DI5000694	Human like me, huh? And just how do I know you aren't workin' with the little green bastards that stuck me in that thing?
1DI5000695	You got a smart mouth kid. I like that.
1DI5000696	What I don't like is I don't know you from a hole in the wall. How do I know you ain't workin' with those little green bastards?
1DI5000697	The only teams I know are cattle and they get led to the slaughter. That's why I work alone, kid.
1DI5000698	Now, you did let me out of that... thing, so it counts for somethin'.
1DI5000699	Tell you what... I usually ride solo, but I'll stick with you for now. You try and pull anythin' stupid and I'll bury you.
1DI5000700	You got a point there, kid. Lettin' me out of that... thing does count for something.
1DI5000702	You got a funny way of talkin', kid. But you know what, I think you're my best bet to get the hell back home.
1DI5000704	Sappari wakaran. Koko ga doko nanoka mouse. Sessha no ken wa do shita?
1DI5000705	Sessha no ken wa dokoda? Ima sugu kaesanu ka!

1DI5000710	Nani wo itteorunoda. Sappari wakaran. Nantoka shite kure.
1DI5000711	Nantoka senuka! Sessha no ken wa ittai doko ni arunoda!
1DI5000712	Oh, sessha no ken! Katajike nai.
1DI5000713	Sumanuga, korekara dosuruka hitoride kangaetai. Shitsurei suru.
1DI5000714	Oh, sessha no ken! Kaeshite moraerutowa, katajike nai.
1DI5000715	Sumanuga, sessha mizukara korekara okorukotoni sonaeneba naranu.
1DI5000716	Oh, korekoso sessha no ken. Katajike nai.
1DI5000718	Onushi, naniyue sonoyo ni hanasu? Nanika shomo no mono demo arunoka?
1DI5000719	Well listen, it's not like I even wanted to be there, okay?
1DI5000720	I'm good with tech. These guys needed someone who knows her way around machines. They just happened to be slavers.
1DI5000721	I mean come on, what was I supposed to do? They took care of me, and as long as I didn't think about where the caps came from, it was fun.
1DI5000722	Already forgotten. Let's just get back to the whole "not getting killed by crazy space men" thing.
1DI5000723	A reason? Yeah, there's a reason. It's because I worked for slavers, okay? I worked for them, I helped them, and sometimes I liked it.
1DI5000724	They needed someone who was good with machines, stripping tech, building shit. That's me.
1DI5000725	So I did the work. And look where it got me. Now can we stop talking about me?
1DI5000727	All right, listen. Not that it's any of your damn business, but yeah. Before I got sucked up into crazy alien land here, I pulled some shady stuff.
1DI5000728	Many of my associates may or may not have been slavers, and I may or may not have received payment for helping them in their trade.
1DI5000729	Okay? Big secret exposed! Great job! Hope you're happy.
1DI5000730	What? I've never seen any of you before in my life. Last people I saw were... oh my god!
1DI5000731	Aliens! I was taken by aliens! You! You must be the aliens trying to get into my mind... well that's not gonna work!
1DI5000732	Private Elliott Tercorien, U.S. Army Medic, Serial Number 3477809. That's all I'm telling you.
1DI5000733	My what? Who the hell are you... oh my god.... wait a minute!
1DI5000736	Prisoner? Last thing I remember I was being outside our bunker and then... oh my god!
1DI5000739	I dunno, I dunno... maybe you assumed human form. I heard they could do that... or you are human but they took over your mind!
1DI5000740	We have no idea how limitless their powers are!
1DI5000741	Hey, you could be one of those little green guys in human form... or maybe you ARE human and they just took over your mind.
1DI5000743	Ha! That doesn't mean anything!
1DI5000744	You could be one of those little green guys in human form... or maybe you ARE human and they just took over your mind.
1DI5000746	I... I suppose so.
1DI5000747	Look, all I want to do is get back home and back to the rest of my squad.
1DI5000748	Wait a minute! My men... my unit! Have you seen them?
1DI5000749	You do? Then you're telling me the truth. Those... aliens took you too.
1DI5000750	Look, I just want to get out of here and get back to things the way they were. Back with my guys...
1DI5000752	No! Please don't. It's horrible in there! To think I was just sitting there, frozen like that... I thought I was dead!
1DI5000753	Just help me get the hell out of this place. I want to get back home... back to my squad.
1DI5000755	Oh my god, I'm responsible for them and now they're lost... or dead.
1DI5000756	Please, if you mean what you say... that we're all in this together... then you've got to help me find out what happened to them!
1DI5000757	What if they're lost... or frozen like I was... or even dead? I'm responsible for them!
1DI5000759	No... no. I'm responsible for those men. They were my team.
1DI5000761	Thank you. Thanks so much. Sorry about all this... I just can't believe this is happening.
1DI5000762	Okay... okay. Whew.
1DI5000763	Sorry about all this... I just can't believe this is happening.
1DI5000764	No, no! Don't do it... don't do it.
1DI5000765	It's just that this whole situation is... unbelievable.
1DI5000766	I think I need a few minutes to take a breather...
1DI5000767	Doesn't matter now. Only important thing is... Well, I guess it's revenge.
1DI5000768	Well, it was getting dark... we had spent the day out in the trenches keeping as many of the guys alive as we could.
1DI5000769	Chinese had been pounding on us all day with artillery from these huge guns they had up on the mountains. It was really a mess.
1DI5000770	Anyway, we pitched our tents and stowed our gear to try and catch some shuteye.
1DI5000771	I woke up suddenly to Private Dawkins screaming... he was bathed in some kind of blue light coming from the sky.
1DI5000772	All of us just froze as he just... well... vanished. We didn't know what happened. Did the Chinese come up with some new weapon?
1DI5000773	Moments later, all of us were in the blue light too... the rest you know.
1DI5000774	Not much to tell. I heard that radio signal, thought I'd check it out.
1DI5000775	Thought maybe I could pull some scrap from whatever was sending the signal. Got a little more than I bargained for.
1DI5000776	Doesn't matter. They're not getting it, whatever it is.
1DI5000777	Hell if I know. I don't plan on starting a conversation to ask, you know?
1DI5000778	Isn't it obvious? They're probably using us as guinea pigs, examining our anatomy.
1DI5000779	Once they've figured out how to make exact copies of us, they'll send those copies back down to earth to take our places.
1DI5000780	When they've copied enough of us, they'll turn on us and take over the world. Come on, how can you not see that coming?
1DI5000781	Maybe they're going to take over the whole planet.
1DI5000782	Like, maybe they've been coming here for hundreds... no, thousands of years, waiting to hit us when we're not expecting it.
1DI5000783	And then they wipe us out, and strip the planet of all its resources. I bet that's it.
1DI5000784	What if this is just some horrible misunderstanding? Like, what if some radio waves got beamed into space and made it all the way to their planet.
1DI5000785	Only they didn't hear the nightly news or whatever, to them it sounded like a declaration of war. So they decided to attack us first.
1DI5000786	Seriously, this whole thing could totally be our fault! Do you realize that?
1DI5000787	Hmm... maybe, just maybe, they're responsible for life on earth. Like, they seeded the planet a really long time ago.
1DI5000788	And they've been coming back every once in a while to check on the progress... and now they've decided they don't like how it turned out.
1DI5000789	Can you imagine? They made us and now they're pissed at us!
1DI5000790	No sense in dwelling on it now. Let's just get out of here.
1DI5000791	Can't say as it matters, or that I'd feel like telling you anyway.
1DI5000792	Me? Well, I was a medic with the 108th Infantry Battalion stationed at Anchorage, Alaska.
1DI5000793	I was with a squad of five other medics... our job was to patch everyone up after the Commies gunned them down.
1DI5000794	It was pretty bloody... nothing at all like I expected when I gave up my hospital job to enlist in the Army.
1DI5000795	Does it really matter?
1DI5000796	I mean, we're fighting to stay alive here. Whatever I did before we got to this point doesn't mean a whole lot right now.
1DI5000799	Well, the cryogenics compound I found will help already, but keep your eyes open for anything else.
1DI5000800	I'm not sure. Some of this stuff looks way more advanced than anything I've ever seen.
1DI5000801	Let's keep an eye out for any kind of materials or equipment I might be able to adapt for humans.
1DI5000802	Well, if this is where they make the robots, we may be able to discover some way to weaken or control them.
1DI5000803	Be on the lookout for any gizmos or schematics.
1DI5000804	The only thing useful in here is me and my gun. Now let's keep moving.
1DI5000805	It's a pretty big place, and I've only seen some of it. They always catch me before I can see the whole thing.
1DI5000806	I've seen the Cryo Lab... that's where they freeze people and cut them up and stuff.
1DI5000807	And the Hangar... That has the aliens's flying ships and all the stuff they need to fly them.
1DI5000808	And the Robot Assembly is where they build the big metal robots they use.
1DI5000809	But the real important stuff is on the top of the ship. I've never been there.
1DI5000810	Hey! If I could I would! Some of the vents are so small in there, even I can't crawl through them.
1DI5000811	Sorry, you'll just have to blow up those generators and get the door open yourself.
1DI5000812	Uhh... it wasn't my turn to watch him?
1DI5000813	I dunno. He was here before...
1DI5000814	He looks like a Japanese Samurai. I guess the aliens must have plucked him up from earth a long time ago. I can't understand a word he's saying.
1DI5000815	Huh, how about that. He's gone. I didn't even notice.
1DI5000816	Hope he doesn't get himself into trouble.
1DI5000817	No idea what his deal is. Sounds like that gibberish you can pick up on the radio in some parts of the Wasteland.
1DI5000818	Took off. Don't know where to. Don't much care.
1DI5000819	Some sort of foreigner, obviously. Can't make out a word he's saying.
1DI5000820	Ummm, I think he's from the earth's past. There are people frozen all over the ship that the aliens grabbed wearing funny old time clothes and stuff.
1DI5000821	Are you kidding me? That was stupid of them. Now we know they're getting desperate.
1DI5000822	Pretty effective threat, if you ask me.
1DI5000823	It's obvious, isn't it? They're threatening us. You could tell just by the way he sounded.
1DI5000824	Holy SHIT. What was that?
1DI5000825	Sorry, I should get the door. Hang on, okay?
1DI5000826	Not really the time for gawking...
1DI5000827	Didn't think I'd ever see something like this.
1DI5000828	That's really something. Almost enough to make you forget we're running for our lives up here...
1DI5000829	It's so pretty, isn't it?
1DI5000830	Get a load of this!
1DI5000831	Would ya look at that...
1DI5000833	No idea. Been in over my head for a while now. Still, I'm thinking whatever that was, it wasn't a good thing.
1DI5000834	Probably best if it doesn't happen again, you get my meaning?
1DI5000835	How the hell do I know? It sure looked like it!
1DI5000836	That was crazy! What if they use that thing on us!
1DI5000837	You gotta find that thing. You gotta find it and get rid of it, before something really bad happens...
1DI5000838	Pretty obvious, wasn't it? They're putting on a big show, trying to scare us.
1DI5000839	Means we're getting under their skin. That's a good thing.
1DI5000840	Of course, now it looks like we've got a big Death Ray thing we need to take down before they blow up the whole damn planet.
1DI5000841	But it's nice to know we're having an effect, don't you think?
1DI5000842	Yep, it seemed all riled up.
1DI5000843	Might end up being a good thing. Lose your cool, you're more likely to make mistakes.
1DI5000844	Still, seems we oughta make sure that doesn't happen again. Shut off whatever that thing was.
1DI5000845	You think? What clued you in?
1DI5000846	It's bad enough that they're trying to kill us, but that was... What, like trying to fry the Earth or something?
1DI5000847	We gotta find that... Death Ray, or whatever it is... and stop it!
1DI5000848	Oh, come on. You don't need to understand it to get the point.
1DI5000849	It's some kind of a threat. And if they're threatening us, it's a good bet we're starting to scare 'em a bit.
1DI5000850	Now, you ask me, we need to find out what that was and make sure it doesn't happen again, but at least we know we're getting somewhere.
1DI5000851	I suppose. Lead the way.
1DI5000852	Yeah, no kidding. Wow, they've gotta be really pissed at us.
1DI5000853	We better hurry up and find out how to shut that thing down.
1DI5000854	Yeah, sure. No question about that.
1DI5000855	But if you ask me, seeing that was kind of good news. Means we're making some headway, you know? Really getting under their skin.
1DI5000856	Well, it looks like they're still keeping some of these turned off.
1DI5000857	But there's one that's on, so I guess that's the way we go!
1DI5000858	You should probably go through first, in case there's something bad on the other side. And then I can go through after. Okay?
1DI5000859	Yeah, I think they're trying to keep us from getting there.
1DI5000860	Well, we should look for another way to go. There's one more here that works...
1DI5000861	You go through first, and make sure it's safe, and I'll be right behind you, okay?
1DI5000862	Pretty good, I guess. This is scary, but it's also kind of fun.
1DI5000863	Looks like this door's locked, too. Hang on, I'll see if I can get it from the other side.
1DI5000864	I'll get the door!
1DI5000865	Good luck! We'll stay right here and wait for you.
1DI5000866	That doesn't seem like a very good idea.
1DI5000867	If they turned it off, that means they know we're here, and they're probably waiting on the other side of that door.
1DI5000868	It'd be smarter if just one person went and checked it out.
1DI5000869	Don't worry, we'll be safe right here. Good luck!
1DI5000870	I think so. Seems like they're getting even more angry at us.
1DI5000871	Okay, if you say so. Lead the way, kid.
1DI5000872	Ha ha. Very funny.
1DI5000873	If you've got nothing, then ask the kid. She's been helpful so far.
1DI5000874	Kid, I think I made it pretty clear that my advice became irrelevant once we got out of that cell they stuck us in.
1DI5000875	I'm happy to tag along and help you out, but I got NO interest in leading this operation.
1DI5000876	Where's my wife? Where's my boy? What've you done with them?
1DI5000877	When I get free, so help me God I'm going to kill every last one of you!
1DI5000878	Agggh! What are you doing? What the hell do you want with us? LET ME GO!
1DI5000879	I know. And you're very welcome.
1DI5000880	Aw, come on. We both know you could have.
1DI5000881	That's right! If it weren't for me, you'd be sitting in a holding cell or lying on some crazy operating table right now.
1DI5000882	You owe me big time, kid.
1DI5000883	I think I'm going to stay here for a while. I don't think I'd like it much down there anymore, and there's still a bunch of the ship I haven't seen.
1DI5000884	I'll tell you what. If I find anything really neat, I'll bring it to you, okay?
1DI5000885	I don't know... I don't really have a place down there anymore, do I? Doesn't sound like it'd suit me very well.
1DI5000886	I think I'll stick around here for a while. See if I can't figure out some of this technology.
1DI5000887	I'm gonna see about getting off this thing. Head back to the Wasteland with some new toys, maybe carve out a place for myself.
1DI5000888	Literally, if I have to.
1DI5000889	Odds are we won't be bumping into each other again, so I just wanted to say thanks.
1DI5000890	No offense, but this ain't some sort of game.
1DI5000891	My whole life is over. Gone, a long time ago.
1DI5000892	Sorry if I can't make light of the situation like you can.
1DI5000893	Yeah, that's one way of putting it. Not really something I'm interested in doing again.
1DI5000894	Boy, I sure hope not. But at least we know what to do with them, right?
1DI5000895	Nope, I'll go back out and look for more stuff soon.
1DI5000896	No, sir! Nothing new!
1DI5000897	Nuh-uh. If I find anything else, I'll let you know!
1DI5000898	Oh, yeah! Here, you can have this stuff. I found it when I was looking around the rest of the ship.
1DI5000899	Yep, I was able to scrounge up some more stuff for you. Here you go, Captain!
1DI5000900	Sir, yes sir! I found some more supplies for you, sir!
1DI5000901	Pretty neat. I'm still exploring some of the rest of the ship using the vents. There's a bunch of places I never saw before.
1DI5000902	I saw a shooting star out the window!
1DI5000903	I'm okay. It's fun to just sit and look at the earth sometimes.
1DI5000904	I told Mr. Elliott this really funny joke earlier, but he didn't get it. He's weird.
1DI5000905	Yep, sure thing!
1DI5000907	Here's everything I've got.
1DI5000908	We don't have anything else stockpiled right now. Sorry.
1DI5000909	Sorry boss, not right now. Anything turns up, and I'll let you know.
1DI5000910	No, but we're still checking the rest of the ship as best we can.
1DI5000911	Oh. He left.
1DI5000912	He used the teleporter after you did. Said he didn't have any reason to stay... but I don't know where he was going to go.
1DI5000913	I'm going to miss him. He was quiet, but I think it's because he was really sad.
1DI5000914	He took off just after you did. Said there was no reason for him to hang around here, that he might as well go see what it was like down there.
1DI5000915	I wasn't about to tell him he couldn't go...
1DI5000916	Okay! That should do it! I'll be back out in a minute!
1DI5000917	Nanda kono arisama ha? Youkaihenge ka?
1DI5000918	Hanase, imasugu!
1DI5000919	Kikoenuka, hanase, ima... <zap>
1DI5000920	[BANGING SOUND COMING FROM BRIDGE DOOR]
1DI5000921	Wait, did anyone hear that?
1DI5000922	Wait, did you hear that?
1DI5000923	Little busy here, darling.
1DI5000924	What did you hear, Sally?
1DI5000926	There it is again. Is that an Alien?
1DI5000927	Iretekure! Sessha wa eirian deha gozaran. Sessha wa samurai nari. Otanomi mosu!
1DI5000928	Oh, it's the Samurai! We should let him in!
1DI5000929	Fine. Let the Chinaman in. Could use his arm in here if it gets rough.
1DI5000930	Actually, I think he's from Japan.
1DI5000931	As you say. Kindly invite the Oriental gentleman with the sword to join us... NOW!
1DI5000932	Hello Samurai! Glad you're still alive.
1DI5000933	Ya, kore wa katajike nai. Soregashi ni dekiru kotoga gozareba nannarito.
1DI5000934	Oh, no way. NO WAY. This is a bad dream, right? I'm dreaming? Shit...
1DI5000935	So what, I'm being held hostage now or something? I'm some kind of prisoner?
1DI5000936	Listen, if this is because of what we did... I just worked for those guys, okay? It's not like I enjoyed it.
1DI5000937	I was just in it for the caps, all right? Can I go now?
1DI5000938	Hey, don't forget to put on the Astronaut's Suit before starting the decompression sequence.
1DI5000939	Nice one!
1DI5000940	Good job!
1DI5000941	Wow, you must really hate them.
1DI5000942	Over this way!
1DI5000943	Yay! We made it. That wasn't so bad, was it?
1DI5000944	Wait! I think there are more coming down the hall. Just stay here, and I'll try and get this door open for you.
1DI5000945	Hmm, maybe it's this other wire...
1DI5000946	There it is! Go on, get in!
1DI5000947	Whew, that was a close one.
1DI5000948	Be careful when you come out, there are still a few to your right. If you can, sneak through the door on your left.
1DI5000949	Okay, you're doing good! Just keep going.
1DI5000950	We'll be at the engineering core in no time!
1DI5000951	Hi, I'm back again!
1DI5000952	I'll catch up once it's safe, okay?
1DI5000953	Hurry up, we're almost there!
1DI5000954	You go ahead. I'll wait here until it's a little safer. I don't want to get hurt.
1DI5000955	Wait here for a second... There's more of them coming.
1DI5000957	Okay, go get their attention.
1DI5000959	I've seen them use those arch things to heal themselves. I don't know if it'll work for you, but you could try it.
1DI5000960	Those are some of their guns over there. You should get one. Or even a bunch of them, just in case.
1DI5000961	There's some alien goo tubes on that table over there.  I've seen them use it to fix guns and stuff. I bet it'll work for you too.
1DI5000962	You know, I could have done that for you. I'm only trying to help!
1DI5000963	Or don't.
1DI5000964	Fine, be that way.
1DI5000965	I'm just trying to make your life easier, but whatever.
1DI5000966	No, your other left!
1DI5000967	Oookay...
1DI5000968	Well good luck. I'm going to get out of sight. Don't worry, I'll stay nearby and help you when I can.
1DI5000969	Cool!
1DI5000970	Give me just a second to get behind them...
1DI5000971	Wow, really?
1DI5000972	I get to use a grenade? Neat!
1DI5000973	Got it! Give me a minute to sneak around them.
1DI5000974	But I can help!
1DI5000975	Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit...
1DI5000976	Gah! Look, just let me go, okay? This is crazy, this is like batshit unbelievable crazy. I didn't do anything, I don't know what you want with me.
1DI5000977	Is this because of Anchorage? I swear, I didn't even want to be there, man. You've gotta believe me.
1DI5000978	I didn't even WANT to be out in the field! I was hoping for a job in Washington, you know?
1DI5000979	What? What do you want? I don't understand! Why is this happening to me??
1DI5000980	Well, we were just in a really big space battle with a UFO... the ship is probably pretty damaged.
1DI5000981	But that's okay, we can just stay on the bridge. And I can try and explore through the vents to see if there's anywhere else to go.
1DI5000982	I bet it's a safety mechanism, designed to seal off damaged areas of the ship. At least, that's what I'd do if I were designing a spaceship.
1DI5000983	Probably means the rest of the ship is so badly damaged that it decompressed. My guess is you don't WANT to open that door.
1DI5000984	Here, got something for ya!
1DI5000986	This should mess 'em up!
1DI5000988	No! I am NOT going back into the cells!
1DI5000989	No way I'm dying up here!
1DI5000990	They're not freezing me again!
1DI5000991	I need help!
1DI5000992	I've got to get to cover!
1DI5000998	I'll keep an eye on the ship for you!
1DI5000999	Yep, not like I'm going anywhere.
1DI5001000	We'll be here if you need us.
1DI5001001	Be careful down there.
1DI5001002	I'll stay right with you!
1DI5001003	Okay, come on!
1DI5001005	You're doing a great job. Really.
1DI5001006	Let's hope they don't figure out where we are.
1DI5001007	Just keep cool, and we'll get through this.
1DI5001008	All right, I'll make sure they don't cut us off.
1DI5001009	They know we're coming, so be careful.
1DI5001010	We might actually make it...
1DI5001011	I hope we can find that Death Ray before they use it again.
1DI5001012	First aliens, now Death Rays. This is like a crazy TV show.
1DI5001015	Just hurry up and find us a way off of this ship before we all end up frozen again.
1DI5001016	Sure, just watch my back and I'll watch yours.
1DI5001017	Okay. Tell me if you need medical assistance.
1DI5001018	Go on, don't let me stop you.
1DI5001019	Yeah, sure. I'll keep your spot warm.
1DI5001020	Yeah, yeah. Just don't think about ditching me... we're in this together.
1DI5001021	You go do what you have to do.
1DI5001022	Fine... I'll be here.
1DI5001024	Remember to wear the spacesuit before you go outside or you could die!
1DI5001025	Don't go alone... those generators are in scary places. Take one of the grown-ups with you!
1DI5001026	Don't worry, I'll be safe with these guys. They seem pretty neat.
1DI5001027	Oh, I hope we can find my sister somewhere.
1DI5001028	Be careful, lady.
1DI5001029	Be careful, mister.
1DI5001030	I sure hope so, for all our sakes.
1DI5001031	No one asked you to thaw me out.
1DI5001032	Hey, at least down there we're free... well, most of us anyway. So let's just get the hell out of here.
1DI5001033	Sorry, you'll just have to learn to deal with it like the rest of us.
1DI5001034	Tell you what. I'll do the shooting, and you do the patching. It's the only way we're gonna make it out of here alive.
1DI5001035	Sure, sure. Don't worry. Don't worry...
1DI5001036	Yeah, uh... well, glad we talked. I know I feel better... ummm... ok...
1DI5001037	It's okay, Somah. It's my problem... I'll deal with it.
1DI5001038	Aw, thanks Somah! You're the best!
1DI5001039	Thanks, Mr. Tercorien. I knew you'd help.
1DI5001040	I guess they're already looking for us... I can sneak past them in the vents, but you're too big to fit. We'll have to figure out how to get around.
1DI5001041	I'll stay here until it's safe, okay?
1DI5001042	Shh! We don't want them to hear us!
1DI5001043	The kid's right... this kind of does look a bit like that TV show.
1DI5001044	I mean, not that I watched it a lot or anything.
1DI5001045	Anyway, uhh, sorry. What should I do?
1DI5001046	Stella Skyfire reporting for duty! She's Captain Cosmos' second in command, at least for the first few episodes...
1DI5001050	Well, that's the last of those turrets.
1DI5001051	Looks like we've got a problem though. The aliens have shut down the teleporters and I can't bring them back up.
1DI5001052	We may have to look around for another way through.
1DI5001053	All right, now that things have quieted down, I'll see if there's something up here I can push to stop more of those tin cans showing up.
1DI5001054	Maybe I can turn off some other stuff too. And maybe I'll find a way back down. You keep looking for that generator!
1DI5001055	Feels like someone's twisted my insides into a knot...
1DI5001056	I'm sick to my stomach, but I'll manage.
1DI5001057	It hurts... can't seem to catch my breath.
1DI5001058	Let's keep going. I don't know how long I have.
1DI5001059	Damn it. This... this burns like hell.
1DI5001060	Don't worry... I can keep going.
1DI5001061	Oh man, I wish I had something for the pain.
1DI5001062	Tatakai no kachimake ha, seme to seme no hazama ni aru.
1DI5001063	Hajimari ni ketsumatu wo mi, ketsumatsu ni hajimari wo miru. Soremade wa dojite wa naran.
1DI5001064	Mokuteki naki okonai wa tadano kaze, ketsui aru okonai wa hue no shirabe to naru.
1DI5001065	Kotoba de wa tamashii wo iyasezu. Chinshi mokko aru nomi.
1DI5001066	Shiii!
1DI5001067	So, it's done.
1DI5001068	I'm not much for talking, so I'll get to it. I owe you. Without you, I'd be dead, or worse.
1DI5001069	Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to see if I can find a way off this thing.
1DI5001071	Hey, I thought you should know... Someone must've hit a button during the fight just now.
1DI5001072	If I understood the display correctly, I think we sort of launched a homing beacon of some kind down to the surface. Landed just outside DC.
1DI5001073	I wouldn't mention it, except that I think... Like I said, I'm not sure... I think it's a way to get back to earth.
1DI5001074	Seems like there's a teleporter in the Captain's quarters... I mean, I guess they're your quarters now.
1DI5001075	So I guess you can go home if you want. Don't worry, I'll stick around up here and keep an eye on things.
1DI5001076	We did it! We really did it!
1DI5001077	Oh man, I can't believe it! I never thought we'd make it!
1DI5001078	You're the best. The absolute best. I'd be dead without you, or worse. Thank you so much.
1DI5001080	Always good to see you.
1DI5001081	I see you're still in one piece.
1DI5001082	Hey, guess what? You can go home!
1DI5001083	I was looking at the controls on the bridge here, and most of it doesn't make any sense to me because it's in that weird alien language.
1DI5001084	But there's this one thing I saw, and I think maybe I accidentally pushed a button while we were fighting that big ship.
1DI5001085	And I think maybe the button I pushed sent some kind of a thing back down to earth. I didn't mean to, honest. But this is a good thing!
1DI5001086	I think now you can use the teleporter in the Captain's quarters to get back to earth. Pretty great, isn't it?
1DI5001087	Anyway, I just thought I should tell you.
1DI5001088	Yay! We won! I knew we could do it, I knew we could beat them!
1DI5001089	You're even better than Captain Cosmos!
1DI5001090	Hello there, Captain! What can I do for you?
1DI5001093	I hear there's a way off this boat. I'll let you go first, just to make sure it works, and then I'm outta here.
1DI5001094	Nice work, kid.
1DI5001095	If there's more of them out there, that'll make 'em think twice about attacking us again.
1DI5001096	And it looks like you're now in charge of your very own spaceship. Well, what's left of it anyway. Congrats.
1DI5001097	What can I do for you, Mr. Hot-shot space captain?
1DI5001100	Holy shit... Look at this place. I get the feeling we're in way over our heads.
1DI5001101	Are we better or worse off than we were before? I honestly can't tell.
1DI5001102	Well... at least we're not locked in a cell anymore.
1DI5001103	Listen, I know how this shit works. We all go together, and we all get wiped out at the same time.
1DI5001104	No offense, but I'm gonna hang back for a bit. You need someone to keep an eye out behind you anyway.
1DI5001105	Don't worry, I'll catch up with you soon enough.
1DI5001106	What are you still doing here? Follow the girl and make some progress, or else we're never getting out of here.
1DI5001107	Come on, kid. You're supposed to be heading towards the engine core, or whatever the hell it is. Get going.
1DI5001108	I already told you, I'll catch up with you. Get outta here!
1DI5001109	You're supposed to be heading for the engine core place, right? So get going!
1DI5001110	What're you waiting for? Let the kid out already!
1DI5001111	Might as well let the kid out. No sense leaving her stuck in there.
1DI5001112	So, this is it. Pretty neat, huh?
1DI5001113	I never had the courage to wake them up, but I think you're going to need to. The spaceman has a suit, and we need him to use it.
1DI5001114	Aw, nuts.
1DI5001115	They turned it off! Last time I was here, I used this to get to the top of the ship.
1DI5001116	It's kind of like an elevator, only it doesn't just go up and down. Feels sort of tingly, too.
1DI5001117	They must be pretty angry that we're exploring...
1DI5001118	Oh, I know! Come on, I know another way up!
1DI5001120	Okay, I'll show you what I found. If you want to get out of here, I think it'll help. Come on, follow me!
1DI5001121	Come on, we're almost there!
1DI5001122	You want to get to the control room, right? Well, then you need to see the engine room first. I know how to get there.
1DI5001123	See? I told you I could help!
1DI5001124	Thanks! Are you escaping? Do you want to see the rest of this place? I've seen a bunch. I can show you if you want.
1DI5001125	You need my help to get out of here, right?
1DI5001126	I told you I can help. I'm super good at helping.
1DI5001127	Okay, we've gotta find a way out of here.
1DI5001128	Look, I'm glad we're still alive too, but can we celebrate later? Like, maybe after we actually get out of here?
1DI5001129	How about you pay less attention to me, and more to finding a way to get out of here.
1DI5001130	Man, what the hell is this place? What do they want with all these people?
1DI5001131	Come on, come on! We don't have time to waste! Get your shit, and let's get moving!
1DI5001133	I'm thinking maybe now you can understand it's a good idea to get the hell out of here.
1DI5001134	Stay against the wall, and get the hell away from me!
1DI5001135	Let me guess: you can't find a way out, and so you're ready to go along with my plan.
1DI5001136	Am I right?
1DI5001137	'bout time you woke up. I was starting to think maybe they'd fried your brains or something.
1DI5001138	You got a headache, right? Don't worry, that'll get better. I don't know if it'll matter, but it'll get better.
1DI5001139	They must really like you... at least they let me keep my clothes. Looks like they stripped you of everything.
1DI5001140	Hey, I didn't know you were exploring, too!  You don't know where we are, do you?
1DI5001141	Okay, let's get out of this place!
1DI5001142	Hey! Hey, are you okay? Skinned knee or anything like that?
1DI5001143	Let's talk later, okay? We should be careful around here.
1DI5001144	Well now, that was something...
1DI5001145	Holy shit, did you see that? What was that thing? Some crazy alien Death Ray?
1DI5001146	Oh, great. Another dark and scary part of the ship.
1DI5001147	Well at least it's someplace different, right?
1DI5001148	You're going through that next teleporter first, right?
1DI5001149	So we're going to follow you through that next one, huh? Okay. I'll... I'll go through last.
1DI5001150	Don't care for these "teleporter" things at all.
1DI5001151	Let's hope this is over soon.
1DI5001152	Ready when you are. Be right behind you.
1DI5001153	Glad to see you're holding up.
1DI5001154	We didn't get much opposition, so either they don't know exactly where we are, or they're busy with something else.
1DI5001155	Looks like they're still trying to keep us out of the teleporters, huh? Only one way to go. Might as well take it.
1DI5001156	Go on ahead through. We'll be right behind you.
1DI5001157	Guess they know what we're up to, so they're shutting off the teleporters. Trying to cut us off.
1DI5001158	Which means they're probably waiting on the other side of that door.
1DI5001159	We'll hold this point. You go on ahead and see if you can find the controls for this teleporter. We'll make sure they don't sneak up behind you.
1DI5001160	We're kind of pinned down here until you find the other end of that teleporter. You might want to get working on that.
1DI5001161	Wow... did you see that?
1DI5001162	Scary, but also kind of a stupid move on their part, don't you think?
1DI5001163	Well hey there, fancy meeting you here!
1DI5001164	Nice work. Now what?
1DI5001165	You're really good at this. I hope it wasn't too scary...
1DI5001166	Oh no, they turned this one off too!
1DI5001167	You're going to have to find the other end and turn it back on.
1DI5001168	Did you see that? Did you see that big gun they just fired?
1DI5001169	We need to turn off that big Death Ray thing before they blow up the whole Earth!
1DI5001170	I knew you'd get it. Good job!
1DI5001171	Now we have to get to the bridge, where their leader is.
1DI5001172	Wait here. I'll get the door!
1DI5001173	This is crazy, right? It's not just me? We're actually trying to escape from a spaceship? Crazy...
1DI5001174	You know the odds of getting out of this alive are pretty small, right? I'm just saying.
1DI5001175	Just between you and me, I'm surprised at how well I'm coping. I mean, I think I'm coping. Unless I've just lost my mind already...
1DI5001176	Aliens... who'd have believed it? This is nuts.
1DI5001177	We need to make 'em pay. Every last one.
1DI5001178	This ain't the time for standing around and talking.
1DI5001179	Let's just keep moving.
1DI5001180	Quite a little band of misfits we've got here, huh?
1DI5001181	If I get out of here, no one's going to believe this. Hell, I'm not sure I believe it.
1DI5001182	I think we're getting close. Just gotta keep moving.
1DI5001183	So if we do manage to get off this ship, then what? We just go back home like nothing happened? I don't know if I can do that.
1DI5001184	I'm not quite sure where to go, but I think if we keep going this way we'll find what we're looking for.
1DI5001185	This is kind of exciting, isn't it? I've never seen this part of the ship before!
1DI5001186	I sure hope they don't figure out where we are. This time I don't think they're going to put me back in the cell...
1DI5001187	Jyama wo suru na.
1DI5001188	Onushi wa nanimono? Koko wa doko da?
1DI5001189	Sessha no ken! Sessha no ken wa dokoda?
1DI5001190	Nanto? Nani wo nozonde orunoda. Nani yue, onushi no iu koto ga wakaranu noda?
1DI5001191	Ken wo ubawarete shimatta, taegataki kutsujoku!
1DI5001192	Ken wo sugu torimodo saneba naranu!
1DI5001193	Nani ga okotta noka, kento ga tsukanu.
1DI5001194	Youjutsu de sessha wo toraeta youkai me. Kono mama de wa okanu zo!
1DI5001195	Youkai kara mi wo mamoru niwa, ken ga iru.
1DI5001196	Hito wo azakeru na. Onushi no monoii wa sappari wakaran.
1DI5001197	Sessha wo tasuke takuba, sessha no ken wo sagashi dase!
1DI5001198	Woah, hang on a tick. I don't know anythin' about anythin' in this section, so I'm headin' back to the Engine Core.
1DI5001199	Good work. But don't get cocky.
1DI5001200	Still one generator to blow up... Figure you should be off doing that instead of hanging around here.
1DI5001201	You can pat yourself on the back when you've blown up all the generators, not just one of 'em.
1DI5001202	Where are they? Where are the little buggers?
1DI5001203	Well? What do you want?
1DI5001204	Speak your piece.
1DI5001206	Wait, wait. I have no idea how I'm going to be of any help in this part of the ship, so I'm going to stay behind in the Engine Core.
1DI5001207	Now that all three generators are destroyed, you're going to have to take a walk outside. I just hope that old spacesuit is still sealed properly.
1DI5001208	Hurry up taking out the last generator if you can. I don't feel comfortable staying near that giant engine core for much longer.
1DI5001209	Hey, you're doing great... only two more generators and we can move on. Just hang in there, I know this is rough.
1DI5001210	What's... what's going on? Who are all these people?
1DI5001212	Oh hey. What's up?
1DI5001213	Hey there... what did you need?
1DI5001214	I don't really think I'm going to be of any use here, so I'm heading back to the Engine Core.
1DI5001215	Just do what the girl says... get them out of those things.
1DI5001216	I guess it's time for your space walk. Lucky you.
1DI5001217	One more generator and we can get to the top of this ship. Then we can hit the aliens where it really hurts.
1DI5001218	Nice work taking out that generator. Only two more to go.
1DI5001219	Hope this is important.
1DI5001220	If you got something you want to say, spit it out.
1DI5001221	Yeah? Something bugging you?
1DI5001222	Wow, you did it!
1DI5001223	Now you're gonna have to go outside of the ship. I know it looks scary, but that's the only way to the top.
1DI5001224	Oh! Make sure you wear a spacesuit before you go out there or you could die! Don't forget!
1DI5001225	Yay! Only one more of those generators is all you need to take care of and we can get to the bridge and kick some alien butt!
1DI5001226	I knew it! I knew it!
1DI5001227	The lights went out for a few seconds and I just KNEW you took out one of those generators. All you have to do is two more and we can leave.
1DI5001228	Here it is! This is the stuff I hid in here. You can have all of it, okay?
1DI5001229	Come on, I'll show you where the stuff is!
1DI5001230	Didja need something?
1DI5001231	Whatcha want?
1DI5001232	Hang on, hang on! I can't get the doors unlocked THAT fast. Sheesh!
1DI5001233	Oh no! That poor astronaut! Those freezers are so dangerous... sometimes people don't wake up.
1DI5001234	I guess you'd better take his suit. You're going to have to go if he can't. But first you have to get to the door to the outside.
1DI5001235	They'll be waiting for you, but you can suck out all the air in part of the ship so they won't get in your way.
1DI5001236	They have these generator things that power parts of the ship and make sure it has air. You'll have to turn some of them off.
1DI5001237	There's one in the Cryo Lab, one in the Hangar Bay and one where they make the robots... the Robot Assembly area.
1DI5001238	Once they're all broken, you can get through that door to the outside.
1DI5001239	And then once you get to the top of the ship, you can turn the teleporter thing back on, and I can catch up to you!
1DI5001240	I guess it's time for me to get those doors unlocked for you now. This is fun!
1DI5001241	You need to wake up the spaceman there. We can't get up to the top of the ship unless he uses his space suit.
1DI5001242	Can't be real... this can't be happening...
1DI5001243	I'll wake up any minute now... just need to wake up.
1DI5001244	Nope, nope. Not real, none of it is real. Can't hurt me if it's not real.
1DI5001245	Come on, follow me! I'll show you what the generators do.
1DI5001246	Test
1DI5001247	Almost there!
1DI5001248	Is it safe yet?
1DI5001249	Captain on the bridge!
1DI5001250	All systems normal, Captain!
1DI5001252	Welcome home, Captain!
1DI5001253	Astronaut Sally, at your service!
1DI5001254	Hey, good to see you again.
1DI5001255	I don't even want to know what it's like down there.
1DI5001256	Welcome aboard.
1DI5001257	Anything I can help with?
1DI5001258	This is a fine mess we're in, isn't it?
1DI5001259	Don't lose it, okay? We can get through this.
1DI5001260	We've gotta get out of here.
1DI5001261	Thanks for letting me out!
1DI5001262	This is exciting, isn't it!
1DI5001264	I sure hope we don't get caught!
1DI5001265	Hope we find what we're looking for soon.
1DI5001266	I can't get off this ship fast enough.
1DI5001268	At least I'm still in one piece...
1DI5001269	I think we're getting closer.
1DI5001271	Where are they? I'll kill those little bastards!
1DI5001272	I guess we're done down here. Time to take the fight to the aliens.
1DI5001273	Not too shabby, kid.
1DI5001274	Got one, eh? Well, it's a start.
1DI5001275	Flyin' ships... now I've seen everything.
1DI5001276	That generator has to be around here somewhere.
1DI5001277	There's more aliens in here... I can smell 'em.
1DI5001278	I wish we knew how to use of these flyin' ships. Would have been a lot easier than sneakin' around.
1DI5001279	What's troublin' ya?
1DI5001280	Somethin' on your mind?
1DI5001283	All right, get that suit on and get outside. The sooner we get out of here the better!
1DI5001284	Only one more of those damn generators to go and we can get the hell out of here.
1DI5001285	One down! Way to go!
1DI5001286	Huh... wha? Where am I?
1DI5001287	I don't know about you, but I'd like to find that generator and get back to the engine core.
1DI5001288	Freezing people then bringing them back to life. Amazing.
1DI5001289	These aliens... why are they experimenting on us? What do they want to do to us?
1DI5001290	If we would have had access to this kind of medical technology back on earth, so many people wouldn't have died in the war.
1DI5001291	Oh... hi.
1DI5001292	This place... it's giving me the creeps.
1DI5001293	Gah! Don't sneak up on me like that.
1DI5001294	I hope we get out of here soon. I don't know how much more of this I can take.
1DI5001295	Got all the generators, huh? Time to take a walk outside.
1DI5001296	Nice work... one more generator and we can get the heck out of the engine core.
1DI5001297	One generator down and two to go. Keep it up, kid.
1DI5001298	Wow, I'd love to get my hands on some of this equipment. I could make a fortune back on earth.
1DI5001299	Those assembly lines remind me of the pens we kept our slav... ummm, I mean our prisoners in.
1DI5001300	I've never seen anything like this place. Everything builds itself... crazy.
1DI5001301	Holy shit. If I'd had even a few of these robots back home...
1DI5001302	Yeah? Need something?
1DI5001303	I hope that little girl knows what she's talking about, or we're in for some serious trouble.
1DI5001304	This ship is huge. How did they build something this big?
1DI5001305	I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually miss those old Salisbury Steaks back home.
1DI5001306	You did it! You did it! Whoohoo!
1DI5001307	Only one more of those generators to go! Wow!
1DI5001308	You blew up one of the generators! We might actually get out of here!
1DI5001309	Hiya, Mister.
1DI5001310	Hiya, Lady.
1DI5001311	Hey there, little one. So, are your parents anywhere aboard this ship?
1DI5001312	Hey Somah, can you tell me how it all ends up? You know, what happens down there?
1DI5001313	Hey there, ummm... I don't mean to bother you and all... ummm...
1DI5001314	Wow, so you were down there when all this started. Right before the bombs fell. That's crazy.
1DI5001315	Hey sweetie, can I talk to you a second?
1DI5001316	So, what's your story, tough guy?
1DI5001317	Did you have to help a lot of people who were hurt when you were in the war?
1DI5001318	Somah, what's it like down there? Is it still the same?
1DI5001319	Hey, mister? Are you a real cowboy?
1DI5001320	Ow, hey, not too hard!
1DI5001321	Hey, kid! Be careful!
1DI5001323	Oh, that really hurts!
1DI5001324	Aaa, atama ga!
1DI5001325	Uuu, ude ga!
1DI5001326	Ashi ga!
1DI5001327	Oou!
1DI5001328	Aaa!
1DI5001330	Uwa!
1DI5001331	Agh, my head!
1DI5001333	Ugh! My leg!
1DI5001335	Agghhh!
1DI5001343	Urgh, hit my head!
1DI5001344	Ugh, got my arm!
1DI5001345	Hit my damn leg!
1DI5001351	Hey! Keep your hands to yourself!
1DI5001352	Uhhh? What are you doing?
1DI5001353	Bad idea. Very bad idea.
1DI5001354	Try that again, you draw back a stump.
1DI5001355	Yaaaaaaa!
1DI5001356	Yeaagh!
1DI5001358	Hrrrragh!
1DI5001359	Urrrrgh!
1DI5001364	No. No, it's not right. I am NOT just leaving them here to their fate. I couldn't do that back in Anchorage, and I am not doing it now.
1DI5001365	Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you stop worrying about shit that doesn't matter.
1DI5001366	I said I've got nothing to talk about. Leave it alone.
1DIU000001	Need specialized equipment and expertise. It's also prone to infection. Too dangerous.
1DIU000002	Dammit! Why are you wasting my time? I already told you, ask Pinkerton down at Rivet City.
1DIU000003	Ever since then, he's been up on his Forge in the back of the robot shop on the hill, working to protect us all from the AntAgonizer!
1DIU000004	I found Maggie hiding under a bed, in the same room where her parents had been butchered. We've been together ever since.
1DIU000005	Because America is the greatest country on Earth... actually... it might be the only country on Earth now.
1DIU000006	I'm afraid Vance has him in isolation and there's no way I'm going to override Vance's orders.
1DIU000007	Oh, come on. You barely even left! I can't imagine you tested it on a reasonable number of subjects so quickly. It can't have been a good sample size.
1DIU000008	Your time here is over!
1DIU000009	Your time has come!
1DIU000010	I was dating Pappy then, you know. I got here and he was all like "Big Town will be safe", but it wasn't! This place is always under attack!
1DIU000011	You live in Big Town; you learn to accept death.
1DIU000012	No one's really in charge of Big Town. There's nothing much to be in charge of.
1DIU000013	You're right, I should have never doubted you!
1DIU000014	Since my parents were already dead, they drank their blood and left the mark on the wall. He didn't want Evan to suspect that I had done it.
1DIU000015	Next thing I know Lucy was pulling me off the guy... I had ripped his throat open with my teeth.
1DIU000016	And I envy your retirement, Dashwood. Though it's true. There's something satisfying about bagging a Rad-Scorpion at 100 yards with a single shot.
1DIU000017	Oh, I'm alright, I suppose. Though, apparently raiders have been attacking the caravans again. Missed a shipment. I'll just have to be creative!
1DIU000018	Let me pack my bags. Oh, wait, I don't have any. Let's get out of here.
1DIU000019	It's... well, it's Dukov's place. He lives here.
1DIU000020	It's... well, it's Dukov's place. He used to live here. Lots of drinking and... you know. Now he's dead.
1DIU000021	I suspect that he is making a stand inside of that building, but an Initiate won't be able to stand for long against those Mutants.
1DIU000022	In return, we'll pay you with your choice of 5.56 ammo, grenades, stimpaks, or Rad-Away. I'll bet they're more useful to you out there, anyway.
1DIU000023	Comes complete with a simulated personality unit, so he's good protection and good company, too! And all yours for just 1,000 caps.
1DIU000024	I got an old mag full of 5.56s! Is that good enough for you?
1DIU000025	I'll give you caps for any Scrap Metal you can bring me. You'll find it all over the place out there in the Wastes.
1DIU000026	A long, long time ago, he saved me from Raiders!
1DIU000027	He don't talk about it much but apparently, there's a whole city of Ghouls somewhere down in D.C.
1DIU000028	He's been here for... Oh, I guess about fifteen years now. Ever since Moriarty bought him off of those Slavers.
1DIU000029	And there's Galaxy News Radio. It's run by a guy named Three Dog somewhere down in D.C. But the signal went down a while ago.
1DIU000030	Head on in, partner. Ya'll enjoy your stay now.
1DIU000031	Yeah, I'll help you, then Moriarty kicks my sweet ass out the door.
1DIU000032	Oh come on. You're a spitting image of the guy. He's been here before, and now you're here. Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
1DIU000033	Hey, I may be the biggest mouth in the Capital Wasteland, but I've also got the biggest ears.
1DIU000034	Since you know all about this cause, no need to explain the effect. Let's get you on your way.
1DIU000035	It's the dish off the old Virgo II Lunar Lander in the Museum of Technology.
1DIU000036	The Brotherhood does its best, but sometimes it takes a little something... special. That's where the Lyons' Pride comes in.
1DIU000037	Step outside the city limits, and it's snake city... nothing but "hissssssss."
1DIU000038	 Grrr! Hungry!
1DIU000039	And was our brave hero scared? No. Not at all, he laughed in the face of danger... "Ha ha ha!" He beat up the monster and everyone cheered!
1DIU000040	Well, yes, but it was hardly any place of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
1DIU000041	She did? Well, suppose I've picked up a lot over the years. I mean, no one's spent more time tinkering on this old girl than I have!
1DIU000042	That lasted until about 18 years ago, when those ambitious backbiters like Li and her little team showed up.
1DIU000043	It's not garbage! But don't be fooled - it is junk. It's just junk that's pretty important stuff, you know?
1DIU000044	Practically speak robot, do you? As long as you don't write it in all ones and zeroes, then I guess it'll be fine. Thanks!
1DIU000045	Don't take too long. The sooner the book's done, the more people we can save with it!
1DIU000046	With that much testing, I guess it's beyond correction. Oh, go ahead and keep it. Maybe you can find a nicer use for it. But I doubt it.
1DIU000047	If you say so. But if you really mean that, you might want to stop wearing a suit with their number written large across the back.
1DIU000048	He's... he's dead?
1DIU000049	Well, this is rather embarrassing so you'll have to forgive me, but it appears that I've made a slight miscalculation in my mutagen samples.
1DIU000050	Every time I'd sneak in there, he'd be sitting at that funny looking TV machine with the green words, pushing buttons.
1DIU000051	You think I didn't know that? I've been hiding in this place for days!
1DIU000052	Sigh. Look... you can call me crazy if you want but there is something odd about those creeps.
1DIU000053	Oh, sure. Look, I don't have time for your bullshit. Turn around and go back the way you came.
1DIU000054	Look, I know I've asked a lot of you already, but you have to find that kid... he deserves better than all this.
1DIU000055	But don't tell Vance I said that.
1DIU000056	Even if all of us look different on the outside, we all have had the same vice infesting our insides.
1DIU000057	Just as long as we understand each other. This here is my town. These are my people. You so much as breathe wrong, and I'm gonna fuckin' end ya.
1DIU000058	I suppose someone ought to verify their findings... Perhaps I'll do that. Who knows? I might even finally get published!
1DIU000059	Hey, that's your loss, smoothskin.
1DIU000060	Head wound! Too bad you're out of morphine.
1DIU000061	Well, what the fuck you bringin' it to me for? Give to Donovan. Sheesh.
1DIU000062	Well, let's just say I would be very appreciative.
1DIU000063	Belle can mix almost anything, as long as it's beer or whiskey.
1DIU000064	Oh. Okay. Well, let me know if you want anything. To buy, that is.
1DIU000065	Oh. Okay. Well, stop by if you want anything. To buy, that is.
1DIU000066	Your food is very nourishing, Vera.
1DIU000067	I... I am at your mercy.
1DIU000068	You're nice. I can tell you a secret. I'm drunk. No no, that's not the secret. I have another secret.
1DIU000069	Application denied. You have 24 hours to leave the Republic, or face deportation.
1DIU000070	Alright sure, why not. The people have a tendency to wait until the last minute to vote, but I'd like just to get it over with.
1DIU000071	Sounds like you need some of Ahzrukhal's special cough medicine.
1DIU000072	I'll trade you five bits of Scrap Metal for a Stimpak, a pack of RadAway, or a dose of Rad-X. Easy deal.
1DIU000073	So you killed a bunch of Feral Ghouls. Is that supposed to sound impressive?
1DIU000074	You've seen those Super Mutants and their ... appetite. There's no way Big Town will survive with them around.
1DIU000075	A few dozen attacks on the town later, and here I am. Almost an ingredient in a Super Mutant chilli cook-off.
1DIU000076	Then we got old, and we had to leave. Those were the rules. So we packed up and headed here, like we were supposed to.
1DIU000077	No one told us it would be like this. We never have fun anymore, and most of us... most of us are dead.
1DIU000078	 If it weren't for you Wasteland types coming through with your caps, I'd be out of here in a second. Assuming that I could convince Jenny and Leo.
1DIU000079	Stay the fuck out of me business, don't go where you don't belong, and buy your drinks here. That's all you need to know.
1DIU000080	Some people hate this place, but I guess that's their right, what the hell do they want out of life? Food, shelter and safety. Works for me.
1DIU000081	I ain't heard much. Truth be told, I don't really ever leave the Lantern. Too much work, too few hours in the day, ya know?
1DIU000082	Any time.
1DIU000083	And all without asking for pay, too. Hell, why don't you move in? Here's the key and the deed to an empty house. Consider yourself a Megaton citizen!
1DIU000084	Oh man! Did you see it? Did you see it? The AntAgonizer was all like, "Fear me!" But the Mechanist was all, "Stop, evil-doer!"
1DIU000085	We'd best not be seen speaking with each other further. If you want a new face, see Pinkerton, down in the flooded fore section of the carrier.
1DIU000086	I got a lot to thank you for... I don't know how to do it. Here... take this. It's always given me good luck.
1DIU000087	How the heck are you?
1DIU000088	Those Ghouls won't be bothering us anymore, will they?
1DIU000089	Good job taking care of our little problem.
1DIU000090	Hello, stranger. I'm Tinker Joe, premier supplier of robotic parts and service throughout the D.C. Wasteland.
1DIU000091	I found that in an ancient book. The words of wisdom of one of the greatest men of the former civilization.
1DIU000092	Happy Holidays! Care for a drink?
1DIU000093	Hi, I'm Maggie. I live with Billy. Billy Creel. Do you know him? He's not my dad or anything, but he takes care of me now.
1DIU000094	This isn't a good time. My daughter, C.J. is missing.
1DIU000095	Never mind. You need a drink. Cherry! I'm thirsty over here!
1DIU000096	Never mind. You need a drink. Cherry! Need some fucking booze over here!
1DIU000097	Never mind. You need a drink. Fantasia! I'm thirsty over here!
1DIU000098	Never mind. You need a drink. My women are gone, so help yourself.
1DIU000099	Don't you look absolutely... miserable. Pull up a stool and lay down a few caps, tell Uncle Ahzrukhal all about it...
1DIU000100	No. Go talk to Ahzrukhal.
1DIU000101	It's so weird here without Ahzrukhal.
1DIU000102	Just hold still. Your left stabilizer's been knocked loose.
1DIU000103	Hello, Henry. I just got in some new torque wrench and some electrical test equipment. You should take a look at them when you're done eating.
1DIU000104	Can you spare enough for a drink? I could really use one.
1DIU000105	<sniffs>You smell like the Wasteland.
1DIU000106	I wish he'd get us some regular clothes. It's cold out here dressed like this.
1DIU000107	It appears you've been wounded, sir. May I suggest you utilize your infirmary?
1DIU000108	You appear to have been wounded, madame. May I suggest you utilize your infirmary?
1DIU000109	Did you hear about those newbies? The ones who went up north lookin' for raids?
1DIU000110	Ah you think you can sneak up on ol' Roy Phillips, do you?
