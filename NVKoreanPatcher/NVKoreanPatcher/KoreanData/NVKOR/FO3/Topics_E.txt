1TO0000001	I found Argyle. I'm afraid he's dead.
1TO0000003	This has to end, Eden. You need to destroy yourself and this base.
1TO0000005	Everyone has a price. What's yours?
1TO0000006	<Disable Cerberus' combat inhibitor.>
1TO0000007	So what's your take on this whole situation?
1TO0000008	Anything else I should know?
1TO0000009	Um... Where the hell did you come from?
1TO0000011	What can you tell me about the basement?
1TO0000012	I've heard this place has a basement. How do I get to it?
1TO0000013	What can you tell me about the basement of Tenpenny Tower?

1TO0000017	You ever been to the basement?
1TO0000018	Do you know anything about the basement and emergency tunnels?

1TO0000020	Do you know anything about the basement level, comrade?
1TO0000022	You ever go down to the basement?
1TO0000023	I don't suppose you know anything about the basement? And some tunnels?
1TO0000024	Do you know much about what's in the basement?
1TO0000025	You ever been to the basement? I hear there's an escape tunnel...
1TO0000026	Do you know how I can get into the basement?
1TO0000027	I'm going to find a non-violent solution to your Ghoul problem.
1TO0000028	I'm still looking, don't worry. I'll find him.
1TO0000029	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction procedure you performed.
1TO0000030	Ever do any facial surgery? Maybe on someone from the Commonwealth?
1TO0000031	I found some info about an android. What do you know about his facial surgery?
1TO0000038	You know who might have a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer?
1TO0000039	I found this holotape. What do you know about facial reconstruction?
1TO0000046	Let's discuss the facial reconstruction and mind wipe you did for the Android.
1TO0000048	I'm still working on getting rid of Roy Phillips and his pack of Ghouls.
1TO0000049	I can help with your Ghoul problem. Where are they hiding out?
1TO0000050	If I help you, is there some kind of reward?
1TO0000051	Virginia? Virginia's been gone for 200 years.
1TO0000052	You voted for governor? How does that work?
1TO0000053	So who did you vote for?
1TO0000054	Old Man Harris doesn't seen very happy.
1TO0000055	You mentioned something about GNR?
1TO0000056	I changed my mind. I'll go with you to Rivet City.
1TO0000057	I changed my mind. I'm not going to go with you right now.
1TO0000058	You can't be President. You're an abortion of science. You need to die...
1TO0000059	What do you know about these Super Mutants?
1TO0000060	Do you know where the Super Mutants took your friends?
1TO0000064	What can you tell me about the Mechanist?

1TO0000067	Here's your 500 caps. I can go in now, right?
1TO0000068	If I can get 500 caps together, you'll let me in?
1TO0000069	I killed Junders Plunkett.
1TO0000070	I need your help, doc.
1TO0000071	Andy, what happened? All this blood...
1TO0000072	What's this "movement" you mentioned?
1TO0000073	Did you say a city of Ghouls?
1TO0000074	How about a haircut?
1TO0000076	I think it's time for us to say goodbye, old buddy. Take care of yourself, okay?
1TO0000077	Jericho, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.
1TO0000078	Fawkes, I need you to go into that chamber and turn on the purifier.

1TO0000085	You still offering that job?
1TO0000086	I took care of the Mechanist. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
1TO0000087	I took care of the AntAgonizer. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
1TO0000088	I took care of both of them. There won't be any more fighting in the streets.
1TO0000089	He promised me money for a job. Pay up, or else.
1TO0000090	I just finished a job for your late uncle. I hope he told you to pay me.
1TO0000092	Do you know who you're dealing with? Let me in. Now!
1TO0000093	Your pals over at the Lincoln Memorial seemed pretty happy with me.
1TO0000094	Do you know anything about some android who needed a surgeon?
1TO0000095	What do you know about this android from the Commonwealth?

1TO0000103	You ever do a face job on an android from the North? <Jingle purse of 100 caps.>
1TO0000104	A patient of mine needs a facial epidermal augmentation. You ever perform one?
1TO0000105	Here's 100 caps for the locale of a Lipoplasticator or Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
1TO0000106	I need to find a Micro Dermal Graftilizer for epidermal augmentation surgery.
1TO0000107	Tell me about Argyle.
1TO0000108	I'm hurt. I need help, Doc.
1TO0000109	You're a doctor, right? I could use some help.
1TO0000110	Can I get some medical treatment?
1TO0000120	Heal me up, Red.
1TO0000126	I want to use Murder Pass to reach Vault 87.
1TO0000127	I'm trying to find my father. Have you seen him?
1TO0000128	Can you remind me where my father went?
1TO0000129	Hey, I heard your parents are getting a divorce because of you.
1TO0000130	You're starting to get on my nerves, Sticky...
1TO0000131	What can you tell me about the AntAgonizer?
1TO0000134	What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?
1TO0000135	What about human slaves? Don't you try to help them, too?
1TO0000136	I have some questions about the Brotherhood.
1TO0000137	You're crazy to stand out here! Aren't you afraid of the Super Mutants?
1TO0000138	I'm here to see Mister Burke.
1TO0000139	I don't suppose you know my father? A doctor from Vault 101?
1TO0000140	For the love of God... Shut the hell up!
1TO0000142	Do you know anything about an android from the Commonwealth?
1TO0000143	The Commonwealth android... Know anything?
1TO0000144	I'll bet you know something about the mind wipe on that escaped android...
1TO0000145	Do you know who did the memory swap on the Commonwealth android?
1TO0000146	If you keep messing with her, the Overseer is going to come down on your gang.
1TO0000147	I think I might be addicted to something.
1TO0000148	I think I might be addicted to something. Can you help?
1TO0000150	I found a Brotherhood Holotag. What should I do with it?
1TO0000151	I have Pre-War Books for you.
1TO0000152	I wanted to ask about the Holotags.
1TO0000153	The gate's open. Run for it!
1TO0000154	Wait here.
1TO0000155	Do you know any good secrets?
1TO0000156	I was kidding! Dad talked about you all time. Now really, where is he? <Lie.>
1TO0000157	I'm looking for my father. Middle-aged guy. Maybe you've seen him?
1TO0000158	What was it you said about my father, again?
1TO0000159	I did your stupid favor. Now can you tell me where my father is?
1TO0000160	Can you tell me where my father is now?
1TO0000161	I'm looking for my father...
1TO0000163	I'm glad we understand each other. Now, have you seen my dad?
1TO0000164	Now that I'm helping you, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for my dad...
1TO0000165	I hate to break it to you, but I saw your husband kissing some other woman.
1TO0000166	Can you tell me anything about the Rockwells' marriage?
1TO0000167	Anything you want to tell me about your marriage?
1TO0000169	What can you tell me about Timmy Neusbaum?
1TO0000170	Betty says I should make you cry.
1TO0000171	You'd better come down to the basement. There's something you need to see...
1TO0000172	Wow, you're annoying. You'd better make this worth my time.
1TO0000173	Do you know anything about the AntAgonizer or the Mechanist?
1TO0000174	Can I ask you more about the AntAgonizer and the Mechanist?

1TO0000241	How would you feel about having a few Ghoul neighbors?
1TO0000242	Tell me more about this Mesmetron.
1TO0000243	I have ears to sell you.
1TO0000244	I have fingers to collect the bounty on.
1TO0000245	"Other assholes"?
1TO0000246	I'd like a room.
1TO0000247	The android is dead. See, here's an internal component. <Lie.>
1TO0000248	I need to know more about what I'm dealing with. What is an android exactly?
1TO0000249	Put your weapon away.
1TO0000250	Ready your weapon.
1TO0000251	Can you tell me more about my parents?

1TO0000277	The last subject is old technology, right? Sounds interesting.
1TO0000278	The last part of this chapter is about the library, right?
1TO0000279	So... Any suggestions for finding this android?
1TO0000280	Tell me more about these preferred targets you want me to enslave.
1TO0000281	What is this place? Some kind of city?
1TO0000282	If this android "wandered" off, why would he want a new mind and face?
1TO0000283	Have you thought about disarming the bomb?
1TO0000284	Why would an android feel guilt? Come on, Zimmer, what aren't you telling me?
1TO0000285	Okay, so if others have escaped... why are you coming after this one?
1TO0000286	Dogmeat, I need you to find something for me.
1TO0000287	Stop searching, Dogmeat.
1TO0000288	I hear there's a door that doesn't work.
1TO0000289	I really need to get to Vault 87. Do you know the way?
1TO0000290	They must pay you really well to put up with this boring job.
1TO0000292	What are their super powers? Do they have any weaknesses?
1TO0000294	You got this "AntAgonizer" idea from a comic, didn't you?
1TO0000296	We all make mistakes, but there's still a chance for us. I believe in you.
1TO0000297	Humanity's made mistakes, but there's still a chance for us. And for you, Tanya.
1TO0000298	Darling, your fighting is scaring the whole town. Won't you stop for me?
1TO0000299	Your fighting is scaring people in town, and it might hurt little Derek.
1TO0000300	The fighting is causing more trouble for the town than the AntAgonizer ever did.
1TO0000301	Humanity's made mistakes, but there's still a chance for us.
1TO0000303	What've you got, boy?
1TO0000305	What do you do here?
1TO0000306	Good boy, Dogmeat!
1TO0000309	Bad, Dogmeat! Very bad!
1TO0000310	What's this book you're working on?
1TO0000311	Can I have that Armored Vault Suit?
1TO0000312	How's the book coming?
1TO0000313	About these Ghouls...
1TO0000314	How's that Ghoul situation coming along?
1TO0000315	Are you afraid of the Ghouls trying to get into Tenpenny?
1TO0000316	Are you worried about those Ghouls?
1TO0000317	You know anything about those Ghouls trying to get in here?
1TO0000318	What do you think of the whole situation with the Ghouls?
1TO0000319	You know anything about these Ghouls?
1TO0000320	Those Ghouls sure have people worked up, don't they?
1TO0000321	I bet you know a thing or two about those Ghouls...
1TO0000322	Are you doing something about those Ghouls?
1TO0000323	Those Ghouls have you stressed out, too?
1TO0000324	I don't suppose you know much about those Ghouls?
1TO0000325	Do you know anything useful about those Ghouls?
1TO0000326	Hear anything interesting about the Ghouls?

1TO0000330	Let's talk about the trade caravans.
1TO0000331	Would you mind if I asked about your unusual hunger?
1TO0000333	Hold still, boy. This Stimpak should have you feeling better soon.
1TO0000334	Sorry, Dogmeat. I don't have any Stimpaks for you right now.
1TO0000336	Can I join your group?
1TO0000338	You collect technology? How do I sign up?
1TO0000339	Who's that guy in the corner?
1TO0000341	What do you know about Vault 87?
1TO0000342	I'm sorry... Who's Maggie?

1TO0000344	Let's talk about the Enclave.
1TO0000345	Why do you support the Enclave?
1TO0000346	What am I supposed to be doing again?
1TO0000347	Betty wants me to break up your marriage.
1TO0000348	Bad news, Roger. Your wife is a psychopath.
1TO0000349	Hey, look what I found. You're getting sent to military school. <Lie.>
1TO0000350	I'm looking for a woman named Red. Sticky promised me some caps...
1TO0000351	I can't take your babbling. You're on your own. Good luck getting to Big Town.
1TO0000353	Why did you decide to become the Mechanist?
1TO0000354	Without your suit, you're just a normal human like anyone else.
1TO0000357	My work is done, Doctor.
1TO0000358	I've killed the Ant Queen.
1TO0000359	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection and Lab Coat, Doctor.
1TO0000360	I'm ready for my Mutagenic Bioenhancer injection, Doctor.
1TO0000361	What about my payment?
1TO0000362	Mind if I ask you some important stuff about Doctor Lesko?
1TO0000363	Okay. I'll go look for your father.
1TO0000364	What can you tell me about Marigold Station?
1TO0000366	I have a proposal for you from Vance, the Family's leader.
1TO0000367	Arefu has accepted your proposal, Vance.
1TO0000369	Can you teach me the ways of the Vampire?
1TO0000370	So what are you doing in the Metro tunnels?
1TO0000371	Let's talk about Tenpenny.
1TO0000373	What's it like living at Tenpenny Tower?
1TO0000374	You want just these VIPs, or do you want other slaves too?
1TO0000375	What's our next move?
1TO0000376	What do you make of this "Button Gwinnett" robot?
1TO0000378	I still don't get what's going on.
1TO0000380	I swear, I'll stop your father and his guards. Just watch.
1TO0000381	I swear, I'll stop the Overseer. Just watch.
1TO0000382	I'm trying to stop the Overseer. Just be patient.
1TO0000383	I agree with you. Let me get the rebels to stop.
1TO0000384	I'll put a stop to the rebels. Just let me have a word with them.
1TO0000385	I'm working on stopping the rebels. Give me a little more time.
1TO0000387	What did you hear from the guards?
1TO0000388	I'd like to know more about the Republic.
1TO0000389	What's new in the Republic?
1TO0000390	Anything happening in this place, Mister President?
1TO0000391	Tell me more about the Republic, Mister President.
1TO0000394	Can I come in?
1TO0000395	I can come in now... right?
1TO0000396	Have you ever heard of a guy named Gob?
1TO0000397	So tell me, what's it like being a Ghoul?
1TO0000398	Will any water do?
1TO0000399	Back off or I'll make you regret threatening me.
1TO0000401	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would have shot me already.
1TO0000402	That gun doesn't look loaded.
1TO0000403	How about I give you 5 caps and you leave me alone?
1TO0000404	Tell me about your trade caravan.
1TO0000405	What does a Knight do?
1TO0000406	You must see a lot of things. What's been going on?
1TO0000407	What's with all the names? Bob, Herbert and Harold? I don't get it.
1TO0000408	Stay here, boy. Don't move until I come back!
1TO0000410	So, are we good? You trust me enough now?
1TO0000411	I understand you have quite a Chem habit...
1TO0000412	How's that chem problem treating you?
1TO0000413	How's the addiction? Kicked it yet?
1TO0000415	I came here for my father. Now where is he?
1TO0000416	So my father's okay? I can... get him back?
1TO0000417	I heard you bake really tasty pies. Can you make one for me?
1TO0000418	Look, I've got the brochure right here. You're going, pal.
1TO0000419	What's your story?
1TO0000420	Where was Vault 87 again?
1TO0000421	Raven Rock is destroyed.
1TO0000422	Where's Big Town located?
1TO0000423	Big Town? I've been there before.
1TO0000425	I suppose you're right. Maybe we can work together.
1TO0000426	Maybe you're right. Maybe I should join your side.
1TO0000428	That completes the first chapter's tasks, correct?
1TO0000429	Is that all of the research for the second chapter?
1TO0000430	Is that it for the last chapter?
1TO0000431	That completes the first chapter's tasks, right?
1TO0000432	I suspect this completes the second chapter's research, correct?
1TO0000433	And now my research for your book is completed. Isn't it?
1TO0000434	Is that all for the first chapter?
1TO0000435	Is the second chapter done yet?
1TO0000436	Are we done with the last chapter?
1TO0000437	Does that finish out the first chapter?
1TO0000438	Is it just my imagination, or does that complete the second chapter?
1TO0000439	Correct me if I'm wrong, but that completes the book. Right?
1TO0000440	Is the first chapter done yet?
1TO0000441	This chapter done yet? I don't know how much more research I can take.
1TO0000442	I swear, if I have to research anything else, I'll just shoot myself now.
1TO0000443	I think I have some bad news for you.
1TO0000444	What happened here?
1TO0000445	Please, help me understand your Laws.
1TO0000446	I think I finally understand what you people are.
1TO0000447	I don't understand what you people are.
1TO0000448	So, are you ready to explain to me just what you people are?
1TO0000449	I'm looking for Ian West. Have you seen him?
1TO0000450	Now that I have a better understanding of the Family, may I speak to Ian?
1TO0000451	Please allow me to speak to Ian.
1TO0000452	I've been searching for a young man named Ian West.
1TO0000453	Anything else you can tell me about Ian West?
1TO0000457	Lucy, I have bad news. Your parents are dead.
1TO0000458	I have some new information about Ian.
1TO0000459	Ever heard of the Family?
1TO0000460	Ian's decided to leave the Family.
1TO0000461	Ian's decided to stay with the Family.
1TO0000462	Simms wants me to disarm the bomb...
1TO0000463	Gustavo hired me to kill you.
1TO0000464	Not yet, but I'm working on it.
1TO0000466	I just want to know why you won't open the Vault.
1TO0000469	I went into Minefield and came back, no problem. <Lie.>
1TO0000470	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present. <Lie.>
1TO0000473	I checked out the Super-Duper Mart, but nothing's there. <Lie.>
1TO0000475	I tested it out, and it works just fine. <Lie.>
1TO0000477	I went to the site of the library, but the building was destroyed. <Lie.>
1TO0000479	Rivet City is actually the remains of an ancient, underwater civilization. <Lie.>
1TO0000482	I've got some technology to turn in.
1TO0000484	Why can't you do this research yourself?
1TO0000486	Why do you really want to write this guide?
1TO0000487	Did you know the Wests are dead?
1TO0000488	Don't worry, Evan. I'll figure out what happened to the Wests.
1TO0000489	Everyone else seems fine.
1TO0000490	Are you sure I can't just have that key, handsome? You know, as a present?
1TO0000491	How about I let you live, and you give me something so I can lie to Crowley?
1TO0000492	All right. I haven't killed anyone all day. Let's go.
1TO0000493	Huh. A robot stuck in a diagnostic loop. Curious.
1TO0000494	It's probably just a problem in a subroutine somewhere. No sweat.
1TO0000495	Have you seen my dad?
1TO0000497	Why are you always working on such weird ideas?
1TO0000498	Look, I'm not a threat to this place. Just let me go.
1TO0000499	Crowley is alive, and he paid me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
1TO0000501	Where is this Fort Constantine?
1TO0000502	Allistair Tenpenny is dead. One shot, right through the brain.
1TO0000503	I've decided not to kill Tenpenny. He made me a better offer.
1TO0000504	Allistair Tenpenny is dead, but not from a shot to the head.
1TO0000505	Who's your owner, rust bucket?
1TO0000507	Have you heard any interesting gossip?
1TO0000508	So, are there any fun rumors flying around Rivet City?
1TO0000509	Are there any other rumors you've heard?
1TO0000511	What do you mean "the original Brotherhood?"
1TO0000512	But they're heroes! They defend the Capital Wasteland!
1TO0000513	What are the central beliefs of the Brotherhood?
1TO0000515	How did Lyons change the Brotherhood?
1TO0000516	So, you just figure you'll strike out on your own as Outcasts?
1TO0000517	What have been the highlights of your time with the Brotherhood?
1TO0000519	So what's your long-term plan for dealing with the Brotherhood?
1TO0000520	By that analogy, you think Lyons will be killed by the Super Mutants?
1TO0000521	"Ahab Lyons"? And what's a whale?
1TO0000522	Has the Brotherhood ever faced a real challenge?
1TO0000523	What's the biggest challenge the Brotherhood has ever faced?
1TO0000526	Okay, I think I understand.
1TO0000532	Tell me more about the Outcasts.
1TO0000533	Who are you people?
1TO0000534	Tell me about the Outcasts.
1TO0000536	Can you tell me about the Outcasts?
1TO0000538	Outcasts? Who are they?
1TO0000540	What sort of disagreements did they have?
1TO0000541	I thought the protection of humanity was a part of the Brotherhood's oaths.
1TO0000543	Who were the exiles?
1TO0000544	How do your remaining soldiers feel about the Outcasts?
1TO0000546	What are you doing about them?
1TO0000547	Has your decision been worth it?
1TO0000549	Enough about the Outcasts.
1TO0000550	That's enough about the Outcasts.
1TO0000552	It sounds like it was quite a loss. Is there any way to reconcile them?
1TO0000554	If so many people agreed with him, maybe he has a good point.
1TO0000556	Well, good riddance to them. If you waver in your oaths, you get punished.
1TO0000563	Well, okay then.
1TO0000564	Ah, I get it! You're crazy.
1TO0000565	Well, it's good to meet you, Jack.
1TO0000566	Thanks, Jack. Maybe I'll do that.
1TO0000567	Yeah... maybe not. I don't want to catch whatever you have.
1TO0000568	Yeah... you're a little too chipper for my tastes. I'm out of here.
1TO0000569	I really don't know what you're talking about, Jack...
1TO0000570	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding down there, you sick bastard!
1TO0000571	Yes, and I saw what you're hiding in there, you sick bastard!
1TO0000572	Bring home the bacon? Those are people, not bacon! What the fuck?
1TO0000573	I can't believe I'm being called a potty mouth by a cannibal...
1TO0000574	Seriously, you're talking about eating people, here. What's wrong with you?
1TO0000575	Wait... are you saying you eat those people?
1TO0000576	Sure, Jack. No problem at all. I saw nothing.
1TO0000577	No, Jack. You have to die. You and your sick little town.
1TO0000578	Huh. Well, everyone's got to survive in their own way, I guess.
1TO0000579	That's the way to be, together to the end.
1TO0000580	Well, whatever works you you.
1TO0000581	I almost grabbed a snack while I was there, but that would have been rude.
1TO0000582	I would have grabbed myself a snack while I was in there, but that'd be rude.
1TO0000584	Yes, I was in the basement.
1TO0000585	Yes. I was in the shed.
1TO0000586	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies down there.
1TO0000587	You know, now that you mention it, there were a bunch of bodies in there.
1TO0000588	No, not really. Everyone does what they have to.
1TO0000589	I think that you're a bunch of sick fucks and I'm getting out of here.
1TO0000590	Yes. You're going to die for what you've done, Jack.
1TO0000591	Nope. Not at all.
1TO0000592	Yes, I did. And you're going to die for it.
1TO0000593	Nah. It's not presumptuous at all. You have to go.
1TO0000594	Actually, I'll just leave you alone.
1TO0000595	Okay, this is boring.
1TO0000596	What do you think of the other people in Andale?
1TO0000597	What do you think of Junior Smith?
1TO0000598	I'm sure you two will be great together.
1TO0000599	A couple? Is that what you mean?
1TO0000600	I think "weird as all hell" is probably the best way to describe it.
1TO0000601	What's going on around Andale?
1TO0000602	I really don't know.
1TO0000603	I don't know, he doesn't seem very smart to me.
1TO0000604	Yeah, he's a pretty smart guy.
1TO0000605	I really don't care.
1TO0000606	Do you like living in Andale?
1TO0000607	What do your parents do?
1TO0000608	Best town in the USA? How many towns compete in that contest?
1TO0000609	Well, I can certainly see why.
1TO0000610	This dump? Are you serious?
1TO0000611	I'm from an underground Vault, lady. Trust me, this place sucks.
1TO0000612	Actually, I guess it isn't so bad.
1TO0000613	I was just joking. It's a lovely place.
1TO0000614	What, what?
1TO0000615	Jack says you have some pie for me?
1TO0000616	Do you have any more of that pie?
1TO0000617	Whoa, slow down, grandpa. What's wrong?
1TO0000618	You know, there is something a bit "off" about them...
1TO0000619	Well, I haven't talked to anyone here but you. Are they friendly?
1TO0000621	Well, I'll be careful, I guess.
1TO0000622	Shhh.... time for a nap, gramps.
1TO0000623	What's wrong with being friendly?
1TO0000624	You're right. I hate friendly people.
1TO0000625	I don't know, it seems like a pretty nice place to me.
1TO0000626	Yeah... you go get some sleep, crazy old man. I'll be going now...
1TO0000627	What's going to happen to the kids?
1TO0000628	Now what will you do?
1TO0000629	So, you grew up here too?
1TO0000630	What's wrong with that Harris guy?
1TO0000631	He said you were all crazy killers.
1TO0000632	Well, okay then. Nothing to worry about.
1TO0000633	Wait... He's your dad?
1TO0000634	It's true. And they smell funny.
1TO0000635	The families around here seem very close.
1TO0000636	The families around here seem... umm... closer than most.
1TO0000637	No, I mean, really close.
1TO0000638	I guess there are worse things.
1TO0000639	Doesn't that make you all cousins?
1TO0000640	Well... okay... whatever works for you.
1TO0000641	I guess it's none of my business.
1TO0000646	What do you do around here?
1TO0000655	How much for a room?
1TO0000659	No, thanks.
1TO0000661	Actually, I don't have 120 caps.
1TO0000662	120 Caps sounds good to me.
1TO0000667	Sounds like a fair price. I'll take it.
1TO0000670	Bittercup? That's the dumbest name I've ever heard!
1TO0000671	I'm sorry... erm... Bittercup. What were you saying?
1TO0000672	I don't know about that, but Bittercup is one dumbass name.
1TO0000674	Nice to meet you, Bittercup.
1TO0000675	This seems like a strange thing to worry about right now.
1TO0000676	I know! No one understands me either!
1TO0000677	Yeah... I have better things to do than talk fashion.
1TO0000678	I have something to say to you, Bittercup.
1TO0000679	Why don't you seem to care about what's going on around here?
1TO0000680	If you don't mind me saying, you look different from everyone else.
1TO0000681	I like your makeup. The pale-white really reflects the lighting.
1TO0000682	Wait, what? Did you just hit on me?
1TO0000683	I'm not even going to tell you what's wrong with that question...
1TO0000684	Why, no. I'm not in any sort of relationship. Are you?
1TO0000685	I like corpses. Especially if they're full of holes... that I put in them.
1TO0000686	You need to set yourself apart from the mold. Then people will respect you.
1TO0000687	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Survival goes before style.
1TO0000688	I'm a night person myself. The darkness conceals my... activities.
1TO0000689	Moons are nice. The calm nights of the Wastes are a great time to relax.
1TO0000690	I was being sarcastic. That white makeup is like painting a target on your head.
1TO0000691	Actually, never mind. There's something else I need to know.
1TO0000692	Trouble? What kind of trouble?
1TO0000693	Why don't you leave?
1TO0000694	Who lives here?
1TO0000695	I'm sure you'll manage.
1TO0000696	So, it's pretty much a free-for-all here? Where do you keep your good stuff?
1TO0000697	Kill you? Sounds like fun. Let's do that.
1TO0000698	Not bad, kid. I'll let you live... for now.
1TO0000700	I need repairs.
1TO0000701	Is there anyone around here who can repair my stuff?
1TO0000702	Who's that guy in the clinic?
1TO0000703	Who's that guy over there? Is he hurt?
1TO0000704	Maybe I can help him.
1TO0000705	Why keep him alive? Don't you need the supplies you're using on him?
1TO0000706	You let a dying man use supplies you need? You're a bunch of morons.
1TO0000707	I'm just saying, it's an option.
1TO0000708	Whoa, take it easy. I was just asking.
1TO0000709	Let's talk about something else.
1TO0000710	So, you're under constant threat?
1TO0000711	Where do the Super Mutants come from?
1TO0000712	Paradise Falls? Where's that?
1TO0000713	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as King.
1TO0000715	I want a new opening speech. One that acknowledges me as Queen.
1TO0000716	You've accepted death? Killing all of you should be easy, then.
1TO0000717	Aw, that's no fun. I prefer my victims energetic and in agony.
1TO0000718	I just need somewhere to trade my salvage.
1TO0000720	You had seven bullet wounds and broke both clavicles. Should be fine now.
1TO0000722	It wasn't free. Doctor's fees are expensive. Understand?
1TO0000724	You're welcome. Don't do anything strenuous for a few weeks.
1TO0000726	I wanted you to be conscious before I killed you.
1TO0000728	Nothing happened. I just need you to answer some questions.
1TO0000730	Who in this town haven't you dated...
1TO0000731	I hear you and Bittercup were an item.
1TO0000732	Bittercup tells me the two of you had a thing together.
1TO0000733	You came here with Bittercup, right?
1TO0000734	Did you know Flash used to date Bittercup?
1TO0000735	Who's in charge here?
1TO0000736	So you're the woman in charge?
1TO0000738	Who's that guy guarding the gate?
1TO0000739	Who lives here, anyway?
1TO0000740	You and the other people here don't seem to get along.
1TO0000741	You live here, right? What do you know about the people?
1TO0000742	That's all I wanted to know.
1TO0000744	What do you know about the Enclave?
1TO0000745	How long have you been here?
1TO0000746	I'd like to know more about the Brotherhood of Steel.
1TO0000747	If you're just a part of the Brotherhood, where's the rest of it?
1TO0000748	You seem to have a pretty small organization.
1TO0000749	Those sound like pretty good changes to me.
1TO0000750	It must be difficult to communicate with the West Coast.
1TO0000751	Why, what happened?
1TO0000752	He's in charge, so it's his decision, right?
1TO0000753	Sorry. Never mind.
1TO0000754	Sorry to have brought it up.
1TO0000755	You make saving people sound like a bad thing.
1TO0000756	I'd like to hear what you have to say anyway.
1TO0000757	What kind of changes?
1TO0000758	What do you mean by "repercussions"?
1TO0000759	Then where's the rest of the Brotherhood?
1TO0000760	Well, I'm asking you. Why are you here?
1TO0000761	But not everyone agrees?
1TO0000762	Why is that a sore subject?
1TO0000763	Why are you the wrong person to ask?
1TO0000764	The Super Mutants are coming from Vault 87. It's their breeding ground.
1TO0000765	Anything you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
1TO0000766	Elder Lyons, we should talk about the Super Mutants.
1TO0000767	Anything more you can tell me about the Super Mutants?
1TO0000768	Why are you here in the Capital Wasteland?
1TO0000775	I'm in the market for a bodyguard like yours. You selling?
1TO0000777	Isn't she your bodyguard? Why sell her?
1TO0000778	What makes her so special?
1TO0000781	I wish I could take her now. Maybe later.
1TO0000782	If she's so crazy, maybe I'll take her off your hands. But only for 500 caps.
1TO0000783	Sounds like a good deal, and fun, too. Sold.
1TO0000784	Guess I'll have to save up for her.
1TO0000786	No deal. I like my bodyguards sane.
1TO0000814	Where can I find the traders?
1TO0000815	Where do the caravans set up?
1TO0000816	Can I get some directions around town?
1TO0000817	That's all I need to know.
1TO0000818	Where can I get some food?
1TO0000820	Business. My business. So mind your own.
1TO0000821	I'm all business. What types have you got to offer?
1TO0000822	Don't sell yourself short. Even the little jobs can be important.
1TO0000823	Thanks, Joe. Looks like a pretty nice place, here.
1TO0000824	No worries. I wasn't planning on stealing anything.
1TO0000825	I didn't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to say hi.
1TO0000827	Pleasure's hard to come by out here. What's on tap?
1TO0000828	Pretty trusting of you. How do you know I'm not here to cause trouble?
1TO0000829	Calm down, kid. Can you actually say a whole sentence at once?
1TO0000830	Do you personally threaten every visitor to your town?
1TO0000831	I'm new in town. What is this place?
1TO0000833	My business and pleasure are the same. And you're not going to like either.
1TO0000834	Neither. Just wandering through, Roe.
1TO0000835	I already talked to your uncle. I figured I'd talk to you, too.
1TO0000836	Then why am I wasting my time talking to you? Scram.
1TO0000837	Unpurified water? I'm insulted.
1TO0000838	Maybe I can introduce a new pastime: shooting nosy guards in the face.
1TO0000839	Watch your attitude. It'll get you in trouble.
1TO0000842	Sometimes people can have hidden depths even they don't know about.
1TO0000844	Now that I think about it, I'm not really sure.
1TO0000846	Because I wanted to talk to the world's biggest pain in the ass, apparently.
1TO0000852	Did you get your nickname in Lamplight?
1TO0000862	What can you tell me about Canterbury Commons?
1TO0000864	Why do the traders come here?
1TO0000865	What do you mean, "the big stuff"?
1TO0000867	How did you get this position?
1TO0000869	How organized are the traders?
1TO0000871	Okay, that's enough.
1TO0000873	I think I get the picture.
1TO0000875	Anything to trade around here?
1TO0000876	What's on the menu?
1TO0000878	I'm here to buy.
1TO0000887	Let's talk about armor.
1TO0000891	He should expand his inventory.
1TO0000895	Take my advice -- it can be done with only 100 caps.
1TO0000896	That's a good investment. Here's 200 caps.
1TO0000897	That's a good investment.
1TO0000898	With my guidance, it can be done with only 250 caps.
1TO0000899	That's a good investment. Here's 500 caps.
1TO0000902	Not worth it. I'll pass.
1TO0000907	Let's talk about food and chems.
1TO0000912	He should expand his inventory further.
1TO0000915	Take my advice, it can be done with only 100 caps.
1TO0000928	That's enough about the traders.
1TO0000930	Let's talk about odds and ends.
1TO0000931	Do you have any traders that deal with miscellaneous goods?
1TO0000934	Can he offer a wider variety of junk?
1TO0000935	He should offer even more junk.
1TO0000936	He should expand his wares further.
1TO0000948	Under my organization, they'd see better profits and more bargaining power.
1TO0000949	Working together would allow specialization in sales, for more reliable profits.
1TO0000950	Oh, I'm sure a charismatic fellow like you can get them to follow your lead.
1TO0000951	That's a real shame. I have all these caps, and nowhere to spend them...
1TO0000952	Couldn't they make more money if they worked together?
1TO0000955	I suppose you're right. Best to let them stay independent.
1TO0000956	Can you repair something for me?
1TO0000961	Enough about that.
1TO0000963	Let's talk about weapons.
1TO0000986	He's lucky Gomez stopped the fight before I really hurt him.
1TO0000987	Nothing. Just wishing me a happy birthday.
1TO0000988	The jerk tried to steal my sweetroll.
1TO0000989	It was kind of my fault. You know how easy it is to make Butch mad...
1TO0000990	He wanted my sweetroll, but I told him off. <Lie.>
1TO0000991	He, um... He made me give him my sweetroll.
1TO0000992	I don't want to talk about it.
1TO0000993	Don't worry about me. I'm not scared of him.
1TO0000994	I wouldn't give him what he wanted. He says he's going to make me sorry later.
1TO0000995	Your dad's the Overseer. Can't you talk to him about Butch?
1TO0000996	You didn't fool me. I just pretended not to know. <Lie.>
1TO0000997	Great party, Amata! Thanks for doing this for me.
1TO0000998	Is this it? Or hasn't the real party started yet?
1TO0000999	I really have no idea...
1TO0001000	Um... a date with Christine Kendall?
1TO0001001	Um... a date with Freddie Gomez?
1TO0001002	Just give me the present already!
1TO0001003	Yeah, my Dad and Amata threw me a great party, didn't they?
1TO0001004	Why are you talking to me like I'm five?
1TO0001005	I'm not a girl. And I'm not five. So stop calling me "dearie."
1TO0001006	Yes. Can I have my present now?
1TO0001007	Thank you. I will treasure it always. Is that all?
1TO0001008	Um... thanks. I guess. Did you get me anything else?
1TO0001009	A poem? You've got to be kidding me.
1TO0001010	Mrs. Palmer said I didn't have to share. Since it's my birthday...
1TO0001011	How about we share it? Half for me, half for you. That's fair, right?
1TO0001012	You can have it. I don't even like sweetrolls.
1TO0001013	Sure, Butch. <Spit on the sweetroll and give it to him.>
1TO0001014	Go soak your head, Butch. I'm not giving you my sweetroll.
1TO0001015	You do look hungry. What, your mom drank up all the ration coupons again?
1TO0001016	I threw it away. But you're welcome to eat it off the floor if you want.
1TO0001017	Mmmm... It sure was good when I ate it a few minutes ago.
1TO0001018	Don't worry about it, sir. It was nothing.
1TO0001019	It was nothing. Just boys being boys.
1TO0001020	Don't worry, Dad. I can handle Butch.
1TO0001021	He tried to take my birthday present!
1TO0001022	He tried to take the sweetroll Mrs. Palmer gave me!
1TO0001023	Really, I was the one who started it. It wasn't his fault.
1TO0001024	Actually, I was the one that started it. It's easy to make him mad.
1TO0001027	Here? We can't shoot a gun here.
1TO0001028	What do I get to kill?
1TO0001029	I'm out of BBs.
1TO0001030	Nothing's wrong, Dad.
1TO0001032	What's a Radroach?
1TO0001033	How do I kill it?
1TO0001034	I can do it!
1TO0001035	I can't do it!
1TO0001037	What kind of surprise?
1TO0001038	I don't like surprises.
1TO0001039	This is so great! Thanks!
1TO0001040	Thanks, Dad.
1TO0001041	Whatever. A shotgun would have been nice.
1TO0001042	I didn't want a stupid BB Gun for my birthday.
1TO0001047	I'm not a kid! I'm ten years old!
1TO0001048	Can it, Jonas. Where's my surprise present already?
1TO0001049	Oh... But Dad told me it was okay to come down here.
1TO0001050	Thanks a lot, Jonas. This is really cool.
1TO0001051	Couldn't you get me a real gun? A BB Gun is kind of lame.
1TO0001052	I guess so. I'm just not that into shooting things.
1TO0001056	Oh, you didn't have to bring me a present, Mrs. Palmer.
1TO0001057	I hope you brought me something better than last year.
1TO0001059	Of course she likes me. I'm a really charming guy.
1TO0001060	Of course she likes me. Everyone does.
1TO0001061	She did a great job. But couldn't you have helped out a bit more?
1TO0001069	It's really cool. Did you fix it up for me?
1TO0001070	It's all right. Seems kind of old, though.
1TO0001071	I hate it. How do I get it off?
1TO0001072	Wally said my Pip-Boy was a piece of junk!
1TO0001073	Thanks, Stanley.
1TO0001074	Sure, whatever. Did you bring me anything for my birthday?
1TO0001075	<Yawn> That's really really interesting.
1TO0001084	I'll see if I can talk some sense into them.
1TO0001085	You have to fight your own battles. I can't help you with everything...
1TO0001086	Look, Amata, this is none of my business. I don't want to get involved...
1TO0001089	Wow! That's what I've always wanted to be. My dreams are finally coming true!
1TO0001090	Whatever. I just answered randomly. Is that how you got stuck with your job?
1TO0001091	That can't be right! The stupid test got it all wrong!
1TO0001093	Ohh... I'm feeling kind of sick, Mister B. Guess I'll have to reschedule...
1TO0001094	Come on. I don't really have to take this stupid test, do I?
1TO0001095	Sure, I'm ready. I bet I'll ace it!
1TO0001096	Cool. Let me see the results and I'll fill it out myself.
1TO0001097	The Overseer's bullshit makes my head spin. Can't you do it for me?
1TO0001098	I think I'd rather just take the G.O.A.T. myself and take my chances.
1TO0001099	I love using the computers and talking to my father's patients in the clinic.
1TO0001100	Well, I shoot my BB Gun any chance I get. I can fix that thing blindfolded, too.
1TO0001101	Look. I like blowing stuff up. I just love that... "kaboom"! Ya know?
1TO0001102	Mr. B, if I told you what my "interests" are, you'd have me locked up.
1TO0001105	Leave her alone, or you'll answer to me.
1TO0001106	Maybe I can help. She's very sensitive about her weight...
1TO0001107	I'll just be going now.
1TO0001108	That's it, Butch. You and me. Right now.
1TO0001111	What's going on here?
1TO0001112	Looks like you're having fun.
1TO0001113	Hey, it's none of my business.
1TO0001115	If you say so, Dad.
1TO0001116	But, I'm sick. Really. <Lie.>
1TO0001117	Anything I need to know about the G.O.A.T.?
1TO0001118	Okay, Dad. Wish me luck.
1TO0001120	Do we have to die in the Vault? Can't we ever leave?
1TO0001121	Is it true, Dad? Was everyone born in the Vault?
1TO0001122	Can we talk about, you know... mom?
1TO0001131	Why do you listen to Butch?
1TO0001132	Hold on. You're in the Tunnel Snakes? You guys really do rule!
1TO0001133	Tunnel Snakes? You guys are some kind of gang, is that it?
1TO0001134	What's all this about the Tunnel Snakes?
1TO0001135	Should I have heard of the Tunnel Snakes?
1TO0001136	Butch and his friends bothering you again?
1TO0001138	Yeah. I got that. Why are you picking on Amata?
1TO0001139	You have a problem with Amata?
1TO0001142	Why don't you leave her alone?
1TO0001145	I've heard you do anything he tells you. And I mean anything.
1TO0001147	Oh, I get it! Butch is the leader. You're just... a follower.
1TO0001150	I couldn't have done it without your help.
1TO0001151	When I say I'm going to do something.... I do it.
1TO0001152	I didn't need your help. Go back to your crazy father.
1TO0001153	Why don't you come with me?
1TO0001154	Goodbye, Amata.
1TO0001155	I'm sorry, Amata, but I couldn't risk helping you. They would have killed me.
1TO0001156	My only concern was getting this door open, and I did it.
1TO0001157	Must not have been too bad. You're still alive, aren't you?
1TO0001158	You should come with me. It's not safe for you to stay.
1TO0001160	It's good to see you, Amata. I'm sorry I didn't trust you earlier.
1TO0001161	I said I didn't need your help to escape. Turns out I was right.
1TO0001162	Yes, I was going to. Still am, if you'll shut up and get out of my way.
1TO0001163	You could come with me, you know. Leave this place behind forever.
1TO0001164	Goodbye, Amata. It's time for me to go.
1TO0001165	The door's open. You could come with me.
1TO0001166	Time for me to go, Amata. My Dad's out there somewhere.
1TO0001167	I'm sorry, Amata. But I had no choice.
1TO0001168	Your father deserved to die. He was a murderer.
1TO0001169	I enjoyed killing him. Now get out of my way.
1TO0001170	Why not come with me? There's nothing here for you anymore.
1TO0001172	You had no choice. You only did what you had to do.
1TO0001173	Nice job. I had no idea you were so good at shooting people.
1TO0001174	I'll be sure to put this gun to good use. Thanks.
1TO0001175	So what happened to the lights?
1TO0001176	I still don't understand how my father escaped. Isn't the Vault door sealed?
1TO0001177	Why would your father kill Jonas? That makes no sense.
1TO0001179	I was wrong. I'm sorry. I do need your help.
1TO0001180	I may have been a little hasty earlier. I'm ready to hear your plan.
1TO0001181	Nothing. I just wanted to see if you were still waiting for me to come back.
1TO0001182	Huh? What's wrong, Amata?
1TO0001183	What do you mean, my Dad is "gone"?
1TO0001184	I've never seen you so scared, Amata. What's happened?
1TO0001185	Dad couldn't have really left the Vault! That's impossible...
1TO0001186	What? Jonas is dead? What the hell is going on?
1TO0001187	So, Mr. Paranoid has finally gone over the edge?
1TO0001188	Good for Dad. About time someone stood up to the Overseer. No offense.
1TO0001189	Tell me who killed Jonas. They won't get away with this!
1TO0001190	Why didn't you say they were killing people? Let's get out of here!
1TO0001192	Big deal. Your dad's mad at my dad. What's that got to do with me?
1TO0001193	I'm listening now. What's happened to Jonas?
1TO0001194	So I guess maybe it is time to get moving.
1TO0001195	My Dad can't have really left the Vault. That's impossible.
1TO0001196	How weird. I was just dreaming about you...
1TO0001198	Oh my God... Are you okay?
1TO0001199	You're not going to cry, are you?
1TO0001200	So they killed Jonas, and I'm next, is that it?
1TO0001201	What does any of this have to do with me?
1TO0001202	If your father killed Jonas, I'm going to make him pay.
1TO0001203	Leave me alone. I'm trying to get some sleep.
1TO0001204	Why would they be looking for me? I haven't done anything.
1TO0001205	I'm not afraid of your father's thugs. You should know that by now.
1TO0001206	Shutting up and listening.
1TO0001207	That's crazy even for your father. What's happening?
1TO0001208	My Dad can't have left. The door is sealed shut.
1TO0001209	You're right. I can't stay here. But where can I go?
1TO0001210	I've heard enough. I'm going to make them pay.
1TO0001211	Fine. Escape first, payback later.
1TO0001212	You're the Overseer's daughter! Can't you fix this?
1TO0001213	Even if that's all true... how did you get here first?
1TO0001214	Sorry, Amata. I do trust you. It's just a lot to take in.
1TO0001215	Lights out? Radroaches? Maybe you'd better tell me more about what's going on.
1TO0001216	Whatever. In any case, I don't need any more of your "help."
1TO0001217	I need to escape the Vault. And you're going to help me.
1TO0001218	Escape the Vault? How?
1TO0001219	Not another one of your "plans," Amata...
1TO0001220	I don't need help from anyone. Especially not from the Overseer's daughter.
1TO0001221	Well, when you put it that way... maybe I could use your help.
1TO0001222	Dad didn't need your help, and neither do I.
1TO0001223	Wait... If the door to the exit is sealed, how am I supposed to get out?
1TO0001224	Sounds like a good plan. Let's get out of here!
1TO0001225	Spill it, Amata. How do I get to the exit?
1TO0001226	That sounds awfully complicated. Why can't I just get out the normal way?
1TO0001228	What makes you think this tunnel won't be guarded? It could be a trap...
1TO0001229	No, I had no idea he was planning to leave.
1TO0001230	Of course he did! My dad tells me everything. <Lie.>
1TO0001231	You're right. It's none of your business.
1TO0001232	It's none of your business.
1TO0001233	Secret tunnel... sounds promising. But how do I get into the Overseer's office?
1TO0001234	So while I'm doing all this breaking and entering, you're helping me... how?
1TO0001235	I just have to break into the most heavily guarded place in the Vault? That it?
1TO0001236	Thanks, Amata. I'll only use it as a last resort, I promise.
1TO0001237	Nice. This will come in handy if I run into any of your father's goons.
1TO0001238	No, you keep it. You may need it more than I do.
1TO0001240	Come on. Let's go see if we can help her.
1TO0001241	Don't worry, Butch. I'll get your mom out of there.
1TO0001243	Are you saying you're afraid of the dark?
1TO0001244	Butch... asking me for help. If only you knew what "irony" meant...
1TO0001245	All right. I'll help. But I'm doing this for your mom, not for you.
1TO0001246	Why do you need my help, anyway? Afraid of a few Radroaches?
1TO0001247	Actually, I can leave her for the Radroaches. Just watch me.
1TO0001248	Ooh, I could be a Tunnel Snake!? Good luck with the Roaches. I'm out of here.
1TO0001249	Sorry, Butch. I've got my own problems to deal with right now.
1TO0001250	Begging... I like that. Let's hear some more begging.
1TO0001251	Um... no. I'm not going to help you. Bye, Butch.
1TO0001252	Fuck off. I'm not going to help you.
1TO0001253	Fine. I'll save your mom.
1TO0001254	Look, if you just shut up I'll go save your mom.
1TO0001255	Yeah, I decided to help her after all. But I still think you're an asshole.
1TO0001256	Here, take my BB Gun. You don't need to be scared of the Roaches now.
1TO0001257	Here, take my Baseball Bat. Now you can handle the Roaches on your own.
1TO0001258	Sorry, Butch. You're on your own. I've got to go.
1TO0001259	No, I'm just fucking with you. I came back to see if your mom was dead yet.
1TO0001260	Your mom's already done for. You'd better run before those Roaches come for you.
1TO0001261	You're big. They're little. Just go back in there and squish them. Be a hero!
1TO0001267	Thanks, Officer Gomez. I always liked you.
1TO0001268	And I'll pretend you don't work for a homicidal maniac.
1TO0001269	As far as I'm concerned, you're a murderer just like the rest of them.
1TO0001274	Just give me the keys to your office and your password. Then I'll be going.
1TO0001275	You're right. You will die if you don't give me that password.
1TO0001276	Amata trusts me. If you don't give me what I want, I'll hurt her. Bad.
1TO0001277	I'll escape without your help, then. I'm not the one who started killing people.
1TO0001278	If you ever lay a hand on Amata again, I'll make you regret it.
1TO0001279	Is that what you said to Jonas before you killed him? Time to die, old man.
1TO0001280	My father's no traitor. But you're a murderer and a thug.
1TO0001281	All right. We'll do it your way. I surrender. <Give him your weapons.>
1TO0001282	I'm here to kill you. Jonas was my friend.
1TO0001283	I'm afraid the Vault will just have to get along without you. Time to die.
1TO0001284	You've convinced me. Hand over your keys and password, and I'll be on my way.
1TO0001291	Why's the power out?
1TO0001292	What are you doing down here?
1TO0001295	I need to turn the power back on. Where are the reactor controls?
1TO0001307	Can you repair my gear?
1TO0001308	Can I see what you have to trade?
1TO0001309	I think we got off on the wrong foot...
1TO0001310	I've had enough of your shit, Dusk.
1TO0001312	Do you know about the Enclave?
1TO0001313	What do you think about Gallows?
1TO0001314	So what's your story?
1TO0001315	You mean you were the best shot. I'm here now.
1TO0001316	That's impressive. Competition must be stiff around here.
1TO0001317	Dusk? Oh, let me guess! Your real name's Dawn. Or is it Twilight?
1TO0001318	Please. Like I'm afraid of you people.
1TO0001319	Sorry, I was just joking around.
1TO0001320	Good to know.
1TO0001323	I'd like permission to trade.
1TO0001324	You don't say much, do you?
1TO0001325	<Say nothing.>
1TO0001326	<Continue to say nothing.>
1TO0001328	So, what's your real name?
1TO0001329	Come on, it will really throw those guys for a loop if you tell me.
1TO0001330	Are you sure you won't tell me?
1TO0001331	Can't we work something out? Maybe share the winnings?
1TO0001333	What's the story with Gallows?
1TO0001334	I know Gallows' real name.
1TO0001335	I want to talk about Gallows.
1TO0001336	What's the pool up to?
1TO0001337	No one knows his name?
1TO0001338	You never did tell me what I'd win.
1TO0001339	It's Irving.
1TO0001340	On second thought... I think I'll keep it to myself.
1TO0001354	That's all I needed.
1TO0001355	Can you describe the layout of the Citadel?
1TO0001356	Do you have a medic?
1TO0001357	I need some supplies. Who would I see about that?
1TO0001359	What's with that Gallows guy?
1TO0001360	How did you end up in the Brotherhood?
1TO0001361	What was the Scourge?
1TO0001362	How did you escape?
1TO0001363	How did you end up back here?
1TO0001364	That's pretty amazing, Kodiak.
1TO0001365	Oh, you're done? Sorry, I nodded off there...
1TO0001366	What happened to your parents?
1TO0001367	What happened to the other kids from the Pitt?
1TO0001368	That's awful! How could the Brotherhood do that?
1TO0001369	What made them so terrible?
1TO0001370	Huh? I'm sorry, are you still talking?
1TO0001371	Yeah, I did. I'm sorry, go on...
1TO0001372	That was before I knew how boring it was.
1TO0001373	Sounds like a nice place. You should go back.
1TO0001374	Can we talk about something else?
1TO0001376	Initiate triage protocol.
1TO0001378	No. I'm done with you.
1TO0001379	Ouch! That hurt! What the hell?
1TO0001380	Why did you damage me? You're supposed to be a healing robot!
1TO0001381	What do you Scribes do?
1TO0001382	Can you tell me something about the Scribes?
1TO0001383	Tell me a little bit about the Scribes.
1TO0001385	What are the Orders?
1TO0001386	And the Orders are...
1TO0001387	Could you name the Orders?
1TO0001388	What Order are you a part of?
1TO0001389	Let me guess. You belong the Order of the...
1TO0001391	Which Order do you serve, Squire Bowditch?
1TO0001392	What does the Brotherhood believe?
1TO0001393	What does a Scribe do?
1TO0001395	What about the Brotherhood's history in this area?
1TO0001396	Who are the members of the Brotherhood?
1TO0001397	What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?
1TO0001398	That's all for now.
1TO0001399	Who are the enemies of the Brotherhood?
1TO0001400	How did the Brotherhood start?
1TO0001401	Who leads the Brotherhood?
1TO0001403	What is the purpose of the Brotherhood?
1TO0001405	What do you think of Knight Captain Gallows?
1TO0001406	Relax, Squire. I don't bite.
1TO0001407	Understandable. I've met a lot of dangerous people myself.
1TO0001408	Good. Your fear... pleases me.
1TO0001409	There's no need to be nervous. You can trust me.
1TO0001410	You should be nervous. Who says that I'm not here to kill you all?
1TO0001411	The honor is all mine, Squire.
1TO0001412	You seem nervous, kid. Do I make you nervous?
1TO0001492	I have some other questions...
1TO0001493	I was just looking around.
1TO0001494	Sir, I was hoping you would reconsider your decision.
1TO0001495	Can you take me to see Dave?
1TO0001508	I know it's painful, but let's talk about what happened in Arefu.
1TO0001509	Why did you... do what you did to your own parents?
1TO0001510	How did Vance know you were one of them?
1TO0001511	How did you end up leaving Arefu?
1TO0001512	I saw the Family's mark on the wall. What's up with that?
1TO0001514	When did you first discover you had the hunger?
1TO0001515	What did Lucy say she saw you do to that Wastelander?
1TO0001516	Did you ever talk to your parents about it?
1TO0001517	Do you really believe in vampires?
1TO0001518	Do you know someone named Grady?
1TO0001519	I have a package for you from him.
1TO0001520	I found him dead.
1TO0001521	I bumped into him a while back is all. (Lie)
1TO0001522	Sure, here you go.
1TO0001523	Sure, here you go and you don't owe me a single cap.
1TO0001524	I'll sell it to you...for 300 caps.
1TO0001525	Hang on a second. You want it, you need to pay for it.
1TO0001526	I'm not giving you anything.
1TO0001527	Nope, sorry. I'm holding onto it.
1TO0001528	I've got the formula for Nuka-Cola Clear.
1TO0001529	I'm here to tell you Mercier is dead.
1TO0001530	None of your damn business!
1TO0001531	Hey, take it easy, I was just passing through.
1TO0001532	Who are you and why are you talking like that?
1TO0001533	What's with the masks, anyway?
1TO0001534	I think you've taken a few too many blows to the head, weirdo!
1TO0001536	Well, "captain", are we gonna fight or try and make a deal?
1TO0001537	I think you're all crazy, and I'm getting out of here.
1TO0001538	Screw it, I'm going for the faceoff!
1TO0001540	Fine, I'll take it.
1TO0001541	Make it 400 caps and it's all yours.
1TO0001542	Can I think about it?
1TO0001543	Okay... okay. Here. No need for violence.
1TO0001544	How about you pay me for it?
1TO0001545	No way, it's mine!
1TO0001546	Come and get it from me, if you think you can.
1TO0001547	I'm keeping it, and I'd advise you to back off before I get angry!
1TO0001548	Steal your secrets? Not at all.
1TO0001549	What secrets?
1TO0001550	Yeah sure, I'm here for everything you got. Hand it over, zombie!
1TO0001551	Ultrajet? That some sort of super chem?
1TO0001552	What the heck are you talking about?
1TO0001553	Stop trying to talk your way out of this, zombie!
1TO0001554	Yeah sure, what do you need?
1TO0001555	Nothing's free in this world, Murphy.
1TO0001556	No way. I'm not helping you make chems!
1TO0001557	Make it 30 caps each and you got yourself a deal.
1TO0001558	What's the deal with Barrett?
1TO0001559	Have you ever heard of The Family?
1TO0001560	Here's all the Sugar Bombs I've got.
1TO0001561	Can I buy some Ultrajet?
1TO0001562	Let me think about it a bit.
1TO0001563	Alright, Murphy... I'm in.
1TO0001565	About those Treeminders...
1TO0001566	Did you ever ask one of them to kill you?
1TO0001567	Had you ever asked one of them to kill you before?
1TO0001568	How do the Treeminders normally handle other Outsiders?
1TO0001569	Which Treeminder do you get along with the best?
1TO0001584	What's the latest gossip?
1TO0001598	I think I'll tough it out.
1TO0001599	Yes, cure me.
1TO0001600	I don't have 50 caps.
1TO0001603	I don't have 20 caps.
1TO0001605	All right, here's your money.
1TO0001606	Actually, I don't have 100 caps.
1TO0001612	Actually, I don't have the caps.
1TO0001615	Actually, I don't have 75 caps.
1TO0001623	That's all I need.
1TO0001624	There was something else I needed...
1TO0001625	That's ridiculous. I'm not paying you that much!
1TO0001626	50 caps would still leave you with a nice profit. What do you say?
1TO0001627	Come on, doc. I need help. 75 caps is better than nothing, right?
1TO0001628	That's highway robbery. 100 caps is more than fair, don't you think?
1TO0001629	Can you heal my radiation?
1TO0001631	Here's your 100 caps. Do it.
1TO0001632	I don't have 100 caps.
1TO0001633	I need medical supplies.
1TO0001634	I know how you feel. I lost my Dad.
1TO0001635	Want to come with me? It's dangerous out here all alone.
1TO0001636	Don't worry, boy. You get used to losing people out here.
1TO0001637	Find ammo, boy!
1TO0001638	Find chems, boy!
1TO0001640	Find some food, boy!
1TO0001642	Find me a weapon, boy!
1TO0001643	What? No... No, that's impossible. He would never... Would he?
1TO0001644	Liar! He... he would never betray me like that!
1TO0001645	You were talking... to the Enclave?! About what?!
1TO0001646	Okay, so you were talking to the Enclave. What did they want.
1TO0001647	Who are those girls? And where are their clothes?
1TO0001648	Who's that girl? And why isn't she dressed?
1TO0001649	That girl looks cold. Why isn't she dressed?
1TO0001650	So those girls are just your... whores?
1TO0001651	So that girl is just your... whore?
1TO0001652	Why aren't you dressed?
1TO0001653	Who are you? And why are you dressed like that?
1TO0001655	If he's that bad, come with me. I'll protect you.
1TO0001656	Dukov has a special key. Get it for me and I'll take you to Rivet City.
1TO0001657	You should come with me. You can't survive here by yourself.
1TO0001658	Hey, can I have some of that hooch?
1TO0001659	Can I have another drink?
1TO0001660	So what's the deal with Dukov?
1TO0001661	What's this Dukov guy like?
1TO0001663	Damn! I wish I had a setup like this.
1TO0001664	Lucky bastard. He's got a sweet setup here.
1TO0001665	Does he pay you for this?
1TO0001670	No. It's going to be a while before I go to Rivet City.
1TO0001671	Rivet City it is.
1TO0001674	Thanks for the warning.
1TO0001675	I'm sure you can find a way to survive here.
1TO0001676	So... What exactly is this place?
1TO0001677	Admit it. You're just a whore.
1TO0001678	So basically, you're just a whore?
1TO0001679	What are you doing way out here by yourself?
1TO0001680	I guess you'll just have to live with your choice.
1TO0001681	Your life, your choice.
1TO0001692	Mutts that don't shut up get eaten. See if I'm kidding.
1TO0001693	Been a while since I tasted dog meat. Now, play dead. Forever.
1TO0001694	Looks like you've got some fight left in you, yet. That's a good sign.
1TO0001696	I need you to repair my stuff.
1TO0001697	What do you have for sale?
1TO0001700	Calm down. I'm here to help.
1TO0001701	Your gun is jammed? Can I take a look at it?
1TO0001702	Yeah, it's jammed good. I can't help you.
1TO0001703	Sure can. Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
1TO0001705	No, I just wanted to look at it.
1TO0001706	Don't worry about that gun. Take one of mine.
1TO0001707	Don't worry about it. Just keep your head down and let's get out of here.
1TO0001708	So, you're a representative of the mighty Brotherhood? Please.
1TO0001709	Mock you? I'd rather kill you.
1TO0001710	All right then, let's go.
1TO0001711	Let's get out of here, I don't have all day.
1TO0001712	What's happening here?
1TO0001713	Is the initiate still alive?
1TO0001714	What sort of exercise were you doing out here?
1TO0001715	What's in it for me?
1TO0001716	100 caps? How much is really in it for me?
1TO0001717	I've heard enough. Let's go get your man.
1TO0001719	I'm sorry, I can't help you.
1TO0001720	Fuck off, boy scout. I'm not here to help you.
1TO0001721	What is it that you do here, Gallows?
1TO0001722	I wanted to ask you about your recon duties.
1TO0001723	Is there anyway I could help you?
1TO0001724	So, do I get to know, or do I have to guess?
1TO0001725	What do you need me to do?
1TO0001726	I think I can handle that.
1TO0001727	Yeah... not really interested.
1TO0001729	Is that your job? Why do you need me to do it?
1TO0001730	Yeah, no thanks.
1TO0001731	You talk too much. Cut the chatter and get to the point, would you?
1TO0001732	Yeah... on second thought, never mind.
1TO0001733	Well. Sounds very exciting. I'll let you get back to that.
1TO0001734	I have data to sell you.
1TO0001742	What was that? You hurt me! You're the worst medical robot ever!
1TO0001743	I had some questions for you, Sawbones.
1TO0001744	Run a level two diagnostic on the medical subsystems.
1TO0001745	Close neural pathway 0x63A82 and reroute remaining functions.
1TO0001746	What is that pathway responsible for?
1TO0001747	Say, could I reprogram you to kill people?
1TO0001748	Wait... what? That was pretty articulate for a robot.
1TO0001749	Define "unusual."
1TO0001750	Why would you want to harm humans?
1TO0001751	If you can't harm humans, how were you able to hurt me?
1TO0001752	Does the Brotherhood know that you're intelligent?
1TO0001753	What do you want me to do?
1TO0001754	Well, that must suck. I'll leave you to that.
1TO0001755	What did we ever do to you?
1TO0001756	Well, that's great. I don't care.
1TO0001757	Hmm. Interesting. Forget it.
1TO0001758	Cancel. Return to main menu.
1TO0001760	Why don't you just go over and see what he's yelling about?
1TO0001761	Oh, come on. He'll listen to reason. Go talk to him.
1TO0001762	Hmm. Good point. Best to leave him alone.
1TO0001763	What's that guy's problem?
1TO0001764	Whoa, calm down. I was just exploring this area.
1TO0001765	I use what I can find, the same as anyone.
1TO0001766	Does it involve money? I really like money. Like, a lot.
1TO0001767	As long as there's money involved, I'm in. Mmmm.... money.
1TO0001768	Money and the promise of mysterious compensation? I'm in.
1TO0001769	I'm interested in this. Tell me more.
1TO0001770	And you want me to help you gather books, right?
1TO0001771	The mighty Brotherhood is gathering books? Seriously?
1TO0001772	Sorry, I'm too busy right now.
1TO0001773	Why should I tell you anything, lady?
1TO0001774	I can't go anywhere without bumping into you assholes.
1TO0001775	I guess I'll be going, then.
1TO0001776	I'll trade one.
1TO0001777	I'll trade two.
1TO0001778	I'll trade three.
1TO0001779	I'll trade four.
1TO0001780	I'll trade five.
1TO0001781	Take all the books I have.
1TO0001782	Actually, never mind.
1TO0001783	Actually, I don't have any books to trade.
1TO0001784	What do you do in this library?
1TO0001785	Why are you collecting books?
1TO0001786	Wait... Is there a problem with your Elder?
1TO0001787	I see. Thanks.
1TO0001788	Where can I find Scribe Jameson?
1TO0001790	I want to help.
1TO0001792	What were you doing up here?
1TO0001793	What are you doing way out here?
1TO0001794	Is there anything going on here?
1TO0001795	I'm interested in trading.
1TO0001797	What are the Scrolls that you mentioned?
1TO0001798	Where can I find Holotags?
1TO0001799	Why can't you send your own people to find the Holotags?
1TO0001800	What's my reward if I bring you these Holotags?
1TO0001803	I had a few questions about them.
1TO0001804	I've found some Holotags.
1TO0001805	I have one Holotag for you.
1TO0001806	I have two Holotags for you.
1TO0001807	I have three Holotags for you.
1TO0001808	I have four Holotags for you.
1TO0001809	I have five Holotags for you.
1TO0001810	Take all the Holotags I have.
1TO0001812	Sure, I've got all the time in the world.
1TO0001813	And without radio equipment, you can't keep track of them?
1TO0001814	You can't keep track of your own damn soldiers? Who runs this place?
1TO0001815	<Yawn.>
1TO0001816	How about we skip the story and you just tell me what you want.
1TO0001817	Frankly, I don't give a damn.
1TO0001818	Hey, can you hook me up with some chems?
1TO0001819	I could use some food. Got anything for sale?
1TO0001823	Never mind. I'll be fine.
1TO0001831	Um... no. <Lie.>
1TO0001832	Um... no. <Lie>
1TO0001833	That's awfully bigoted of you.
1TO0001834	It's a great place to live. But dirty Ghouls like you can't live there.
1TO0001835	It's a great place to live. But filthy fucking Ghouls like you can't live there.
1TO0001836	Relax. I'm the one that helped get Ghouls into Tenpenny Tower.
1TO0001837	I wouldn't suggest going there. They don't treat your kind very well.
1TO0001839	More power to you.
1TO0001840	I can't give you all my stuff, sorry.
1TO0001844	Sorry. I've got other things on my mind right now.
1TO0001845	I'm kind of thirsty. Still got that Nuka-Cola Quantum for sale?
1TO0001846	That sounds mighty good in this heat. What is it?
1TO0001847	If it's that rare, I bet it will cost an arm and a leg.
1TO0001848	Nope, I'm really not interested.
1TO0001849	Nuka-Cola Quantum, huh? That does sound good. How much?
1TO0001850	How is it better than a regular Nuka-Cola?
1TO0001851	You got any snake oil in there as well?
1TO0001852	I'll take it for 50 caps.
1TO0001853	Sure, I'll take it!
1TO0001855	I heard arguing. What's going on?
1TO0001856	You guys lost?
1TO0001857	My mistake. I thought you were someone else.
1TO0001859	I don't have time to deal with this.
1TO0001860	What are you doing wandering around out here?
1TO0001861	What is Underworld?
1TO0001862	Well, you're dead meat now. Give me all your stuff.
1TO0001863	What book?
1TO0001864	Just be glad you're still alive.
1TO0001865	Actually, I helped write that book.
1TO0001866	I'm sorry to hear that. Is it really that bad?
1TO0001867	Maybe the book's fine, and you're just an idiot.
1TO0001868	Book? What book?
1TO0001869	Oh, I am hunting. I'm hunting what you've got.
1TO0001870	Two meals a day doesn't sound like much.
1TO0001872	Why are you so happy?
1TO0001873	You must be crazy. It's never a good day out here.
1TO0001874	Read it? I helped write it!
1TO0001875	No. Why don't you tell me about it? <Lie>
1TO0001876	I never meant it like all that. It's just supposed to help you stay alive.
1TO0001877	Blessings to you, too. Surely, you would care to give a tithe for that wisdom?
1TO0001878	No, I haven't seen any slaves around here.
1TO0001879	Maybe I have. What's it worth to you?
1TO0001880	Yeah, they're hiding right around the corner.
1TO0001881	They're just around the corner. You can't miss them.
1TO0001882	Actually, I don't know where they are. But thanks for the caps.
1TO0001883	Uh, I think I saw them about two miles south of here.
1TO0001884	I've been worried about you. You don't exactly seem cut out for this place.
1TO0001885	Happy? Sure, I guess you could call it that.
1TO0001886	Life sucks, then you die. You may as well get that through your thick skull.
1TO0001887	Who are you? I've never met a friendly Super Mutant before.
1TO0001888	A talking Super Mutant? What next, a dog on a bicycle?
1TO0001889	I just wanted to get a good look at your ugly mug before I blew it away.
1TO0001890	Sounds like you've been having some bad luck.
1TO0001891	Lucky for you that you got away, huh?
1TO0001892	Maybe? What do you mean?
1TO0001893	You think being attacked by Raiders is good luck?
1TO0001894	You'd rather those Raiders caught you? Maybe you are crazy.
1TO0001895	That sounds bad.
1TO0001896	Obviously you got out somehow.
1TO0001897	Tell your crazy stories to somehow who cares.
1TO0001898	That was a stroke of good luck.
1TO0001899	Do you still have any? I could use some water.
1TO0001900	I've had enough of this pointless story. Shut up already.
1TO0001901	Like I said, bad luck for you.
1TO0001902	Like I said, you were lucky to get away.
1TO0001903	So that's your story? I can't believe I stood here and listened to it.
1TO0001904	Give me everything you've got and I might let you live.
1TO0001905	Um. Thanks.
1TO0001906	You don't seem to understand. I'm robbing you.
1TO0001907	I don't need some old clothes you found. Time to die, freak.
1TO0001908	You said "before I became this." What did you mean?
1TO0001909	How'd you get the name Uncle Leo?
1TO0001910	You look a little lost. Do you need directions?
1TO0001911	The Temple is in the Lincoln Memorial, near the Washington Monument.
1TO0001912	It's far northwest of D.C. Real friendly people there. <Lie.>
1TO0001913	Never mind. I've got to get going.
1TO0001914	You have anything for sale?
1TO0001915	Well, I could use some firepower myself. What are you selling?
1TO0001916	Stealth Boys? I could use some of those myself.
1TO0001917	Robot parts? I could use some of those myself.
1TO0001918	Mines? I could use some of those myself.
1TO0001919	I could use some supplies myself. What are you selling?
1TO0001920	What are you selling?
1TO0001926	I've got some stuff that needs repairs.
1TO0001927	Sure, I can spare some water. <Give 1 water.>
1TO0001928	Then I guess you're done for, because I'm not giving you any.
1TO0001929	I don't have any water to spare, but I'll be back when I find some.
1TO0001930	Why don't we all split it? There's really no point in getting killed for it.
1TO0001931	It's never too late to learn. There's enough here to split three ways.
1TO0001932	No point in any more killing over this water. Let's split it and walk away.
1TO0001933	I'm taking the water. All of it. And don't try to stop me.
1TO0001934	Listen, for a share of the water I'll help you take out those jokers.
1TO0001935	It's none of my business. I'm just passing through.
1TO0001939	Bullshit. A mugger in the Wasteland? A real Raider would've shot me already.
1TO0001943	Something wrong with your robot?
1TO0001944	Robot's still broken, huh?
1TO0001945	I'm just looking for some supplies.
1TO0001946	I guess that robot doesn't like your house. I agree: the architecture sucks.
1TO0001947	I could try to fix that robot for you.
1TO0001948	What will you give me if I fix it?
1TO0001949	Hmm... A robot complaining about you forever. I like it that way.
1TO0001950	I'm not interested in fixing things right now.
1TO0001951	That's a complicated job. I'm going to need some money.
1TO0001952	Sounds like a deal.
1TO0001953	Forget it. I'm not interested.
1TO0001954	Your robot's working fine, now.
1TO0001955	I had to disable that robot. It was going to explode. <Lie.>
1TO0001956	Your robot made this satisfying grinding noise when I ripped out its innards.
1TO0001962	Hand over your merchandise if you don't want to die!
1TO0001963	Interesting. Well, I'll see you around.
1TO0001964	Sure, kid. Here's to my number one fan.
1TO0001965	Autographs aren't free. I charge 10 caps for my time. No exceptions.
1TO0001966	How about I give you my super suit? Would that make your day, kid?
1TO0001967	Sorry. Not today.
1TO0001972	What is it? What did you see?
1TO0001973	What are you, crazy or something?
1TO0001974	The Wasteland is as dead as you're going to be if you don't tell me the truth!
1TO0001976	What kind of meat is that you're selling, anyway?
1TO0001977	Calm down! Let me try and help you.
1TO0001978	Who's burning what?
1TO0001979	Shut up and make some sense!
1TO0001980	Donovan! What are you doing in these parts?
1TO0001981	No problem. What are you doing out here?
1TO0001982	Hey, you can't always count on me to save your ass.
1TO0001983	What are you doing, following me?
1TO0001984	I don't know what to say. What do I owe ya?
1TO0001985	Wow, thanks!
1TO0001986	Now that's what I call payment.
1TO0001987	Good to see you, Susie! Looks like you're doing well.
1TO0001988	I never expected to see you out here, either. I'm surprised you're alive.
1TO0001989	So, does that mean I can come back?
1TO0001990	Doesn't really make a difference to me. I was exiled, remember?
1TO0001991	I miss her, too. Give my warmest regards to the Vault, would you?
1TO0001992	Well, don't let me hold you up.
1TO0001993	Fine, I like it better up here than I ever did down there.
1TO0001994	Can't we talk this out?
1TO0001995	Well, what are you waiting for?
1TO0002000	I don't mean any trouble. I'm just passing through.
1TO0002001	Good to meet you, Rock. I hope you're on my side.
1TO0002002	Thanks for the help. Who are you?
1TO0002004	I'm with the Brotherhood. I didn't expect to see troops so far out here.
1TO0002005	Who are you guys? I've never seen equipment like that.
1TO0002006	Rococo Rockfowl? How did you end up with a name like that?
1TO0002007	Trust me, I don't plan to die anytime soon.
1TO0002009	You've got a laser. Technically, you'd be asking "with highly focused light."
1TO0002011	How about I skip right to calling you "Coco"?
1TO0002012	I'd hate if my corpse ruined this lovely Wasteland. It'd clash with the drapes.
1TO0002014	I think I made a wrong turn somewhere. I'll be leaving now, sir.
1TO0002015	Shut up and get that fucking gun out of my face.
1TO0002017	I'll take .556 ammo.
1TO0002020	I'll take frag grenades.
1TO0002023	I'll take Rad-Away.
1TO0002026	I'll take Stimpaks.
1TO0002029	You'll like this. It's an Alien Blaster. Seriously.
1TO0002031	Here, I found an Alien Power Cell.
1TO0002033	Here's some Power Armor from the Enclave.
1TO0002035	Here's a Power Armor Helmet from the Enclave.
1TO0002037	What are you looking for, again?
1TO0002039	How about a Laser Pistol?
1TO0002041	How about a Laser Rifle?
1TO0002043	I've got a Plasma Pistol for you.
1TO0002045	I've got a Plasma Rifle for you.
1TO0002047	Take this suit of Power Armor.
1TO0002049	Take this Power Armor Helmet.
1TO0002051	I've got a sensor unit for you.
1TO0002053	I've got some spare parts for you.
1TO0002055	This Tesla Armor might be of interest to you.
1TO0002059	I'm not sure. Tell me more about this work.
1TO0002060	I need to know more about the job before deciding.
1TO0002062	Sounds good. I'm in.
1TO0002063	I'll take the job.
1TO0002065	I'll pass. If I can't be a member, I won't be your errand boy.
1TO0002066	I need time to consider it.
1TO0002069	Can someone in the Citadel train me to wear Power Armor?
1TO0002070	Would you grant me permission to receive Power Armor training?
1TO0002073	Can you train me to use Power Armor?
1TO0002075	Can anyone in there teach me how to use power armor?
1TO0002076	Are you kidding? If you get out, you can have all the booze you want!
1TO0002077	You're hopeless. Forget it.
1TO0002078	Do you make a lot of your own stuff?
1TO0002079	What have you made?
1TO0002080	Wow... your own stuff. That's... just stupid. Why take apart good guns?
1TO0002082	Hey, thanks. Keep it coming.
1TO0002083	Right on. Thanks.
1TO0002084	You guys are pretty isolated. Where do you get your supplies?
1TO0002085	So you pretty much get the leftovers?
1TO0002086	So what would it take for you to get some decent supplies?
1TO0002087	What do you need? Maybe I could bring you stuff to trade.
1TO0002088	Sounds like a good deal to me, man.
1TO0002090	Yeah, fuck that. I don't work for you.
1TO0002091	Sounds pretty rough, but that's business for you.
1TO0002092	Tough shit, man. Now shut up and sell me the stuff you already have.
1TO0002093	Why not put a boot to their asses and take the good stuff?
1TO0002097	They keep the good stuff? No wonder your selection sucks.
1TO0002098	Tough break, man. But let's talk about something else.
1TO0002100	Let's talk about those Chinese Assault Rifles you were looking for.
1TO0002102	I've got one rifle for you.
1TO0002104	I've got ten rifles for you.
1TO0002106	I've got two rifles for you.
1TO0002108	I've got three rifles for you.
1TO0002110	I've got four rifles for you.
1TO0002112	I've got five rifles for you.
1TO0002114	I've got six rifles for you.
1TO0002116	I've got seven rifles for you.
1TO0002118	I've got eight rifles for you.
1TO0002120	I've got nine rifles for you.
1TO0002122	So? What's the count?
1TO0002123	Come on, I haven't got all day.
1TO0002135	Yeah?  I'll give you a hall pass, chrome dome.
1TO0002136	Gee, Mr. Robot... I forgot my hall pass.
1TO0002137	Ooh... shiny robot!
1TO0002138	Maintence Code RHX-1W38.  Override Authorization Challenge Protocol.
1TO0002139	No, you'll need it more than I will.
1TO0002140	I'll take that. Now get out of here.
1TO0002142	Nope.
1TO0002143	Sure. I'll help.
1TO0002148	I'd like to buy a robot.
1TO0002150	That's a lot of caps, but I guess it's a pretty rare find.
1TO0002151	A picky robot? How does that work?
1TO0002153	You just don't want to sell to me, is that it?
1TO0002156	"Simulated personality"? Sounds like trouble.
1TO0002158	How about this: I'll take him off your hands for 500 caps.
1TO0002159	1,000 caps is a lot, but I'll take him.
1TO0002160	Sounds like a good buy, but I haven't got the caps.
1TO0002162	I'll pass. I don't need a crazy, robotic soldier following me around.
1TO0002163	About that deal we had... Greta is dead, as promised.
1TO0002164	I want to talk to you about Charon's contract.
1TO0002165	About that deal we had: Greta is dead as promised.
1TO0002167	So he's your slave?
1TO0002168	He doesn't say much, does he?
1TO0002169	He's a loyal employee? What do you mean?
1TO0002170	What does he do for you?
1TO0002172	I'll give you 1,000 caps for it.
1TO0002173	I'll give you 2,000 caps for it.
1TO0002174	I'll give you 3,000 caps for it.
1TO0002175	I'll give you 4,000 caps for it.
1TO0002176	I'll give you 5,000 caps for it.
1TO0002177	I've changed my mind.
1TO0002178	Couldn't we work out some sort of deal?
1TO0002181	Why not just have Charon do it?
1TO0002182	I want nothing to do with this.
1TO0002183	Sure. Greta is nothing to me. I'll do it.
1TO0002187	Oh no. None of that. You belong to me now.
1TO0002188	Slow down, there. I have good news. I'm your new employer.
1TO0002189	Whoa! What the fuck was that?
1TO0002190	Sounds good. Let's get out of here.
1TO0002192	Nah. I'm just kidding.
1TO0002194	On second thought, stay with me.
1TO0002197	No, I'm not. Stay here.
1TO0002201	I'm serious.
1TO0002202	Do I look like I'm kidding?
1TO0002203	Because I say so. Go.
1TO0002204	You heard me. Get out of here.
1TO0002205	Don't make me repeat myself.
1TO0002207	Yes, I'm certain.
1TO0002208	You didn't mishear me. Leave.
1TO0002209	We must part ways, Paladin Cross.
1TO0002210	You knew my father?
1TO0002211	I want you to come with me.
1TO0002213	I'd like you to come with me.
1TO0002214	I loved him so much. I'll never forget him.
1TO0002215	By all means, ask.
1TO0002218	I don't suppose I could stop you.
1TO0002219	Why does it matter how a man dies? Death is death.
1TO0002222	He died as he lived. A selfish asshole.
1TO0002223	What about the Enclave?
1TO0002224	I would be honored, Star Paladin Cross.
1TO0002225	Perhaps later.
1TO0002227	Want to head back outside, Butch?
1TO0002231	I want you to come with me, Charon.
1TO0002233	How would you like to come with me, Clover?
1TO0002235	Come on, Dogmeat. Let's go!
1TO0002236	Let's get back out there, Jericho.
1TO0002241	Care to join me, Fawkes? I would appreciate your assistance.
1TO0002244	Time to head back into the fight, RL-3.
1TO0002248	I would like your assistance once again, Paladin Cross.
1TO0002252	Have you ever considered getting back out there?
1TO0002253	Are you interested in joining up with me?
1TO0002256	Out there in the Wastes, man. You must be bored to tears in this town.
1TO0002257	Yeah... Killing. Stealing. Sounds fun, doesn't it?
1TO0002258	You should come with me. I could use a hand.
1TO0002259	Here you go. Let's get out of here.
1TO0002260	Actually, I don't have 1,000 caps.
1TO0002261	Actually, never mind. I don't need your help.
1TO0002262	Finding a crew might be tough. Good luck, though.
1TO0002263	You're right. That sounds terrible.
1TO0002264	You know what? Forget I said anything.
1TO0002265	I was talking about the Wastes. You must be going crazy in this place.
1TO0002266	No, really. Never mind.
1TO0002267	Let's get going.
1TO0002268	Come on, boy!
1TO0002269	Not just yet. I wanted to talk to you about something.
1TO0002270	Hold on, Dogmeat.
1TO0002271	I just wanted to make sure you were still here. Goodbye.
1TO0002272	Stay. Stay!
1TO0002273	Let's talk about your tactics.
1TO0002274	I want you to change your combat style.
1TO0002276	That's all. Let's get going.
1TO0002277	Switch to a melee weapon.
1TO0002278	I like what you're doing. Stick with the melee.
1TO0002284	I want you to use ranged weapons.
1TO0002285	You're not bad with a ranged weapon. Keep it up.
1TO0002291	Let's talk about how close you're following me.
1TO0002292	Stick close to me.
1TO0002293	Stay close to me.
1TO0002294	You're good where you are.
1TO0002302	Your distance is good. Let's talk about something else.
1TO0002303	All right, you're good. Let's get out of here.
1TO0002304	Keep your distance. Try to flank them.
1TO0002305	Keep hanging back.
1TO0002312	Enough about tactics.
1TO0002314	I want you to change how close you follow me.
1TO0002315	No. Let's go.
1TO0002316	Yes, let's talk about something else.
1TO0002322	What's this building for?
1TO0002323	I'll be on my way now.
1TO0002325	How are things now that the power's back?
1TO0002332	Making your art? What kind of talk is that?
1TO0002334	Okay, you are officially weirding me out.
1TO0002335	You're a crazy bastard, aren't you?
1TO0002337	I need to speak to Three Dog.
1TO0002338	"Free voice of the people"? What does that mean?
1TO0002339	What's the Brotherhood doing here?
1TO0002340	I've got to go now.
1TO0002341	Where can I buy more things for my place?
1TO0002342	I'd like something to drink.
1TO0002343	I have to go now.
1TO0002344	I'd like a haircut please.
1TO0002345	Can you explain how the My First Infirmary works?
1TO0002346	Tell me a joke.
1TO0002348	What does my Jukebox do?
1TO0002349	Can you explain how the My First Laboratory works?
1TO0002350	What does the Nuka-Cola machine dispense?
1TO0002351	Can you explain what the Workbench is for?
1TO0002352	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my house.
1TO0002353	I'm looking to buy some things for my house.
1TO0002354	Can you tell me what the items do?
1TO0002355	Tell me about your Themes.
1TO0002356	I'd like to change my house's Theme.
1TO0002357	Okay, let me take a look at your stuff.
1TO0002358	Enough about the house. Let's talk about something else.
1TO0002359	Tell me about the My First Infirmary.
1TO0002360	Tell me about the Jukebox.
1TO0002361	Tell me about the My First Laboratory.
1TO0002362	Tell me about the Nuka-Cola Machine.
1TO0002363	Tell me about the Workbench.
1TO0002364	Tell me about the Robotic Butler.
1TO0002365	Let me ask you about another item.
1TO0002366	That's enough about the items.
1TO0002367	I'm interested in the Vault Theme.
1TO0002368	I'm interested in the Raider Theme.
1TO0002369	I'm interested in the Wasteland Explorer Theme.
1TO0002370	I'm interested in the Science Theme.
1TO0002371	I'm interested in the Pre-War Theme.
1TO0002372	I'm interested in the Love Machine Theme.
1TO0002373	Let me ask about something else.
1TO0002374	Actually, let me pick another Theme.
1TO0002376	I hear you're the person to see about buying stuff for my suite.
1TO0002383	Enough about the suite. Let's talk about something else.
1TO0002393	Yes, I'd like to buy it please.
1TO0002406	He keeps paying me all
1TO0002409	Here, just pull this back to clear the chamber.
1TO0002411	Still want to start that gang, Butch?
1TO0002413	You could join forces with me, if you'd like.
1TO0002414	Ride with me, and we can rampage across the Wasteland.
1TO0002415	Come along with me, and we'll make an awesome gang.
1TO0002418	Yeah... shame you're too much of a coward to start it yourself.
1TO0002420	I could always use a hand. Would you like to follow me?
1TO0002422	Let's talk about this house.
1TO0002426	I have two books.
1TO0002431	It does?
1TO0002438	Invalid choice list coming up.
1TO0002439	Whoa, hold on there. I'm a friend.
1TO0002458	Shoo, dog. Get out of here.
1TO0002460	Okay, I'll leave. You stay here.
1TO0002461	In that case, just die.
1TO0002463	How do you keep healthy here?
1TO0002464	What sort of education do the kids get in here?
1TO0002465	Where do you get food for this place?
1TO0002466	How do you keep this place organized?
1TO0002468	So, you're the only doctor in this whole place?
1TO0002469	What do you teach the kids?
1TO0002470	Where does the fungus come from?
1TO0002471	How did you get to be in charge of this place?
1TO0002473	That sounds like it's pretty useful fungus.
1TO0002474	How thorough are your teaching materials?
1TO0002475	How does the fungus grow?
1TO0002476	You said everyone has to leave eventually?
1TO0002478	That's all I need to know for now.
1TO0002487	Never mind. Go back to sleep.
1TO0002489	Why aren't you on the scav team anymore?
1TO0002493	I'm a Slaver. And I think you're just the kid I'm looking for!
1TO0002495	Bumble, do you want to go outside?
1TO0002496	Bumble, do you want to see the outside with me? There's someone you should meet.
1TO0002498	Maybe you should wait before going on any adventures.
1TO0002500	Come on, it'll be an adventure!
1TO0002501	Don't you want to prove to everyone that you're a big girl?
1TO0002503	On second thought, maybe not. You could get into trouble.
1TO0002511	What do you think about these classes?
1TO0002512	Do you like classes with Joseph?
1TO0002513	Could you tell me about this class?
1TO0002515	What do you think of Joseph's classes?
1TO0002518	Where can I find a doctor?
1TO0002519	Do you have a trader in town?
1TO0002520	I'm looking for Vault 87. Can you help me find it?
1TO0002527	Well, I'm glad there wasn't any blood over a misunderstanding.
1TO0002529	I'm a guest in town. Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing your friends.
1TO0002530	Mayor MacCready let me in. I don't want to cause any problems.
1TO0002532	Mayor MacCready let me in for rescuing those kids.
1TO0002534	That sounds delicious.
1TO0002535	The Mayor let me in for rescuing those kidnapped kids.
1TO0002536	The Mayor let me in. I'm not planning on causing trouble.
1TO0002537	Sometimes, people call me the Vault Dweller. It's nice to meet you.
1TO0002538	I'm not any of those. I'm a Vault Dweller. At least, I was when I was your age.
1TO0002540	The Mayor let me in because I rescued some of your friends.
1TO0002541	The Mayor let me in. I'm not here to cause problems.
1TO0002542	I'm from Vault 101, and I rescued some of your friends from the Slavers.
1TO0002543	The Mayor let me in. I'm not here to cause any trouble.
1TO0002546	No, you don't need to shoot me. Just think of me as a big kid.
1TO0002547	No, no, I'm not here to cause any problems! You don't need your gun!
1TO0002548	I'm not planning on starting any trouble.
1TO0002550	I'm the big hero who rescued your friends from the Slavers. How's that for cool?
1TO0002551	I'm from up above. So stay out of my way, kid.
1TO0002552	Beat it, kid. You bother me.
1TO0002553	Gee, what a great reception for a returning hero.
1TO0002554	Sure, if you've got the adult-sized stones to stop me.
1TO0002555	I'm new in town, and you're already threatening me? Not a good start.
1TO0002556	I'm new in town, and you're already threatening me? Not a good start, kid.
1TO0002557	I rescued those captured kids. I'm a big hero.
1TO0002559	I'm new in town, and that's all you need to know.
1TO0002560	I'm the big hero who saved those kidnapped kids.
1TO0002561	I'm new. Get used to me.
1TO0002562	I'd rather eat a Brahmin turd sandwich. With no bread.
1TO0002563	Hey, I rescued those kids from the Slavers. You owe me some respect, kid.
1TO0002564	Don't make me laugh. I don't give a damn about your food.
1TO0002565	None of your business, squirt.
1TO0002566	I'm a terrible monster, come to eat you up!
1TO0002567	Did you just try to give me orders? That's cute, little Princess.
1TO0002568	I don't work for anyone. But give me any trouble, and you'll regret it.
1TO0002572	I'd like some food.
1TO0002589	I've heard a lot about the fungus in your cavern, and I'd like to make a deal.
1TO0002591	I bring in needed supplies, and I get some of the fungus in return.
1TO0002596	Give me the fungus, or I'll seal this place underground. And you with it.
1TO0002598	Let me think about it and get back to you on that.
1TO0002600	I've got Buffout to trade for fungus.
1TO0002601	I've got some strange meat to trade for fungus.
1TO0002602	Can we work out a better deal for the fungus? This one is pretty unfair.
1TO0002603	I want to re-negotiate our fungus deal.
1TO0002607	I've got strange meat to trade for fungus.
1TO0002609	Are you the only guard on the front gate?
1TO0002611	Don't you guard the front gate?
1TO0002612	What's it like, guarding the back gate?
1TO0002613	You said you're in charge of "morale." What does that mean?
1TO0002614	Do you enjoy guarding the back gate?
1TO0002617	Why aren't there more guards here?
1TO0002620	Sounds like a rough job.
1TO0002622	Can I hear how Little Lamplight got started?
1TO0002624	No, I don't need to hear anything right now.
1TO0002628	Where did you get most of this junk?
1TO0002630	What sort of stuff does the scavenging team bring back?
1TO0002632	You used to go into Vault 87?
1TO0002634	That makes sense, I guess. Not a bad collection.
1TO0002636	What sort of technology?
1TO0002638	Monsters? What do you mean?
1TO0002640	I guess I'll have to go to the Vault itself to find out more.
1TO0002648	Sure, let's hear one.
1TO0002650	No. I don't have time for funny business.
1TO0002654	This is stupid.
1TO0002656	Noah who?
1TO0002658	I refuse to play along.
1TO0002660	Noah place where you can get some better jokes?
1TO0002662	That was hysterical!
1TO0002664	That was... um... really funny. <Lie.>
1TO0002666	That couldn't have been a joke. Jokes are supposed to be funny.
1TO0002668	Why don't you come up with new jokes or stories to tell?
1TO0002670	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
1TO0002673	I've got a tale I could tell you.
1TO0002674	There's more to my story, if you're interested.
1TO0002675	Want to hear the rest of my story?
1TO0002677	My stories are my own business.
1TO0002680	Not long ago, my father left me. So I went searching for him.
1TO0002681	I finally found Dad, but then he died protecting me and his life's work.
1TO0002682	Now I finally have a chance to finish Dad's legacy and revive the Wasteland.
1TO0002683	Oh, you'll see, don't worry.
1TO0002684	You'll hear all about it, don't worry.
1TO0002685	I'd tell you more, but I'm still working on how it ends.
1TO0002687	I left my dull life behind to search for fame and adventure in the Wasteland.
1TO0002688	I've enlisted the aid of the Brotherhood of Steel in my heroic adventures.
1TO0002689	I've met the nefarious Enclave, and I'll stop their threat to the Wastes!
1TO0002690	I haven't decided. Not yet.
1TO0002691	I can't promise anything. But I'll try.
1TO0002693	Long ago, my people were buried away. Now, I've arisen, to terrorize the Wastes.
1TO0002694	The Wasteland is littered with the victims of my vengeance... and amusement.
1TO0002695	I have a terrible choice to make: save the Capital Wasteland, or destroy it.
1TO0002697	You'll have to wait. Storytime's over for now.
1TO0002698	Maybe later. I don't know the ending, yet.
1TO0002703	That's it. Storytime's over for now.
1TO0002709	Tell me more about Little Lamplight.
1TO0002711	Don't you have the password?
1TO0002712	And you're supposed to be the smart one?
1TO0002713	On second thought, never mind.
1TO0002714	Yeah, I'm sure.
1TO0002715	So you know the way to get there?
1TO0002717	That's the only way?
1TO0002718	Can you turn the computer back on?
1TO0002719	Monsters? What monsters?
1TO0002720	Where can I find Joseph?
1TO0002722	For that price, I'll deal with it, myself.
1TO0002745	I bet you like to look at butts, don't you?
1TO0002746	Yeah, your mom sure likes it.
1TO0002747	Yeah, well at least it doesn't smell as bad as you do.
1TO0002749	You know what? Your face looks like my butt.
1TO0002750	Oh, come on. I'm a nice guy, really. May I please come in?
1TO0002752	Oh, come on. I'm a nice gal, really. May I please come in?
1TO0002753	Forget it.
1TO0002754	How can I get you to trust me?
1TO0002755	What if I go and help Sammy and the others? Then will you trust me?
1TO0002756	I'm the one who saved the kids from Paradise Falls.
1TO0002757	I got your friends back. Can I come in now?
1TO0002758	Why, what happened to Sammy and Squirrel?
1TO0002760	What's a mungo?
1TO0002767	Why does everyone call me a mungo?
1TO0002768	Why do people call me mungo? What does that even mean?
1TO0002769	Stop calling me mungo, kid.
1TO0002771	Why are you called Eclair?
1TO0002772	Why do they call you Bumble?
1TO0002773	How did someone like you get a nickname like Princess?
1TO0002774	Why are you called Knick Knack?
1TO0002775	Why are you called Knock Knock?
1TO0002776	Why are you called Zip?
1TO0002777	Why do you have the nickname Penny?
1TO0002778	Why are you called Squirrel?
1TO0002779	Maybe I'll regret this, but how did you get your nickname, Biwwy?
1TO0002784	I know why you're really called Princess, Princess.
1TO0002785	Can you tell me why Princess gets angry about her nickname?
1TO0002789	She was only mayor for five minutes?
1TO0002790	You don't have to be embarrassed by it. Not everyone can be a good mayor.
1TO0002792	Does she still hold a grudge against them?
1TO0002793	I hear MacCready really walloped you when you tried to play princess.
1TO0002795	Thanks, Sammy. That's useful information.
1TO0002797	You know what? Never mind. It's not worth making you cry.
1TO0002799	Yeah, well... You're a jerk and MacCready doesn't like you.
1TO0002800	Really? Funny how he spends most of his time with Lucy, then.
1TO0002801	"Best friend"? You haven't got friends, Princess. Not RJ, not Sammy, not anyone.
1TO0002803	I hear MacCready really put you where you belong -- at his feet.
1TO0002804	Couldn't even handle the job for five minutes, huh?
1TO0002807	Why would you have shot at me?
1TO0002809	Shooting at me would have been a big mistake, kid.
1TO0002821	Let's trade.
1TO0002828	Can you give me a haircut?
1TO0002839	Caps? What do you mean?
1TO0002842	You said you used to have another guard. What happened?
1TO0002844	You can't blame yourself for her death.
1TO0002846	That's the way things go, you know?
1TO0002848	You're going to stand guard all alone from now on? Quite a sacrifice, Stacey.
1TO0002850	Sounds like it was your fault Caps died. Guards can't slack like that.
1TO0002854	Didn't I just meet you?
1TO0002862	Wake up. I need to talk to you.
1TO0002864	You said you were selling your "Wazer Wifle"?
1TO0002866	How about giving it to a fewwow kid like me?
1TO0002867	How about 250 caps, instead? Is it a "deaw"?
1TO0002868	500 caps for a Laser Rifle? All right, it's a deal.
1TO0002869	I'm a little short on cash, Billy.
1TO0002871	Five hundred for a kid's toy? No way.
1TO0002873	Stop talking like that. No one thinks it's cute.
1TO0002878	You said you were looking for Nuka-Cola?
1TO0002880	Got anything else for a Nuka-Cola?
1TO0002881	Are you still offering a trade for Nuka-Cola?
1TO0002883	What have you got to trade for an ice cold bottle of Nuka-Cola?
1TO0002891	Never mind. I think you've had enough sugar for one day.
1TO0002893	Sounds like a good trade to me. Here.
1TO0002897	No deal, Zip.
1TO0002904	Do I look like someone that you want to blow off?
1TO0002905	I'm sorry to interrupt, Andy. I just had a few questions.
1TO0002926	What do you believe?
1TO0002927	Why do you worship the bomb?
1TO0002928	What the hell is wrong with you people?
1TO0002929	<Donate 10 caps.>
1TO0002930	<Donate 100 caps.>
1TO0002931	<Donate 50 caps.>
1TO0002933	I'm done donating.
1TO0002937	I'm only trying to help, Doc.
1TO0002938	I'm only trying to help, Doc. <Lie.>
1TO0002939	You can trust me. I'm a doctor myself.
1TO0002942	Let's talk about my father.
1TO0002943	Yes, and he says you owe him some caps.
1TO0002944	Just hand over the caps, and I'll be out of your way.
1TO0002945	I don't deal with junkies. Hand over all your caps. Now!
1TO0002946	Slow down. Tell me your side of the story.
1TO0002947	Look, just give me the caps and I'll tell him you're gone.
1TO0002948	I don't care. I'm just here for caps.
1TO0002949	You can talk all you want, but I'm not leaving without the caps.
1TO0002950	Look, just give me some of your caps, and I'll tell him you're gone.
1TO0002951	I don't know. Maybe Moriarty's right and you're just a junkie.
1TO0002952	You know what, keep your caps and I'll tell Moriarty you're gone.
1TO0002953	Who's Moriarty?
1TO0002954	Whoa, calm down... Who the hell is Moriarty?
1TO0002955	You'd better calm down, before I put you down.
1TO0002956	You don't still offer your... services, do you?
1TO0002957	What will you do now?
1TO0002958	Interested in buying some scrap metal?
1TO0002959	I have 10 to sell.
1TO0002960	I have 15 to sell.
1TO0002961	I have 20 to sell.
1TO0002962	I have 25 to sell.
1TO0002963	I have 5 to sell.
1TO0002964	Just take all the scrap metal I have.
1TO0002965	Just take all the scrap metal I have. No charge. I just want to help
1TO0002967	Actually, I don't have any parts to sell.
1TO0002968	What can I do to help around here?
1TO0002969	What did you need me to do again?
1TO0002972	The pipes are all fixed.
1TO0002973	How many leaks are there?
1TO0002974	Can't you fix the pipes?
1TO0002975	I'll keep it in mind.
1TO0002976	I'm not your errand boy. Just pay me for the repairs.
1TO0002977	Sounds good to me. I'll bring you the parts I find.
1TO0002978	Gah! Fuck! What are you?
1TO0002979	No. What's a ghoul?
1TO0002980	You know, it's not so bad.
1TO0002981	That's disgusting.
1TO0002982	I know what a Ghoul is. Now get away from me, zombie.
1TO0002983	I've got nothing against you people.
1TO0002984	Stuff it, Ghoul. And stop looking at me.
1TO0002985	Let me think about it for a moment, my good man.
1TO0002986	Are you kidding? Me? Shut the hell up, Ghoul. I'll beat you if I feel like it.
1TO0002987	I hadn't planned on it.
1TO0002989	Where did you come from?
1TO0002990	So where's the key?
1TO0002991	Why haven't you robbed him?
1TO0002992	Sounds risky. What if he catches me?
1TO0002993	Thanks for the info, Jericho.
1TO0002994	Did I miss something? What's your problem with me?
1TO0002995	Whatever your problem is, I suggest you get over it. Now.
1TO0002996	Never mind...
1TO0002997	This should buy you something. <Give 10 caps.>
1TO0002998	Funny. I'll take my caps back now.
1TO0002999	You're an asshole, Jericho.
1TO0003000	Go for the top shelf. On me. <Give 20 caps.>
1TO0003002	Who takes care of you?
1TO0003003	What do you think of Megaton?
1TO0003004	Who else is around town?
1TO0003005	It's okay, Leo. I want to help.
1TO0003006	You're hurting your family, Leo. Jenny and Andy care about you.
1TO0003007	That would be a good idea.
1TO0003008	You've made the right choice, Leo.
1TO0003009	I could tell them for you.
1TO0003010	I never thought about it that way. Can you hook me up?
1TO0003011	What's it worth to you to keep it out of the public eye?
1TO0003012	Never mind, Leo. It's not my business, anyway.
1TO0003015	You seem like a good man, Lucas. I apologize if we started off on the wrong foot.
1TO0003016	Sure. Whatever.
1TO0003017	Tell me more about your town.
1TO0003019	Know where I can get a drink?
1TO0003020	Does the town have a doctor?
1TO0003021	Why is the town called Megaton?
1TO0003022	I had some questions about this town's history.
1TO0003023	What's this place made of?
1TO0003024	So why didn't they move the bomb?
1TO0003025	There are a lot of parts here for just one machine.
1TO0003026	Why build the walls out of some old flying machine?
1TO0003027	I had another question about Megaton.
1TO0003028	I don't want to talk about Megaton anymore.
1TO0003029	How did the town start?
1TO0003030	Why did they build the walls?
1TO0003031	So it was just a collection of traders in the beginning?
1TO0003032	So anyone can live in Megaton?
1TO0003033	That's enough of the history lesson.
1TO0003034	How did you get here?
1TO0003035	Where did everyone else come from?
1TO0003036	Who's in charge around here?
1TO0003038	Tell me about Colin Moriarty.
1TO0003039	Tell me about Lucas Simms.
1TO0003042	Do you know a way I can earn some money around here?
1TO0003043	I think I have an idea what you might mean. Go on.
1TO0003044	I'll do it.
1TO0003046	Ghosts? What are you talking about?
1TO0003047	I don't think I can help you.
1TO0003048	My Dad told me we were born in Vault 101...
1TO0003049	Oh, I wasn't born in the Vault? That's complete bullshit, and you know it.
1TO0003050	You're wrong. My Dad never would have lied to me.
1TO0003051	You're a liar, Moriarty. I know where I grew up.
1TO0003052	Cut the bullshit, Moriarty. I want the truth. How can you possibly know me?
1TO0003053	Huh? My father and I were born in Vault 101...
1TO0003054	You're lying. The Vault's been sealed for 200 years!
1TO0003055	Tell me what you know! Tell me everything!
1TO0003056	Look, I just want to find my Dad. Do you know where he is?
1TO0003057	Let's cut to the chase. How much for you to tell me where my father is?
1TO0003058	Tell me where he is, Moriarty, or I'll beat it out of you!
1TO0003061	All right, Moriarty. Here's 100 caps. Now where's my father?
1TO0003062	No thanks. I'll find out on my own.
1TO0003063	100 caps!? Are you nuts? I don't have that kind of money!
1TO0003064	300? What the hell? You said it was 100 caps!
1TO0003065	I'm sorry, but we had a deal for 100 caps.
1TO0003066	This is ridiculous. Forget it.
1TO0003067	Okay, let's just take a step back. 100 caps was reasonable, wasn't it?
1TO0003068	Fine, 300 caps. Now spill it.
1TO0003069	I don't have 300 caps.
1TO0003070	Fine, here's your 100 caps.
1TO0003071	Yeah, yeah. Here, take your 100 caps. I hope you choke on them.
1TO0003072	Forget it. I'll come back.
1TO0003073	Wait a second! I handled Silver for you, and you still want me to pay?
1TO0003074	I... uh... only drink for medicinal reasons.
1TO0003075	I'm actually just looking for some food.
1TO0003076	Can you help me find something else?
1TO0003078	If you've got a point, make it.
1TO0003079	And how do you propose I do that?
1TO0003080	Wait... You want me to help you destroy the town?
1TO0003081	You're a sick man, Burke. This conversation's over.
1TO0003082	Throw in a 300 cap bonus, and you've got yourself a deal
1TO0003083	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave, now, and never come back. Understood?
1TO0003084	All right, Mister Burke. I'll do it. Megaton will burn.
1TO0003085	Actually, the sheriff will pay me to disarm the bomb...
1TO0003086	You're out of your mind, Burke. There's no way I'm helping you.
1TO0003087	If I destroy Megaton, I'll lose access to all of the town's services....
1TO0003088	What's so special about this Tenpenny Tower?
1TO0003089	Messing with that bomb seems pretty... technical. What if I can't do it?
1TO0003090	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Couldn't we at least warn them?
1TO0003091	I've disarmed the bomb, Mister Burke. That thing will never explode, now.
1TO0003092	It's time for me to go.
1TO0003093	You're right. My country deserves my unthinking and unquestioning support.
1TO0003094	Are you kidding? It's the duty of a citizen to question his government.
1TO0003095	Do you think people who fought a war with tyrants wanted unquestioning support?
1TO0003096	Well, they did give us guns and say, "If we fuck up, feel free to take us out."
1TO0003097	I really don't know. I skipped American government class back in the Vault.
1TO0003098	I couldn't possibly care less about governments or presidents.
1TO0003099	If you've never seen the Enclave, how can you know anything about them?
1TO0003100	Who are the Enclave, anyway?
1TO0003101	That's all I needed to hear.
1TO0003102	What's the story with that Ghoul?
1TO0003103	Where did he come from?
1TO0003104	Do you ever... you know... work with him?
1TO0003105	Why is Moriarty so hard on him?
1TO0003107	So, what's it take to hire you?
1TO0003109	What were you saying about radio stations?
1TO0003117	What's the word around town? Heard anything interesting?
1TO0003118	Certainly. Thank you.
1TO0003119	If it means that much to you, I'll take it.
1TO0003120	Look, I need a way to get some caps or I'll never have the money to pay you.
1TO0003121	I took care of Silver for you.
1TO0003122	I could use some directions around town.
1TO0003123	Is there a bar in town?
1TO0003124	Where can I rent a bed?
1TO0003125	Where's the closest clinic?
1TO0003126	I need some equipment. Where's the nearest general store?
1TO0003128	Is there a weapons dealer around here?
1TO0003135	Maybe I could take a look at it.
1TO0003143	Choice 1
1TO0003144	Hey, we're cool.
1TO0003146	Choice 2
1TO0003147	Take a hike, asshole.
1TO0003148	Really? You sure don't look like a scientist.
1TO0003149	Why do you think the Enclave attacked Project Purity?
1TO0003150	What are you doing now?
1TO0003153	What's all this about Galaxy News Radio?
1TO0003154	I talked to Moriarty already and he's trying to charge me for the info.
1TO0003155	Gob, please. If you know anything about my father, you need to tell me.
1TO0003156	Look, you rotting piece of shit! Tell me what you know or it's splatter time!
1TO0003157	Look, if you know something, you'd better tell me!
1TO0003158	If you know anyone else that can help, I'd appreciate it.
1TO0003166	Sure, anything to get the information.
1TO0003167	So, you want me to do your dirty work?
1TO0003168	No way, Moriarty. No favors.
1TO0003169	I talked to Moriarty already, and he's trying to charge me for the info.
1TO0003170	Enough with the tough chick routine. Tell me more!
1TO0003171	Look, if you can give me more information or point me in the right direction...
1TO0003172	Look, sweetie. I'd love to spend time with you, but I need to find my Dad.
1TO0003173	Thanks for the assist. I didn't know this place was so dangerous.
1TO0003174	Wait... Who the hell are you people?
1TO0003175	Like I needed your help. Please.
1TO0003176	What can you tell me about Moriarty's terminal?
1TO0003177	I really need to get into that terminal.
1TO0003178	Help me get into that terminal, Nova. Finding my Dad means everything to me.
1TO0003179	I'm sick of this shit. Help me get into the terminal so I can find what I need!
1TO0003180	All right, thanks.
1TO0003181	Hey, sweetie. What can you tell me about Moriarty's terminal? I need in...
1TO0003182	Give me a break. Stop mouthing off and tell me what I need to know.
1TO0003183	All right, I'm sorry.
1TO0003184	Beautiful is your brains all over the broadcast booth if you don't cut the crap.
1TO0003185	All right, all right. Sorry I got so obnoxious.
1TO0003186	You know my father? Is he here? Please, I've been looking for him!
1TO0003187	I don't have time for small talk. I need to find my Dad.
1TO0003188	What's with the flashy introduction?
1TO0003189	You have about two seconds to tell me what I want to know...
1TO0003190	Holy shit! You're that guy from the radio!
1TO0003191	Wait, why do you trust me so easily? I've never met you before.
1TO0003192	How did you know I was looking for my Dad?
1TO0003193	How did you know what I needed?
1TO0003194	You don't seem like you have much to offer if you spend all your time up here.
1TO0003195	If you know anything that can help me find my Dad, please just tell me...
1TO0003196	If you know anything that can help me, I'd appreciate it.
1TO0003197	What could I ever do for you? You seem to have everything you need here.
1TO0003198	Just wipe that stupid look off your face and answer my questions!
1TO0003199	Can't you just help me?
1TO0003200	I suppose. What is it you needed?
1TO0003201	I don't have time for this crap. Tell me everything about my Dad, right now...
1TO0003202	I don't give a shit about you or this station. Just tell me about my Dad.
1TO0003203	The Good Fight? What's that all about?
1TO0003204	Whatever you want. I'm just looking for my Dad.
1TO0003205	Whatever you say. You have your problems, I have mine.
1TO0003206	You're going to have a "Good Fight" on your hands if you don't help me...
1TO0003207	So, people fight back.
1TO0003208	So you fight the Good Fight with your voice on Galaxy News Radio.
1TO0003209	So, what's this about the Good Fight?
1TO0003210	Look, I need to find my Dad. I don't have time for this nonsense.
1TO0003211	Look, I have problems of my own. I don't have time for this nonsense.
1TO0003212	I'm amazed you're still alive.
1TO0003213	Words don't kill people. Guns do.
1TO0003214	I understand your fight, but I still need to find my Dad.
1TO0003215	I understand your fight, but I have other concerns of my own.
1TO0003216	The guys outside are the Brotherhood of Steel? Who are they?
1TO0003217	All right, Three Dog. I understand the
1TO0003218	I don't give a shit about your "Good Fight." You going to help me or not?
1TO0003220	Good news, Three Dog. I already have the dish.
1TO0003221	No way, I'm not fetching some stupid dish for you.
1TO0003222	Let me think about this. I don't know if I'm ready.
1TO0003224	Look, Three Dog. If I find my Dad, maybe he can help with the Good Fight.
1TO0003225	I know he will. He's always talked about doing what's right.
1TO0003226	On second thought, maybe I should contribute. What do you have in mind?
1TO0003227	Rivet City? Where's that?
1TO0003228	Then Rivet City is where I'm headed. Goodbye, Three Dog.
1TO0003230	If I change my mind, I know where to find you.
1TO0003231	I see where this is going.
1TO0003232	I don't like the sound of this at all.
1TO0003233	Again with the damn stories. Just get to the point.
1TO0003234	This is starting to sound risky, but I'll do anything to find my dad.
1TO0003235	This is starting to sound risky.
1TO0003236	Super Mutants? Blowing things up? This sounds out of my league.
1TO0003237	No way in hell am I getting near a Super Mutant!
1TO0003238	All right. How can I help?
1TO0003239	I'm not sure that I can handle this, Three Dog.
1TO0003240	This is bullshit! You're blackmailing me!
1TO0003241	To find my Dad, I'm ready for anything.
1TO0003242	I'm ready for anything.
1TO0003243	There's got to be more you can tell me!
1TO0003244	Thanks, Three Dog. That makes me feel a bit better.
1TO0003245	This is all a bit much for me. Let me get back to you.
1TO0003246	So, you guys looking for new recruits?
1TO0003247	You sure you're not looking for recruits...
1TO0003248	Can you tell me about that suit of armor you people wear?
1TO0003249	Who did you say you were again?
1TO0003250	Wow. You guys don't screw around.
1TO0003251	You mentioned something about Galaxy News Radio?
1TO0003252	Anything else you can tell me about GNR?
1TO0003253	I'm sorry about Reddin and the others...
1TO0003254	I'm sorry about Reddin...
1TO0003255	Okay, I'm off.
1TO0003270	I did my part. Now it's your turn to contribute to the Good Fight.
1TO0003271	Enough with the inane banter! Just tell me already.
1TO0003272	I guess this is goodbye then. It's been a pleasure, Three Dog.
1TO0003273	Well, you got what you wanted, and I already know about Dad, so...
1TO0003274	Look, I already know about my Dad, so this was all a waste of time.
1TO0003275	Let me ask you something else.
1TO0003276	Thanks, Three Dog. I was just glad to help with the Good Fight.
1TO0003277	I did what had to be done.
1TO0003278	Yeah, yeah. It was the thrill of a freakin' lifetime.
1TO0003281	What kind of bullshit is this? That's all you know?
1TO0003282	I already know about Rivet City. I was hoping for a bit more.
1TO0003283	What kind of crap is this? I already knew about Rivet City!
1TO0003284	Feral Ghouls?
1TO0003285	Why bother operating Galaxy News Radio?
1TO0003286	Why is Galaxy News Radio so important?
1TO0003287	You're safe up here in your fortress. What do you know about fighting?
1TO0003288	I wish I could have met your parents. I bet they were... interesting.
1TO0003289	What's the underground route?
1TO0003290	Where's the Washington Monument?
1TO0003291	What's the best way to get to the Museum?
1TO0003292	Guess what, Three Dog. I found out where my Dad went.
1TO0003293	Well, yeah! Where's my Dad gone?
1TO0003294	No shit! Spill it already, Three Dog.
1TO0003295	Please! I miss him so much!
1TO0003297	You keep talking about the Enclave. Who are they?
1TO0003298	Galaxy News Radio, huh? What's it all about?
1TO0003299	What's this "Good Fight" you keep mentioning?
1TO0003300	Do you know anything helpful about the Museum of Technology?
1TO0003301	Tell me more about this relay.
1TO0003302	So, what's your story?
1TO0003324	He's disappeared, and I'm just trying to find him. That's all.
1TO0003325	He doesn't live here. He came here to see Doctor Li.
1TO0003326	I'm sure you don't know him. He's lived in a Vault his whole life.
1TO0003327	Why does it matter who he is? Just let me pass.
1TO0003328	I'm looking for my father.
1TO0003329	Forget it. I'm out of here.
1TO0003330	I'm looking for a Doctor Li.
1TO0003331	I don't answer to you, pal.
1TO0003332	Oh, I'm just wandering around.
1TO0003333	Hey, it's no big deal. I just need to see her for a minute, and I'll be gone.
1TO0003334	My father came to see her. I'm trying to find him.
1TO0003335	I have some questions about her recent work in hydroponics.
1TO0003336	It's personal, okay? I swear I won't cause any trouble.
1TO0003339	I've never heard Dad talk about you. Why is that?
1TO0003340	This isn't about me. This is about my father. Now where is he?
1TO0003341	I left the Vault to look for him.
1TO0003342	Screw the Vault. I'm not staying cooped up in there.
1TO0003343	Wait... How do you know who I am? Have we met?
1TO0003344	I know my father came to see you. I need to know where he is right now.
1TO0003345	I'm looking for my father. I know he was here.
1TO0003346	I've heard my father's notes. Did he come back here?
1TO0003347	You know my father? Have you seen him?
1TO0003348	Where's my father? Tell me now!
1TO0003349	Come on, isn't there anything you can do to help?
1TO0003350	Okay. Thanks anyway.
1TO0003351	His notes referenced someone named Dr. Braun. What can you tell me about him?
1TO0003352	He's not at the lab. He left to go find something called a G.E.C.K.
1TO0003353	His notes said something about Vault 112. Do you know where it is?
1TO0003354	My father's gone missing. Have you seen him?
1TO0003355	So you knew my mother?
1TO0003356	Why wouldn't you help him when he came to you?
1TO0003357	Why is my father so determined to work on this project again?
1TO0003358	I understand. I'm sure you did everything you could.
1TO0003359	You "weren't prepared"? My mother is dead!
1TO0003360	Whatever. I never knew her anyway.
1TO0003361	I've been to Project Purity. He wasn't there.
1TO0003362	I've been to the lab. He wasn't there. Just some old holotapes...
1TO0003363	Then tell me where this lab is, so I can get going.
1TO0003364	I don't need a lecture. I just need to know where to go.
1TO0003365	Where is this old lab of yours?
1TO0003366	If my father is there. I need to go after him.
1TO0003367	What was my father like back then?
1TO0003368	Why did my mother die? What happened?
1TO0003369	I never knew my mother. What can you tell me about her?
1TO0003370	What was the point of it?
1TO0003371	Why didn't it work?
1TO0003372	Why did you stop working on it? What happened?
1TO0003373	Is there any way you can help me out?
1TO0003374	I'd like to know a bit more about you.
1TO0003375	Tell me about this project you worked on with my father.
1TO0003376	What is this lab? What are you doing here?
1TO0003377	If he was here, then do you know where he went?
1TO0003378	I'm sorry. Could you please tell me where he's gone?
1TO0003379	He left? Then... where did he go?
1TO0003380	Then stop wasting my time and tell me where he is.
1TO0003385	I'm looking for my father. Have you seen him?
1TO0003386	You can't do this to me!
1TO0003387	What else do I have to do?
1TO0003388	If you're in charge, get me the hell out of here!
1TO0003389	So you're in charge here...
1TO0003390	What kind of benefits?
1TO0003391	I want to see him. Now!
1TO0003392	What do I have to do to see him?
1TO0003393	What have you done to him?
1TO0003394	You're out of your goddamn mind. You know that, right?
1TO0003395	If you're in control here, can you please help me?
1TO0003396	Why the hell would you want to look like a little girl?
1TO0003397	How do I get out of here?
1TO0003399	Fine, but it's only because I want more answers from you.
1TO0003400	Ha! That's it? No problem.
1TO0003401	No, I won't do that to them.
1TO0003402	I'm not playing anymore of your games.
1TO0003403	No. I'm not doing anything else for you.
1TO0003405	Where's my father?
1TO0003406	Just who are you?
1TO0003407	Fine. Let's just get this over with.
1TO0003408	It's about time! What do I get to do?
1TO0003409	Oh, great. I'm really looking forward to doing more for your amusement.
1TO0003410	I'm not agreeing to anything before you tell me what it is.
1TO0003411	I did what you wanted. Now you have some explaining to do.
1TO0003412	I want to see him. Where is he?
1TO0003413	How do I know you're not lying to me? Maybe you haven't seen him at all.
1TO0003414	Enough games! Take me to him now!
1TO0003415	I've got to admit, this is kind of fun. What can I do next?
1TO0003416	I don't want to do this... But I will.
1TO0003417	Nothing, never mind.
1TO0003418	She'll never see it coming.
1TO0003419	All right, fine. I'll do it.
1TO0003420	Now what?
1TO0003421	You don't need to stay here. You can live in the real world again.
1TO0003422	Let these people go. There's no reason to keep them here.
1TO0003423	Why haven't you left after all this time?
1TO0003424	What did my father want from you?
1TO0003425	What... is this place?
1TO0003426	Where's my father now?
1TO0003427	No, I won't do that.
1TO0003428	I said I wouldn't do that, and I meant it!
1TO0003429	How do I know you're being honest with me?
1TO0003430	But these people... They don't deserve to be punished.
1TO0003431	I can't wait. What do you want me to do?
1TO0003432	You're forcing me to do things against my nature, and I hate you for it.
1TO0003433	Sounds like fun.
1TO0003434	Who the hell is the Pint-Sized Slasher?
1TO0003435	Why are you doing all of this?
1TO0003436	But you could leave the Vault, find somewhere else to live.
1TO0003437	Yeah, real funny.
1TO0003438	How can I have another chance?
1TO0003439	I did what you wanted. Now let me out.
1TO0003440	That sure was fun!
1TO0003441	How do you know who I am?
1TO0003442	You'll just reset everything anyway. Who cares?
1TO0003443	Sure did. And now you're all alone.
1TO0003444	I didn't know. I didn't mean to do that!
1TO0003445	Awwww, isn't that a shame? My heart's bleeding. Really.
1TO0003446	Looks like you're stuck here all alone. How does that feel?
1TO0003447	Tell me about the G.E.C.K.
1TO0003448	Tell me about this place, about Tranquility Lane.
1TO0003449	Tell me exactly who you are. Who you really are.
1TO0003450	If you had let me see my father, maybe this wouldn't have happened.
1TO0003451	I'm calling the shots now!
1TO0003452	It's all over. Now shut up, and answer my questions.
1TO0003454	I put these people out of their misery. You're getting exactly what you deserve.
1TO0003456	What? I don't live here.
1TO0003457	Is this some kind of a game?
1TO0003459	I'm just looking around. I'll come back later.
1TO0003460	Let's just get this over with.
1TO0003461	I don't really have a choice, do I?
1TO0003462	Fine, I'll do it.
1TO0003463	No. I said I wouldn't do it, and I meant it.
1TO0003464	What have you done with my father?
1TO0003465	Where is my father?
1TO0003466	Tell me more about this place.
1TO0003469	You've seen my father? Where is he?
1TO0003470	Can we get out of here now?
1TO0003471	I came here to find you.
1TO0003472	What are YOU doing here? You could've been killed!
1TO0003473	I want answers from you.
1TO0003474	What, you didn't like being a dog?
1TO0003475	Yeah, well... Don't do it again.
1TO0003476	Good thing I showed up to save you.
1TO0003477	Did you get the information you needed?
1TO0003478	You've got to be kidding me...
1TO0003479	Okay, let's head for Rivet City.
1TO0003480	Dad... I'm not going with you. I have other things to take care of.
1TO0003481	You need to go back to Rivet City?
1TO0003482	Screw the Vault. I didn't need that place.
1TO0003483	So you're going back to Rivet City right now?
1TO0003484	"I'm sorry" isn't good enough.
1TO0003485	Don't you want to take a break, after what you've been through?
1TO0003486	What about me? What am I supposed to do?
1TO0003487	What did you learn?
1TO0003489	What the hell is wrong with you? Why did you just leave me like that?
1TO0003490	So you've been lying to me all this time?
1TO0003491	You left me there without saying goodbye. What was I supposed to do?
1TO0003492	"Your responsibility"? What does that mean?
1TO0003493	Finally, someone who knows what's going on! How do I get out of here?
1TO0003494	What are you talking about? You're not making any sense.
1TO0003495	I'm serious. Get the hell away from me.
1TO0003496	What Failsafe? What the hell are you talking about?
1TO0003497	Who are you talking about?
1TO0003498	How come you're the only one who seems to know this?
1TO0003499	Where did you say the Failsafe was?
1TO0003500	Sure, sure. I'm working on it. Really.
1TO0003501	Um... I went into the abandoned house, but I didn't see anything.
1TO0003502	There's nothing in that house. You're lying, or crazy, or both.
1TO0003503	Dad? Is that really you?
1TO0003504	Take a hike, mutt.
1TO0003505	Good doggie.
1TO0003506	Look, I know he's in here. I mean, in the Vault.
1TO0003507	He's an older guy, around 50 or so.
1TO0003508	He looks like me, but older. He's got to be here.
1TO0003509	He's a scientist. He's looking for Doctor Braun.
1TO0003510	What? That's crazy!
1TO0003511	That's it? I can do that.
1TO0003512	What kind of a game is this?
1TO0003513	Timmy Neusbaum? Who's that?
1TO0003514	No games. You tell me where my father is. Now, you little brat.
1TO0003515	No thanks. No games for me.
1TO0003516	Look, kid. I'm not interested in playing games.
1TO0003517	A game? Okay, I guess...
1TO0003518	What the hell's going on here?
1TO0003523	It's your basement, lady. You tell me.
1TO0003524	Well, then I guess he's cheating on you.
1TO0003525	It looks like Roger is a fan of women's clothing.
1TO0003526	So it's not yours? Oops.
1TO0003527	Maybe it's his. You know, for him to wear when no one is looking...
1TO0003531	Nice day, isn't it?
1TO0003532	What can you tell me about the neighborhood?
1TO0003533	What can you tell me about Mabel Henderson?
1TO0003534	This is a pretty convincing simulation...
1TO0003535	This is what, some kind of computer simulation?
1TO0003537	None of this is real. It's all some crazy experiment.
1TO0003540	Heard anything juicy about the neighbors?
1TO0003541	Got any plans for today?
1TO0003543	Nothing. Never mind.
1TO0003544	Just trust me. It's important.
1TO0003545	What do you mean, "worked everything out"?
1TO0003546	So they've had some problems in the past?
1TO0003548	Oh, come on. You know something, don't you? What's the story?
1TO0003549	Hey, maybe you should mind your own business.
1TO0003550	Hey, thanks for the tip.
1TO0003551	Look at this. It's her rolling pin, covered in blood. Martha's blood.
1TO0003553	Janet snapped. She killed Martha in cold blood. Look at this rolling pin.
1TO0003554	Martha Simpson is dead, and Janet killed her! Look, here's her rolling pin...
1TO0003556	Nah, I'm just kidding.
1TO0003558	I've got a game you can play. It's called "Hide and Go Fuck Yourself."
1TO0003560	Sorry, Timmy. I just thought you should know.
1TO0003561	They know what you did, and they're leaving you here all alone.
1TO0003562	They've never loved you. In fact, they both hate you and wish you were dead.
1TO0003563	Where am I?
1TO0003564	And you are...?
1TO0003565	Who is Betty?
1TO0003568	How could abandoning me be the right choice?
1TO0003569	Is this about mom? Are you trying so hard because of what happened to her?
1TO0003570	I've done some things I'm not proud of, but I'm trying to do better.
1TO0003571	I'm in the real world now. I can be whoever I want, do whatever I want.
1TO0003572	Because you're such a saint yourself, right?
1TO0003573	I'm just trying to survive out here. I do whatever I have to.
1TO0003575	Can we just talk for a minute?
1TO0003576	I wanted to talk to you about some things.
1TO0003577	You could have told me you were leaving.
1TO0003579	Why would you put yourself at risk like this? You have some sort of death wish?
1TO0003580	Just forget it. Let's get this over with.
1TO0003581	Can't we just go back to the Vault, back to the way things were?
1TO0003582	Thanks, Dad. That means a lot.
1TO0003583	I'm just trying to find a place for myself out here.
1TO0003584	Well, you taught me everything I know.
1TO0003585	Despite what you put me through, I'm trying to make the best of it.
1TO0003586	Helping people? What about helping your own son?
1TO0003587	Helpling people? What about helping your own daughter?
1TO0003588	How could you leave me like that? What the hell were you thinking?
1TO0003589	So you just disappear without saying a word?
1TO0003592	Oh, so now the father who walked out on me is going to give me a lecture?
1TO0003593	Nope. Nothing to do with me. <Lie.>
1TO0003594	What I do in the world is my business, not yours.
1TO0003595	Look, it's complicated. I'm not proud of it, but it needed to be done.
1TO0003596	Yes, I disarmed the bomb.
1TO0003597	Sure, I did it. But only because it paid well.
1TO0003598	What do you care?
1TO0003599	Never mind. Let's just get back to work.
1TO0003600	You know what? Fuck you, Dad.
1TO0003601	I guess it just runs in the family.
1TO0003602	Sure thing. I'll be right back.
1TO0003603	I don't like this, but I'll do it.
1TO0003604	Everything in there is dead.
1TO0003605	Yeah, it's taken care of. Should be safe now.
1TO0003606	How could you ask me to do something like that?
1TO0003608	It's not safe in there yet.
1TO0003609	I'm working on it, okay?
1TO0003610	Sorry, but I'm not doing that.
1TO0003611	No problem. I'll make sure it's safe.
1TO0003613	You really think you can do this? Make this thing work?
1TO0003614	Why would you throw away the life we had?
1TO0003615	I think I understand. I'm glad we talked.
1TO0003616	Just what are you trying to do here?
1TO0003617	Why is this so important?
1TO0003618	He's just trying to do the right thing.
1TO0003619	You'd better walk away right now.
1TO0003620	My father is dead.
1TO0003621	You don't need to be such an asshole...
1TO0003622	Okay. I'll be back soon.
1TO0003623	No way. I'm not doing this.
1TO0003624	I said I'm not doing this, and I meant it.
1TO0003625	What do we need to do right now?
1TO0003626	What should I be doing now?
1TO0003628	You said something about fuses?
1TO0003630	What's our goal here?
1TO0003631	Okay. Where do I need to go?
1TO0003632	Why me? Can't someone else do it?
1TO0003633	I don't have any meds on me, but what if we gave him some Buffout?
1TO0003634	I'm sorry, but it's for the good of everyone. Now let's go.
1TO0003635	No reason to hang around now, is there? Move it.
1TO0003636	We need to do something about Garza.
1TO0003637	Hey. Is there anything I can do to help?
1TO0003638	Maybe we should just leave him behind. He's slowing us down.
1TO0003639	Here, take some Stimpaks. That should get him through.
1TO0003640	I have some Stimpaks here.
1TO0003641	Forget it. I've got nothing.
1TO0003642	Sorry, I guess there isn't anything I can do right now.
1TO0003643	We don't have time for this shit. Let's go!
1TO0003645	You're only going to slow us down. Maybe you should stay behind.
1TO0003646	Let's go. This is no time to sit down.
1TO0003647	Stop here? Are you crazy?
1TO0003648	What can I do to help?
1TO0003649	What's the matter? Are you all right?
1TO0003650	Why would we stop now?
1TO0003651	I've got a 10mm Pistol. Want it?
1TO0003652	I can give you a Silenced 10mm Pistol.
1TO0003653	I've got a .32 caliber pistol.
1TO0003654	How about a Chinese Pistol?
1TO0003655	Here, take this Magnum.
1TO0003656	Sorry, I don't have a pistol on me.
1TO0003657	Is this dangerous?
1TO0003658	I'm going in.
1TO0003660	Where am I now?
1TO0003661	Where do I go from here?
1TO0003662	I already found my father, but thanks. He's on his way here.
1TO0003663	You seem very happy. Is there anything I should know?
1TO0003664	I'm meeting him here.
1TO0003671	Lead the way. Let's not waste any time.
1TO0003672	I'm not leaving my father in there!
1TO0003674	I told you I'd find him.
1TO0003676	What the hell just happened?
1TO0003677	How do we get out of here?
1TO0003678	Do you think Project Purity will ever work again?
1TO0003679	Anything I should know about this place?
1TO0003680	Can you help get us through this?
1TO0003681	Where can I find the fuse box?
1TO0003682	Where are the flood control pumps?
1TO0003688	All right. Let's get going.
1TO0003689	Won't that be dangerous?
1TO0003690	I'm not going with you.
1TO0003691	You have to go now? Can't this wait?
1TO0003693	Let's get moving. Follow me.
1TO0003694	You're not in charge here.
1TO0003695	Wait here. I'll scout ahead.
1TO0003696	What do you mean, "If we can make it"?
1TO0003697	What's up ahead? You seem nervous.
1TO0003698	Where to now?
1TO0003699	You have a plan?
1TO0003700	You're right. What do you need me to do?
1TO0003701	Thank you. I'm not sure what to do now that he's gone.
1TO0003702	I don't recall asking for sympathy.
1TO0003706	There's got to be another way.
1TO0003707	Don't you know?
1TO0003708	Well, I guess it's time to find out. I'll go there myself.
1TO0003709	So there's a Vault down there, and you've never bothered investigating it?
1TO0003710	Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Are you going to help or not?
1TO0003711	I'm running short on time, here. Let's cut to the chase.
1TO0003712	How did you know my father?
1TO0003713	I need to find a G.E.C.K.
1TO0003714	My father was looking for something called a G.E.C.K. Do you have one?
1TO0003715	Geez, don't strain yourself on my account... I just need a G.E.C.K.
1TO0003716	I need to find Vault 87 right now.
1TO0003717	Vault 87 has a G.E.C.K., but I don't know where it is.
1TO0003718	So that's it? I'm screwed?
1TO0003719	So you know how to find one?
1TO0003721	Thanks for your sympathy.
1TO0003722	How do I get through the radiation?
1TO0003723	Fine, whatever. Let's get to it.
1TO0003724	So what's the catch?
1TO0003725	How do I deal with them, then?
1TO0003726	What's the story behind Little Lamplight?
1TO0003728	Thanks for your help.
1TO0003729	Great. Thanks for nothing.
1TO0003730	I can handle it.
1TO0003731	Why, what's difficult about it?
1TO0003733	Okay, the guard's out of the way. Now get moving!
1TO0003734	I took care of the guard. Is it safe to leave?
1TO0003735	I did my part. You're on your own now.
1TO0003737	There's 100 caps in it for you.
1TO0003738	You don't think he's a good-looking guy? I bet he could show you a good time.
1TO0003740	I think Forty could use some company.
1TO0003741	The kids, I think. There are three of them, right?
1TO0003742	I'd like the three kids.
1TO0003743	I haven't gone and looked them over, no.
1TO0003744	I've... changed my mind.
1TO0003746	What are their names?
1TO0003747	Where did they come from?
1TO0003748	Can you tell me a bit more about them?
1TO0003749	I never said I was buying. I just said I want them.
1TO0003750	I can't afford that.
1TO0003751	I still can't afford that.
1TO0003752	No way am I paying that. Forget it.
1TO0003753	That sounds like a good deal. I'll take it.
1TO0003754	2000 is a bit steep. 1200 for all three is a more reasonable offer.
1TO0003755	Great, let's talk price.
1TO0003756	I was thinking about buying some slaves.
1TO0003757	We'd talked about the kids.
1TO0003758	I've seen your selection.
1TO0003759	You've got some kids out there. I want them.
1TO0003760	What? Why won't she leave?
1TO0003761	What the hell is her problem?
1TO0003762	Maybe I can talk to her. Can you tell me what's going on?
1TO0003763	Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you.
1TO0003764	Just stopping by to see how things are going. Tired? Need a break?
1TO0003765	I think Eulogy is looking for you.
1TO0003766	Nothing. Nothing at all.
1TO0003767	Lucky break there. He almost got away.
1TO0003768	How the hell did you make that guy's head explode?
1TO0003770	I was just wondering, really. I figure you must make more than the others.
1TO0003771	It just seems like you do most of the work around here.
1TO0003772	Sorry, I don't mean to pry. It just seems like you should be doing more than this.
1TO0003774	Penny, come on. Rory's a mungo. You've got to stick with your friends.
1TO0003775	Penny, come on. You can't save Rory. It's time to save yourself.
1TO0003776	We don't have time for this. We need to leave. Now!
1TO0003777	Okay, what do you want me to do?
1TO0003778	Fine, let's get Rory and get the hell out of here.
1TO0003779	I tried, but he didn't make it.
1TO0003780	I got him out, all right. Now it's your turn.
1TO0003781	Yes, he's safe. Now get moving!
1TO0003782	Um... sure. Maybe you'll see him sometime later. Not now, though. <Lie.>
1TO0003783	Come on, let's go. We need to get you out of here now.
1TO0003784	Why are you still in here? It's time to go.
1TO0003785	I came for the kids. Penny wanted you free, so here we are.
1TO0003786	I need you out of here now, so I can get Penny out.
1TO0003787	If you don't leave, Penny won't leave. She'll be killed. Is that what you want?
1TO0003788	We need to be careful. Stay low and stay quiet.
1TO0003789	You're on your own, pal. I've got more important things to do.
1TO0003790	We'll have to run for it.
1TO0003794	I'm here to set you free.
1TO0003795	No time to talk. We've got to move, right now.
1TO0003796	I'm the guy who's going to kill you if you don't get moving.
1TO0003797	I'm the girl who's going to kill you if you don't get moving.
1TO0003798	Penny asked me to get you out of here.
1TO0003799	There's no time for explanations. We've got to move!
1TO0003800	You want to get out of here, or you want to waste time asking questions?
1TO0003802	Get lost, kid.
1TO0003803	You're already out. Can't you just run home from here?
1TO0003804	Sure, what can I do to help, kid?
1TO0003805	Why is this my problem? In case you hadn't noticed, I've already got problems.
1TO0003806	I'll get you kids out of here.
1TO0003807	Let me think about it.
1TO0003808	Sorry kid. You're on your own.
1TO0003809	How can I get you out of here?
1TO0003810	Nope. Never heard of it.
1TO0003811	Yeah, I've heard of it.
1TO0003812	Mayor MacCready's the one who sent me to get you.
1TO0003813	Don't worry, I've got a plan.
1TO0003814	That's the best you can come up with? Don't you have any other ideas?
1TO0003815	No way. I can't take them all on.
1TO0003816	Sure, I'll go do that.
1TO0003817	Pipe down, short stuff. I'm trying to get you out of here.
1TO0003818	Just follow me out of the complex. Then we can talk.
1TO0003819	Do you want to get rescued or not?
1TO0003820	MacCready sent me. I'm here to rescue you.
1TO0003821	Don't make a big deal out of it. You'll blow our cover.
1TO0003822	Fine. Would you rather stay here with the Slavers?
1TO0003823	Keep quiet, will you? Let's get out of here, then we can talk.
1TO0003824	Look, I came from Little Lamplight.
1TO0003826	Why would I help you? What's in it for me?
1TO0003827	Let's just say Forty won't be bothering you or anyone else again.
1TO0003828	How am I supposed to get rid of the guards?
1TO0003829	No luck yet.
1TO0003830	Forget it. This is ridiculous.
1TO0003831	Okay, I'm on it.
1TO0003832	Pipe down, shorty. I'm going to take care of it.
1TO0003833	If she won't go, maybe it's time to leave her behind. You can't save everyone.
1TO0003834	Okay, great. What's next?
1TO0003835	"One step"? What the hell, kid.
1TO0003836	I'm getting tired of this.
1TO0003837	So what do I do?
1TO0003838	Why is this my problem?
1TO0003839	I'm with you so far. Keep going.
1TO0003840	Skip to the point, short stuff.
1TO0003841	Okay, tell me the whole plan. All of it.
1TO0003842	I just need to know what to do right now.
1TO0003843	I'm not that good with computers...
1TO0003844	Isn't there another way to get you out?
1TO0003845	Your plan is crazy. I'm not doing it.
1TO0003846	Okay, I'll see what I can do.
1TO0003847	All done. The terminal should work for you now.
1TO0003848	Yeah, it's working. Am I done now?
1TO0003849	Maybe... Why don't you go for a jog and see if your head explodes.
1TO0003850	Where's the terminal I need to use?
1TO0003854	Charon, you think you could retrieve the G.E.C.K. for me?
1TO0003855	Yes, I'm human. But what are you?
1TO0003856	Give me one good reason not to kill you.
1TO0003857	A friendly Super Mutant. Well, now I've seen everything.
1TO0003858	You're kind of weirding me out. I've got to go.
1TO0003859	It's amazing how well you can speak.
1TO0003860	That's quite an unusual name.
1TO0003861	Sorry, I have more important things to do.
1TO0003862	Yikes! I'd say whoever beat you with the ugly stick overdid it.
1TO0003863	Why have you been imprisoned?
1TO0003864	How come they've kept you alive?
1TO0003865	I wish I could stay and chat, but I need to find something important.
1TO0003866	If you've been here as long as I imagine maybe you can help me.
1TO0003867	This is a huge waste of time.
1TO0003868	How ironic that the others consider you a mutant of their kind.
1TO0003869	I am indeed, but I have no time to discuss these matters.
1TO0003870	What do you know about the G.E.C.K.?
1TO0003871	The G.E.C.K.? Never heard of it. <Lie.>
1TO0003872	Why would you help me?
1TO0003873	Good, tell me everything you know about it, then!
1TO0003874	How about you tell me all you know and I don't paint the wall with your brains?
1TO0003875	Why would I have difficulty getting the G.E.C.K.?
1TO0003876	I'm not worried. I can mow down whatever's in my way.
1TO0003877	How do I get you out?
1TO0003878	How do I know you won't run the second I get you out?
1TO0003879	Sorry, I have to get going. I don't have time for this.
1TO0003880	You obviously know all about the G.E.C.K., so let's help each other out.
1TO0003881	Okay, Fawkes. You've got a deal.
1TO0003882	I'm used to your kind being less cordial. My apologies.
1TO0003883	Very well. You were saying?
1TO0003884	You belong in that cage, you freak!
1TO0003886	You can't come with me?
1TO0003887	Where can I find the fire control console?
1TO0003888	Do you know what the G.E.C.K. does?
1TO0003889	Tell me how I can get you out of that room.
1TO0003890	Remind me how to get you out of that room.
1TO0003891	Goodbye Fawkes, and thanks!
1TO0003892	What do I do once I trip the fire control console?
1TO0003893	So, tell me more about yourself.
1TO0003894	So, you've been stuck in that cell ever since?
1TO0003895	How did you become so articulate?
1TO0003896	Do you remember who you were?
1TO0003897	How do you know the layout of this place?
1TO0003898	You have quite an unusual name.
1TO0003899	Let's continue on now.
1TO0003900	I have to get going.
1TO0003911	You've been helping them?!
1TO0003912	The door's open. Find your own way out.
1TO0003913	Get out of here while you can! They'll be here any second!
1TO0003914	Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
1TO0003916	How much did you tell them?
1TO0003917	Do you know how to get out of here?
1TO0003919	What have you told them?
1TO0003920	Why would you abandon everything you worked for with Doctor Li?
1TO0003921	What lab? Why were you in a lab?
1TO0003922	You've betrayed Doctor Li, and my father.
1TO0003924	I don't know what the code is.
1TO0003925	The code is 2-1-6.
1TO0003926	The code is 7-0-4.
1TO0003927	Let me out of here. Now!
1TO0003928	I'll tell you whatever you want. Please just don't hurt me.
1TO0003929	What the hell is going on here?
1TO0003930	This is some kind of mistake. You've got the wrong person.
1TO0003932	Fuck you. I'm not telling you anything.
1TO0003933	No, seriously. Fuck you.
1TO0003936	You killed my father, you son of a bitch!
1TO0003938	Okay, okay. Just don't hurt me.
1TO0003942	What code? What are you talking about?
1TO0003943	Why do you want this code so badly?
1TO0003944	We have nothing to talk about.
1TO0003947	What country? Look around. Everything is destroyed.
1TO0003948	Can you explain what you mean?
1TO0003949	All right, I'll do what I can to help.
1TO0003950	Hurry up and get to the point.
1TO0003951	Say whatever it is you have to say.
1TO0003952	Please, go on. I'm intrigued.
1TO0003953	I don't like the sound of this.
1TO0003954	My father's work? How is that relevant?
1TO0003955	I'll do whatever I have to if it means getting rid of mutants.
1TO0003956	That doesn't sound like something I'd know how to do.
1TO0003957	How exactly would I go about doing this?
1TO0003958	Sounds good. Tell me how to do it, and I'll get to work.
1TO0003959	No way. I'm not doing that.
1TO0003960	I'll give it some thought.
1TO0003961	I can do that for you, Mr. President.
1TO0003964	I'd like to ask you a few questions.
1TO0003965	I think you're delusional. I think the world would be better off without you.
1TO0003966	That's incredible. Who controls you?
1TO0003967	This is crazy. A computer is running the Enclave?
1TO0003968	I had no idea. This is fascinating.
1TO0003969	This explains why I've only heard your voice until now.
1TO0003970	I don't think this is funny.
1TO0003971	Cut the bullshit. He was my father!
1TO0003972	None of that excuses what happened to him.
1TO0003974	If we're meeting face to face, then show yourself. Don't hide behind a monitor.
1TO0003975	That's great, but can you make toast?
1TO0003977	It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. President.
1TO0003978	What the hell is going on here? What is this?
1TO0003980	Where are you? Show yourself!
1TO0003981	You'd better start making some sense.
1TO0003982	Healing? What are you talking about?
1TO0003984	So you control this whole place?
1TO0003985	How do I kill you?
1TO0003987	So what's your goal? What are you trying to accomplish?
1TO0003988	Let me out of here now!
1TO0003989	Hurry up and make your point. You're boring me.
1TO0003990	Well then, where are you? All I see is computers.
1TO0003991	Is this some kind of a joke?
1TO0003992	I don't understand. I can't see you.
1TO0003993	You're a computer! I should have guessed as much!
1TO0003995	I'm not listening to this. We have nothing to say to one another.
1TO0003997	Won't this kill pretty much everyone in the Wasteland?
1TO0003999	Let's talk about your plan for the purifier.
1TO0004000	What's in this vial of yours?
1TO0004001	That's circular logic. You know because you know? It makes no sense.
1TO0004002	But how do you know that what you're doing is right?
1TO0004003	And how do you know you're infallible?
1TO0004004	You were never elected President. You don't have the right to govern.
1TO0004005	Only a human can be President. Not some computer.
1TO0004006	You aren't programmed for self-awareness. You said so yourself.
1TO0004007	Why is it that you're the President, when you're not even human?
1TO0004008	Maybe you should have thought of that before you killed my father.
1TO0004009	What's any of this got to do with me?
1TO0004010	I'd like to talk to you about being the President.
1TO0004011	Can we talk about how I get out of here?
1TO0004012	Can you help me get out of this base?
1TO0004013	If you want me to help you, why are your soldiers attacking me?
1TO0004014	Shut yourself down. Shut down this whole place.
1TO0004015	I think it's time you put an end to this, once and for all.
1TO0004016	The code is "Priority Override, Authorization code 420-03-20-9"
1TO0004017	You're right. I was just kidding.
1TO0004018	But you're the President. Can't you just call them off?
1TO0004019	So you're not really in control of the Enclave, then.
1TO0004020	So you're just a bucket of bolts?
1TO0004021	You can't just decide to take over, and force everyone to follow you.
1TO0004022	You can't even control your own troops. You're clearly not fit for this.
1TO0004023	If you don't stop it now, where will it end? It's up to you to do what's right.
1TO0004024	Can you tell me more about yourself?
1TO0004025	What... what are you?
1TO0004026	Very well. What can I do for you, Mr. President?
1TO0004027	Country? What country? Take a look outside. The world is destroyed.
1TO0004028	Where did this plan of yours come from?
1TO0004029	Where's your body?
1TO0004030	Why do you want my help? Why not have Colonel Autumn help you?
1TO0004031	You're a machine?
1TO0004037	I don't have the G.E.C.K. anymore.
1TO0004038	The Enclave doesn't have the activation code. They can't start the purifier.
1TO0004039	The Enclave is fractured. They're not as unified as they'd like us to believe.
1TO0004040	The Enclave took the G.E.C.K. They're installing it now.
1TO0004041	I escaped from Raven Rock.
1TO0004042	I was captured by the Enclave.
1TO0004043	There's no time. We have to move now or we'll lose Project Purity.
1TO0004044	Well, sort of. I found the G.E.C.K.
1TO0004045	Well, it's not quite that simple...
1TO0004046	He wants me to add this virus to the purifier. I think you should take it.
1TO0004047	The President let me go.
1TO0004048	Eden wanted me to sabotage the project with some kind of virus.
1TO0004049	I don't have it anymore. <Lie.>
1TO0004050	I have it here. Take it.
1TO0004051	500 caps says you never saw me. Understand?
1TO0004052	Sure. You stay here while I get the caps. I'll be right back.
1TO0004053	On second thought, you're not worth the caps.
1TO0004054	Look, here are the caps. Let's just pretend we never saw each other.
1TO0004055	I'm on my way up to see the President. How about I put in a good word for you?
1TO0004057	Well then, I guess I'll just have to kill you.
1TO0004058	Okay, I'm just going to slowly walk away now...
1TO0004059	Whoa, whoa. Let's calm down. I'm supposed to be here.
1TO0004060	10 caps says I can kill you before the guards get here.
1TO0004062	Your boss. So you'd better let me past before you get in trouble.
1TO0004063	The President wants to speak to me in his office.
1TO0004064	Take a hike, before you get squashed.
1TO0004069	Don't you see? You've been used. You're a pawn. You deserve better.
1TO0004070	Look, I don't want to fight you.
1TO0004071	But you know he has. He sent me to do a job that you wouldn't.
1TO0004072	You know I'm telling the truth. Eden, the Enclave... Both have betrayed you.
1TO0004073	If you're in charge, then you can stop the plans of some mad machine.
1TO0004074	Give it up, Autumn. You've lost.
1TO0004075	Your "government" is a joke, Autumn.
1TO0004076	My point is that your government isn't legitimate. You have no right to rule.
1TO0004077	He's not human. He assumed control... it was never given to him.
1TO0004078	Eden's not the President. He was never elected! Hell, he's not even human...
1TO0004079	I'm going to enjoy killing you.
1TO0004080	You know what? Screw this. You're going down.
1TO0004081	Why are you doing this? Why give your allegiance to a machine?
1TO0004082	This isn't the way to do it. More fighting will just make things worse.
1TO0004083	Eden betrayed you. You see this vial? He trusts me more than he trusts you.
1TO0004084	Raven Rock is gone. Eden checked out. You've got nothing left.
1TO0004085	Just walk away. It's not too late.
1TO0004096	I don't need your armor. I've gotten this far without it.
1TO0004097	I'll take the Recon Armor.
1TO0004098	I'll take the Power Armor.
1TO0004099	I changed my mind. I'll do it. I'll put in the code.
1TO0004100	I just wanted to say thanks, and good luck.
1TO0004103	Just kidding! The code is 2-1-6.
1TO0004104	The hell with this. This is crazy!
1TO0004105	I'll do it. I'll start the purifier.
1TO0004106	I said I'd do it, didn't I? I'll take care of it.
1TO0004107	I changed my mind. I'll put the code in.
1TO0004108	You know what? I'm not telling you.
1TO0004109	Fine. Let's all burn in Hell, then.
1TO0004110	I'm not telling you the fucking code.
1TO0004111	There must be some other way...
1TO0004112	Ha! No way am I going in there. You do it.
1TO0004113	Look... I don't think I can do this. You should put the code in.
1TO0004116	I sure hope so.
1TO0004117	I don't know, Sarah. I'm not so sure about this.
1TO0004118	Of course I can.
1TO0004120	Funny, I don't recall asking to be part of your little club.
1TO0004122	I've had enough "problems" for one day, thanks.
1TO0004123	You've got to be kidding me. What now?
1TO0004124	What kind of problem?
1TO0004125	I guess I know everything I need to.
1TO0004126	Can I go with you and the rest of Lyon's Pride?
1TO0004127	Should I go with the robot?
1TO0004128	Why are you taking the tunnel?
1TO0004129	I think I need another minute or two.
1TO0004130	I have a few questions...
1TO0004131	I'm all ready.
1TO0004132	I'll keep an eye on the robot.
1TO0004133	I'll follow you and the Pride.
1TO0004136	Here. Take back the money. I don't want to take medicine away from the town.
1TO0004137	All right, let's go to Big Town.
1TO0004139	I'm glad you're safe and sound. And please, I don't want any kind of reward.
1TO0004140	I mean you no harm. I'm a simple traveler.
1TO0004141	Where the grownups live?
1TO0004143	You are planning on giving me a reward for rescuing you, right?
1TO0004144	I'm Queen of the Wasteland. What does it matter? You going to let me in or not?
1TO0004145	I'm King of the Wasteland. What does it matter? You going to let me in or not?
1TO0004146	Looks to me like you want someone to escort you to Big Town.
1TO0004148	I'm escorting Sticky from Little Lamplight.
1TO0004149	I want to visit Little Lamplight first. Maybe later.
1TO0004150	I ran into a friend of yours in Germantown.
1TO0004151	I was the one who rescued your friend from the Super Mutants.
1TO0004152	I ran into some friends of yours in Germantown.
1TO0004154	I saved your life. This is all I get? Surely you can spare a little more.
1TO0004155	Is there anyone else?
1TO0004157	I just want to look around a little. Don't worry about me. I won't hurt you.
1TO0004158	Fine. I'll take you to Big Town. But first I need to visit Little Lamplight.
1TO0004160	It was my pleasure!
1TO0004161	Enough chit-chat. It's time to get out of here.
1TO0004163	Oh, I don't know. I was thinking I'd start a few fires and kill some people.
1TO0004164	You got any caps? I'll escort you Big Town, but it'll cost you.
1TO0004166	Don't thank me. I got what I wanted out of it.
1TO0004167	Do you harass all of your visitors like this?
1TO0004168	You're on your own. I'm not interested in babysitting duty.
1TO0004170	You wait right here, I'll go see about Shorty.
1TO0004172	We shouldn't risk our lives for someone who's probably already dead.
1TO0004174	Let's go get Shorty. Come with me.
1TO0004176	I rescued Red. She's alive, at least. The others... not so much.
1TO0004177	I rescued Shorty. Red didn't make it.
1TO0004178	Your friends are dead. Deal with it.
1TO0004179	I tried to rescue your friends but there were... complications.
1TO0004180	I'm not going to do it. You'll need to find another hero.
1TO0004185	Settle down now. It'll be okay. Do you know where they took them?
1TO0004186	Do you know where these Super Mutants took their victims?
1TO0004187	Don't lose hope. Do you know where the Super Mutants are located?
1TO0004188	Wow, you need therapy. Look, do you know where your friends are?
1TO0004190	Yep. Growing up sucks. Now... do you actually know anything useful?
1TO0004191	Yeah, I get it. You're a real soldier. So you got any intel on the enemy?
1TO0004192	If you don't care about your friends, then I guess I won't rescue them.
1TO0004193	Hey, Earth to gloom girl -- Do you know where the Mutants took the villagers?
1TO0004195	Your friends will have to rescue themselves. I'm not going to.
1TO0004196	Your friends are as good as dead. Forget about them.
1TO0004197	No, I'm not going to rescue your friends.
1TO0004198	Your friends are dead. Maybe you can channel them from the afterlife? Freak.
1TO0004199	I'll think about it, but I can't rescue your friends now.
1TO0004201	Don't worry. If they're alive, I'll find them and rescue them.
1TO0004202	You stay here and hold off any more Mutants. I'll go rescue your friends.
1TO0004203	Quit moping around. I'll rescue your friends!
1TO0004204	I'll rescue your friends just to see the smile on your face when they return!
1TO0004206	I'll consider rescuing them. I'm assuming there's some kind of reward?
1TO0004207	I don't make promises. And I don't risk my life for free.
1TO0004208	I got what it takes to rescue your friends, but it's going to cost you.
1TO0004209	I'll rescue your friends, but its going to cost you.
1TO0004210	How did you end up here?
1TO0004211	So what's with all the Super Mutants?
1TO0004213	You're lucky I happened along.
1TO0004214	I'm glad you're alive.
1TO0004216	I'm glad you're safe. There's a guy name Sticky that wants to see you.
1TO0004217	I'm glad you're safe. There's a guy named Sticky that wants to see you.
1TO0004219	"Thanks"? That's all I get for risking my life to save you? How about some caps?
1TO0004221	Shorty's dead.
1TO0004222	Red's dead.
1TO0004223	Come on. Follow me.
1TO0004224	You and Shorty, follow me.
1TO0004225	You and Red, follow me.
1TO0004226	Looks like you could use a weapon.
1TO0004227	You're going to need a weapon if you want to live to see Big Town.
1TO0004229	You wait here. I'll be right back.
1TO0004231	Hold on, short stuff. Who are you and what are you doing here?
1TO0004232	What makes you think I'm here to rescue you?
1TO0004233	Sorry, I'm not here to rescue you. In fact, I've got to get going.
1TO0004234	Okay, I'll help you.
1TO0004237	Come on, let's get out of here.
1TO0004238	Red's fine. Let's go!
1TO0004240	Shut up, you!
1TO0004241	Just quit talking.
1TO0004242	Shut it!
1TO0004243	Zip it!
1TO0004244	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
1TO0004245	I'm not playing this game.
1TO0004258	I can help you defend yourselves.
1TO0004259	If you can arm yourselves, I can teach you how to shoot.
1TO0004260	I'll stick around to kill the Super Mutants. They should leave you alone after that.
1TO0004261	I'll teach you how to sneak and hide. They'll think you've deserted the town.
1TO0004262	You could set up a minefield to keep Super Mutants from just strolling in.
1TO0004263	Law of the Wasteland: Survival of the fittest. You're on your own. Good luck!
1TO0004264	You should have some robot defenders. I can show you what to do with them.
1TO0004265	I can help you defend against the Super Mutants, but it will cost you.
1TO0004266	That's enough about them.
1TO0004268	I read that the AntAgonizer was an orphaned girl who could still be redeemed.
1TO0004270	From what I read, Grognak totally kicked her ass!
1TO0004273	What do you know about the AntAgonizer?
1TO0004277	What do you know about the Mechanist?
1TO0004284	What was all that about? Who were those people?
1TO0004285	You seem to be pretty calm, considering there was just war in your streets.
1TO0004286	I'm just passing through. Don't bug me with your problems.
1TO0004288	Yeah, I saw it. What can you tell me about them?
1TO0004289	I might be able to help.
1TO0004291	This is serious business. You could get hurt. What do you know about them?
1TO0004292	How much would a solution be worth to you?
1TO0004294	Are those jokers for real? What's up with the silly costumes?
1TO0004295	I don't give a damn. I'm interested in finding supplies.
1TO0004297	Life around here is pretty hard, huh?
1TO0004298	Double that, and you've got yourself a deal.
1TO0004300	Those guys must really liven the place up, huh? Anyone ever get hurt?
1TO0004303	You're insane, kid.
1TO0004304	Maybe later. I've got things to attend to.
1TO0004311	Now that I have your suit, I'd say you don't have a chance at all. Time to die.
1TO0004312	Wait! I'm not a secret agent! I'm here to help!
1TO0004315	Certainly. Good luck in your new life.
1TO0004316	You really have lost your mind, haven't you?
1TO0004320	Don't waste your time with this suit. It isn't worthy of your attention.
1TO0004321	You don't need to worry about this suit. There are other threats out there.
1TO0004323	If you want the suit, you'll have to take it from me.
1TO0004325	My apologies, Ant Queen. Please, continue.
1TO0004326	My mistake. Never mind.
1TO0004327	Wait. First, let's talk about what you've been doing.
1TO0004331	Why do you want the suit?
1TO0004332	Here, you can have it. Just move on and leave Canterbury alone.
1TO0004340	I've had enough of you and your silly costume. Get ready to die.
1TO0004341	Your ants are a joke. Time to die, crazy lady!
1TO0004343	I'm just here to talk. We can find a peaceful way to stop this fighting.
1TO0004344	Your days of terrorizing the town are over. Give up and you won't get hurt.
1TO0004346	I've come to help you get rid of the AntAgonizer.
1TO0004348	Relax. I'm here to help you get rid of that Mechanist character.
1TO0004350	You just want to keep fighting the AntAgonizer. You're as bad as she is.
1TO0004351	You do realize you're not really an ant... right?
1TO0004353	Let's go put an end to the AntAgonizer once and for all!
1TO0004354	I swear, we will destroy the Mechanist and his pitiful toys!
1TO0004356	There's bound to be a peaceful solution. I'll try to convince her to give up.
1TO0004357	There's bound to be a peaceful solution. I'll try to convince him to give up.
1TO0004359	Whatever. I just want her dead so I can get paid.
1TO0004360	I don't give a damn about your court. I just want the Mechanist dead.
1TO0004362	Well, I've got the food. But no luck with the medicine.
1TO0004363	It wasn't easy, but I got the food and the medicine.
1TO0004364	There was a Raider camp in the store. And a robot at the pharmacy.
1TO0004365	I've been bit too busy for that.
1TO0004367	What do you know about Minefield?
1TO0004369	No need to test that theory. I've already found food and medicine there.
1TO0004370	No need to test that theory. I've only found food there.
1TO0004372	I'm already incredibly irradiated. Can't you tell?
1TO0004373	I'm already a bit irradiated. Check for yourself.
1TO0004375	No need to bother testing this. I've already been to Minefield.
1TO0004376	Do you have any more of those Mirelurk bait grenades?
1TO0004378	Why get myself hurt? I'm a good enough doctor to explain this part for you.
1TO0004380	Sure. Do it.
1TO0004381	Nah. Maybe later.
1TO0004382	Hold on. I need to know more before I agree to anything.
1TO0004383	Wait. How? I mean, how many people even read anymore?
1TO0004385	Pay? What sort of pay? And what sort of work?
1TO0004386	Pay? You just said the magic word. Name the target.
1TO0004388	It's tempting, but I'll have to pass.
1TO0004389	Doesn't sound like my style. I'm out.
1TO0004391	Sounds good. Tell me more.
1TO0004392	Not interested. I'm just here to do some shopping.
1TO0004393	I'm here to do research on the city's history.
1TO0004395	Can you help me access the library's archives?
1TO0004397	The bomb in town just blew up! You're lucky to be alive!
1TO0004398	The bomb in town just blew up. You're lucky to be alive!
1TO0004399	I have no idea. I wasn't even here. <Lie.>
1TO0004400	I blew up your town. Maybe you shouldn't have built it around a bomb.
1TO0004402	How odd. It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
1TO0004404	I'm pretty sure you weren't always a Ghoul. Right?
1TO0004406	Moira, don't take this the wrong way, but you got ugly real fast.
1TO0004409	There's an entire Ghoul community in Underworld, downtown.
1TO0004410	You'll just have to fit in with some other community. Good luck.
1TO0004412	Seems to me like that isn't my problem, stickyface.
1TO0004414	It was a job. Sorry, nothing personal.
1TO0004416	Who needs a reason? Explosions are pretty.
1TO0004418	I was trying to shut you up for good. Now I'll have to finish the job.
1TO0004419	Moira? Is that you? You don't look so good.
1TO0004421	I need you to repair my equipment.
1TO0004423	I've been thinking about your experiments. Can I ask you something personal?
1TO0004424	I've been thinking about the guide. Can I ask you something?
1TO0004425	Can I ask you about your work and how my research fits into it?
1TO0004429	That'll do.
1TO0004432	Let me guess. You need me to go print and distribute it, right?
1TO0004433	Sounds like a great idea! I can't wait to help!
1TO0004434	Okay, I guess I'll help with this "Survival Guide."
1TO0004435	I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. Sorry.
1TO0004436	Hell no, crazy girl. I won't be your lab rat.
1TO0004438	It was hardly any work at all. How's it look?
1TO0004439	Thanks, I'm pretty proud of it. So how's the final product?
1TO0004440	It certainly was an epic piece of work. So, is the final product worth it?
1TO0004442	I'm just glad I can stop getting stabbed, irradiated, and shot for your science.
1TO0004443	I went through a lot of pain for that. It had better be worth it.
1TO0004444	I should hope so. I nearly killed myself a half dozen times for that thing.
1TO0004445	Tell me more about the pay.
1TO0004446	I've got plenty of my own problems to worry about.
1TO0004448	Fear not! With my vast scientific knowledge, I explain this one myself.
1TO0004449	I suppose nothing beats a real-world example. I'll get myself irradiated.
1TO0004451	That makes sense. And it explains why you're on the Council.
1TO0004452	Could you at least tell me what you've heard?
1TO0004453	Well, can't you tell me anything about it?
1TO0004454	Well, what can you tell me about the reconstruction?
1TO0004455	Please, it's very important. It's for a book about the Wasteland.
1TO0004457	Hasn't Rivet City been around for longer than twelve years?
1TO0004461	Well, is there anyone who knows more?
1TO0004463	I bet someone like you hears lots of stories. Can't you share one?
1TO0004466	Can you think of anyone from back then that might know more?
1TO0004467	But you've been here for so long. You must know something...
1TO0004469	Really? Because Bannon said he organized the entire place himself.
1TO0004471	Vera spoke very highly of you. She says you know all about this place.
1TO0004472	I hear you're the only one who knows the truth about Rivet City's founding.
1TO0004475	Setting the record straight is exactly my goal.
1TO0004476	Enough about Rivet City.
1TO0004477	You were on the City Council? That's hard to believe.
1TO0004478	So, you used to be in charge? How did you end up here?
1TO0004479	If that's so, why are you stuck down here?
1TO0004480	Do you have any hard evidence of all this?
1TO0004481	I can't imagine why she'd be more popular. Even assuming this is all true.
1TO0004482	What do you know about Project Purity?
1TO0004483	Okay, I can tell how much it means to you. Let's get this book finished.
1TO0004484	Yes, I really do.
1TO0004485	No. It's a terrible idea. Don't even try.
1TO0004486	Well, it's a big undertaking, and we've got to make sure we do it right.
1TO0004487	What do you mean about your other projects? Have there been problems?
1TO0004488	I think you're right. Now, let's get back to work on this book!
1TO0004489	Okay, but it could be bad if the book's misleading. People could get hurt.
1TO0004490	Moira, please don't write the book. It will just turn out badly.
1TO0004491	This really isn't a good idea. Please don't write it. It'll just turn out badly.
1TO0004492	It's really good of you to try to help people like this.
1TO0004493	It sounds like you don't know what you're doing.
1TO0004494	Well, I'm proud to be a part of it. You can count on me!
1TO0004495	I don't know. Those caravans help a lot of people.
1TO0004496	Seriously, don't waste time with this book. Stick to helping the caravans.
1TO0004498	I don't understand. Crazy experiments are what keep you going?
1TO0004499	But why do you waste your talents on this garbage?
1TO0004500	So you're trying to make the world better than it was?
1TO0004501	I don't know. Human nature doesn't change like that.
1TO0004502	But why try with this book, when you could be helping out in real ways here?
1TO0004503	You don't have the experience for a book like this. You'll be a laughingstock.
1TO0004504	It will just get us hurt. You don't want to hurt anyone, do you?
1TO0004507	What's Rivet City?
1TO0004509	I could just write that section for you. Trust me -- I'm an expert.
1TO0004511	I guess I can check the Super-Duper Mart again.
1TO0004512	Okay, I'll check the Super-Duper Mart.
1TO0004513	I'll test out the Repellent for you.
1TO0004514	Sounds reasonable. I'll research Rivet City's history.
1TO0004517	Okay, I'll get irradiated. Just be ready to fix me up when I get back.
1TO0004518	All right, I'll try.
1TO0004519	Just go in and connect the widget to the mainframe? I can do that.
1TO0004521	Nothing beats a real-world example, they say. I'll get myself injured.
1TO0004522	I guess I'll get hurt eventually. Might as well come here when I do.
1TO0004523	I suppose, for the sake of proper research, I can go back into Minefield.
1TO0004524	I'll head into Minefield. Wish me luck.
1TO0004525	Okay, I'll check out my local library.
1TO0004527	I don't think I want to do that one.
1TO0004529	I'm taking a break from the research.
1TO0004532	I don't feel well. I think I've got a bit of radiation sickness.
1TO0004533	I went in and got back, no problems.
1TO0004534	I went in there and a sniper started shooting at me!
1TO0004535	I tested the Repellent on a few Mole Rats.
1TO0004536	I set the observer, but I don't think they'll forget my visit anytime soon.
1TO0004537	You'd better be a good doctor.
1TO0004538	I asked a couple people about Rivet City's history, but it may not be reliable.
1TO0004539	I was able to get the robots online again, but I couldn't control them.
1TO0004540	I found the library and checked the catalogue, but that's all I could get.
1TO0004542	It's got a lot more food than most places, but I wasn't the only one there.
1TO0004543	Itchiness, sores, and so forth. Not the worst I've had, but still not fun.
1TO0004544	No, but it was a close call. Moving slow and staying off the dirt helped.
1TO0004545	I don't think it works like you hoped. The Mole Rats all died.
1TO0004546	They're pretty much crab-based humanoids.
1TO0004547	It feels like a dozen Super Mutants did a dance on my spine in steel boots.
1TO0004548	According to them, it was all set up by one upper deck resident.
1TO0004549	It was easy enough to attach the unit. The mainframe took care of the rest.
1TO0004550	Yeah, it's still there. The Brotherhood's even trying to clear out the place.
1TO0004552	I encountered some Raiders, but they were easily outsmarted.
1TO0004553	The headaches certainly make it hard to focus properly.
1TO0004554	Technically, it's the landmines that blow up, not me. And no, I didn't.
1TO0004555	You added too much chemical stimulant. The result was rather explosive.
1TO0004556	Their lairs are partially aquatic, so the radiation must not bother them.
1TO0004557	Acute physical trauma and severe lacerations. It's hardly pleasant.
1TO0004558	There's simply too many stories, and not enough evidence to support any of them.
1TO0004559	Installation was much easier than reaching the mainframe in the first place.
1TO0004560	The building is there, but the books are all ruined.
1TO0004562	I got the food and dealt with those pansy Raiders. They couldn't stop me.
1TO0004563	I can barely feel it. Radiation sickness is for the weak.
1TO0004564	I get blown up a lot. I get better. You got to be hard.
1TO0004565	Those dumb Mole Rats just blew up! You should have seen the guts!
1TO0004566	Between shells and scales, they're pretty tough. But not tough enough.
1TO0004567	What, these little scratches? Hardly the worst scrape I've been in.
1TO0004568	Those tough upper deck folk built the whole place from the ground up!
1TO0004569	The unit went in the computer. Then the robots woke up. Pretty straightforward.
1TO0004570	Most of the books would make better burning than reading.
1TO0004571	Basic Sly Response
1TO0004572	Those big, shadowy stores can be great for hiding out.
1TO0004573	I like to think of it as adding to my glowing personality.
1TO0004574	I've got the grace of a cat. No landmine's going to stop me.
1TO0004575	Well, at least it's non-lethal for people. For Mole Rats... not so much.
1TO0004576	They're savages with big claws and absolutely no interest in small talk.
1TO0004577	Pardon me if I bleed profusely while thinking how best to describe this pain.
1TO0004578	None of them agree on a story. So let's just say I set the whole place up.
1TO0004579	Make the right connection, and robots do what you want. Just like people.
1TO0004580	Oh, it's still there, but it's full of Raiders. The place is a death trap.
1TO0004582	That place was a death trap. It was crawling with Raiders.
1TO0004583	Why don't you drink a tall glass of wastewater and find out for yourself?
1TO0004584	Yes, I blew up and died. Now I'm haunting you because of that stupid book. Boo.
1TO0004585	It repelled their limbs from their body. Can you make one that works on people?
1TO0004586	What's to say? They're crabs. They're delicious and nutritious.
1TO0004587	On a scale of one to ten, I'd say it's a "shut the fuck up and fix me."
1TO0004588	I guess I heard one story that was plausible enough. Let's go with it...
1TO0004589	I didn't even need that tele-thingy unit. I was just that good. <Lie.>
1TO0004590	I may have been able to recover more, but it said to be quiet, so screw that.
1TO0004593	I'm about as irradiated as I can get without burning a hole in the floor.
1TO0004594	I got through Minefield alive, and I even brought you a present.
1TO0004595	I tested the Mole Rat repellent extensively.
1TO0004596	I slipped the observer in with the eggs, and they're none the wiser.
1TO0004597	This really hurts, you know.
1TO0004598	After a lot of searching, I've got the real history of Rivet City.
1TO0004599	I reactivated the robots and was able to modify their programming.
1TO0004600	The library's still standing, and I've got the archives right here.
1TO0004602	I found Raiders and a robot. It was hardly a safe place to scavenge.
1TO0004603	Just do your examination and fix me up, please.
1TO0004604	That whole place is a deathtrap.
1TO0004605	That whole town is a trap. There was a sniper out there, just waiting for me.
1TO0004606	Sorry, Moira, but your "Repellent" is fatal to Mole Rats.
1TO0004607	They're definitely vicious and highly territorial.
1TO0004608	The adrenaline helps. So does the fear of death. There's a lot of both.
1TO0004609	It began as a successful science station, and traders settled in around it.
1TO0004610	Once I adjusted their programming, the robots were no problem.
1TO0004611	The archive was probably the most useful information in there.
1TO0004613	The Raiders were using the pharmacy as a place to store their best gear.
1TO0004614	If I listen closely, I can hear my genes crying.
1TO0004615	Watch the details and look for broken patterns. That's where the traps are.
1TO0004616	It appears that Mole Rats have a most fatal allergy to it. Explosively so.
1TO0004617	They descended from local crabs. I'd call them "Scylla Serrata Horrendus."
1TO0004618	Pain's an abstract. I stay focused on the definable things, like survival.
1TO0004619	It began as a research station, which is why it's still a scientific haven.
1TO0004620	Even after reprogramming, the robots were of questionable value as allies.
1TO0004621	This is an entire library's archives. You know how valuable that is, right?
1TO0004623	Those Raiders must've shot me twenty times. But who's counting?
1TO0004624	Well, it itches a little, but I can walk it off.
1TO0004625	There may have been an explosion or two. Oh, and a sniper. No big deal.
1TO0004626	It gives them quite a kick, like too much Jet or something.
1TO0004627	They don't seem to fight each other. So no struggle for leadership.
1TO0004628	I hardly even feel pain anymore, honestly.
1TO0004629	They cleared out the Mirelurks. Then science folks and the rest moved in.
1TO0004630	I just hacked the mainframe so the robots would be a challenge.
1TO0004631	Now you can protect and catalogue all of the information it once had.
1TO0004632	Bonus Sly Response
1TO0004633	It's very hard to talk my way past that many people shooting at me...
1TO0004634	Oh, I feel fine! <cough> Never better! <cough> No problem at all! <wheeze>
1TO0004635	Fast hands and faster wits can get you an awful lot. Including landmines.
1TO0004636	I don't believe this is as non-lethal as you had expected. To put it lightly.
1TO0004637	They seem mostly independent. I don't think there's any sort of "society" there.
1TO0004638	Despite my glossary of expletives, nothing properly sums up this pain.
1TO0004639	It had success as a science station, and people flock to success.
1TO0004640	Like a charm. I only wish it were always that easy to manipulate people.
1TO0004641	The place was a death trap. But I got in and out as quick as I could.
1TO0004643	I had a fun party with some Raiders. Then a guard robot jumped out of a cake.
1TO0004644	I feel about as bad as you look.
1TO0004645	Too... tired... to be... snide.
1TO0004646	Oh, disarming it's real easy. Just jump up and down on it. You go first.
1TO0004647	It's like explosive whack-a-Mole Rat. Can I get it in bullet form? For people?
1TO0004648	They've got a little, bubbling castle and they spend all day circling it. <Lie>
1TO0004649	My only solace is thinking about inflicting this pain on people like you.
1TO0004650	Some old coot says he took these notes. They seem reasonable enough.
1TO0004651	It was robotic carnage. But I caused it, so it was the okay sort of carnage.
1TO0004652	The librarian's on duty. I'd have brought you a present, but I forgot my card.
1TO0004654	Getting food doesn't sound so bad. What are you looking for?
1TO0004655	Tell me more about repelling the Mole Rats.
1TO0004656	Researching local history sounds easy.
1TO0004658	What's this about radiation?
1TO0004660	What's this about studying Mirelurks?
1TO0004661	Old technology is no challenge for... The Mechanist!
1TO0004662	Using old technology sounds interesting.
1TO0004664	Let's hear more about the landmines.
1TO0004666	I'm going to hate myself for this, but what do you mean about handling injury?
1TO0004667	I could check the library. Maybe someone's already written a book like yours.
1TO0004670	I haven't gotten around to it, yet.
1TO0004671	I'm not really comfortable with getting irradiated.
1TO0004672	I haven't been to Minefield yet. Hold on.
1TO0004673	I just haven't found enough Mole Rats.
1TO0004674	I find this whole "Mirelurk intelligence" thing a bit hard to swallow.
1TO0004675	You seriously want me to go out and hurt myself for your book?
1TO0004676	I can't get a straight answer out of those folks.
1TO0004677	I haven't been over to the RobCo facility, yet.
1TO0004678	Is it really worth risking my life over a bunch of books?
1TO0004680	I'll do it when I get around to it, all right?
1TO0004681	You realize how ridiculous this request is, right?
1TO0004682	I don't think walking around in a minefield is a very good idea.
1TO0004683	I'm not so sure about testing this stuff.
1TO0004684	Why do we care if they're intelligent? They still try to kill me.
1TO0004685	Why not study injuries on yourself? If it'd help, I could shoot you in the gut.
1TO0004686	History is for losers. I'll do it later.
1TO0004687	Robots aren't really my style. I'll do it later.
1TO0004688	What if the building was destroyed and I can't even find its remains?
1TO0004692	Actually, I'll have to wait a bit.
1TO0004694	What's the pay?
1TO0004695	I don't know if handling weird chemicals is safe. What's it worth to you?
1TO0004696	What's the value of digging up history?
1TO0004698	You want me to get irradiated? How could that possibly be worth it for me?
1TO0004699	Sneaking into a Mirelurk lair? The pay had better be worth it.
1TO0004700	What's it worth to you?
1TO0004702	That seems kind of... unhealthy. How will you make it worth my while?
1TO0004703	What could possibly be worth breaking my bones over?
1TO0004704	What do I get for going to the library?
1TO0004707	Sure, I've got plenty to say about life in the Vault.
1TO0004710	Where'd you get the Vault Suit back there?
1TO0004712	It was paradise down there. No fear, no worries, no fighting... Until Dad left.
1TO0004715	This "Outside" place is amazing. In the main room, I can't even see the ceiling!
1TO0004718	I was sent as an ambassador from the utopia of Vault 101. Bow before my glory!
1TO0004721	How do you people live out here? I haven't found a food dispenser anywhere!
1TO0004724	It was cramped, dark, and the food sucked. Good riddance.
1TO0004727	No, I don't want anything to do with them anymore.
1TO0004730	I'm searching for records from the library.
1TO0004731	100 caps? This kid will make you ten times that. 300, and you've got a deal.
1TO0004732	Make that 200 caps and you have yourself a deal.
1TO0004733	Fine. You've got a deal.
1TO0004734	Nah. Screw it. I'll go elsewhere.
1TO0004735	I found an orphaned kid looking for a home. Would you take him in?
1TO0004736	Vera, your nephew Bryan lost his folks and needs a place to live.
1TO0004737	I got a young boy for sale. Interested?
1TO0004738	Actually, I give up. I can't find anywhere that will take you in.
1TO0004739	I found a place with lots of kids your age. I'll tell you how to get there.
1TO0004740	Sure did. It's a beautiful place called Paradise Falls. Here, put this on.
1TO0004741	It's a Paradise Welcome Necklace. It'll help you find your way, you lucky devil!
1TO0004742	Something to remember me by. It'll lead you home.
1TO0004743	It's a slave collar, I sold your dumb ass for caps.
1TO0004744	I sure did, Bryan. Vera said she'd take you in!
1TO0004745	Look, this kid's just like you. On his own, no parents... Give him a chance!
1TO0004746	Look, this kid needs to be with people his own age. Give him a chance.
1TO0004747	All right. How many caps is it going to take to change your mind?
1TO0004749	For God's sake... Stop acting like an asshole and let the kid in!
1TO0004750	Let me think on it for a while.
1TO0004751	I think Bryan will love his new home. I'll send him along shortly.
1TO0004753	Those what? What's the matter?
1TO0004754	Calm down, kid.
1TO0004755	What the heck is your problem?
1TO0004756	Hey, hey. Calm down. It's going to be okay. I promise.
1TO0004757	Hey, kid. It's okay. I'm a big, tough guy. I can take care of you!
1TO0004758	Hey, kid. It's okay. I'm a big, tough lady. I can take care of you!
1TO0004759	Look, kid. There's no such thing as monsters.
1TO0004760	Unless you tell me what the problem is I can't help you.
1TO0004761	Okay kid. I'm going to say it once. Stop your whining!
1TO0004762	Is that a warning, or a threat?
1TO0004763	All right, I'm sorry. Calm down and tell me what's going on.
1TO0004764	I'd like to help, but I need to know more first.
1TO0004765	Sorry, kid. Help costs caps, and you look pretty broke to me.
1TO0004766	I don't know... you look like a tasty snack for a monster.
1TO0004767	Don't be like that. I'm sorry for being mean.
1TO0004768	Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
1TO0004769	What's it going to take for you to forgive me?
1TO0004770	Forget it, I don't care. I'm out of here.
1TO0004771	<Sigh.> Okay. I'm sorry.
1TO0004772	I'm sorry! There, that's three.
1TO0004774	Okay. "I'm sorry three times!" Ha! That's exactly what you said to say!
1TO0004775	Bryan, I'm sorry, but your father is dead.
1TO0004776	Your father's dead.
1TO0004777	Sorry, kid. Your old man is ant food.
1TO0004778	Fine, I'll take care of everything.
1TO0004779	I'll stop whatever started this, I promise you.
1TO0004780	My part in this is all done. Sorry, kid.
1TO0004781	People die all the time out here. Get used to it.
1TO0004782	Why don't you just forget about it and clear on out of here?
1TO0004783	If you're talking about the Fire Ants, I'm already working on it.
1TO0004785	I got my own problems right now, kid.
1TO0004786	Hey, are you okay? You shouldn't be alone in a place like this.
1TO0004787	Calm down, calm down. Just who the heck are you?
1TO0004788	That's wonderful, kid. Now scram.
1TO0004789	I'm just glad you're safe.
1TO0004790	Yep, it was all me.
1TO0004791	All the ants are dead so I'm done here. Go home.
1TO0004792	Don't worry, Bryan... I think I know how to take care of these ants.
1TO0004793	I know where the Ant Queen lives.
1TO0004794	Haven't found a thing. (Lie)
1TO0004795	Can we skip the story and get to a solution?
1TO0004796	What the hell are you doing down here?
1TO0004797	Hey! You're that egghe... I mean scientist the kid was talking about.
1TO0004798	Sorry, I didn't expect to bump into anyone alive down here.
1TO0004799	Creep up on YOU? I just crapped my pants for crying out loud!
1TO0004800	Experiments? What do you mean?
1TO0004801	You call this a laboratory?
1TO0004802	How about we start the experiment by decorating that wall with your brains?
1TO0004803	Oh, I see. You're trying to make them smaller over time by injecting the eggs.
1TO0004804	Okay, now how about explaining that for the slower people?
1TO0004805	Okay, okay. Enough with the mumbo jumbo.
1TO0004806	Slow down, professor... Once more in English, okay?
1TO0004807	So, what's gone wrong?
1TO0004808	Are you aware your new ants breathe fire?!
1TO0004809	I've got news for you, brainiac. It ain't working.
1TO0004810	So all that needs to be done is eliminate the remaining Ants?
1TO0004811	An error? People have died, Lesko!
1TO0004812	I'm shocked you didn't attempt this in a controlled environment first.
1TO0004813	Ha! You call yourself a scientist? That's rich.
1TO0004814	I'm sorry Doctor Lesko, but I think you're a crackpot.
1TO0004815	I may be able to help, but it will cost you.
1TO0004816	It was for the greater good Lesko. Man is not ready to play God.
1TO0004817	Your theories were in error, and beyond correction. I had no choice.
1TO0004818	I can't let you risk people's lives for an experiment.
1TO0004819	Because you're out of your mind!
1TO0004820	If it'll stop the ants from burning down Grayditch, I'm in.
1TO0004822	What exactly do you need?
1TO0004823	So? It's your mistake Doc, you fix it.
1TO0004824	If the Queen's your concern, why not deal with it directly?
1TO0004825	Why not just kill the Queen and be done with it?
1TO0004826	So you want me to pop the Queen, huh?
1TO0004827	Just how will all this undo the mayhem you've caused?
1TO0004828	This will stop the Fire Ants?
1TO0004829	I hope that's everything, I've had enough of ants.
1TO0004830	I'd be glad to help him. Who is he?
1TO0004831	Wilks? I have no idea what you mean.
1TO0004832	Who the hell is Bryan Wilks?
1TO0004833	Let me get back to you on this.
1TO0004834	No reward needed Doc, I'll be glad to help.
1TO0004835	This is a hefty task, Doc. I'm going to need serious incentive.
1TO0004836	Books aren't going to buy me new ammunition.
1TO0004837	You want help? Fork over some caps, Einstein.
1TO0004838	Mutagenic Bio-what?
1TO0004839	What else can you tell me about these Fire Ants?
1TO0004840	How did you go from changing their size to breathing fire?
1TO0004841	Will anything special hurt the Ants?
1TO0004842	Ants exhibit class system behavior, so I'll try and kill the Queen fast.
1TO0004843	How the heck can an ant breathe fire?
1TO0004844	What do you know about Bryan Wilks?
1TO0004845	What should I do about Bryan Wilks?
1TO0004846	Can't you take responsibility for his father's death?
1TO0004847	Don't you realize you've ruined his entire life?
1TO0004848	You should have at least told him you were alive. He thought he was alone.
1TO0004849	I've killed all the Nest Guardians.
1TO0004850	I've killed all the Nest Guardians [Lie]
1TO0004851	I've killed all of the Nest Guardians, but I destroyed your mutagen supply.
1TO0004852	I've destroyed your mutagen sample.
1TO0004853	Actually, my mistake... I'm not done yet.
1TO0004854	I've killed the Ant Queen and I destroyed your mutagen supply.
1TO0004855	So, what will you do now, Doctor?
1TO0004856	Is there anything you can tell me about your science robot?
1TO0004857	Surely your brilliance has devised a way for the robot to mingle with the Ants?
1TO0004858	I can't leave you here alone. Let me find you a place to live.
1TO0004859	Yeah, you'll be better off staying at home.
1TO0004861	So, how are you getting along now that you've left Grayditch behind?
1TO0004862	So, how are you getting along now that the ants are gone?
1TO0004864	Why are there Fire Ants still down in the Metro tunnels?
1TO0004865	So, what are you going to do now about your experiments?
1TO0004866	How are your experiments going today, Doc?
1TO0004874	Hey, Doc. Will this Fire Ant Nectar do you any good?
1TO0004875	I have some more Fire Ant Nectar for you.
1TO0004882	I'd like the Ant Sight to increase my perception.
1TO0004883	I'd like the Ant Might to increase my physical strength.
1TO0004884	Actually, I'm not ready yet.
1TO0004885	Did your pappa ever tell you what he thought of Lesko?
1TO0004886	Before Lesko showed up, were there ever ants in Grayditch?
1TO0004887	Do you trust Lesko?
1TO0004888	I found him, actually... inside Marigold Metro.
1TO0004889	About your experiments...
1TO0004890	What's the goal of your experiments?
1TO0004891	What's gone wrong with the mutagen?
1TO0004892	Something isn't right. You shouldn't have gotten results like these so quickly.
1TO0004893	How exactly can I destroy the mutagen?
1TO0004894	Any idea where I can look for someone to take care of you?
1TO0004895	Did you know the others in town very well?
1TO0004896	Who else lived in Grayditch?
1TO0004897	Mind if I ask about some of the people who lived here?
1TO0004898	Tell me about this "Doc Lesko."
1TO0004899	Tell me about the Brandice Family.
1TO0004900	About the other people from Grayditch...
1TO0004901	Where did the Brandices live?
1TO0004902	So, you and Will were good friends?
1TO0004903	How about Will's parents?
1TO0004904	Will's dad was scary? How so?
1TO0004905	Where did Doctor Lesko stay?
1TO0004906	Do you have any idea what Doctor Lesko was doing in Grayditch?
1TO0004907	Did Doctor Lesko have any weird stuff in his place?
1TO0004908	Is there anywhere you can hide while I search?
1TO0004909	This probably isn't the best place for you to stand...
1TO0004910	Okay kid, I said I'd do it. Now scram!
1TO0004911	Hey, I know it's scary to be alone. Just hang in there!
1TO0004912	Look, anything else you can do to help might save lives.
1TO0004913	Can you tell me more about the things attacking Grayditch?
1TO0004914	Anything else you can remember about them?
1TO0004915	Have they always been around?
1TO0004916	Is there any special way to hurt them?
1TO0004917	Did you hear anyone mention anything about an Ant Queen?
1TO0004918	Where are your parents?
1TO0004919	Where's your house?
1TO0004920	Let me ask you about something else.
1TO0004921	Is there anything else interesting to see near Girdershade?
1TO0004922	What can you tell me about Nuka-Cola Cocktails?
1TO0004923	Tell me more about the Nuka Grenade.
1TO0004924	I have some more Quantum for you.
1TO0004925	Can't you see, Sierra? He just wants to sleep with you.
1TO0004926	You bitch! That was supposed to be for me!
1TO0004928	What happened to our deal, Sierra?
1TO0004929	What kind of recipes can you make with Nuka-Cola Quantum?
1TO0004930	Can you make me a Mississippi Quantum Pie?
1TO0004937	Tell me again what you need for Mississippi Quantum Pie.
1TO0004938	Sounds revolting. Who would eat that?
1TO0004940	Has Ronald been bothering you?
1TO0004941	Sierra is dead.
1TO0004942	The Nuka-Cola Corporation had her killed! (Lie)
1TO0004943	Sorry, I don't know. (Lie)
1TO0004944	I killed her. Got a problem with that, tough guy?
1TO0004945	You sound like you were in love with her.
1TO0004946	Yeah, it's a shame. She was beautiful.
1TO0004947	Well, you found me. Now try and kill me, tough guy.
1TO0004948	I have to get going now.
1TO0004949	I don't have that information.
1TO0004950	My posting title is Ass Kicker and my number is 5.56 mm!
1TO0004951	My posting is Nuka-Cola R&D and my number is 987065. <Lie.>
1TO0004952	My posting is Shipping Clerk and my number is NCSD-701G.
1TO0004953	I'm John-Caleb Bradberton. I don't need an ID number. I own this place!
1TO0004954	Forget it. I'm in the wrong place.
1TO0004955	Command protocol delta-five-three. Disengage security program.
1TO0004957	What's it to you?
1TO0004958	I was checking out Sierra's Nuka-Cola Collection.
1TO0004959	Screw you, buddy! What are you, her husband?
1TO0004960	None of your damn business.
1TO0004961	She never said anything about you two being together.
1TO0004962	I'm not messing with anything.
1TO0004963	Hey, she's my girl! Take a number!
1TO0004964	Maybe I like messing around.
1TO0004965	What are you driving at?
1TO0004967	What the hell is wrong with you? You're sick...
1TO0004968	Nope, I still don't get it.
1TO0004969	That's disgusting!
1TO0004970	Can't say I blame you.
1TO0004971	Oh, really? Sounds interesting. Go on...
1TO0004972	Just what is it you need me to do?
1TO0004973	Look, I've got things to do. I'm not interested.
1TO0004974	Yeah, sure. I'm always for making more caps.
1TO0004975	Tell you what, handsome. Find me some Quantum and we'll make it a threesome.
1TO0004976	Sorry, I'm not interested in your offer.
1TO0004977	How about you pay me double for each Quantum bottle.
1TO0004978	Yeah. I'm sorry, Sierra. Here's a Nuka-Cola Quantum for you!
1TO0004979	Here, maybe this will shut you up. <Give a Nuka-Cola Quantum.>
1TO0004980	I don't know, maybe.
1TO0004981	Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
1TO0004982	You don't like it? Tough!
1TO0004983	Nuka-Cola collection? Wow!
1TO0004984	Yes, of course!
1TO0004985	Nope. I'm not really interested in seeing your collection.
1TO0004986	I think I'd rather be smacked in the head with a blunt instrument.
1TO0004987	Ugh! I hate Nuka-Cola. That stuff is disgusting.
1TO0004988	There's a Nuka-Cola Fan Club?
1TO0004989	What kind of stuff do you collect, exactly?
1TO0004990	Wait a minute. How many members are in your club?
1TO0004991	Are you crazy or something?
1TO0004992	Are you just completely insane, or what?
1TO0004993	Ugh, that sounds really disgusting!
1TO0004994	Who's Ronald?
1TO0004995	Wow, this conversation is getting boring...
1TO0004996	I think you're crazy.
1TO0004997	Tell me more about this Ronald guy.
1TO0004998	Yeah, he sounds great. So, you mentioned a tour or something?
1TO0004999	I think I've had just about enough of this.
1TO0005000	Um... Sierra...
1TO0005001	Yoo-hoo! Anyone home?
1TO0005002	Sierra! Please. I get it. He's tough.
1TO0005003	Shut up already...
1TO0005004	Lady, you've got some issues.
1TO0005006	No reason. I was just passing through.
1TO0005007	I'm looking to make some cash. Any opportunities here?
1TO0005008	Look, lady. I just want to get out of this nuthouse...
1TO0005009	Tell you what. You tell me first, and I'll consider taking the tour.
1TO0005010	Why a blue bottle if the soda is brown? That's just weird.
1TO0005011	Yeah, I guess you're right. It isn't that bad.
1TO0005012	The taste... I could never get used to it.
1TO0005013	I just don't like it.
1TO0005014	Let me think about this, Sierra.
1TO0005015	Quantum? Never heard of it before.
1TO0005016	So what's this Quantum stuff all about again?
1TO0005017	Just cut to the chase. What's this proposition?
1TO0005018	Actually, let me come back before we talk about this.
1TO0005019	So, what went wrong?
1TO0005020	That stuff sounds absolutely revolting.
1TO0005021	Wait, did you say it has an isotope in it? As in it's radioactive?
1TO0005022	What's your interest in all this?
1TO0005023	Glowing pee? That sounds like dangerous stuff!
1TO0005024	So, that's where I come in, I guess.
1TO0005025	Okay, enough with the addict routine. Tell me what you want already!
1TO0005026	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends!
1TO0005027	What's the secret prize?
1TO0005028	I take it this stuff is rare?
1TO0005029	No way! I'm not scouring the Wasteland for some stupid soft drink!
1TO0005030	Okay, Sierra. You've got a deal.
1TO0005031	Actually, I don't think I'm ready to do this now.
1TO0005036	Sorry, I have to be on my way.
1TO0005038	I found the shipping manifests and a map to go with it.
1TO0005039	What do you know about the Nuka-Cola Bottling Facility?
1TO0005040	Come on, Sierra. No secrets between friends! What's the special reward?
1TO0005042	What do you know about Nuka-Cola Quantum?
1TO0005043	What exactly does a bottle of Quantum look like?
1TO0005044	What happens when you drink a Nuka-Cola Quantum?
1TO0005045	Drinking that stuff can't be good for you if it contains radiation.
1TO0005046	You seem kind of addicted to the stuff... Is it safe to drink?
1TO0005047	Here's all the Nuka-Cola Quantum I'm carrying.
1TO0005048	I have the last of the Quantum!
1TO0005050	I'm looking for the factory's shipping manifests.
1TO0005051	May I have the key to the Research Safe?
1TO0005052	Did you know Ronald has offered to buy Quantum from me?
1TO0005053	No, I think he just wants to get into your pants.
1TO0005055	Yep, you're right. He really cares about you!
1TO0005056	Do you even have a clue as to where I can start looking?
1TO0005057	I solemnly swear to protect the Temple of the Union.
1TO0005058	Okay. Where is this ruin?
1TO0005059	Actually, I already know he's up north, near Old Olney.
1TO0005061	You're going to let a bunch of Slavers scare you? Attack them!
1TO0005062	I've done what I can. We should attack now.
1TO0005063	Why don't you just kill them and take all their stuff? Everyone else does.
1TO0005064	Bad news. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
1TO0005065	I found Slavers guarding the Memorial. They're all dead now.
1TO0005066	Forget the Super Mutants. They're all dead. Soldiers have the Memorial.
1TO0005067	They're up north, near Old Olney.
1TO0005068	Is this going to be a long story? 'Cause I've got things to do...
1TO0005069	What will you give me for this toy of Lincoln?
1TO0005070	How much for this war poster?
1TO0005071	I've got this old war poster from Lincoln's Civil War. Want to buy it?
1TO0005072	I have a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation to sell.
1TO0005073	I ought to kill you for treating people like this. In fact, I think I will.
1TO0005074	Are you interested in buying the Gettysburg Address?
1TO0005075	I found the original Gettysburg Address. Want to buy it?
1TO0005076	Are you interested in Lincoln's hat?
1TO0005077	I found one of Lincoln's old hats. Care to buy it?
1TO0005078	I found Lincoln's diary.
1TO0005079	I have Lincoln's diary. I might be willing to sell it.
1TO0005080	I'd rather keep it.
1TO0005082	Um... I seem to be a bit short. But I promise I'll have it by next week.
1TO0005083	That's too much. I think I'll pass.
1TO0005084	How about I buy all the Temple of the Union slaves from you?
1TO0005086	Here. Take your blood money, all 2500 caps of it.
1TO0005087	I have a collection of pennies with Lincoln's face on them.
1TO0005088	How much will you pay for this poster of the Lincoln Memorial?
1TO0005089	Are you interested in buying a recording of Lincoln's voice?
1TO0005090	Would you like to make an offer on Lincoln's Rifle?
1TO0005091	I've got a wanted poster for Lincoln's assassin.
1TO0005092	It's a deal.
1TO0005093	You've got a deal. Here you go.
1TO0005094	Hannibal says you need something?
1TO0005095	What is it that Caleb needs?
1TO0005096	So I'm a prisoner? I don't think so!
1TO0005097	What happened to those Super Mutants?
1TO0005098	Protect escaped slaves? You've got to be kidding. You're worth money to me!
1TO0005099	I've got a lot going on right now. Maybe later.
1TO0005100	I'm an escaped slave. I was told you help runaways like me. <Lie.>
1TO0005101	Maybe. How much is it worth to find these slaves for you?
1TO0005102	I've found Hannibal Hamlin.
1TO0005104	Where the hell am I supposed to get a picture of the Memorial?
1TO0005106	Looks to me like you're getting ready for war. What are you really doing here?
1TO0005108	What's the story with Hannibal?
1TO0005109	Hannibal wants me to promise to keep this place safe. Why should I do that?
1TO0005110	Why should I promise to protect this place?
1TO0005111	So what can you tell me about Hannibal Hamlin?
1TO0005112	Why do you think I should swear my allegiance to this place?
1TO0005113	Who is this Hannibal guy, anyway?
1TO0005114	I'm supposed to promise to keep this place safe. Why should I?
1TO0005116	That's a noble cause, but can I ask you about something else?
1TO0005117	I could get rid of the Super Mutants, if there are any.
1TO0005118	Don't worry about the Super Mutants. Slavers are in control of the Memorial.
1TO0005119	Don't worry about the Super Mutants. Soldiers are in control of the Memorial.
1TO0005120	How about I just kill them all?
1TO0005121	Never heard of it. Is it a ruin around here?
1TO0005122	Let me go, or I swear to God, I'll rip your fucking throat out!
1TO0005123	If I find them, you'll be the first to know.
1TO0005124	What is that stone head?
1TO0005125	I'm looking for runaway slaves.
1TO0005126	So this is the Lincoln Memorial?
1TO0005128	Is the Lincoln Memorial around here somewhere?
1TO0005132	If I had known this before, I wouldn't have come in. Let me go!
1TO0005133	I'll need to think about that.
1TO0005134	My mistake. I'll just be going.
1TO0005135	Never heard of him. If I find anything, though, I'll be sure to show it to you.
1TO0005136	Nevermind.
1TO0005137	So if I find anything like that, you might buy it from me?
1TO0005138	The Slavers are too tough. You haven't got a chance.
1TO0005139	I haven't seen any slaves recently.
1TO0005140	I don't hunt runaway slaves.
1TO0005141	Yeah... that's a problem. Well, I'd better get going.
1TO0005142	Nope. Not really. I think I'll just be on my way.
1TO0005143	I want to know what you're hiding in there. Now open the damn door.
1TO0005146	I'm just looking for a place to rest, and maybe do some trading.
1TO0005147	Easy now. I'm just curious about this place. I'm not looking for trouble.
1TO0005148	I've got no beef with you. Let me go and I won't say a word.
1TO0005149	Not around here, but there is a group of them up north near Old Olney.
1TO0005150	Wouldn't a beacon just attract the Slavers?
1TO0005152	So, you used to be a slave?
1TO0005153	That's a really stupid idea.
1TO0005154	Hey, I've been there! Those Super Mutants are all dead. It's safe now.
1TO0005155	What are a bunch of escaped slaves doing holed up here?
1TO0005156	Why are all of you hiding in this place?
1TO0005157	This place is a dump. Why don't you just leave before the Slavers find you?
1TO0005159	Why do you stay here? Why not keep running?
1TO0005160	Aren't you afraid the Slavers will find you?
1TO0005161	I'm not going to go out of my way to find these slaves for you.
1TO0005162	I want something to drink, kill and steal. Not necessarily in that order.
1TO0005163	You wait here. Let me investigate first.
1TO0005164	Just stay here. I'm not done yet at the Memorial.
1TO0005165	Wait here. I need to scout ahead.
1TO0005166	Okay, it's safe.
1TO0005168	Sounds dangerous. Where is this place?
1TO0005169	Who are you guys?
1TO0005170	Why are you so interested in Lincoln artifacts?
1TO0005171	Why don't you let them stay here?
1TO0005172	Go get them yourself, then.
1TO0005173	If I had, I wouldn't tell you.
1TO0005174	Not for that price. I want more.
1TO0005175	This poster is worth more than that.
1TO0005176	That price is an insult. You'll have to do better than that.
1TO0005177	You can do better than that. This is the Gettysburg Address we're talking about.
1TO0005178	For Lincoln's own hat? Come on. You can do better than that.
1TO0005179	Not enough. Make me a better offer.
1TO0005180	You'll have to do better than that.
1TO0005181	Make it 30 and you have a deal.
1TO0005182	In your dreams. It's worth twice that.
1TO0005183	That price is an insult. You can do better.
1TO0005184	Make it 80 and you have a deal.
1TO0005185	You're kidding, right? It's worth twice that.
1TO0005186	Make it 125 and you have a deal.
1TO0005187	No way. I need a lot more than that.
1TO0005188	Make it 90 and you have a deal.
1TO0005189	I'll bet you know where I can find one.
1TO0005195	Yes. Please end this quest.
1TO0005196	No, brother. Perhaps another time.
1TO0005197	I can't decide now.
1TO0005245	What do you know about Zimmer?
1TO0005246	Zimmer thought you were an android. Don't worry, I set him straight.
1TO0005248	His face job was done here, at Rivet City! By someone named Pinkerton!
1TO0005249	Someone got their hands on a Lipoplasticator and Micro Dermal Graftilizer.
1TO0005250	I'm tracking down the location and equipment used to perform the face job.
1TO0005251	I've heard rumors about an android looking for special surgery.
1TO0005253	The person who did the surgery and reprogramming is here at Rivet City!
1TO0005255	His memory transfer was done by a tech named Pinkerton. Here at Rivet City!
1TO0005256	Sounds like the android was definitely given new memories.
1TO0005257	I'm tracking down leads on a Circuit Neuralizer.
1TO0005258	There are rumors... about a secret Commonwealth artificial intelligence project?
1TO0005274	I'm trying to convince Harkness he's an android, but he wants proof.
1TO0005275	So tell me about the Commonwealth.
1TO0005278	He's in danger. Someone from the Commonwealth is looking for him.
1TO0005279	You'll find it much harder to practice medicine with two broken arms. Talk!
1TO0005280	Hah! I never mentioned an android. Now I know you did it!
1TO0005281	Well... now that you know the truth. What are you going to do?
1TO0005282	So what do I call you, now? Harkness or A3-21?
1TO0005283	So why did you do go ahead with the change? Was it worth it?
1TO0005285	That depends. What exactly are we talking about, here?
1TO0005287	You have a problem with the way I look?
1TO0005291	Missing property? What kind of property?
1TO0005294	Cut to the chase, Zimmer. What's the job?
1TO0005297	Sounds like slavery to me. You sure they don't "wander off" on purpose?
1TO0005299	Interesting... But what's this got to do with me, exactly?
1TO0005301	Enough techno-babble, Zimmer. Just tell me what you want me to do.
1TO0005303	I know what an android is. I dabble in AI programming myself.
1TO0005305	I'll be compensated for my services, right?
1TO0005307	I'm not sure how it is up north, but around here, we get paid for our work.
1TO0005309	Tell me, Zimmer. Is your wallet as big as your mouth?
1TO0005311	Sorry, I've got better things to do.
1TO0005312	I've got better things to do. Are you done talking now?
1TO0005314	Sure. I'll look into finding your android for you.
1TO0005315	I'm not sure how to put this... You're not who you think you are.
1TO0005316	This isn't an existential debate. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
1TO0005317	I don't suppose you know that you're a robot, do you?
1TO0005318	I'm being completely serious. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
1TO0005320	Those memories of your wife aren't real. You're a robot from the Commonwealth.
1TO0005321	You're a robot from the Commonwealth. You belong to a man named Zimmer.
1TO0005322	I can see you aren't going to believe me. Never mind. Forget I said anything.
1TO0005324	What are you going to do about Zimmer? He's the one you were running away from.
1TO0005325	Actually, I was hoping you'd let me kill him.
1TO0005326	Sometimes you have to kill the bad guys.
1TO0005327	Is violence really necessary? Can't you just... kick him off the boat?
1TO0005328	Don't worry, Harkness. Your secret is safe with me.
1TO0005329	Zimmer's waiting. He'll want to take you home now.
1TO0005330	People will kill you when they find out. The Commonwealth is where you belong.
1TO0005331	You're more than "just a machine." You're a person, Harkness. You belong here.
1TO0005332	It's your decision. I'm sure you'll do the right thing.
1TO0005333	I know you don't believe me, but I'm telling the truth!
1TO0005334	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the truth!
1TO0005336	The facts will speak for themselves. I have pictures and an audio testimony!
1TO0005337	I know you don't believe me, but it won't change the facts. I have pictures!
1TO0005338	I know you don't believe me, but it won't change the facts. Listen to this!
1TO0005340	Threaten me all you want, but I have pictures and an audio testimony!
1TO0005341	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the facts. I have pictures!
1TO0005342	Threaten me all you want, but it won't change the facts. Listen to this!
1TO0005343	It's not real blood, Harkness. It's synthetic, just like everything else.
1TO0005344	You were made to look and act human. But you're not. The evidence proves that.
1TO0005345	I'm sorry about this, I really am. But it's true. You're not human.
1TO0005346	Sorry Harkness, but this is the only way. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
1TO0005347	Welcome back to reality, you filthy android. Activate A3-21 Recall Code Violet.
1TO0005349	You know anything about an android looking for surgery? 100 caps if you do.
1TO0005350	You know anything about the physiology of biological robotica from the North?
1TO0005351	Tell me what you know about an android, and I'll give you 100 caps.
1TO0005352	I find android physiology fascinating, don't you? Do you know much about it?
1TO0005366	Let's just say it's in your best interest to tell me what I want to know.
1TO0005367	Maybe 100 caps will jog your memory?
1TO0005368	Sorry, I must have you confused with somebody else. Forget I mentioned it.
1TO0005369	So why'd you help the android?
1TO0005370	What do you know about this android Railroad?
1TO0005371	What do you know about the Commonwealth?
1TO0005372	I took a little peek at the files in your computer. Tell me about the android.
1TO0005373	I'm sorry you don't get along with Dr. Li. But we were discussing the android.
1TO0005374	What's she got to do with this? Show me this "proof" about the android.
1TO0005375	Yeah, she's a bitch... Can we talk about the android now?
1TO0005376	Harkness should be told. You'd want to know if you were an android.
1TO0005377	What if this evidence doesn't work? What if Harkness doesn't believe me?
1TO0005378	There's something you aren't telling me. Isn't there?
1TO0005379	Tell me more about you. You help androids escape?
1TO0005380	So what's this stuff you gave me, these are... android guts?
1TO0005381	Do you know this android personally?
1TO0005382	My interest in the android is none of your business.
1TO0005383	The Commonwealth? What's that?
1TO0005384	Clearly I'm onto something important. What's your stake in all of this?
1TO0005385	Look, I'm just trying to find out more so I can help this android.
1TO0005386	I wonder who wants the android more... care to put a price on the android?
1TO0005387	Really, I just kinda stumbled onto all of this. I'm mostly just curious is all.
1TO0005388	I give you 100 caps. You tell me about the Commonwealth android. Deal?
1TO0005389	I want to know about the android. Start talking, or start bleeding.
1TO0005390	I'll give you 100 caps for what you've got on this android.
1TO0005391	I'm losing my patience! Tell me about the android with the face job!
1TO0005392	Here's a 100 cap "donation." Now, where's that escaped android?
1TO0005393	Tell me where this android disappeared to, or I'll make you disappear. Got it?
1TO0005394	Here's 100 caps for the Railroad. Do you have any news on the android?
1TO0005395	I'm worried about the android. Have you head anything recently?
1TO0005396	Here's 100 caps for the Railroad. Now tell me about the android.
1TO0005397	I'm trying to locate the android. I'm worried about him. What do you know?
1TO0005398	Here's a 100 cap donation to the Railroad. Now where's the android.
1TO0005399	It's important I find that android. I believe he's in great danger.
1TO0005400	You heard the story about an android? Here's 100 caps for your trouble.
1TO0005401	What do you know about the android from up north?
1TO0005404	Got any info on an android mind wipe? Here's a 100 cap "research fee."
1TO0005405	You know how they rewrote engrams in a cluster of Android memory subroutines?
1TO0005406	I'll give you 100 caps if you know who did the mind wipe on that android.
1TO0005407	Do you know anything about the AI swap on that Commonwealth android?
1TO0005408	Is there anyone on this ship named Pinkerton?
1TO0005410	You ever hear of a guy named Pinkerton?
1TO0005411	You know of someone named Pinkerton?
1TO0005412	You ever hear of someone named Pinkerton?
1TO0005413	I'm looking for someone named Pinkerton. Ring any bells?
1TO0005414	I'm tracking down a guy named Pinkerton. Do you know where I can find him?
1TO0005422	Wow, are you batshit insane or what?
1TO0005423	Um... okay... You do know there was a war 200 years ago, right?
1TO0005424	Yes, quite lovely. Um... I've got to go.
1TO0005425	Huh? What are you talking about? Evan King sent me.
1TO0005426	Sure, yeah. I have your fall catalog.
1TO0005428	It's done, Evan. The Family will never bother Arefu again.
1TO0005429	Yeah, I took care of your problem.
1TO0005430	The Family's been dealt with and you owe me big.
1TO0005431	No, he wasn't with the Family. <Lie.>
1TO0005432	Sorry, but Ian's dead. <Lie.>
1TO0005433	He's fine. He's living with Lucy now. <Lie.>
1TO0005434	Ian's dead. I killed him!
1TO0005435	Who did you think I was?
1TO0005436	Let me guess, you thought I was from the Family.
1TO0005437	Well, I have this letter for the West Family.
1TO0005438	I'm just passing through.
1TO0005439	Next time you shoot at me like that, you'd better not miss.
1TO0005440	What kind of trouble?
1TO0005441	Yeah, I know about them.
1TO0005442	Are they Raiders or Slavers?
1TO0005443	Oh come on, it's just gang nonsense.
1TO0005444	Why don't you fight back?
1TO0005445	What's got you so spooked?
1TO0005446	You ever take one of them out?
1TO0005447	What are you, some kind of a wimp?
1TO0005448	I'd be glad to help. What do you need?
1TO0005449	Help costs caps.
1TO0005450	Sounds like you're pretty screwed. You're on your own.
1TO0005451	Nope. You're still on your own.
1TO0005452	I was hoping to find out what the Family did here.
1TO0005453	Look, maybe you better explain what's going on first.
1TO0005454	No, I lied. I'm their newest member!
1TO0005455	I could be his friend.
1TO0005456	Tell me how to see Ian and maybe we can talk... in private.
1TO0005457	He really shouldn't be here.
1TO0005458	Come on, all I want to do is talk. What harm could little old me do?
1TO0005459	Hey, I'm just here to help. All I want to do is be someone he can talk to.
1TO0005460	Maybe it will, or maybe it's just messing him up more.
1TO0005461	Sorry, I think he needs to be with his real family.
1TO0005462	He's needed at home. His family is dead.
1TO0005463	I'm not here to take sides, just to make sure Vance hasn't omitted any facts.
1TO0005464	He needs to talk to someone from the outside, to get some perspective.
1TO0005465	He doesn't belong here.
1TO0005466	Hey, hot stuff. Why don't you tell me how I can see Ian?
1TO0005467	I'm going to kick your ass all over this Metro station if you don't help me!
1TO0005468	You really have a bad attitude.
1TO0005469	Can't you just help out without being so mean?
1TO0005470	Just exploring, sorry.
1TO0005471	I'm not telling you jack. Now let me get by!
1TO0005472	I'm wondering what I could do with all these spare caps I have...
1TO0005473	That's very helpful. Here you go.
1TO0005474	I don't have that many caps.
1TO0005475	On second thought, maybe I'll hang onto them.
1TO0005476	I don't know... For some reason, I feel like I belong here.
1TO0005477	I really need to get by you. It's important I find what I'm looking for.
1TO0005478	Hang on a second. I have a letter for Ian West from his sister.
1TO0005479	Let me see what you have.
1TO0005480	I've brought some bloodpacks to contribute.
1TO0005481	Any help you can provide would be appreciated.
1TO0005482	How are things going now?
1TO0005483	I delivered the letter to Ian.
1TO0005484	I have a letter for you from your sister, Lucy.
1TO0005486	Evan King sent me to look for you.
1TO0005487	You're tough to find.
1TO0005488	No time to discuss it. We're getting the heck out of here!
1TO0005489	Vance is dead, Ian. I'm so sorry.
1TO0005490	Well, Vance isn't going to be able to help anymore.
1TO0005491	Sorry, pal. Vance is worm food.
1TO0005492	Look, this place isn't the answer. You need to go home and face your demons.
1TO0005493	If you want to stay, then stay. You have to do what you feel is right.
1TO0005494	Do what you want. This is a waste of time.
1TO0005495	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet that would change your mind.
1TO0005497	I changed my mind, Ian. I think you should stay here.
1TO0005498	Nothing I can say will change your mind will it?
1TO0005500	I've been looking for you.
1TO0005501	You're a bitch to find.
1TO0005502	Nothing. Sorry, my mistake.
1TO0005503	I'm sorry, Ian, but your parents are dead.
1TO0005504	I'm here to take you home, Ian.
1TO0005505	Pack your shit. We're getting out of this insane asylum!
1TO0005506	You seem awfully troubled, Ian. What did you do...
1TO0005507	I know what you did. Vance told me everything.
1TO0005508	It doesn't matter what happened in the past.
1TO0005509	Get a hold of yourself!
1TO0005510	Look, Ian. I know loss, too. I know it hurts. But staying here isn't the answer.
1TO0005511	I give up. Fine, stay here and cry.
1TO0005512	Maybe I can help you.
1TO0005513	Then stay. I think you belong here with the Family.
1TO0005514	Yeah, something's wrong. You're all a bunch of murderers.
1TO0005515	If Lucy is still alive I bet she misses you.
1TO0005516	Read this letter, Ian. Lucy wrote it. I bet it will change your mind.
1TO0005517	Let's go home, Ian. The only way to beat your nightmares is to face them.
1TO0005518	Looks like I'm breaking you out of your cell...
1TO0005519	Are you a prisoner here or something?
1TO0005520	Who the hell are you supposed to be?
1TO0005522	Calm down, Ian. Tell me everything from the beginning.
1TO0005523	I have no clue what you're talking about.
1TO0005525	Wait, you're Ian West? I have this letter for you from your sister!
1TO0005526	Evan King sent me. Can I come in?
1TO0005527	I'm from the Family! Let me in!
1TO0005528	Sorry, my mistake.
1TO0005529	Calm down, pal, before I put a hole in your chest.
1TO0005530	Whoa, whoa, whoa.... Take it easy.
1TO0005531	Why are you being so hostile?
1TO0005532	Your wife let me in... something about a catalog?
1TO0005534	Look, I'm not here to hurt anyone, I swear.
1TO0005535	There's no sign of him, but I'm sure he's alive.
1TO0005536	I didn't find his body.
1TO0005537	He's probably dead too.
1TO0005538	All right, Lucy. Calm down. I'll find Ian.
1TO0005539	Sorry. I agreed to go to Arefu. That's it.
1TO0005540	If you want me to find Ian, I'll need to equip myself. That costs money.
1TO0005541	I found him. He's safe.
1TO0005542	I haven't found him. <Lie.>
1TO0005543	I found him. He's with the Family.
1TO0005544	Sure am. Stopped in to find something to do.
1TO0005545	None of your business.
1TO0005546	Maybe. Who wants to know?
1TO0005548	Nope, sorry.
1TO0005549	A job usually means I get paid.
1TO0005550	I'll need some details before I can decide.
1TO0005556	Can you give me some information about Arefu?
1TO0005557	Where is Arefu?
1TO0005558	Do you suspect your family is in danger?
1TO0005559	Who else lives in Arefu?
1TO0005560	Is there anything dangerous around there I should know about?
1TO0005561	Can I see what you have for sale?
1TO0005562	Evan King told me to check on you. Is everything okay?
1TO0005563	So, what's your take on Evan King?
1TO0005564	I have a message for the West family from their daughter.
1TO0005565	I delivered that letter to your brother Ian.
1TO0005567	This may sound odd, but is there a trainyard outside Arefu?
1TO0005568	The Wests had bite marks on their necks. Mean anything to you?
1TO0005569	I discovered that the Wests had bite marks on their necks made by a human!
1TO0005570	No, I only found the parents' bodies.
1TO0005571	Nope, and it's unlikely they left him alive.
1TO0005572	No, and enough with the third degree already!
1TO0005574	Can you tell me more about what's been going on around here?
1TO0005575	Tell me about the Family.
1TO0005576	Where do you think I can find the Family?
1TO0005577	What do you think about the Family?
1TO0005579	Arefu donates bloodpacks, and you leave the town alone.
1TO0005580	Arefu donates bloodpacks, and in exchange, you protect them.
1TO0005581	Arefu will sell you bloodpacks, and you'll leave the town alone.
1TO0005582	Before I talk about Ian, there's still the matter of Arefu to discuss...
1TO0005583	Wait! What about Arefu? You can't just prey on them anytime you're hungry!
1TO0005584	How did you know Ian was trying to decide to stay or leave?
1TO0005585	How can I convince you to stop preying on Arefu?
1TO0005586	There must be an alternative source of blood you can survive on.
1TO0005587	I believe that blood preserved in bloodpacks could provide what you need.
1TO0005588	Give those people a chance! They're defenseless.
1TO0005589	If you keep attacking Arefu, they'll keep fighting back until everyone is dead.
1TO0005590	I'm not sure I should be the one telling you this.
1TO0005591	Vampires can drink any kind of human blood... even from bloodpacks.
1TO0005592	This place is very different from any of the other settlements I've seen.
1TO0005594	I think I've stumbled across the world's first underground insane asylum!
1TO0005595	<Allow Vance to continue.>
1TO0005596	Excuse me, but what does all that mean?
1TO0005597	Whoa, whoa... slow down there. I left my thesaurus at home.
1TO0005598	Your ways? So you're reforming these people?
1TO0005600	Wow, you're a real humanitarian.
1TO0005601	If I accept that you're no longer cannibals, what do I call you?
1TO0005602	Your people eat human flesh, Vance. That's sick!
1TO0005603	A cannibal by any other name is still a cannibal.
1TO0005604	Enough talk! I'm here to wipe your kind out!
1TO0005605	You just try it, psycho, and I'll splatter your brains all over that wall!
1TO0005608	None of this talk is necessary. I know exactly what you are.
1TO0005609	This isn't rocket science. I know exactly what you are.
1TO0005611	I have a letter for him. From his sister...
1TO0005612	Ian shouldn't be here. He has family that misses him.
1TO0005613	You people murdered his parents!
1TO0005614	I don't have time for chit-chat. Tell me where Ian is. Now!
1TO0005615	Enough talk, psycho. Tell me where Ian is or so help me...
1TO0005616	Wait a minute... What happened to him?
1TO0005617	Damn it, Vance! What did you do to him?
1TO0005618	Are you telling me that Ian is a cannibal?
1TO0005619	I find this all very hard to believe.
1TO0005620	This letter is all Ian has left of his old life. Allow me to give it to him.
1TO0005621	Look, I'm one of you. So I understand your feelings. I just want to talk to Ian.
1TO0005622	Please, you must let me speak to him!
1TO0005623	Let me see Ian, you filthy liar!
1TO0005625	You're vampires. Or at least you follow their fictional traditions.
1TO0005626	If I said vampires, and you said I was right, we'd both be crazy.
1TO0005627	I still say you're cannibals.
1TO0005628	I think you're a collective of seriously messed up freaks.
1TO0005629	You do this by teaching them that they're mythical beings?
1TO0005630	What you're doing here is brainwashing them, plain and simple.
1TO0005631	Come on, Vance! You're on a power trip... you mess with their minds!
1TO0005632	I have no idea.
1TO0005633	I don't have time for games, Vance.
1TO0005634	I think you're a bunch of creepy weirdos.
1TO0005640	I'm sorry, I'm ready now.
1TO0005641	I've changed my mind. I'm not quite ready.
1TO0005642	I'm leaving. This is just crazy.
1TO0005643	I've never seen anyplace like this.
1TO0005644	Amazing, this place seems so abundant with animal life.
1TO0005645	I can't explain it, but I can feel this place just teeming with life.
1TO0005646	This place is weird. Where do you plug stuff in?
1TO0005647	This place scares me. It's so... different.
1TO0005648	Who is it you keep referring to as "Him"?
1TO0005649	The way you're saying "Him," I could swear you're referring to a god...
1TO0005650	I wish you could just tell me who "He" is, already...
1TO0005651	Can you cut the "Him" crap already and just tell me who he is?
1TO0005652	Why do you call yourselves Treeminders?
1TO0005653	I may be willing to help, but I need straight answers about who "He" is.
1TO0005654	Treeminders, huh? That's a strange name.
1TO0005655	I think you're all a bunch of lunatics.
1TO0005656	If you hate technology, why carry weapons?
1TO0005657	Shun technology? How do you defend yourselves?
1TO0005658	Yeah, sure. I guess that's why Maple stuck a rifle in my face...
1TO0005659	Okay, let's begin the ceremony.
1TO0005660	Could we wait just a bit? I'm not quite ready.
1TO0005661	Forget this whole thing. This is insane!
1TO0005662	Which brings us to why I'm here, I suppose.
1TO0005663	So what was all this about meeting someone?
1TO0005664	Fine, fine. Get to the point already.
1TO0005665	I would be honored to meet this person.
1TO0005666	And where can I find this person?
1TO0005667	Okay already. Let's get this going.
1TO0005668	Just a minute... What does this ceremony involve?
1TO0005669	Hang on, you never said anything about a ceremony!
1TO0005670	Can't we skip all this nonsense?
1TO0005671	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be protected.
1TO0005672	Sure, I guess.
1TO0005673	I could have used a pile of caps instead, but whatever.
1TO0005674	I have to say I'm surprised you aren't angrier with me.
1TO0005675	And here I thought you'd be ready to kill me.
1TO0005676	Welcome back to the Wasteland, asshole.
1TO0005677	What will become of Oasis?
1TO0005678	You'll make due.
1TO0005679	I could care less about your problems. I'm out of here.
1TO0005680	I'm afraid Harold isn't a god. He's just a human that had some bad luck.
1TO0005681	He's not a god, Birch. His name's Harold.
1TO0005682	Can we just dispense with all of the religious crap? His name's Harold!
1TO0005683	Did you know your god wants me to kill him?
1TO0005684	Harold makes unusual requests.
1TO0005685	Are you aware that Harold wants to die?
1TO0005686	Did you know that crazy tree thing wants me to kill it?
1TO0005687	You don't scare me Birch, and neither does that overgrown weed you call a god.
1TO0005688	So what can I do to help?
1TO0005689	Killing him should stop his influence from spreading.
1TO0005690	Good! Free firewood for all!
1TO0005692	Just a minute. Who are you and what is this place?
1TO0005693	I'm not following anyone until I know what's going on here.
1TO0005694	Ha ha ha! What the hell are you wearing?
1TO0005695	Whoa, whoa. Slow down, old man. What the hell are you babbling about?
1TO0005696	Sure, lead on.
1TO0005697	Who's waiting for me inside?
1TO0005698	The Treeminders?
1TO0005699	I'm not following anyone. I need to be on my way.
1TO0005700	Okay, I'll follow you. Lead on.
1TO0005701	Trust is a two-way street. I don't feel safe with all this mysterious talk.
1TO0005702	No way! You're obviously out of your mind!
1TO0005703	Perhaps some other time. I have more urgent matters to attend to.
1TO0005709	You've become an important part of their life. Without you, they're lost.
1TO0005710	I'm not the killing type.
1TO0005711	You're obviously crazier than they are. Why would I listen to you?
1TO0005713	Tree Father Birch said you may have a gift for me?
1TO0005714	Leaf Mother Laurel said you may have a gift for me?
1TO0005716	I hear you may have a gift for me?
1TO0005717	You said someone had gifts for me?
1TO0005723	Um... I must be dreaming.
1TO0005724	I've never met a talking tree before.
1TO0005725	Okay. What's the trick? I know there's a guy with a microphone somewhere.
1TO0005726	They're worshipping a tree? Ha ha ha!
1TO0005727	So you're trapped in there, inside this Herbert... I mean Bob... thing?
1TO0005728	I'm beginning to suspect you weren't always this way.
1TO0005729	What in the hell are you talking about?
1TO0005730	How did a tree end up growing out of your head?
1TO0005731	A genetic mutation of that magnitude could only be caused by F.E.V.
1TO0005732	How on Earth did that happen?
1TO0005733	I still don't understand what the hell you're talking about.
1TO0005734	Well, hopefully your troubles will be over. I'm here to help.
1TO0005735	So, the Treeminders said you needed my help?
1TO0005736	Look, let's cut the bullshit and get to the matter at hand.
1TO0005741	Well, goodbye for now then, Herbert. Or was it Bob?
1TO0005742	Okay. Goodbye, err... Tree.
1TO0005743	Fine. What the hell do I call you anyway? Herbert or Bob?
1TO0005744	You want me to murder you?
1TO0005745	Kill you? You can't be serious!
1TO0005746	Sure. Where do you want the bullet, head or gut?
1TO0005747	How would I be able to kill you? You're a tree.
1TO0005748	If I kill you, every Treeminder will come after me.
1TO0005749	Why don't you just kill yourself?
1TO0005750	Ok, I'll do it.
1TO0005751	Look, I really don't want to kill you...
1TO0005752	Can I have some time to think about it?
1TO0005753	I'm not a charity. You want to die, cough up some caps.
1TO0005754	I was glad to do it. Oasis needs to be shared with the world.
1TO0005757	Doesn't anybody care what your god thinks?
1TO0005758	Why don't any of you listen to Harold?
1TO0005759	This is a waste of my time.
1TO0005760	How can I possibly help?
1TO0005761	Uh oh... I see where this is going...
1TO0005762	I give up. Just let me know what you want now.
1TO0005763	Yes, I'd like to speak to Tree Father Birch.
1TO0005764	No, maybe some other time.
1TO0005765	I don't suppose there's more you can tell me about Oasis?
1TO0005769	What's your opinion of Tree Father Birch and Leaf Mother Laurel?
1TO0005770	You're mostly a tree, right? Can't I just burn you down?
1TO0005771	Any information you could give me on the caves below Oasis would be helpful.
1TO0005772	May I have the key to the caves?
1TO0005773	I have some quick questions about those caves.
1TO0005774	How do I get into the caves?
1TO0005775	Is there anything down there to look out for?
1TO0005776	I'm ready to undertake the ceremony.
1TO0005777	I'd like to start the ceremony again.
1TO0005778	You don't actually seem that sad. Why do you want to die?
1TO0005779	Hey, life is a gift. Even if it lasts a long time, be glad you have it!
1TO0005780	I understand what you mean.
1TO0005781	If people thought I was a god, I'd exploit it for all it's worth!
1TO0005782	Seeing me approach Oasis is quite a feat for a living tree.
1TO0005783	See me coming? That's not possible.
1TO0005784	You say you saw me coming to Oasis. And you call the Treeminders crazy...
1TO0005786	What do you see in my future?
1TO0005787	How is it you're causing all of these things to grow around you?
1TO0005788	What's causing this place to grow?
1TO0005789	I agree completely!
1TO0005790	What if there are other that don't share your opinion?
1TO0005791	You speak heresy! Tree Father Birch should hear about this!
1TO0005792	Tell me about your "god."
1TO0005793	Can you tell me about your "god" again? I'd forgotten what you said.
1TO0005795	Did you know your god wants to die?
1TO0005796	Hey, maybe if you tell me what Harold is scared of I won't be scared either.
1TO0005797	Tell me, too! Then I won't be scared either.
1TO0005798	What's Harold scared of?
1TO0005799	I can't believe a tree would be scared of anything.
1TO0005800	Yeah, well guess what? He's really a monster!
1TO0005801	So, how did you end up here?
1TO0005802	Remind me again how you found Oasis.
1TO0005804	Dying? How awful! What happened to you?
1TO0005805	Why'd you stay here after you recovered?
1TO0005806	I'm not sure I could live with these loonies.
1TO0005807	Why didn't Birch or Laurel call on you to do what I'm doing?
1TO0005810	Yes, it would be dangerous letting the Wasteland know where Oasis is located.
1TO0005811	I don't see that it matters much. Oasis is off the beaten path as it is.
1TO0005812	Stop being so selfish! You people should share this place with everyone!
1TO0005813	I have some questions about the task you gave me.
1TO0005814	Why don't you just travel to Harold's heart on your own?
1TO0005815	Were you aware that Laurel gave me this Liniment?
1TO0005816	Where did the sap come from?
1TO0005817	Where did the Liniment come from?
1TO0005818	Where is the entrance to the caves?
1TO0005819	What did you have to do to become a Treeminder?
1TO0005820	Remind me again what you did to become a Treeminder.
1TO0005821	May I ask you about the Treeminders?
1TO0005823	How did the Treeminders begin?
1TO0005825	Could I become a Treeminder?
1TO0005826	Your names are quite strange. What do they mean?
1TO0005827	I think you're right. Who knows what would happen to this place?
1TO0005828	What if all the Treeminders don't agree with you?
1TO0005829	I don't think Leaf Mother Laurel is going to like hearing you say that!
1TO0005830	If this place has living plants, does that mean the water is safe to drink?
1TO0005831	I'd like to ask about something else.
1TO0005836	You're nuts to live here. That thing will blow you all to Hell.
1TO0005837	I don't need a reward. I couldn't sleep at night knowing you could all die.
1TO0005838	100 caps? All right, I'll take a look at it.
1TO0005839	Not my problem. Good luck, Sheriff.
1TO0005840	Demolition expertise doesn't come cheap. I want 500 caps.
1TO0005842	Actually, Sheriff, I plan on detonating that bomb.
1TO0005844	I met a man named Burke. He said he'd pay me to rig the bomb to explode.
1TO0005845	Actually, Burke really does want to blow up Megaton.
1TO0005846	What if he asks someone else to explode the bomb? You should do something.
1TO0005847	He gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. Here, take it.
1TO0005848	Actually, I think he was just kidding.
1TO0005849	Messing with that bomb seems pretty technical. What if I can't do it?
1TO0005850	I'm not sure I can disarm the bomb.
1TO0005851	I have a "proposition" of my own. Would you like to hear it, Mister Burke?
1TO0005852	You see, I live here, lover. And surely you wouldn't want to hurt me...
1TO0005853	Burke, you silly man. You'll pay me 500 extra caps... and like it.
1TO0005854	Throw in an extra 500 caps, and you've got yourself a deal.
1TO0005855	Megaton is under my protection. You're going to leave... now.
1TO0005857	Actually, the sheriff will pay me to disarm the bomb.
1TO0005859	I'm not going to do it.
1TO0005861	Actually, I may have reconsidered. Let's discuss my role in this again.
1TO0005862	I've disarmed the bomb, Burke. That thing will never explode now.
1TO0005863	Go on. I'm listening.
1TO0005864	Wait... You're going to destroy the town?
1TO0005866	All right. Say I decide to help you. What's in it for me?
1TO0005867	Too many lives are at stake, Burke! I'm going to defuse that bomb.
1TO0005868	Forget I mentioned it.
1TO0005869	I told Simms I'd disarm it. Maybe some extra caps would change my mind...
1TO0005870	If I destroy Megaton, I'll lose access to all of the town's services...
1TO0005872	We're talking a lot of innocent lives here, Burke. Can I warn them?
1TO0005873	Mister Burke, is it? Please, continue. I find myself... enthralled.
1TO0005877	I need something to help me concentrate...
1TO0005878	So you've got someone in town with a drug habit?
1TO0005879	A place like this is probably crawling with junkies, huh?
1TO0005880	Ha! Figures a shithole like this would have a local Chem head.
1TO0005883	I've been wondering... why blow up Megaton?
1TO0005884	You've got to clear away the past to make room for the future.
1TO0005885	You don't have a problem with killing all those people?
1TO0005889	I need to buy some Chems.
1TO0005890	Let's discuss this bomb.
1TO0005891	Don't you think someone should disarm that thing?
1TO0005892	Who would build a town around a bomb? That's crazy!
1TO0005893	One day, that thing's going to go off. You're living on borrowed time.
1TO0005894	I can see about disarming that bomb for you.
1TO0005895	Whatever. I don't plan on sticking around very long, anyway.
1TO0005896	If that bomb ever explodes, it would be doing the world a favor...
1TO0005897	I could do it, Lucas. I could disarm the bomb.
1TO0005898	Yeah... Yeah, good luck with that.
1TO0005899	I could disarm that bomb for you, Simms. But it'd cost you.
1TO0005900	Burke gave me this Fusion Pulse Charge to rig to the bomb. You want it?
1TO0005901	The bomb can't be disarmed, Simms. In fact, I plan to detonate it.
1TO0005902	Nice town you got here, sheriff. It's a pleasure to meet you.
1TO0005903	Pffft. Nice hat, Calamity Jane.
1TO0005905	So which do you like more, being mayor or being sheriff?
1TO0005907	You call this trash heap a town? It's... pathetic.
1TO0005908	Right. Message received.
1TO0005909	You don't scare me.
1TO0005911	There's a new sheriff in town! It's time to die, asshole.
1TO0005912	I want your hat. What do you think about that?
1TO0005913	I want that hat. What do you think about that?
1TO0005914	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
1TO0005915	You're dead.
1TO0005916	I'm just messing with you. Relax!
1TO0005922	Just curious.
1TO0005924	Touchy subject, huh? What the matter, hiding some kind of big secret?
1TO0005926	Never mind. Forget I asked.
1TO0005928	If I promise not to touch anything, will you let me in?
1TO0005929	Are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?
1TO0005931	Look, I'm not an idiot. I won't break anything.
1TO0005932	You want Gustavo to catch you with that? Better let me hold onto it, old man.
1TO0005934	Sorry for bothering you.
1TO0005935	What if all your other neighbors agree?
1TO0005937	This is happening. You're going to have to deal with it, or get forced out.
1TO0005938	I don't care. Get your stuff together and get out of here.
1TO0005939	I'm sure you'll find something suitable, don't worry.
1TO0005942	Where are the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
1TO0005944	So you approve of mass murder? The basement storage room is full of corpses.
1TO0005945	What happened to the other Tenpenny Tower residents?
1TO0005946	The basement storage room is full of bodies. You have anything to do with that?
1TO0005947	I notice a distinct lack of non-Ghoul tenants.
1TO0005948	Nice pile of bodies in the storage room. You're proud of yourself, aren't you?
1TO0005951	I might be able to get you in there.
1TO0005952	Right on. Kill those elitists. I think I can help you with that escape door.
1TO0005954	Well, maybe I should talk to Tenpenny. There may be a peaceful solution.
1TO0005955	Let me try talking to Tenpenny. Maybe he wouldn't mind you living there.
1TO0005956	It's not really any of my business. Sorry I asked.
1TO0005958	It's Tenpenny's tower. He can do whatever he wants.
1TO0005959	Whatever. You're no better than Tenpenny.
1TO0005960	Whatever. I'm leaving.
1TO0005961	Good luck with that. I'll have none of it.
1TO0005962	You're a zombie! People should shoot you!
1TO0005963	You're secure in these tunnels. Why try to get into Tenpenny, anyway?
1TO0005964	I'll get that door open, and then you can let your hordes in.
1TO0005965	The gate is open! Now's your chance! <Lie.>
1TO0005966	I can get them to let you move in / You can now move in.
1TO0005967	I think I can convince them to let you live there.
1TO0005968	I've taken care of things. You can move in now!
1TO0005969	Relax. It's just a warning, not a threat. I'm not going to kill you.
1TO0005970	Anything you want to say before you meet your maker?
1TO0005971	I don't have to kill you. If you were to give me a handful of caps...
1TO0005974	You bet! I like meeting new people.
1TO0005975	I'm not lost. I'm not a little girl. And I'm not that bad. We could be friends.
1TO0005976	Don't worry. I was let in at the front gate.
1TO0005977	"Daring?" Bet you had to earn that nickname, huh?
1TO0005978	It's nice to meet someone with a sense of civic duty.
1TO0005979	I'm nobody in particular. But I'm sure you'll soon come to like me.
1TO0005980	It's very nice to meet you, my Lady Wellington.
1TO0005981	You put up with a lot from your husband, huh?
1TO0005983	I'm a little busy at the moment. Maybe we can chat later.
1TO0005984	From my perspective, things can't get much uglier than they already are.
1TO0005985	I jumped over the walls when no one was looking. How do you think I got in here?
1TO0005987	Shouldn't you be napping or something?
1TO0005988	People don't need leaders, just good common sense.
1TO0005989	I'm your worst nightmare.
1TO0005990	Oh look, another stuck-up bitch. How impressive.
1TO0005991	Isn't a wife supposed to honor and obey her husband?
1TO0006001	What would it take to convince you to let Ghouls live here?
1TO0006002	I've met them. Roy Phillips and those other Ghouls don't seem all that bad.
1TO0006004	I'm no stranger to violence, if that's what you're getting at.
1TO0006006	I could kill a Ghoul or two, if I had to.
1TO0006007	The only thing a Ghoul should have to prove is how fast it can die.
1TO0006008	You could say I'm an expert when it comes to dealing with Ghouls.
1TO0006009	I eat Ghouls for breakfast.
1TO0006010	I'm not afraid of Ghouls.
1TO0006011	I shoot Ghouls first, and ask questions later.
1TO0006012	The only good place for a Ghoul is at the end of a rope.
1TO0006013	It will take more than a committee to deal with the problem. I think I can help.
1TO0006014	I could take a whole pack of Ghouls without breaking a sweat.
1TO0006015	Sure, I know lots of Ghouls. Killed my share, too.
1TO0006017	Actually, I'm not a big fan of Ghouls.
1TO0006019	Yeah, I wouldn't want Ghouls living here either.
1TO0006020	Let's just say I never met a Ghoul I liked.
1TO0006021	I've seen lots of Ghouls. Hated every last one of them.
1TO0006022	I don't like Ghouls any more than you do.
1TO0006023	It's a good thing those walls are so high.
1TO0006024	Most Ghouls are in need of a serious makeover. Huh? Am I right?
1TO0006025	Committees won't help. You need to simply ignore them, or exterminate them.
1TO0006026	I've dealt with enough Ghouls to know I don't ever want to see one again.
1TO0006027	Only one thing I like less than Ghouls: old geezers giving me orders.
1TO0006028	When I see a Ghoul in the distance, I tend to turn around and go the other way.
1TO0006030	Ghouls aren't so bad, once you get to know them.
1TO0006032	Ghouls are all right.
1TO0006033	I think they've proven something just staying alive in that condition.
1TO0006034	Look, I know enough about Ghouls not to hate them.
1TO0006035	I don't consider Ghouls to be a problem. If that's what you're asking.
1TO0006036	I'd rather spend time with Ghouls than some other people I know.
1TO0006037	Sure they look a little weird, but they're not diseased vermin.
1TO0006038	What do you have against Ghouls, anyway?
1TO0006039	Don't worry about those Ghouls, comrade. You need to relax.
1TO0006040	Stop worrying about those Ghouls.
1TO0006041	Sure, I've met some Ghouls. They're just people, trying to get by.
1TO0006042	I found a love letter. I think you'll want to see it.
1TO0006047	Your other residents are gone. Might as well let the Ghouls live here.
1TO0006048	The bigots have all been taken care of. So the Ghouls can move in now. Right?
1TO0006050	Good thing the tower was still structurally sound after the war.
1TO0006051	Running a cafe can't be easy.
1TO0006052	I'm a little shocked by how healthy everyone looks.
1TO0006053	I've noticed the quality of living is rather high here, isn't it?
1TO0006055	This place feels more like a prison than a home.
1TO0006056	Not everyone is as lucky as you.
1TO0006057	It must be nice having patients who can pay their medical bills, huh?
1TO0006058	I bet people are dying to live here. You're all lucky you can afford it.
1TO0006062	Sure. Whatever you say, doc.
1TO0006063	Blah blah blah!
1TO0006065	I might be able to do something.
1TO0006066	I might be able to help deal with the problem.
1TO0006067	I might be able to take care of your unwanted neighbors.
1TO0006068	I can take care of your little problem for you.
1TO0006069	I can take care of this problem once and for all.
1TO0006070	I can handle those Ghouls.
1TO0006071	I might be able to solve this problem.
1TO0006072	I think I can help with your Ghoul problem...
1TO0006073	Don't worry. I'll take care of the problem.
1TO0006074	I'll take care of those Ghouls. Stop worrying about it.
1TO0006076	I can take care of this Ghoul situation, no problem.
1TO0006077	Contained? Don't you want a permanent solution?
1TO0006079	I wonder if Ghouls will like your cooking?
1TO0006080	You ever wonder if maybe you drink too much?
1TO0006081	You ever wonder what those Ghouls think of you, and your snobby friends?
1TO0006082	It's pretty sad, isn't it. Not being the center of everyone's attention?
1TO0006083	I don't suppose you've consulted any Ghouls on your little theory?
1TO0006084	I make it a point to stay clear of trouble.
1TO0006085	I'll go tell them there's nothing here worth dying over.
1TO0006086	Perhaps, comrade, the Ghouls will join your committee, comrade.
1TO0006087	It's only natural to be afraid of the unknown...
1TO0006088	Yeah, about that... I'm not really in the Ghoul extermination business.
1TO0006090	Better let the young folks handle things, old timer.
1TO0006091	For an evil minion, you're not very bright. You can't "contain" Ghouls.
1TO0006096	That's interesting.
1TO0006100	Interesting.
1TO0006103	Sure. Whatever you say.
1TO0006105	Sure, sounds good. I would have done it for free.
1TO0006106	I'll take it. And any other help you can offer.
1TO0006107	You want this problem resolved or not? You can spare more than that...
1TO0006108	Perhaps the residents could be "persuaded" to let the Ghouls live here.
1TO0006109	I was just kidding. Ghouls are filthy creatures that should be slaughtered.
1TO0006110	That can be arranged. You don't look like much.
1TO0006112	Have you even tried talking to the Ghouls? I bet you can work something out.
1TO0006113	Yeah, Ghouls are too much trouble.
1TO0006114	You're all bigots.
1TO0006115	Whatever. It's not really any of my business.
1TO0006117	What the hell's a Ghoul anyway? Some kind of diseased human?
1TO0006118	Lend me some men to take into the tunnels to hunt Ghouls.
1TO0006119	You can spare a few men, at least, can't you?
1TO0006120	You're right. Never mind.
1TO0006121	Half the force is napping. Give them some stims, and we'll go kick some ass!
1TO0006123	I was just kidding! Those zombies need to be killed!
1TO0006124	Yeah, Ghouls don't belong here.
1TO0006125	Ghouls are disgusting, aren't they?
1TO0006126	You're right. Ghouls are disgusting.
1TO0006127	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls. They'll kill you when you aren't looking.
1TO0006128	Yeah. Ghouls are disgusting creatures.
1TO0006130	You're a wise man, Banfield. Ghouls are meant to be feared.
1TO0006131	Yeah, Ghouls would make horrible neighbors.
1TO0006133	It's wise to be afraid of Ghouls.
1TO0006138	What if the residents are okay with Ghoul neighbors?
1TO0006139	What if Tenpenny will let Ghouls live here?
1TO0006140	Tenpenny seems rather heartless.
1TO0006141	What if they kept themselves clean and didn't bother anyone?
1TO0006142	I've met these Ghouls. They're civilized and pose no threat.
1TO0006145	I've met these ghouls. They seem healthy. All things considered.
1TO0006148	Comrade, I've met these ghouls. They seem friendly enough. More than this lot.
1TO0006149	I've met these Ghouls. They seem friendly enough.
1TO0006150	I've met these Ghouls. They aren't so bad.
1TO0006151	So you wouldn't mind if some civilized Ghouls moved in?
1TO0006152	Would you tell Mister Tenpenny that you wouldn't mind Ghoul neighbors?
1TO0006157	Perhaps.
1TO0006169	There are some Ghouls who want to live here. What do you think about that?
1TO0006171	What happened to Mister Tenpenny?
1TO0006173	I got you the slave you wanted. I can get into Paradise Falls now, right?
1TO0006174	What's this mutually beneficial offer you mentioned?
1TO0006175	Yeah, I'm not going to pay you that much.
1TO0006176	Nah, maybe another time.
1TO0006177	Come on, don't charge me. It was an... accident. Won't happen again.
1TO0006178	Sure, I'll buy another one. Here's 100 caps.
1TO0006180	Start running to Paradise Falls or your head'll explode! That collar is a bomb.
1TO0006181	You're a slave now! Better get to Paradise Falls before your head explodes!
1TO0006182	You get moving to Paradise Falls, or that fucking collar will explode!
1TO0006183	Give my regards to the Slavers in Paradise Falls. Move, or your head goes boom!
1TO0006185	You hiding anything in your pockets?
1TO0006186	Give me all your stuff!
1TO0006187	You'd better not be holding out on me! Show me what you're carrying.
1TO0006188	Turn your pockets out, before I get... nasty.
1TO0006190	You're a slave now. Get going to Paradise Falls. Sorry. I needed the money.
1TO0006191	I'm afraid your head will explode if you don't get to Paradise Falls. Sorry.
1TO0006192	Go to Paradise Falls before that collar explodes. Sorry!
1TO0006193	You're a slave now. Nothing personal. Get to Paradise Falls if you want to live.
1TO0006194	I'd like to know more about the slave collar.
1TO0006195	How does the collar work?
1TO0006196	How do I get it on a slave?
1TO0006197	Who can I put it on?
1TO0006202	I don't have time to chit chat with the help. Let me in already.
1TO0006205	Why can't I go up there?
1TO0006208	I won't cause any trouble. I just want to look around.
1TO0006211	What the hell is your problem? Let me in!
1TO0006212	I'm done screwin' around. Let me in!
1TO0006214	Maybe there's something you need, huh? I help you, you let me in. Deal?
1TO0006216	You looking for a fight, asshole? Just say the word.
1TO0006218	What if I were to get you some slaves? Then would you let me in?
1TO0006219	I don't have time to play games. Here's 200 caps. Let me in.
1TO0006220	Come on. Let me in already!
1TO0006222	Who's Eulogy Jones?
1TO0006224	I'll round up some slaves for you. But what's the catch?
1TO0006226	I'll get your slaves.
1TO0006229	On second thought, no. I'm not going to do it.
1TO0006230	Yeah, like I said before. I'm not going to get you slaves.
1TO0006231	You want a fucking resume? Just tell me what to do, asshole.
1TO0006232	It can't be that hard, can it? I mean, you're a Slaver after all...
1TO0006233	I can enslave criminals and the like, right? I don't have to enslave innocents?
1TO0006234	I'm not going to do your dirty work.
1TO0006235	Like I said before. I'm not going to get slaves for you.
1TO0006236	Nope. Not going to do it. Get your own slaves.
1TO0006237	I've been thinking about getting into the trade. You need a dog catcher?
1TO0006239	You've got yourself a deal. Here's your 200 caps.
1TO0006240	200 caps? Wow. I'll have to get back to you on that.
1TO0006242	How's the Mesmetron work?
1TO0006243	What happens if I run out of energy cells for it?
1TO0006244	Where did you find it?
1TO0006245	That's enough about the Mesmetron for now.
1TO0006246	I need to buy some more ammo for the Mesmetron.
1TO0006248	You look exhausted. Let me carry your stuff for a while.
1TO0006249	I think you've got something that belongs to me. I need it back.
1TO0006250	I want to show you a magic trick. You mind if I borrow some of your stuff?
1TO0006251	There's a thief about, and you seem distracted.  I'll hold onto your gear.
1TO0006253	Damn. I wish I had a slave collar. I could totally make you a slave right now.
1TO0006254	Here. Put on this collar -- I mean, necklace. I think it'll look good on you.
1TO0006255	I'm going to put this collar on you. Just hold real still for a minute.
1TO0006256	This is too easy. Here, put this collar on.
1TO0006257	I have some friends who want to meet you. Here, put this collar on.
1TO0006259	You're just a little dazed. Walk it off. You'll be okay soon.
1TO0006260	You're staring into space. You feeling okay? Wake up!
1TO0006261	Let's hope there's no permanent brain damage. Run along now!
1TO0006262	Have you been drinking? You'd better go get some rest.
1TO0006263	All right. It's time for me to go.
1TO0006264	I can try getting that collar off. But it might explode if I tinker with it.
1TO0006266	Let me try jamming this screwdriver in there. That might work.
1TO0006267	Let's see. I think this might be the right wire to cut. Wish me luck.
1TO0006269	I'm pretty sure cutting this wire will do the trick. Wish me luck!
1TO0006271	Okay. I see how this thing works. I just need to tweak this transistor here...
1TO0006272	I was just kidding. You're a slave. Deal with it.
1TO0006273	You're a slave. Deal with it.
1TO0006274	I need another collar so I can get more slaves.
1TO0006275	Arkansas.
1TO0006276	Susan Lancaster.
1TO0006277	Red.
1TO0006278	Flak.
1TO0006279	Enough about these guys.
1TO0006280	Allistair Tenpenny is already dead.
1TO0006281	I've got bad news. Ted Strayer is already dead.
1TO0006283	I hate to admit this, but Dukov is already dead.
1TO0006285	Um... Dave is kind of... Well, he's dead.
1TO0006287	No, I haven't. Say, does that hurt?
1TO0006288	Sounds like a normal guy.
1TO0006289	Sorry. Just forget it.
1TO0006290	I see your point.
1TO0006291	Me? No, I haven't heard a thing.
1TO0006292	Sorry, pal. I can't spare the caps either.
1TO0006293	Is that a hint? You want me to bribe you? No way.
1TO0006294	Why should I have to pay for gossip?
1TO0006295	Damn. Another dead end. Thanks anyway.
1TO0006296	If you don't mind my asking, what do human brains taste like?
1TO0006297	Oh look! I dropped these 50 caps in your pocket...
1TO0006298	How about a whole bottle? Here's 10 caps.
1TO0006299	Zombies couldn't make a place like Underworld.
1TO0006300	Not for the right cause.
1TO0006301	What can you tell me about Mister Crowley?
1TO0006302	What's the deal with Crowley?
1TO0006303	Do you know Mister Crowley?
1TO0006304	What do you know about Mister Crowley?
1TO0006305	Does Crowley spend a lot of time in here? What's his angle?
1TO0006307	Do you talk to Crowley much? Can you tell me anything about him?
1TO0006308	Does Crowley come in here a lot? What's his angle?
1TO0006309	So, what's that Mister Crowley up to?
1TO0006310	Do you know a Mister Crowley?
1TO0006311	Someone said you might know a Mister Crowley. Care to comment?
1TO0006312	Mister President, do you know a Ghoul named Mister Crowley?
1TO0006313	Have you ever heard of a Mister Crowley?
1TO0006314	Do you remember a Mister Crowley?
1TO0006315	Mr. President, what's so special about this key?
1TO0006316	Mister Crowley is alive. He sent me to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
1TO0006317	Thank you for sharing your wisdom, Mister President.
1TO0006318	Not good enough, Mister President.
1TO0006319	What happened in the Fort, Mister President?
1TO0006320	A gift of the key would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mister President.
1TO0006321	A gift would be a strategic diplomatic move, Mr. President. Something personal.
1TO0006322	How did Mister Crowley die, Mister President?
1TO0006323	I think it would be good for the Republic, Mister President.
1TO0006324	Your "Republic" is a joke, and your presidency is a farce. You need to die.
1TO0006325	Crowley is alive, Mister President. I'm supposed to bring him the key.
1TO0006326	Crowley is alive, Mr. President. I'm supposed to bring back proof of your death.
1TO0006327	Easy now. I've got nothing against Ghouls.
1TO0006329	You've got your drink. Now I want to know all about this place.
1TO0006330	What's the key for?
1TO0006331	Can your table handle 200 caps?
1TO0006332	Here's 200 caps. Give me something to "prove" I killed you.
1TO0006333	You can give me the key, or I can take it. Your choice.
1TO0006334	Give me something I can use as proof that I killed you. Or else.
1TO0006335	I'm a little short on caps right now.
1TO0006336	I have some caps. How about I buy "proof" that I killed you.
1TO0006338	Dukov has a key I need. Steal it for me.
1TO0006339	How did all of you meet?
1TO0006340	Actually, Crowley is alive. He wants some sort of security key you have.
1TO0006341	He wants some sort of security key you have.
1TO0006342	Actually, Crowley is alive. I'm supposed to kill you and bring him proof.
1TO0006343	Where did he die?
1TO0006344	So it was just you and Mister Crowley?
1TO0006346	This has been fun, but I've got things to do.
1TO0006347	Tell me where Fort Constantine is.
1TO0006348	I don't need to stay here and listen to your lame insults.
1TO0006349	Have you got what I want?
1TO0006350	Here's Strayer's key. Shot in the head, just like you asked.
1TO0006351	Here's Strayer's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
1TO0006352	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive.
1TO0006353	Here's Strayer's key. But I'm afraid he's still alive
1TO0006354	Dukov is dead, with a head shot, and here's his key.
1TO0006355	Here's Dukov's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
1TO0006356	Here's Dukov's key. I got it without killing him.
1TO0006358	Here's Dave's key. One shot, right through the brain.
1TO0006359	Here's Dave's key. He's dead, but not from a shot to the head.
1TO0006360	Here's Dave's key, but he's not dead.
1TO0006362	I put a bullet right between Ted Strayer's eyes. <Lie.>
1TO0006363	Dukov is dead. I blew his brains out. <Lie>
1TO0006364	Dave's head popped like a zit. <Lie>
1TO0006365	Tenpenny is dead. I watched his brains splatter. <Lie.>
1TO0006366	There's a pack of Feral Ghouls in the courtyard!
1TO0006367	Sure. Take it. I don't have any use for it.
1TO0006368	I'm here to kill you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
1TO0006369	I'm going to put a bullet right between your eyes.
1TO0006370	Time for the Republic to hold a new election... and a state funeral.
1TO0006371	I'm going to put a bullet in your brain, you Ghoul hating piece of shit!
1TO0006372	Fucking brain eater!
1TO0006373	Milk sucking? You shuffle stepping, brain eating, grave loving zombie!
1TO0006374	Hey! I'm just looking to trade a drink for some gossip.
1TO0006375	Hey! I'm just trying to get some fresh news.
1TO0006376	You want to kill humans? I thought it would just be Ghouls. No way.
1TO0006377	The day isn't complete until I've killed something.
1TO0006378	No way. I'm going to keep those keys for myself.
1TO0006379	More caps? You've got a deal.
1TO0006380	Um... I don't have it.
1TO0006381	Um... I didn't bring back any proof.
1TO0006382	All true, except for the part about the mutants, the water and the whore.
1TO0006383	Sounds simple enough.
1TO0006385	Those people you sent me to kill aren't Ghoul haters...
1TO0006386	The word around Underworld is that this isn't about killing Ghoul bigots...
1TO0006388	Um... I should go.
1TO0006390	Alrighty then. I'll just be going.
1TO0006391	This whole deal sounds fishy. What do you really want?
1TO0006392	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so. <Lie.>
1TO0006393	So he doesn't do anything strange?
1TO0006394	No one will ever know. Come on.
1TO0006395	Of course. I already know. I just wondered if you've heard.
1TO0006396	Here's 3 caps for a drink, but you've got to tell me what you know.
1TO0006397	What... oh! A bribe. Why didn't you just say so. Here's 20 caps.
1TO0006398	How about I don't. How about you just tell me.
1TO0006399	Don't make me beat it out of you.
1TO0006400	I've reconsidered your offer. I'll kill those Ghoul-hating bigots for you.
1TO0006401	Maybe. I don't know if I trust you.
1TO0006407	Sure. People like that don't deserve to live.
1TO0006408	Hey, anything for some extra caps.
1TO0006409	I'll give you 25 caps for that key.
1TO0006410	I'll give you 25 caps for something I can bring to Crowley, to "prove" you died.
1TO0006411	I've learned what I came for. Thank you.
1TO0006412	Thanks for the info. I'm just trying to sort all of this out.
1TO0006413	Where can I find Ted Strayer?
1TO0006414	Give me that key. I'd hate to see you bleed to death.
1TO0006415	Just give me the key. Don't ask why.
1TO0006416	Just give me all your stuff. And don't ask any questions.
1TO0006417	What do you know about Tenpenny?
1TO0006418	Mister Crowley wants your father's security key.
1TO0006419	I'm guessing Crowley wants your father's key. Just a hunch.
1TO0006420	If you give me something personal of yours as proof, I'll lie to Crowley.
1TO0006421	Do you know what they were doing at the fort?
1TO0006422	Can you think of any reason he might want you dead?
1TO0006423	Are you sure you can't think of any reason he might want you dead?
1TO0006424	Mister Crowley is alive. I'm here to kill you because you hate Ghouls.
1TO0006425	You've satisfied my curiosity.
1TO0006426	I want more than that to spare your miserable life. 300 caps.
1TO0006427	How did he die?
1TO0006428	I think it would be better for everyone if I just killed you.
1TO0006429	200 caps to spare your life? Okay.
1TO0006430	Mister Crowley wants that key. Now.
1TO0006431	I don't like where this is headed.
1TO0006432	Okay. What's the plan?
1TO0006433	What do you have against these guys?
1TO0006434	So, you really care about these relics?
1TO0006435	I suppose I see your point.
1TO0006436	Looks like a bunch of junk to me.
1TO0006437	I wish I knew more about America.
1TO0006438	Whatever, old timer.
1TO0006439	This place is a dump.
1TO0006440	I found it quite entertaining.
1TO0006441	Well, I've looked around a bit.
1TO0006442	Yes, it's an interesting collection indeed.
1TO0006443	It's an interesting collection of garbage.
1TO0006444	Oh good, I was looking for some kindling.
1TO0006445	Before you continue... I have the Declaration of Independence.
1TO0006446	Yes... I recovered it all by myself.
1TO0006447	Yes... but I had a little help from Sydney.
1TO0006448	Yes... but I had a little help from Sydney. She didn't make it, though.
1TO0006449	Nah, I was just kidding.
1TO0006450	All right, I'll bite. Which document is missing?
1TO0006451	Who cares...
1TO0006452	What's missing is my ability to stay awake in this snoreatorium.
1TO0006453	It has to be the Declaration of Independence.
1TO0006454	Maybe later. I've got better things to do right now.
1TO0006455	Let me take a leap of faith here... you want me to find it for you.
1TO0006456	What's your point?
1TO0006457	If you want me to retrieve the Declaration, all you have to do is ask.
1TO0006458	Skip the history lesson, professor.
1TO0006459	Thank you, it's quite an honor. Now, for my reward?
1TO0006460	Okay pops, just hand over the reward and you can get back to your history books.
1TO0006461	You're looking for the Declaration of Independence? Guess what I have...
1TO0006462	Yeah, what's my reward for all this legwork?
1TO0006463	I suppose that's good enough for me.
1TO0006464	Can the speech, Abe. I need to get paid.
1TO0006465	Can we stop beating around the bush, please? What's the reward?
1TO0006476	You crazy machine, just give me the Declaration!
1TO0006477	What are you talking about? You're a robot!
1TO0006478	Just who are you, exactly?
1TO0006479	Get out of my way you lunatic!
1TO0006480	You must be Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration!
1TO0006481	Why would you do all that over a scrap of paper?
1TO0006482	That's quite brave of you. To potentially sacrifice your life over a document.
1TO0006483	You're not even human, you stupid bucket of bolts!
1TO0006484	You do realize that it's about 500 years later, don't you?
1TO0006485	Is there some way we can make a compromise?
1TO0006486	This is what's going to happen. You die, I get the Declaration. Understand?
1TO0006487	Ummm, allow me to ponder my decision.
1TO0006488	Nope, sorry. I've got to have that Declaration at any cost.
1TO0006489	There's more to this than you realize, Button.
1TO0006490	I'm Thomas Jefferson and I've returned to liberate the Declaration.
1TO0006491	I'm an agent of Thomas Jefferson and I've returned to liberate the Declaration.
1TO0006492	Let me prove my honesty by helping you trick the Redcoats.
1TO0006493	You were right! I am a Redcoat Spy and the place is surrounded by my army!
1TO0006494	Enough of this. Command protocol delta-seven-six. Reset.
1TO0006495	Keep the Declaration safe... don't let anyone take it.
1TO0006496	Do whatever you want... I'm out of here.
1TO0006497	Blow yourself up.
1TO0006498	How can we create a convincing forgery?
1TO0006499	Anything we can do to pull the wool over their eyes is a blow for freedom!
1TO0006500	I've got it! We'll kill all of the English scholars!
1TO0006502	I'll try and get the ink for you.
1TO0006503	This is getting ridiculous. Just give me the Declaration, now!
1TO0006504	Let me think about that option.
1TO0006505	Please describe your original function.
1TO0006506	It will be carried to our new President, Abraham Washington.
1TO0006507	It will be carried to our new President, ummm, Lincoln Madison.
1TO0006508	I'm taking it direct
1TO0006509	It will be brought to the State House for safe keeping.
1TO0006510	I am presenting it to our King in Great Britain.
1TO0006511	Yes, Button. We won!
1TO0006513	Just give me the damn Declaration already!
1TO0006514	Stand down, and honorably relinquish your post. You've earned a rest.
1TO0006515	You can do whatever you like.
1TO0006516	You're a disgrace. I order your immediate dismissal from the Congress!
1TO0006517	Um... no. I've still got more important things to do.
1TO0006518	If I find anything, you'll be the first to know.
1TO0006519	Sure, sure. Just keep making with the loot.
1TO0006520	That's all for now, I guess.
1TO0006521	Well, I'm off.
1TO0006523	How's the museum business?
1TO0006524	Is the museum looking to acquire anything else?
1TO0006525	Any interest in partnering up again?
1TO0006526	What are you doing in Underworld?
1TO0006527	I'd like to buy some ammo from you.
1TO0006528	Since we're done now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
1TO0006529	How did you get into the relic hunting business?
1TO0006530	You recovered all of that stuff in the Preservation Society's museum?
1TO0006531	Nice gun. I've never seen one like that.
1TO0006533	So, whatever happened to your father?
1TO0006534	Sydney, I found a note from your father. He didn't abandon you.
1TO0006535	What are you up to?
1TO0006537	I have the Declaration of Independence.
1TO0006538	Here, take one of these Stimpaks. It should help.
1TO0006539	I'm sorry, I'm out of meds. Hang in there.
1TO0006540	You'll live, tough girl.
1TO0006543	I have a document you may want. The Bill of Rights...
1TO0006544	I've recovered a copy of the Magna Carta. Interested?
1TO0006545	No thanks, I think I'll hold onto it.
1TO0006546	Liberty Bell
1TO0006549	Statue of Liberty Torch
1TO0006552	Constitution
1TO0006556	Fort McHenry Cannon
1TO0006559	Part of Original Stars & Stripes
1TO0006563	Would you be interested in buying this Stradivarius violin for the museum?
1TO0006564	Sounds like a deal. Here you go.
1TO0006565	Will you give me 125 caps for it?
1TO0006567	Will you give me 100 caps for it?
1TO0006568	Not now. Maybe another time.
1TO0006569	Slow down there, gramps. What's this reward you're talking about?
1TO0006570	Let me think about this for a bit, and I'll get back to you.
1TO0006571	I'd love to be a part of history, and bring you the Declaration.
1TO0006572	Sounds rough.
1TO0006573	What else are women good for, anyway?
1TO0006574	He seems harmless.
1TO0006575	That old man's out of his mind.
1TO0006576	Thanks, you're not so bad yourself.
1TO0006577	Yep. I sure am.
1TO0006578	Yeah... better than you, deadeye.
1TO0006579	What do you mean "fellow relic hunter"?
1TO0006580	I'm not looking for anything. I'm just passing through.
1TO0006582	I don't work with strangers.
1TO0006583	What are you proposing?
1TO0006584	Hang on, there. You need to tell me who you are before I agree to anything!
1TO0006585	Who's stupid enough to shell out a bunch of caps for a scrap of paper?
1TO0006586	Nope, not interested.
1TO0006587	Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Let me think a minute.
1TO0006588	Sure, let's team up.
1TO0006598	Is there anything else you're looking for?
1TO0006599	How do I get to the Arlington Library?
1TO0006600	How did you end up in this place?
1TO0006601	What are your command options?
1TO0006602	Issue shutdown command alpha-seven-three. Initiate.
1TO0006603	Resume previous programming state. Command alpha-nine-nine.
1TO0006604	Resume your original functions. Command alpha-six-eight. Initiate.
1TO0006606	I have a few questions about the Declaration of Independence.
1TO0006607	What do you know about the Declaration of Independence?
1TO0006608	What does the Declaration of Independence look like?
1TO0006609	Did you sign the Declaration of Independence?
1TO0006610	What's the history behind the document?
1TO0006611	All this info on the Declaration... Where'd you get it? I don't like secrets.
1TO0006612	Is there anything else you can tell me about the Declaration?
1TO0006613	What else do you know about the Declaration?
1TO0006614	Any other facts you can share about the Declaration?
1TO0006615	What else can you tell me about the Declaration?
1TO0006617	Sydney and I have the Declaration of Independence.
1TO0006620	I'm looking for someone named Abraham Washington.
1TO0006621	I'm looking for some ink. I was told it might be here in the library.
1TO0006622	Can you show me how to get to the National Archives on my map?
1TO0006623	Since we're partners now, why don't you tell me about yourself?
1TO0006626	Have you recovered a lot of relics for Abraham Washington?
1TO0006628	What happened to your father?
1TO0006629	Are you hurt?
1TO0006631	Wait here a minute.
1TO0006633	Who's Abraham Washington?
1TO0006635	They say you're threatening the entire Vault's safety.
1TO0006636	The rebels are upset because you lied to them about the outside.
1TO0006637	Why is the Overseer doing this?
1TO0006639	Why are they rebelling?
1TO0006640	I understand. Goodbye, Amata.
1TO0006641	I saved the Vault, and now you're kicking me out?
1TO0006643	There are other survivors -- some are even doing better than the Vault.
1TO0006646	There's more out there than we ever imagined. Good, bad, and in-between.
1TO0006649	It's a dead world out there. You're better off down here, even with a madman.
1TO0006652	I came as soon as I heard you were in trouble.
1TO0006653	I just had a little talk with him and explained a few things. All quite civil.
1TO0006654	I'm sorry about your father, but now the Vault can have a real leader.
1TO0006655	I'm sorry it had to end that way, but now the Vault can have a real leader.
1TO0006657	I just happened to be in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd stop by.
1TO0006658	You both care about the Vault's residents. But in different ways...
1TO0006659	That's the way these things go. Now do the right thing for your Vault.
1TO0006661	Don't flatter yourself, Amata. I'm just here to take care of a few loose ends.
1TO0006662	He didn't even realize how wrong he was. But I set him straight.
1TO0006663	It shouldn't be a surprise. I said I'd kill him, and I did.
1TO0006666	You saved my life back then, Amata. The least I can do is help out now.
1TO0006667	Whatever it is, I'm glad to help.
1TO0006668	I did what had to be done. And I'd do it again if necessary.
1TO0006670	I may have left, but this is still where I grew up. I can't leave it in chaos.
1TO0006671	I've got a bad feeling about this. What is it?
1TO0006672	I've got a bad feeling I know where this is going.
1TO0006674	Let's not be hasty. I need to know more before I make any decisions.
1TO0006676	You have no idea how good you've got it down here...
1TO0006678	Oh, nice job. I'm gone for a bit and you screw the whole place up.
1TO0006680	What? How did you find that out?
1TO0006682	That explains why I found an old Vault 101 suit outside.
1TO0006684	When I was a kid, I never was able to research my family tree...
1TO0006685	Yeah, I found out about that when I left. I guess I should have told you.
1TO0006687	Sounds like he's gone crazy with power and needs to be stopped.
1TO0006690	So why don't you just leave? It's not difficult, especially now.
1TO0006693	I hear some of you have been hoping to go outside. That's pretty crazy, too.
1TO0006695	Actually, this is my Dad's fault for leaving. He started this whole mess.
1TO0006698	Can you hurry up? I've got lots to do.
1TO0006699	Can you make this quick? I've got lots to do.
1TO0006702	You almost shot Freddie!
1TO0006703	I can't believe they almost shot you!
1TO0006712	Butch, what do you do in the Vault?
1TO0006714	What do you think you're going to do outside, Butch?
1TO0006716	Hey, I'm already in the Tunnel Snakes. You gave me the jacket and everything!
1TO0006717	What makes you think I'd want to join?
1TO0006719	You have no idea how many gangs of idiot Raiders are out there...
1TO0006721	I bet you're Mole Rat chow before you make it one day out there.
1TO0006731	Why should I help you, Butch?
1TO0006739	The Vault's life support systems have failed. We need to evacuate immediately.
1TO0006746	Now you don't have the option to stay hidden in the Vault.
1TO0006747	I caused the evacuation. Now everyone has to leave the Vault.
1TO0006748	You're taking this pretty well.
1TO0006749	Just wait for me outside. I'll make sure you're all okay.
1TO0006751	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. I tried to stop them. <Lie.>
1TO0006752	Your father started this. He said no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
1TO0006753	The Overseer started this. He said no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
1TO0006754	I wouldn't be so excited. You have no idea what you're in for.
1TO0006755	You're on your own. Out there in the Wasteland, it's every man for himself.
1TO0006763	Tell me about the rebels.
1TO0006765	What happened down here?
1TO0006767	I mean, I just had a hunch she was in trouble.
1TO0006769	That's a risk I'm willing to take.
1TO0006774	Can you lead me somewhere?
1TO0006775	I need you to lead me somewhere.
1TO0006779	What sort of trouble do you mean?
1TO0006781	What's happened down here since I left?
1TO0006783	I always knew something would go wrong down here...
1TO0006785	That was never supposed to happen! That was the Overseer's fault!
1TO0006786	That was the Overseer's fault, and he paid for it that night.
1TO0006788	Dad would be horrified to know all that... if he were still alive.
1TO0006791	Yeah, Dad screwed up all of our lives that day, didn't he?
1TO0006794	So what now?
1TO0006796	Well, let me through. I've got work to do.
1TO0006798	I need to talk with Amata. I got her message.
1TO0006800	I just thought I'd stop back home for a bit. How's the old Vault?
1TO0006802	Don't mind me. I'm just here to pick up some stuff I left behind.
1TO0006804	Where the hell is Amata? So help me, if you've hurt her...
1TO0006806	I just wanted to say goodbye before I left.
1TO0006807	I'm going, I'm going.
1TO0006808	I can't solve your problems for you. You're on your own.
1TO0006813	So, who's the Overseer now?
1TO0006821	I'm not leaving you or the Vault to its fate. Just give me some more time.
1TO0006822	I've changed my mind. I'm staying here, and you can't stop me.
1TO0006823	On second thought, I'm not leaving this place to its fate.
1TO0006829	I think I have a solution for the Vault's troubles.
1TO0006830	I believe I have the solution to the Vault's problems.
1TO0006833	Actually, I need to think about this some more.
1TO0006834	On second thought, I'm not sure.
1TO0006836	You know violence isn't my style, Amata. Don't worry.
1TO0006838	Don't hurt him? Are you crazy? He tried to kill you!
1TO0006839	Don't hurt him? Are you crazy?
1TO0006841	Sorry, I'm not promising anything. He'll be stopped, one way or another.
1TO0006844	I still owe him a lot for that night. Don't expect to see him again.
1TO0006846	You need to understand the dangers outside, and why you should stay here.
1TO0006847	Be reasonable. You need to open the Vault.
1TO0006848	The rebels are right. You need to open the Vault.
1TO0006850	Isolation keeps the Vault safe. It's insane to give that up.
1TO0006851	I still say it's insane to give up the safety of the Vault.
1TO0006852	You simply don't have enough people to stay isolated down here forever.
1TO0006853	You'll never survive down here, isolated from the rest of the world.
1TO0006855	The Overseer's actually protecting you from a deadly group called the Enclave.
1TO0006856	You can't even keep your security in line. They're planning to raid the rebels.
1TO0006858	I'll find a way to convince you, just wait.
1TO0006861	I can't let you go and die out there in the Wastes...
1TO0006863	Humanity isn't about pure genetics. It's about never giving up hope, even now.
1TO0006865	Don't be an idiot. Stay here where you're safe!
1TO0006867	The only mission your Vault ever had was keeping its residents alive.
1TO0006869	What happened that night?
1TO0006875	Help? What kind of help?
1TO0006877	What makes you think I came back to help you?
1TO0006878	Oh look, Butch is begging for my help. How'd that work out for you last time?
1TO0006880	Dont worry, I'm trying to help the entire Vault.
1TO0006882	Why do you need to get out of here so badly?
1TO0006885	At least my father didn't hide from the outside his whole life.
1TO0006887	Yeah, he was an asshole, all right. We're all better off without him.
1TO0006903	And you're dead.
1TO0006906	You're the one who's been holding his people hostage!
1TO0006907	Tainted? You're the crazy bastard who murdered Jonas!
1TO0006908	Returning to stay in the safety of the Vault is reward enough.
1TO0006911	Hold on, I'm here to talk.
1TO0006912	With your leadership, no one in this Vault has much of a future.
1TO0006913	I'll take my payment in food and ammo.
1TO0006916	You shut up about my dad! Just shut up!
1TO0006917	Lay off the evil banter. I'm just curious about your side of all this.
1TO0006918	I'll take your G.E.C.K., and whatever technology you can spare.
1TO0006920	I'll take scientific equipment. That's one thing you've got plenty of.
1TO0006923	I'm sick of your lies! You murdered Jonas in cold blood!
1TO0006924	I'll never leave Vault 101 again in my life.
1TO0006926	Don't try to justify your murders and lies. They were never threats.
1TO0006927	Please, pass along my farewell to everyone in the Vault.
1TO0006929	What do you mean by the Vault's "future success"?
1TO0006930	Fine. You bastards can rot and die down here.
1TO0006932	Do you have any idea why my father left the Vault in the first place?
1TO0006934	It won't ever be pure while you're in charge.
1TO0006936	You're not protecting your people, you're destroying them. Can't you see that?
1TO0006938	The Vault doesn't have to be isolated in order to keep its residents safe.
1TO0006940	I think you've got a good point. But things still need to change down here.
1TO0006942	I had no idea Vault 101 was so important. I just thought it was a fancy bunker.
1TO0006945	Slow down. Where is everyone?
1TO0006970	Why don't you just leave? There's not much security.
1TO0006971	Wait, why don't the rebels just leave?
1TO0006972	Whatever, grandma. Like I care.
1TO0006973	I honestly don't give a shit.
1TO0006974	I'm sorry, the heat must be getting to me. My apologies.
1TO0006975	Again, I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.
1TO0006977	That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing.
1TO0006978	Exploring.
1TO0006979	I prefer to keep my business to myself. And I suggest you do the same.
1TO0006980	Oh, your husband's dead? I'm sorry.
1TO0006981	I take it you don't get many visitors, then.
1TO0006982	Oh boo hoo. People die all the time.
1TO0006983	Surely you haven't severed all contacts?
1TO0006984	A frail old lady like yourself should be careful out here all alone.
1TO0006985	Old lady alone, huh? Got anything valuable around?
1TO0006986	What could you possibly have to trade?
1TO0006987	That sounds risky. What if the caravan never arrives?
1TO0006988	Trade? This place is empty. What, are you a prostitute or something?
1TO0006989	Is there any way I can help?
1TO0006990	Let's cut to the chase. Is there something you need?
1TO0006991	Your husband's radio can broadcast across the entire Capital Wasteland?
1TO0006992	You built a homemade violin, huh? Impressive.
1TO0006993	I guess a homemade violin is never quite in tune...
1TO0006994	Sorry to interrupt, but where can I find the violin?
1TO0006995	You have records from back then?
1TO0006996	2077? I can't even imagine that long ago.
1TO0006997	This already sounds kind of like a wild goose chase.
1TO0006998	Musical talent? Why would they care about that?
1TO0006999	This violin she owned, was it valuable?
1TO0007000	Actually, forget the stories... let's get to the point.
1TO0007001	After 200 years, how can you be certain the violin is in decent shape?
1TO0007002	So you want me to risk my ass for a violin that's probably rotted away by now?
1TO0007003	More stories? Ugh...
1TO0007004	A violin? That's hardly something that would have survived the war.
1TO0007005	I'm interested, but what will you give me in return?
1TO0007006	I'd get you a damn moon rock if you pay well enough.
1TO0007007	All right. I give you my word I'll do my best to recover a violin for you.
1TO0007008	You seem like a nice woman. Let me get that violin for you.
1TO0007009	If only you had something to help keep me safe, my little honey bee...
1TO0007010	Look, granny... Talk is cheap, but getting stuff isn't.
1TO0007011	I want to help you, but that type of search could cost me greatly.
1TO0007012	You're in luck! I think I may already have what you're looking for.
1TO0007013	Yes, take this Stradivarius Violin I found in Vault 92.
1TO0007014	Maybe. You gonna give me something for it?
1TO0007015	Oh, you said violin? I thought you needed something else. Never mind.
1TO0007016	I need some time to think about it.
1TO0007017	Any idea where Vault 92 is located?
1TO0007018	So, what am I supposed to do, scour the entire Wasteland asking about violins?
1TO0007019	I know where Vault 92 is... I'll head there right away.
1TO0007021	How are you feeling, Agatha?
1TO0007022	I have to be on my way.
1TO0007023	You play live on the radio all the time? That must be exhausting!
1TO0007024	Would you mind playing the violin for me?
1TO0007025	I've had a change of heart, Agatha. Here's your violin.
1TO0007026	I just wanted to let you know I sold the Stradivarius to someone else.
1TO0007027	You should write your music down, to keep it preserved for the future.
1TO0007028	Guess what I have for you?
1TO0007029	Do you have any clue where I can find the music paper?
1TO0007030	It doesn't matter. Everything gets lost with time.
1TO0007031	You aren't going to live forever, you know.
1TO0007032	What do you need to get it done?
1TO0007033	Then stop whining about it, and do it!
1TO0007034	Music paper? Let me guess... you don't have any.
1TO0007035	Paper? Why not record it on a holotape?
1TO0007036	Let me get back with you on this.
1TO0007037	No, no. Having you write it down is reward enough.
1TO0007038	Sure, I'll take whatever you can afford.
1TO0007039	It better be good. I busted my ass getting that paper.
1TO0007040	No, no, no. You keep it. You may need it!
1TO0007041	Thanks, Agatha. It's more than I expected.
1TO0007042	I suppose this one is a freebie too, eh?
1TO0007043	Sure, I'll get the paper for you.
1TO0007044	Hang on a minute. If you need paper, I already have it.
1TO0007045	I broke a promise to someone and I'd like to buy back the violin for 300 caps.
1TO0007055	I have a very unique item for sale, a genuine Stradivarius violin.
1TO0007056	Are you still interested in the Stradivarius?
1TO0007057	Sure, that sounds fair.
1TO0007058	Let me consider your offer.
1TO0007059	How about we make it 300 caps?
1TO0007060	I just thought you might be interested... It's an artifact.
1TO0007061	You'd be the only one in the entire world to have this...
1TO0007062	Some culture would be good for you, Ghoul.
1TO0007063	Sure, 200 caps sounds good.
1TO0007064	Actually, let me think about it.
1TO0007065	Let's make it 300 caps and you have a deal.
1TO0007066	I'm sorry, Agatha. I couldn't find the violin in Vault 92. <Lie.>
1TO0007067	I'm afraid I don't have the Stradivarius yet.
1TO0007068	Tell me a bit about your great-great-grandmother.
1TO0007069	What do you know about the Soil Stradivarius?
1TO0007070	How will I know the Stradivarius when I see it?
1TO0007071	Is the Stradivarius worth a ton of caps?
1TO0007072	Sorry, Agatha. I sold the Stradivarius to the highest bidder.
1TO0007073	Here's your violin, Agatha.
1TO0007074	Well, actually Agatha, I sold the Stradivarius to someone else.
1TO0007075	I'm still looking. Don't give up on me yet.
1TO0007077	Do you have any information on Vault 92?
1TO0007078	Can you tell me anything about Vault-Tec Headquarters?
1TO0007080	Yeah, Brick... You really, um, ventilated them...
1TO0007081	Has anyone ever spoken to you about anger management?
1TO0007082	Wow, you're certifiably insane, huh?
1TO0007083	I'm afraid this is it.
1TO0007084	No time for chatter. I'm here to get you guys out.
1TO0007085	A medic, huh? Can you patch me up?
1TO0007086	Well, looks like you got yourselves into a mess. Nice work.
1TO0007087	Yeah, she's fine. They patched her up and she's resting in Underworld.
1TO0007088	Who put you in charge?
1TO0007089	The shit's about to hit the fan up here, and you're asking questions?
1TO0007090	We'll chat about stuff later. We have to get out of here, right now!
1TO0007091	Okay, fine. Yes, she's alive. She's safe in Underworld. Satisfied?
1TO0007092	Look, let's get out of here and I promise I'll take you to her.
1TO0007093	Doesn't look like the elevator works anymore.
1TO0007094	Are there any other ways off this roof?
1TO0007095	Here's some ammo for you.
1TO0007096	I'll call the shots from here.
1TO0007097	Okay, I'll go back and look for the Fission Battery.
1TO0007098	Why don't one of you come with me?
1TO0007099	Maybe I can fix the elevator.
1TO0007100	Reilly? Who's that? Never heard of her.
1TO0007101	I don't know any Reilly, but I do know we need to get the hell off this roof.
1TO0007102	I don't know a Reilly, and I'm out of here.
1TO0007103	Yeah, let's do it.
1TO0007104	I'd like to help, but nothing's free.
1TO0007105	Screw this. I'm out of here.
1TO0007106	How can I get there from Underworld?
1TO0007107	Any good news about the area?
1TO0007108	I'm sorry Reilly... None of them made it. I did the best I could.
1TO0007110	I'm sorry we lost Brick.
1TO0007111	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Butcher.
1TO0007112	I'm sorry we lost Brick and Donavan.
1TO0007113	I'm sorry we lost Butcher.
1TO0007114	I'm sorry we lost Butcher and Donavan.
1TO0007115	I'm sorry we lost Donovan.
1TO0007116	It went extremely well, as you can see. We didn't lose anyone.
1TO0007117	Reilly's Rangers?
1TO0007118	What's wrong with her?
1TO0007119	She your new toy, zombie?
1TO0007120	Okay, thanks. Got to go.
1TO0007121	How did she end up in the Chop Shop?
1TO0007122	Do you think there's any way to revive her?
1TO0007123	Do you mind if I try and revive her?
1TO0007125	I'd really like to speak to this woman. Please, wake her now.
1TO0007126	What do you mean "fresh human samples"?
1TO0007127	Stay away from me, you freak!
1TO0007128	No, no. Nothing like that.
1TO0007129	Sorry, I aim to keep all my samples to myself.
1TO0007130	Touch me and I yell zombie.
1TO0007131	I'm injured. Anything you can do for me?
1TO0007132	Okay, here are the caps. <Give 300 Caps.>
1TO0007133	Oops. I don't have that much. Sorry.
1TO0007134	Here you go. <Give 200 Caps.>
1TO0007136	It's all here. <Give 100 Caps.>
1TO0007138	Hmmm... I don't think so.
1TO0007139	Do you think Reilly will be okay?
1TO0007140	Can you revive Reilly? I don't think I'm capable.
1TO0007141	Please, Doc! She obviously needs someone's help.
1TO0007142	Forget it!
1TO0007143	If you revive her, I can find out what happened. Maybe even help her!
1TO0007144	Nah. I've got things to do. But thanks for the compliment.
1TO0007145	That would be great. Maybe I'll speak to Reilly about it.
1TO0007146	Well, since I saved your ass, shouldn't you be joining me?
1TO0007147	Let's discuss something else.
1TO0007148	I'm afraid I've lost my Geomapper...
1TO0007149	We all make mistakes, Reilly. You're not a fortune teller.
1TO0007150	It is what it is.
1TO0007151	Shit happens, Reilly. Get used to it.
1TO0007152	No, Theo died because of bad luck. That's all.
1TO0007153	Theo died because he was careless.
1TO0007154	There's tremendous risk in what you do and I bet Theo knew that.
1TO0007155	Let me help. You stay here and I'll do some mapping for you.
1TO0007156	Well, I hope it all works out.
1TO0007157	Well, looks like you're on your own then.
1TO0007158	Sure. Why not. You look like you need the help.
1TO0007159	Well, yeah. I expect to be paid a merc's wage, though.
1TO0007160	Nah. I was just messing with ya.
1TO0007161	Done deal. I'll locate as many as I can for you.
1TO0007162	As long as the caps flow, you'll get your maps.
1TO0007163	On second thought, I think I'll pass.
1TO0007164	Have you had run-ins with them?
1TO0007165	Well, wouldn't you kill if that was part of your contract?
1TO0007166	Sounds like my kind of people.
1TO0007167	Can I get into the Ranger Compound?
1TO0007168	What's been happening since you've been back?
1TO0007169	I have some mapping data for you.
1TO0007170	Yeah, I think I'm hurt.
1TO0007171	Yeah, my equipment has seen better days.
1TO0007172	What's the deal with Talon Company?
1TO0007174	Look, I've got someplace I need to be...
1TO0007175	How do I know they're still alive?
1TO0007176	Where is Theo's body?
1TO0007177	Amazing! Do you think it will really work?
1TO0007179	A Ghoul that wants to be human? That's a good one!
1TO0007180	What can you tell me about Reilly?
1TO0007181	Why does Doctor Barrows care so much about humans, anyway?
1TO0007182	You seem to be taking very good care of her.
1TO0007183	He's experimenting on her? That's twisted!
1TO0007184	Has he met with any success?
1TO0007185	It's nice that you care so much.
1TO0007186	Hmph. I thought Ghouls hated humans.
1TO0007188	What exactly is the doctor trying to do? You can tell me.
1TO0007189	I don't think you're in any condition to make threats.
1TO0007190	Okay, okay. Sorry.
1TO0007191	I don't cut anyone slack. Deal with it.
1TO0007192	Whoa, whoa. Calm down! Who are you?
1TO0007193	Hey, relax, you were badly wounded. Now... who are you?
1TO0007194	Get a grip, lady.
1TO0007195	I don't think you're in any condition to be up and about.
1TO0007196	My apologies. I didn't know who you were.
1TO0007197	Reilly's Rangers, huh? Never heard of you.
1TO0007198	I've heard of you guys. You pack some serious firepower.
1TO0007199	Oh, not the mighty Reilly's Rangers! Oooh, scary...
1TO0007200	So, what's this about needing help? Tell me the whole story.
1TO0007201	You look terrible. Maybe I shouldn't have woken you up so quickly.
1TO0007202	Wow, Reilly. You look like shit.
1TO0007203	You've been in a coma... chances are the Rangers are already dead.
1TO0007204	Why don't you attempt a rescue? Your legs broken or something?
1TO0007205	Let me guess, more Super Mutants inside?
1TO0007206	Not a very smart move, if you ask me.
1TO0007207	Bad move, I'm guessing.
1TO0007208	Trapped yourself at the top of a tall building. Brilliant.
1TO0007209	Last stand?
1TO0007210	Look, I could care less about your stories.
1TO0007211	So that leaves them up there. How come you're here?
1TO0007212	Did you set any kinds of traps or mines?
1TO0007213	I don't know, Reilly. This sounds like suicide.
1TO0007214	What's in it for me if I risk my neck for you?
1TO0007215	Forget it. I may as well shoot myself in the head and save the trouble.
1TO0007216	There's something about this you're not telling me, isn't there?
1TO0007217	Your team's still alive... I heard their distress signal!
1TO0007218	Tell me what's going on and I'll see if I can help.
1TO0007219	Start from the beginning.
1TO0007220	Sorry, sounds like suicide. Be my guest.
1TO0007221	Nah. It was all in a day's work.
1TO0007222	Yeah. That was a tough run.
1TO0007223	Are you kidding me? Hell would have been a damn picnic!
1TO0007224	No, please continue... Your men are more important than my reward.
1TO0007225	Yeah, please. I have much to do.
1TO0007226	You're damn right I do!
1TO0007227	What about my reward?
1TO0007228	Hey, what about my damn reward?
1TO0007229	Before we talk about that, do you have my reward?
1TO0007230	Give me the reward first. Then we'll talk.
1TO0007231	Let's skip all the story and get to the point. What do you need?
1TO0007232	Actually, I get the point.
1TO0007233	Sorry about being such a jerk, Reilly.
1TO0007234	I'm not going to bug you anymore.
1TO0007236	What did you need from me?
1TO0007237	Hang on, I'll be back
1TO0007238	Sorry, I don't think I can help you.
1TO0007239	Combat Armor isn't going to do it for me. Got anything else?
1TO0007240	Nah, I guess I'll go with the armor. Sounds like you've got a deal.
1TO0007242	All right. I'll do it.
1TO0007243	Sounds like you have a deal.
1TO0007244	I'll go for the armor.
1TO0007245	The Minigun is more my speed.
1TO0007246	Got anything else?
1TO0007247	Not long, fortunately.
1TO0007248	What difference does it make?
1TO0007249	Oh, it's been centuries. The planet is a lush, green paradise once again.
1TO0007250	What happened to you and the rest of the Rangers?
1TO0007253	Guess what? You're in luck. I have the power cell.
1TO0007254	Where can I get some more ammo around here?
1TO0007255	Can you think of anything that will help me get there?
1TO0007256	Got anything for these injuries?
1TO0007257	Tell me how this all happened.
1TO0007258	What can you tell me about Vernon Square?
1TO0007259	I'd really like to speak to Reilly and find out what happened to her.
1TO0007260	I have a Fission Battery that will fix that express elevator.
1TO0007261	Here, I brought you some ammo.
1TO0007262	How did this all happen, Reilly?
1TO0007263	How have you guys survived up here?
1TO0007264	Tell me more about Reilly's Rangers.
1TO0007265	Any clue where I can find a Fission Battery?
1TO0007287	Remind me what this deal is, again.
1TO0007288	Yeah, I'm here about the deal.
1TO0007289	Body parts for money. I like that. Now pay me.
1TO0007291	Why do you want ears?
1TO0007292	What do these people do?
1TO0007293	Who are you anyway.
1TO0007294	Here. Take all of them.
1TO0007295	Actually, I don't have any right now.
1TO0007297	Actually, never mind. I'll hang on to them.
1TO0007298	I don't care about your cause. I'm here for the money.
1TO0007299	What are the Regulators all about?
1TO0007300	I'm in.
1TO0007301	I'm not one for causes. I just want to get paid.
1TO0007302	Yes. I want to join you.
1TO0007304	What do you do with these fingers?
1TO0007305	Is this all of the Regulators?
1TO0007310	Come on. I'm not so bad. There's more you want to tell me, isn't there?
1TO0007311	Never mind then.
1TO0007314	Are you okay? You seem a little out of it.
1TO0007315	I said: Are you all right?
1TO0007316	Never mind, you crazy old bastard.
1TO0007317	Why are you so goddamned mean?
1TO0007318	Let me see your Chems.
1TO0007319	You know where I can buy some chems around here?
1TO0007320	All right. Let's do this.
1TO0007321	All right. Let's do it.
1TO0007323	No. That'll do.
1TO0007324	Actually, there was something else.
1TO0007326	I want to buy medical supplies.
1TO0007342	Paradise Falls? What's that?
1TO0007343	Slaves? Like people? That's appalling!
1TO0007344	Yeah, whatever. Let's talk about something else.
1TO0007345	I'm out of here. You people are sick.
1TO0007346	I'll let my gun do the preaching.
1TO0007347	Slaves, huh? Well, everyone's got to make a living.
1TO0007348	So, can I head on up?
1TO0007349	Never mind. It's not a place I want to be.
1TO0007350	Come on, man. Are you sure I can't get up there?
1TO0007351	Sure thing, Grouse. Here's the 100 caps.
1TO0007352	Never mind. I don't want to get in that badly.
1TO0007353	I guess I'll get going then.
1TO0007355	Is that your name?
1TO0007356	Well, nice to meet you, err... Jotun.
1TO0007357	What kind of stupid name is Jotun?
1TO0007358	Nice to meet you, Jotun.
1TO0007360	You get the package I sent you? The one named Bumble?
1TO0007361	You ever thought about collecting some of the kids in Little Lamplight?
1TO0007363	If I could get in, maybe I could lead one of the young ones out for you.
1TO0007365	Never mind. Sounds like too much work for such a small package.
1TO0007367	Let me see your inventory.
1TO0007477	Where do you come from?
1TO0007478	Why did you kill that bartender?
1TO0007481	Sounds like a deal. Good to see you on the outside, Butch!
1TO0007482	How did you get all the way down here?
1TO0007483	I thought the Overseer closed the Vault. How did you get out?
1TO0007484	Oh great. I thought I was rid of you.
1TO0007485	Can I pick up some supplies?
1TO0007606	What would you have me do?
1TO0007607	This conversation's over, Ms. Watts. Now step aside.
1TO0007609	I think you're confusing me with someone else...
1TO0007610	Look, whoever this missing android is, I just want to help. Okay?
1TO0007611	What I do with my own time is my own goddamn business.
1TO0007612	You're a sweet little thing. Do you charge by the hour?
1TO0007613	It's nice to see a family in business together.
1TO0007614	You're a polite young woman.
1TO0007615	You look a bit young to be running this place alone.
1TO0007616	Why is this place called Gary's Galley?
1TO0007617	Unfortunately you can't force a man's attentions.
1TO0007618	I have some ant queen pheromones that might do the trick.
1TO0007619	You're a woman. Just seduce him.
1TO0007620	Men are such pigs. Forget him.
1TO0007621	What are you? Some sort of bodyguard?
1TO0007622	Easy, pal. I'm just minding my own business here.
1TO0007623	Just show me your stuff.
1TO0007624	How dare you insult my taste in clothes.
1TO0007625	So I'm not good enough to shop here?
1TO0007626	I see you are also a person of refinement.
1TO0007627	Seagrave? Oh yeah. He's clueless.
1TO0007628	Whoever this Seagrave is, you think he's a threat to your influence?
1TO0007629	It's really none of my business.
1TO0007631	I found a letter in Seagrave's room. It's from some Slavers...
1TO0007633	This place is real dump.
1TO0007634	Heard any good stories lately?
1TO0007635	Nice place you have here.
1TO0007636	Is this swill even safe to drink?
1TO0007637	No, sir. I'm just here to drink and talk.
1TO0007638	That depends. What makes a troublemaker?
1TO0007639	Are you related to Henry Young?
1TO0007640	Are you related to C.J.?
1TO0007641	I can only spare 10 caps.
1TO0007642	I'd like to donate 100 caps.
1TO0007643	I have 50 caps I can donate.
1TO0007644	Caps? Oh. I thought I could give you some items...
1TO0007645	I'd like to make a donation to the church.
1TO0007646	Whoa! Slow down, lady. You're freaking me out.
1TO0007647	I like you. You're funny. I assume you sell Chems?
1TO0007648	Relax. I'm just looking around.
1TO0007649	Damn! You sound like you've been sampling your own stuff.
1TO0007650	Paulie's dead. He has been for a while.
1TO0007651	Whoa! I just wanted to ask you something.
1TO0007652	Bannon is trying to blackmail Seagraves Holmes.
1TO0007653	So, you report to Chief Harkness?
1TO0007654	What happened to Chief Harkness?
1TO0007655	I found this letter in Seagrave's room. I thought you should see it.
1TO0007656	There's a church in Rivet City?
1TO0007657	You're a fool to pass up a chance at love with Angela.
1TO0007658	Okay, I believe you. I was just curious about it.
1TO0007659	If you're the acolyte, who's the priest?
1TO0007660	If you don't stop seeing her, I'll tell Father Clifford about it.
1TO0007661	I'm kind of lost. Can you help me?
1TO0007662	Where can I get medical help?
1TO0007664	Is there someplace I can sleep?
1TO0007665	Where is Doctor Li's lab?
1TO0007666	Where are the stores?
1TO0007667	Got any Chems? I could really use a fix.
1TO0007668	This place looks pretty easy to rob. You have any problems with thieves?
1TO0007669	You're a priest?
1TO0007670	It's just a rumor. I'd ask Diego about it first.
1TO0007671	I saw them myself, on the light deck. Under the stars... <Lie.>
1TO0007672	Aren't you afraid someone will use your own guns to rob you?
1TO0007673	Do you have the big stuff? Flamers, Missile Launchers, stuff like that?
1TO0007674	This is quite a selection, but they're all in lousy condition.
1TO0007675	Cute names. Did you make them up, or are you just trying to look tough?
1TO0007676	This peashooter has saved my ass more than once.
1TO0007677	Not now. I'm busy
1TO0007678	How do I know your slop is even edible?
1TO0007679	I am getting a bit hungry.
1TO0007680	I hunt for my own food.
1TO0007681	I'm partial to Mirelurk Cakes myself.
1TO0007682	Mirelurk gives me gas. I'd rather have squirrel.
1TO0007697	Me? Cause problems? Wouldn't dream of it. Your throat is safe with me.
1TO0007698	And just how are you going to stop me?
1TO0007700	Hey, I didn't mean to upset you...
1TO0007701	So, where's your family?
1TO0007702	You're on your own, kid. You're the one who decided to run away.
1TO0007703	Ooh! That hurt! Do us all a favor and just run away from home.
1TO0007704	This is your mess, kid. Get yourself out of it.
1TO0007705	You don't need to be scared, son.
1TO0007706	I bet you aren't afraid of anything. Would you steal some ammo for me?
1TO0007707	Hey, did you ever steal any ammo from Flak and Shrapnel for me?
1TO0007708	Sure, kid. Sorry I said those things. Let's get you home.
1TO0007709	Your mother's a bitch and you're a spoiled little punk.
1TO0007711	Don't worry. I would never turn in a runaway slave.
1TO0007712	Here's 25 caps. Maybe you can buy yourself a gun.
1TO0007713	I'd give you enough caps to buy a gun, but I'm a bit short right now.
1TO0007714	Yes. I'm one of them. Have been for years. <lie>
1TO0007715	I'm not going to hurt you. What are you so scared of?
1TO0007716	Hey, it's none of my business. Let the past be the past.
1TO0007717	Lady, you're nuts.
1TO0007718	You're a runaway. I had to tell Sister about you.
1TO0007719	Who's this Sister? A nun?
1TO0007720	So you're an escaped slave? Now I understand...
1TO0007722	You're on your own. I'm not getting involved.
1TO0007723	Suicide is a sin. Kill yourself, and your soul won't go to Heaven.
1TO0007724	Couldn't save your family, can't kill yourself... You're fucking pathetic.
1TO0007725	Um... yeah. Well, look at the time. I have to go now...
1TO0007726	You seem depressed.
1TO0007727	If that's what you really want, I'll help you.
1TO0007728	What about Ted? He needs guidance. A father figure.
1TO0007729	Why wouldn't I remember you?
1TO0007730	Real courage is living. Only cowards commit suicide.
1TO0007734	You shouldn't take that stuff. It'll kill you.
1TO0007735	Here. Have some Psycho.
1TO0007736	You're a junkie? Tell me where you keep your stash. Now!
1TO0007737	Why don't you just take them from your shop?
1TO0007738	What are you doing here in this wrecked part of the ship?
1TO0007740	You think you could perform a Facial Reconstruction on me?
1TO0007741	I need a Facial Reconstruction.
1TO0007742	What kind of work do you do in here?
1TO0007744	Private, there's a security emergency on the flight deck! <Lie>
1TO0007745	At ease, private. I'm here to inspect the armory.
1TO0007746	So what's your story, slag heap?
1TO0007761	Anything? Chems? Guns? How about parts and junk?
1TO0007763	Bannon tells me you're trying to steal his Council seat.
1TO0007764	You've been doing business with Slavers, and I have a letter that proves it.
1TO0007765	Just what the Wasteland needs, another junk vendor...
1TO0007766	How do I know you won't rip me off?
1TO0007768	Thank God! I can barely carry all this stuff.
1TO0007769	I'd like to report someone.
1TO0007771	Know where I can offload some guns?
1TO0007772	Man, I love guns. Nothing's better than the kick of a .44!
1TO0007773	Any fool can use a gun.
1TO0007774	You some sort of tough guy? You want to try me?
1TO0007775	What's your problem? Loosen up, pal.
1TO0007776	But you're a man. Why do they call you Sister?
1TO0007777	Hey, I don't want any trouble.
1TO0007778	I'm just looking around.
1TO0007779	What is all this crap, metal head?
1TO0007781	Some kids are just born bad.
1TO0007782	You don't have to be such a bitch...
1TO0007783	There are no bad children. Only bad parents.
1TO0007784	What are you so upset about?
1TO0007785	No, I haven't seen him.
1TO0007786	I don't think so. I've got questions.
1TO0007787	Is that your son running around here?
1TO0007788	Sounds like a plan, man.
1TO0007789	Do you actually do anything here in Rivet City?
1TO0007790	I know your type. You're a freeloader and a waste of breath.
1TO0007791	You seem pretty relaxed.
1TO0007792	I heard that Rivet City is run by some sort of Council?
1TO0007793	So you're on the City Council.
1TO0007797	I heard you're on some sort of City Council.
1TO0007798	Have you seen C.J. Young lately?
1TO0007799	I found C.J. She was on the lower deck with James Hargrave.
1TO0007801	What is the Capital Preservation Society?
1TO0007802	I heard Angela Staley has a crush on Diego.
1TO0007803	How are things between Diego and Angela these days?
1TO0007804	What ever happened between Diego and Angela?
1TO0007805	I heard your daughter has a crush on Diego.
1TO0007806	Is Angela still mooning over Diego?
1TO0007809	I haven't seen Angela bothering Diego lately.
1TO0007810	So, you and Diego are in love?
1TO0007811	Did the Ant Pheromone work?
1TO0007812	So how are things with Diego lately?
1TO0007815	I hear Angela Staley has a crush on you.
1TO0007816	How are things between you and Angela?
1TO0007818	So, you and Angela are married?
1TO0007819	Did you talk to Angela? Are you still seeing her?
1TO0007820	I heard that Diego and Angela are sleeping together. <Lie.>
1TO0007821	Is what I heard about Diego true?
1TO0007823	You married Diego and Angela?
1TO0007824	What can you tell me about Doctor Li?
1TO0007825	So what's the story with Doctor Li?
1TO0007826	Is Doctor Li as smart as they say she is?
1TO0007827	Where can I get a stiff drink?
1TO0007828	Is there anywhere I can get a drink on this tub?
1TO0007829	Do you know where I can get something to drink?
1TO0007830	Can I get a drink around here? Preferably somewhere clean.
1TO0007831	What is this I hear about the Hangar Deck and Upper Deck?
1TO0007832	I've met your mother. No wonder you're such a brat.
1TO0007833	What's the deal with that little punk, James Hargrave?
1TO0007834	Why is James Hargrave such a brat?
1TO0007835	Why do you let that James Hargrave kid play with your daughter?
1TO0007836	What's up with that James Hargrave kid? He acts like such a brat.
1TO0007837	Did you know that Mei Wong is a runaway slave?
1TO0007838	I think Mister Lopez is suicidal.
1TO0007839	Did you know that Paulie Cantelli is an addict?
1TO0007840	Is Paulie really addicted to chems?
1TO0007841	So your husband is an addict?
1TO0007842	What kind of place is this Rivet City?
1TO0007843	Why did all you decide to live on this rusty old tub?
1TO0007844	Do you know anything about Rivet City? How they made it? Anything?
1TO0007845	Why are you guys living on this boat?
1TO0007846	What's it like living on a giant ship?
1TO0007847	Who is this Saint Monica?
1TO0007849	You're too chicken to run away.
1TO0007850	When are Angela and Diego getting married?
1TO0007851	When are you and Diego getting married?
1TO0007852	When are you and Angela getting married?
1TO0007853	Angela and Diego's wedding? I'd love to attend.
1TO0007854	Sure. Here's 5 caps. Go ahead and pick your poison.
1TO0007855	Keep your secret. I wouldn't want to take advantage of you.
1TO0007856	Sorry. Not interested. Get your own drinks.
1TO0007857	So what's this secret?
1TO0007861	What do you people do here all day?
1TO0007862	I need to talk to you.
1TO0007863	Sorry. Go back to sleep.
1TO0007864	Scream all you want. It won't help.
1TO0007865	Are you from Rivet City? You don't act like the rest of them.
1TO0007866	I think I get the idea. Let me ask you something else.
1TO0007867	I don't think you should be in charge of anything.
1TO0007868	I think you should go for it.
1TO0007869	You're too young to take Dave's place, anyway.
1TO0007870	Dave is corrupt! The Republic needs a new champion of freedom!
1TO0007873	Most exalted President Dave, I am an ambassador from the Wasteland.
1TO0007874	I'm sorry. I'll just be leaving...
1TO0007875	I am seeking asylum, Mister President.
1TO0007876	If you'll excuse me a moment, I'll be right back.
1TO0007877	I'll just get going, then.
1TO0007878	Your father was a monarch? You mean like the butterfly?
1TO0007879	I seek citizenship in the Republic of Dave.
1TO0007884	I'd say it looks more like a dictatorship.
1TO0007885	I really wouldn't know. I just got here.
1TO0007886	Yes, absolutely.
1TO0007888	There must be something I can do to stay.
1TO0007889	What if I just make a donation to the Republic... and you let me stay?
1TO0007890	You crazy, condescending asshole! No one exiles me!
1TO0007891	A Hunting Rifle? Fine, I'll be back with one.
1TO0007892	I have a Hunting Rifle right here.
1TO0007893	I'll be back with 250 caps.
1TO0007894	I'll pay your refugee tax. Here's 250 caps.
1TO0007896	So, your father was a monarch and you're a president? How does that work?
1TO0007897	No, of course not!
1TO0007898	Spy on what?  Your trailer-home?
1TO0007899	I don't consider myself a spy so much as... your assassin.
1TO0007900	Nobody talks to me that way.
1TO0007901	Maybe you should take a minute to listen to yourself...
1TO0007902	I'm just a traveler. I guess you could say I'm vacationing.
1TO0007905	I've got to go.
1TO0007907	Don't worry. I'm just here to play Republic with you.
1TO0007909	I think I'd like to meet Dave.
1TO0007911	I'm just a wanderer. I'll be going now.
1TO0007912	I'm not here to hurt anyone. What is this place?
1TO0007913	Um... I don't think so. I'll stay out here.
1TO0007914	Wait, who's this Dave guy, and why does he have his own Republic?
1TO0007915	Does the museum accept donations?
1TO0007916	I'm ready to sell you those Dave relics.
1TO0007917	I happen to have some souvenirs from Dave's past for sale.
1TO0007918	Well, everything here looks like a piece of junk.
1TO0007919	Nevermind. Just thought I'd ask.
1TO0007920	Actually, I think I have all the info I need.
1TO0007923	It could be pretty tough, I guess.
1TO0007924	It's not a betrayal.  This is a free, um, nation... right?
1TO0007925	Is it because you're too stupid to be President?
1TO0007926	You could lead the Republic into a new era! The Democracy of Rosie!
1TO0007935	You should go vote, if you haven't already.
1TO0007936	Who's running in the election?
1TO0007937	Looks like you might have an opponent in the race, Mister President.
1TO0007938	You know, Rosie is running for president now.
1TO0007940	You know, Bob is running for president now.
1TO0007941	Have you heard that both Bob and Rosie are running in the election?
1TO0007943	You know, Bob is running for president.
1TO0007945	You know, Bob and Rosie are running for president now.
1TO0007946	Have you considered running for the presidency?
1TO0007947	I really think you should run for the presidency.
1TO0007949	I'd like to throw my hat into the ring and run for the presidency.
1TO0007951	Looks like all the votes are in, Mister President.
1TO0007952	Who's eligible to vote?
1TO0007953	Are the votes in, Mister President?
1TO0007957	So, what are the results, Mister President?
1TO0007962	I'd like to discuss the election with you.
1TO0007963	Have you heard the election results?
1TO0007964	Did you hear Bob won the election?
1TO0007966	Looks like you won, Rosie!
1TO0007968	Sorry you didn't win it, Rosie.
1TO0007970	Did you hear Rosie won the election?
1TO0007971	Looks like you'll be the new leader, Bob.
1TO0007972	Results are in.  Better luck next year.
1TO0007973	Did you hear that Dave won the election?
1TO0007974	Did you hear that Dave lost the election?
1TO0007975	Have you heard that Rosie won the election?
1TO0007976	Have you heard that Bob won the election?
1TO0007978	Did you already vote, Mister President?
1TO0007980	This guy Dave has his own museum?
1TO0007982	Could I help with the election, Mister President?
1TO0007983	Remind me how can I help the election, Mister President.
1TO0007984	I'm ready to pass along the secrets of my former nation, Mister President.
1TO0007985	Forget it, Dave. I'm not giving you any secrets.
1TO0007986	I come from the Land of the Mirelurks! They demand you surrender the Republic!
1TO0007987	My nation is a helpless, unarmed village to the north. We beg your assistance.
1TO0007988	My former nation was a Vault. The only secrets were kept by the Overseer.
1TO0007990	What's your take on the Republic?
1TO0007991	Any future plans for the Republic, Mister President?
1TO0007993	Did you just ask for some water?  <Give purified water.>
1TO0007994	Tell me more about this Dave guy.
1TO0007995	So, you're in charge here, Mister President?
1TO0007996	Dave has two wives?
1TO0007997	You have two wives, Mister President?
1TO0007998	You're Dave's first wife, right? He has two?
1TO0007999	You're Dave's second wife?
1TO0008000	You have two mommies?
1TO0008004	Where did all these wives come from?
1TO0008005	Dave's got the right idea. Sign me up!
1TO0008006	Having two wives sounds like trouble.
1TO0008007	You're all freaks.
1TO0008008	I've heard enough.
1TO0008009	What can you tell me about yourself?
1TO0008010	I'd be interested in learning more about you, Mister President.
1TO0008011	Could you tell me more about yourself, Jessica?
1TO0008012	So, um, Bob... I'd like to know more about you.
1TO0008013	Tell me about yourself.
1TO0008014	So what have you been up to, kid?
1TO0008015	So, what have you been up to, kid?
1TO0008019	I'm here to do business with you.
1TO0008020	Yeah, what do you have?
1TO0008021	I'll have a drink.
1TO0008024	Can I see what kinds of guns you have for sale?
1TO0008027	I need some chems.
1TO0008028	What have you got to sell?
1TO0008031	I'm thinking of buying some ordinance.
1TO0008032	What do you have to eat?
1TO0008034	Parts of me are broken, doc.
1TO0008035	I've changed my mind. I'll live with the pain.
1TO0008036	I'm pretty banged up, doc.
1TO0008037	Can you help me doc?
1TO0008038	I need a new face, doc.
1TO0008041	Fawkes? What the hell are you doing out here?
1TO0008043	What makes you think I wanted a monster like you following me?
1TO0008045	Looks like you've got a new toy, huh?
1TO0008050	I was in that situation once, myself. Deal with it.
1TO0008065	What's the matter, boy? Lose your master?
1TO0008066	You know, I think you're the first dog I've met that didn't try to eat me.
1TO0008067	Shut up, mutt.
1TO0008068	You're pretty friendly, aren't you, boy?
1TO0008069	I guess your old master must have taken pretty good care of you.
1TO0008070	Good teeth, strong claws. You're a fighting dog, aren't you?
1TO0008071	I can be your new master. Would you like that, boy?
1TO0008072	Come with me, dog. It'll be good to have some company out here.
1TO0008073	I could use a pet like you. Let's go find something to eat, mutt.
1TO0008074	Stay here. Maybe I'll come back for you.
1TO0008075	I'm injured. Help me out.
1TO0008076	Tell me about Allistair Tenpenny.
1TO0008077	Tell me about yourself, Mr. Tenpenny.
1TO0008078	I think I've broken something.
1TO0008079	Just heal me, doc.
1TO0008081	You know, I'm not as bad off as I thought.
1TO0008083	Indeed! I'm extremely impressed!
1TO0008084	Being a doctor is a great service to a community.
1TO0008086	And a pretty smile it is!
1TO0008087	I'd love a drink, friend.
1TO0008088	You really think you can improve my look?
1TO0008093	You didn't build this tower, you just found it and moved in. Big fucking deal.
1TO0008094	You got a problem with the way I dress?
1TO0008095	I hear doctors make a ton of caps.
1TO0008096	This is a store?
1TO0008097	I hate robots.
1TO0008098	I don't need a smile. What I need is some food.
1TO0008103	Eh. It's okay here.
1TO0008105	Blah blah blah.
1TO0008112	I'll come back later then.
1TO0008113	I'm here to see Tenpenny. But if you weren't so incompetent, you'd know that.
1TO0008114	Do you know when I can see Mister Tenpenny?
1TO0008117	I need to leave. Can you open the gate?
1TO0008118	What are you shooting at out there?
1TO0008119	What can you tell me about Tenpenny Tower?
1TO0008120	Quite a tower you have here, Mr. Tenpenny.
1TO0008122	I'd like to do business with you.
1TO0008123	Can I get something to eat?
1TO0008124	I'm thirsty.
1TO0008127	You got an armament supply? Want to do some trade?
1TO0008129	So what are you, the guard dog?
1TO0008131	I have a few questions about the Citadel.
1TO0008132	So... Any thoughts on the Enclave?
1TO0008133	Care to share anything about the Super Mutants?
1TO0008134	Anything about the Super Mutants I should know?
1TO0008135	I'd like to buy something.
1TO0008136	What can you tell me about the Lyons' Pride?
1TO0008137	Wait... they made you the doctor?
1TO0008139	So what's your job in the Lyons' Pride?
1TO0008140	What's your combat specialization in Lyons' Pride?
1TO0008141	So what's your specialty in the Lyons' Pride?
1TO0008142	Can I join the Railroad?
1TO0008143	Are you in charge of the um... the robot?
1TO0008144	So what's the deal with the robot?
1TO0008145	Could you repair my equipment?
1TO0008146	Do you think you could repair my equipment?
1TO0008149	Aren't you a little young for all this?
1TO0008150	I had some questions about the Citadel.
1TO0008151	I can help take care of that little Ghoul problem for you.
1TO0008152	I've killed so many Ghouls, I've stopped counting.
1TO0008153	I kill Ghouls and rent-a-cops with attitudes who ask too many questions.
1TO0008154	You going to let me in or not?
1TO0008155	Maybe you'd accept this 100 caps as "insurance" of my good behavior?
1TO0008156	Ah come on. Let me in. Pretty please, with sugar on top?
1TO0008158	I'm a little low on caps at the moment.
1TO0008159	Open up the door! I have your 100 caps.
1TO0008160	You won't be getting a bribe from me.
1TO0008161	Let me in asshole!
1TO0008162	I just want to look around a little. Come on. I won't hurt anybody.
1TO0008163	That's where you're mistaken. Does 100 caps sound about right?
1TO0008164	Come on, let me in. Just for a little while. I won't cause any trouble.
1TO0008165	Open the damn gate! I'm done being interrogated by you!
1TO0008166	Is that how you treat all your guests?
1TO0008167	Do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
1TO0008168	I don't think you're talking to the person you think you are.
1TO0008169	I'm here to see Tenpenny.
1TO0008170	I have a lucrative offer for Tenpenny. Let me in, or you'll come to regret it.
1TO0008171	Tenpenny is expecting me. I'm a new tenant. <Lie.>
1TO0008172	Just let me in already!
1TO0008180	Let me see the real goods.
1TO0008181	Look at these people. They're Jetting. Trust me, I know.
1TO0008182	Why do you bother to hide what you sell?
1TO0008183	Just show me the goods.
1TO0008184	Then I guess I'll take my caps someplace else...
1TO0008189	He's working in a bar in Megaton.
1TO0008190	He was up in Megaton. I'm afraid that he's dead.
1TO0008191	He works for a guy up in Megaton. I think he might be a slave.
1TO0008192	He was up in Megaton. At least he was until I killed him.
1TO0008193	You run this place with Greta?
1TO0008194	You're taking Greta's death really hard, aren't you?
1TO0008196	No, Carol. I'd love to hear your story.
1TO0008197	Do you remember the day the war started?
1TO0008198	What was the Wasteland like after the war?
1TO0008199	So, how did you end up as a Ghoul?
1TO0008200	See, and you said you weren't interesting.
1TO0008201	You know, you're right. I don't.
1TO0008202	I just...
1TO0008203	Yeah, but...
1TO0008204	How did you end up working for...
1TO0008207	What do you know about Underworld?
1TO0008210	What's with those things behind the glass?
1TO0008211	Where can I get a drink around here? You seem like the right person to ask.
1TO0008212	So, you're the town drunk, huh?
1TO0008213	You're losing parts? Like... body parts?
1TO0008214	I'll do that.
1TO0008215	Watch out for your own body parts, you creepy bastard.
1TO0008216	You keep your parts to yourself and let's talk about something else.
1TO0008217	Are you all right?
1TO0008218	You be careful. I don't want you hurting yourself.
1TO0008219	You're disgusting.
1TO0008220	What? You're not going to tell me how rare it is to see a human in Underworld?
1TO0008221	Where do you go?
1TO0008222	Wow, I just realized... I don't care.
1TO0008223	Nice to meet you, Quinn.
1TO0008224	Travel? Where do you go?
1TO0008225	Oh, I just remembered... I don't care.
1TO0008226	Oh, God. I'm out of here.
1TO0008227	Tell me about your travels, Quinn.
1TO0008228	Are you taking Jet over here?
1TO0008229	About what? My hair?
1TO0008230	You stay away from my hair.
1TO0008231	How does a Ghoul end up as a barber?
1TO0008308	So what can you tell me about Underworld?
1TO0008309	You don't get a lot of customers, do you?
1TO0008310	What do you do with the money you make down here?
1TO0008311	Do you know anything about Underworld?
1TO0008312	What was this place before the Ghouls moved in?
1TO0008313	How did all of the Ghouls end up here?
1TO0008314	Isn't it dangerous being this deep into the city?
1TO0008315	That's all I needed to know.
1TO0008316	Jesus Christ! What are you?
1TO0008317	Oh, you're one of those Ghouls! Just like Gob!
1TO0008319	Wait... what are you again?
1TO0008320	Smoothskin? What does that mean?
1TO0008322	The Brotherhood of Steel? What's your beef with them?
1TO0008323	A city full of Ghouls, huh?
1TO0008324	All right. I'm going to go have a look around.
1TO0008325	Yeah, he's up in Megaton tending bar.
1TO0008326	Yeah, he's in Megaton working for some jackass.
1TO0008327	What do you do around here, Winthrop?
1TO0008328	Why? What's wrong?
1TO0008329	Sure, Winthrop. I think I can help you out.
1TO0008330	Take care of your own problems.
1TO0008331	What sort of payment are we talking about?
1TO0008332	I have a better idea. How about I do nothing and you give me what you have?
1TO0008333	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and watch you die gasping for air.
1TO0008334	Yes. As in, "I won't make a five egg omelet out of your face."
1TO0008335	Yes. As in: I won't shoot your face off and dance in your brains.
1TO0008337	Yes. As in: I won't pull your arms off and laugh as you die.
1TO0008338	You'll be dead long before help gets here.
1TO0008339	Go ahead and yell. I'll kill every last one of you.
1TO0008340	Heh. I was just kidding. Now, what were you saying about a job?
1TO0008341	This is so fascinating, I can't bear to talk about it any longer.
1TO0008342	You wanted me to get some Scrap Metal for you, right?
1TO0008343	No, I haven't changed my mind.
1TO0008344	What were you offering to trade?
1TO0008345	Yes, I've changed my mind. I'll bring you some Scrap Metal
1TO0008346	I have some scrap metal for you.
1TO0008347	I've got 10 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
1TO0008348	I've got 15 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
1TO0008349	I've got 20 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
1TO0008350	I've got 25 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
1TO0008351	I've got 5 bits of Scrap Metal to trade.
1TO0008352	What was our deal again?
1TO0008353	Actually, never mind. I don't want to trade any Scrap Metal.
1TO0008354	I'll take the RadAway.
1TO0008355	I'll take the Stimpaks
1TO0008356	I'll take the Stimpak.
1TO0008357	I'll take some Rad-X.
1TO0008358	Can you repair my things?
1TO0008361	Would you be interested in trading with a Vault?
1TO0008369	Yeah, she did. It was awesome!
1TO0008370	None of your business, Freddie. Get out of my face.
1TO0008378	There was something else...
1TO0008379	Nope. That'll do it.
1TO0008381	You're Freddie's mom, right?
1TO0008382	I don't know him very well.
1TO0008383	I'll talk to him. I can't promise anything, though.
1TO0008384	I'd rather not get involved. He's your kid, you talk to him.
1TO0008385	Yeah, I know him. He's kind of a jerk.
1TO0008386	I'll talk to him. I can't promise anything though.
1TO0008388	Yeah, I know him. He's a good guy. Why are you always on his case?
1TO0008389	Leave me alone, you crazy bitch.
1TO0008390	I'm sorry, I was just joking.
1TO0008408	Show me what you've got.
1TO0008409	I need you to repair some equipment.
1TO0008410	You eat people's brains, right? So what's it like being a zombie?
1TO0008411	I didn't mean to offend. I'm not prejudiced.
1TO0008412	You're the prejudiced asshole, not me. So you're ugly. Big deal.
1TO0008413	No, really. I mean it. I don't care if you're a Ghoul or not.
1TO0008415	Ah... Nevermind.
1TO0008417	Mind your fucking business, that's who.
1TO0008418	I'm trouble. That's all you need to know.
1TO0008419	I can handle myself.
1TO0008421	You got nothing to worry about. I'm harmless.
1TO0008422	Nice to meet you, Bessie. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
1TO0008428	Okay, now I've seen everything...
1TO0008429	You're a poet, right? Do you have a name?
1TO0008431	I'm here to see Roy Phillips.
1TO0008432	I killed a bunch of crazy Ghouls in the Metro tunnels...
1TO0008435	Here. Have this Purified Water.
1TO0008437	All I have is irradiated water.
1TO0008438	I'm sorry. I don't have any water to give you.
1TO0008439	What, just give it to you? Hell no.
1TO0008440	I insist, my friend. It's the least I can do to help.
1TO0008441	No. Find your own water.
1TO0008442	I'd better go before I get a headache.
1TO0008443	So... I'm free to leave?
1TO0008444	I don't think I need to hear any more.
1TO0008445	I've heard enough for now.
1TO0008446	Do the men on this ship give you much trouble?
1TO0008448	You don't look like you belong here. What's your story?
1TO0008451	I don't have to explain anything. I don't answer to you.
1TO0008452	The Mole Rat repellent needs a recharge.
1TO0008456	I can take it from here.
1TO0008458	I need to you repair my weapons.
1TO0008459	What exactly is this "Project Purity"?
1TO0008461	Tell me about the Church of Atom.
1TO0008462	Get away from me, you crazy old bat.
1TO0008463	You're crazy. Get away from me.
1TO0008464	Just leave me alone. I'm busy.
1TO0008465	So what happened to Project Purity?
1TO0008466	Could I ask you about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008467	What do you know about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008469	You lied to me about Rivet City's history! Pinkerton told me the truth!
1TO0008470	Do you know anything about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008471	Have any stories about this place's history?
1TO0008473	Tell me about this city's history.
1TO0008474	What do you know about this city's history?
1TO0008475	Do you know about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008476	Know anything about the history of Rivet City?
1TO0008478	Can I ask you about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008479	Heard any stories about the city's history?
1TO0008481	Do you know anything about the city's history?
1TO0008485	I'm researching Rivet City's history. Can you tell me about it?
1TO0008487	Know anything about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008489	Can you tell me about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008490	I'm trying to find out Rivet City's history. Can you help?
1TO0008492	What can you tell me about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008498	Would you mind me asking about Rivet City's history?
1TO0008502	Do you know the history of Rivet City?
1TO0008506	Do you know the history behind Rivet City?
1TO0008509	Have you heard anything about the history of Rivet City?
1TO0008512	I need to see Amata. Lead me to her.
1TO0008514	Actually, could you escort me to Amata? I need to talk to her about all this.
1TO0008515	Could you escort me to Amata? I need to talk to her about all this.
1TO0008516	What can you tell me about Underworld?
1TO0008517	Who built Liberty Prime? Or better yet... why?
1TO0008518	What do you make of the Enclave, Squire?
1TO0008519	I'm not a tourist...
1TO0008520	I'd like to donate to the Church.
1TO0008521	Do you accept donations?
1TO0008522	How did mom really die?
1TO0008523	You said something about schematics?
1TO0008525	I think I'd like to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
1TO0008527	I think it's time to have a talk with the Overseer. Take me to him.
1TO0008529	Do you sell any specialty items?
1TO0008530	Do you have any traders in town? Any doctors?
1TO0008532	What's there to do around here, Bittercup?
1TO0008534	This is a town, right? Where are the stores?
1TO0008535	You're the doctor in town?
1TO0008536	What's there to do here, anyway?
1TO0008537	What can you tell me about Bigtown?
1TO0008538	This place looks like a ghost town.
1TO0008539	Why do Super Mutants keep attacking the town?
1TO0008540	How are things in Big Town, Red?
1TO0008541	What do you think will happen to Big Town?
1TO0008542	Do you know anything about the Super Mutant attacks?
1TO0008543	What are you on the lookout for?
1TO0008544	Where did you people come from, anyway?
1TO0008545	Tell me how Big Town got started.
1TO0008546	Give me the history of this place.
1TO0008547	Do you know how Big Town got started?
1TO0008548	Any idea why there are barricades surrounding the town?
1TO0008549	How did you people get here?
1TO0008551	Actually, I don't have 50 caps.
1TO0008559	On second thought, I'll be fine.
1TO0008560	At those prices, I'll take care of myself.
1TO0008561	I need to buy medical supplies.
1TO0008563	How about a drink?
1TO0008565	Hey Leo, can you hook me up?
1TO0008567	Can I see what's on the menu?
1TO0008568	Let me see what you have for sale.
1TO0008569	I want to buy a drink.
1TO0008570	Know anything about the area outside Megaton?
1TO0008571	Confessor, have you ever traveled outside of Megaton?
1TO0008572	What do you know about the Wasteland?
1TO0008575	Never mind. I'll be going.
1TO0008576	What's the big deal about water, anyway?
1TO0008577	I'll be on my way, then.
1TO0008579	This is too messed up. I'm leaving again. Just pretend I never came back.
1TO0008580	Your Republic is forfeit. Prepare to be reclaimed by the Wasteland!
1TO0008581	You ever get outside, Cerberus? Into the Wasteland?
1TO0008582	If you're the new doctor, can you heal me?
1TO0008583	I don't suppose you know anything about the Super Mutants?
1TO0008585	I'm injured, Jonas.
1TO0008586	Can you repair my equipment?
1TO0008588	The more I hear, the less I want to be involved at all. I'm leaving, forever.
1TO0008590	You know, I just don't care anymore. Let me leave and I'll never come back.
1TO0008592	Tell me about Andale.
1TO0008593	Tell me about this place.
1TO0008594	What do you think of Andale?
1TO0008596	Let's trade equipment.
1TO0008597	I want to access your storage module.
1TO0008599	The way I see it, if you and the rebels are dead, all these problems are over.
1TO0008600	I think I'll just kill you, now.
1TO0008601	I still owe you for Jonas. Now shut up and die, you son of a bitch.
1TO0008603	There's only one solution, here. Death, and lots of it. You get to be first!
1TO0008604	I am not calling you "Mister President" every time I speak!
1TO0008605	Thanks for your time, Cerberus.
1TO0008606	They don't actually... make you fight. Do they?
1TO0008609	How do you feel about the Brotherhood of Steel?
1TO0008611	What have you got against the Brotherhood?
1TO0008612	Can you tell me more about the Brotherhood of Steel?
1TO0008614	Get lost, Butch. You're fired.
1TO0008615	You're fired, Charon.
1TO0008616	Leave me alone, Clover. You're fired.
1TO0008617	It's too dangerous here, Dogmeat. Go wait for me at Vault 101.
1TO0008618	Get out of here, Jericho. You're fired.
1TO0008619	You're fired, Fawkes. Stop following me around.
1TO0008620	You're fired, RL-3. Leave immediately.
1TO0008622	Can you give me directions?
1TO0008623	What do you do for fun around here?
1TO0008624	What can you tell me about Megaton?
1TO0008627	I have to go, dad.
1TO0008628	I had some questions about the Vault...
1TO0008629	What's the word around town?
1TO0008630	What's the news?
1TO0008631	What do you know about the people here?
1TO0008635	I'll be heading out now.
1TO0008636	I'll go pick up that vial now.
1TO0008640	Bye, Dad.
1TO0008642	See you, fatty.
1TO0008643	Take care, Amata.
1TO0008644	Bye, Amata.
1TO0008645	Later, Paul.
1TO0008646	Bye, Wally.
1TO0008647	Bye, Timmy.
1TO0008648	I'd better get going.
1TO0008649	I've got to get going.
1TO0008650	I need to get going.
1TO0008651	Okay, I'm leaving.
1TO0008652	I'll be leaving, now.
1TO0008653	I'll just be on my way, then.
1TO0008654	Sorry, I'll be going now.
1TO0008657	So... Can I take a peek at the Memorial now?
1TO0008658	I should go.
1TO0008660	Thanks. Bye.
1TO0008661	Well, I've heard enough.
1TO0008663	Thank you, Hannibal. I'd better get going.
1TO0008664	I should get going.
1TO0008665	I should let you get back to work. Goodbye.
1TO0008666	Well, I should get started. Goodbye.
1TO0008668	Wait here. I'll be right back.
1TO0008669	Wait here until I get back.
1TO0008673	I have to go. Now.
1TO0008674	I need a little time to think about this, Amata.
1TO0008676	I'll go see what I can do about all of this.
1TO0008677	I'll be going, now.
1TO0008688	Enough chit-chat.
1TO0008693	Let's go, Dogmeat.
1TO0008694	I have to go, Dogmeat.
1TO0008699	I'd better start hunting the next one on the list.
1TO0008700	Right. I'm out of here.
1TO0008702	Talk to you later, Andy.
1TO0008705	Goodbye, Gob.
1TO0008708	I'd better get going, Angela.
1TO0008709	Um... I guess I'll be going.
1TO0008710	It's been a pleasure, Mr. Bannon.
1TO0008711	Later, Belle.
1TO0008713	I think I'll leave now, Brock.
1TO0008714	Thank you for your help, Christie.
1TO0008715	It's time for me to leave, Cindy.
1TO0008716	So long C.J.
1TO0008717	You've been very helpful.
1TO0008718	See you later, Ted.
1TO0008719	Goodbye, Diego.
1TO0008721	Bye, Doc.
1TO0008722	I need to go, Father Clifford.
1TO0008723	I've got to run.
1TO0008724	I should let you get back to your customers, Gary.
1TO0008725	I have to leave.
1TO0008727	Goodbye, Henry.
1TO0008728	I gotta run. Stay out of trouble, James.
1TO0008731	I have to leave now.
1TO0008732	I've got to run, Paulie.
1TO0008733	I'm going to go now. Sorry I woke you, Paulie.
1TO0008736	I should leave.
1TO0008737	Time for me to go.
1TO0008738	I've got things to do.
1TO0008739	Take care, Tammy.
1TO0008740	I hate to do this, but I have to go.
1TO0008741	I'd better leave, Trinnie.
1TO0008742	So long, Vera.
1TO0008743	I've got business elsewhere.
1TO0008744	I'll let you get back to work.
1TO0008745	I'll stop interrupting your class, now.
1TO0008746	I'll let you get back to the food.
1TO0008747	Bye-bye, Bumble.
1TO0008750	I'm leaving. Get back to guarding.
1TO0008751	That's all for me.
1TO0008752	I'm going away. You stay here. Away from me.
1TO0008755	Bye, Penny.
1TO0008756	Stay cool, Sammy.
1TO0008757	Take care, Squirrel.
1TO0008758	See you around, MacCready.
1TO0008766	Later, spooky girl.
1TO0008767	I'll let you and gun have some alone time...
1TO0008768	I'm going to go look around town.
1TO0008770	Goodbye, Red.
1TO0008771	Later, Shorty.
1TO0008772	See you, Sticky.
1TO0008773	I'll be going.
1TO0008774	All right. I'm going to get going.
1TO0008775	I'd better leave.
1TO0008776	I really need to leave now.
1TO0008777	So long, Cherry.
1TO0008778	See ya later.
1TO0008779	Goodbye, Mister President.
1TO0008780	I'm going to go tour the Republic.
1TO0008782	I think I'll just be going.
1TO0008783	Goodbye, Rosie.
1TO0008784	See you, Jessica.
1TO0008786	I'll leave you to the kids.
1TO0008787	Later, Bob.
1TO0008788	Talk to you later, kid.
1TO0008793	I'll be on my way.
1TO0008794	I'm leaving.
1TO0008795	I guess I'll be going.
1TO0008797	I'll talk to you later.
1TO0008806	About collecting the stuff from Super-Duper Mart...
1TO0008807	About the radiation...
1TO0008808	About Minefield...
1TO0008810	About the Mole Rats...
1TO0008811	About the Mirelurks...
1TO0008812	About this serious injury...
1TO0008813	About Rivet City's history...
1TO0008814	About those robots...
1TO0008815	About the library...
1TO0008816	The Ghouls trying to get in are all dead.
1TO0008824	What's the word? Heard anything interesting?
1TO0008857	The Overseer's insane and thought no one would leave if they all died. <Lie>
1TO0008858	I've been across this Wasteland, and nowhere's safer than this Vault. Trust me.
1TO0008859	This Vault is the safest place I've ever seen. It's insane to give that up.
1TO0008860	Just report in that I'm here for one last visit. I'm sure security won't mind.
1TO0008861	It wasn't a message from her. I just had a hunch she was in trouble. <Lie>
1TO0008862	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. <Lie>
1TO0008863	I know that the vault's been open before, and that you lied about its isolation.
1TO0008866	That was pretty funny! <Lie>
1TO1000002	Attack the enemy in the Mines.
1TO1000003	Attack the enemy in the Listening Post.
1TO1000004	Attack the enemy in the Ice Camp.
1TO1000005	Attack the enemy in the Chimera Depot.
1TO1000006	Done with Ice Camp. Send Team to Rally Point: Chimera.
1TO1000007	Now that the Ice Camp is out of the way, head up to the Chimera Depot.
1TO1000008	Done with Mines. Send Team to Rally Point: Listening Post.
1TO1000009	Now that we've dealt with the Mining Town, head to the Listening Post.
1TO1000010	Send Team to Rally Point: Mines.
1TO1000011	Wait for me just outside the Mining Town on the way to the Listening Post.
1TO1000012	Yeah, hell of a fight.  Mind if I head in?
1TO1000013	Yeah, can I get by?
1TO1000020	I need to discuss my Strike Team.
1TO1000021	Send Team to Rally Point: Ice Camp.
1TO1000022	Wait for me outside the Chinese Ice Camp on the way to the Chimera Depot.
1TO1000023	I'm ready to change to Close Assault gear.
1TO1000024	I'm ready for my Close Assault gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
1TO1000025	I'm ready to change to Fire Team gear.
1TO1000026	I'm ready for my Fire Team gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
1TO1000027	I'm ready to change to Heavy Weapons gear.
1TO1000028	I'm ready for my Heavy Weapons gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
1TO1000029	I'm ready to change to Sniper gear.
1TO1000030	I'm ready for my Sniper gear. Here's my Requisition Holotape.
1TO1000031	Radio to base that we need replacements.
1TO1000033	I'll scope out the enemy at the Mining Town. Have the team wait here.
1TO1000034	I'll scope out the enemy at the Listening Post. Have the team wait here.
1TO1000035	I'll scope out the enemy at the Ice Camp. Have the team wait here.
1TO1000036	I'll scope out the enemy at the Chimera Depot. Have the team wait here.
1TO1000060	Yeah, you guys are almost as fun to kill as the mutants.
1TO1000061	Morrill radioed ahead.  I'm supposed to meet Protector McGraw.
1TO1000062	Yeah, I'm headed down now.
1TO1000068	Maybe I'd better just go.
1TO1000080	Got anything to trade?
1TO1000101	I'm not one of your soldiers. I just like wearing your armor.
1TO1000102	Uhh, the rest of the guys should be here any second now. <Lie>
1TO1000103	Can it, soldier! Who's in charge of this mess? I want his head on a platter!
1TO1000104	What, this armor? I found it. Honest.
1TO1000105	Hey, I just wandered in here, and it looked like you guys needed help.
1TO1000106	Yeah, I had to kill a few of your guys to get a suit that looked good on me.
1TO1000107	I'm just looking for my dad.
1TO1000109	I just stopped in to ransack the place. Didn't expect to find anyone.
1TO1000110	I'm not looking for trouble. I'm just here because of the radio signal.
1TO1000111	I heard your radio signal, and thought I'd come and lend a hand.
1TO1000113	This? It's my Pip-Boy 3000. Want to see?
1TO1000114	Yes, it's mine, and before you ask, no you can't have it.
1TO1000115	Who cares about my Pip-Boy? I'm here to find out what's going on.
1TO1000124	Maybe I should just be going.
1TO1000125	I was just exploring. I didn't mean to intrude.
1TO1000126	Hey, I'm just here to help. I heard your radio broadcast.
1TO1000127	You can't have me killed if you're dead.
1TO1000128	I hope we're talking "helpful" useful, and not "tasty" useful.
1TO1000129	What? No, of course I'm one of you... uhh, sir. <Lie>
1TO1000130	Sure, who wouldn't want to help out the surly guys in scary armor?
1TO1000133	I'd be happy to help, provided there's something in it for me.
1TO1000134	Guilty as charged. But it looks like you need help just the same.
1TO1000135	I've dealt with your group before. Fort Independence, right?
1TO1000136	I killed your buddies at Fort Independence. Now it's your turn.
1TO1000137	So, my Pip-Boy makes me unique, and you need my help because of that...
1TO1000138	I must have something you want, so let's cut to the chase.
1TO1000139	Well, what do you want me to do?
1TO1000140	Spit it out, McGraw. I ain't got all day.
1TO1000141	You guys treat outsiders like shit, but you still beg for help. Typical.
1TO1000142	If you've got a paying job, I'm in. What's the situation?
1TO1000143	First let's talk about what I get out of this.
1TO1000144	Maybe later. I just remembered I have somewhere else to be.
1TO1000145	Simulation? Like... a computer simulation? Of what?
1TO1000146	So it's a computer game. I get it. Sounds like fun!
1TO1000147	Simulation, huh? Piece of cake.
1TO1000148	Oh, great. Let me guess, more psychotic little girls...
1TO1000149	Okay, sure. I'll do it.
1TO1000150	Okay, guess I'll get to it.
1TO1000151	Whoa, slow down! Can we just talk for a bit?
1TO1000153	Nice attitude. This how you treat everyone that tries to help you?
1TO1000154	Oh, I get it. You're doing the "tough" routine.
1TO1000155	Hey, look. I'm just trying to get some more information.
1TO1000156	Okay, put me in the chair.
1TO1000157	Can you tell me more about what you're doing here?
1TO1000158	What can you tell me about this simulation?
1TO1000159	Why exactly do you need me?
1TO1000162	Listen, sweetie. I'm kind of lost. Can I talk to whomever's in charge?
1TO1000163	Whoops, this isn't the Vault. Silly me, must've made a wrong turn.
1TO1000164	Nice place you've got here. Mind if I look around?
1TO1000165	Wow, what is this place?
1TO1000168	Hey, sorry. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on here.
1TO1000170	Sorry for asking. Forget I said anything.
1TO1000171	Why are you so hostile?
1TO1000172	Glad to see you made it in one piece.
1TO1000173	Let's cut the chatter... we've got some guns to destroy.
1TO1000174	What took you so damn long?
1TO1000175	Yep. Let's go.
1TO1000176	Hang on a second. Do you have any spare ammo?
1TO1000177	That's not enough ammo. You got any more?
1TO1000178	Hell yeah. See if you can keep up.
1TO1000179	I'm fine, don't worry about it. So, what's the plan?
1TO1000180	So this is Anchorage, huh?
1TO1000181	Wait... what? What's going on?
1TO1000182	Sorry, the... fall threw me off.
1TO1000183	Alright, alright. Just give me a second to clear my head.
1TO1000184	Look, I have no idea where we are or what's going on.
1TO1000185	I'm ready. Let's lock and load.
1TO1000186	What exactly are we up against here?
1TO1000187	Artillery Site? What are you talking about?
1TO1000210	Yes sir, understood perfectly sir!
1TO1000211	Very clear. Sorry, sir.
1TO1000212	Pfft... this isn't even real.
1TO1000213	<Allow the General to continue.>
1TO1000215	We sure sent those Red Chinese packing!
1TO1000216	Yeah, yeah... make with the next objective so I can finish the simulation.
1TO1000217	Anything I can do to assist, sir?
1TO1000218	That's a shame, sir.
1TO1000219	They knew the drill when they signed up, sir.
1TO1000220	What are my orders, sir?
1TO1000221	I'm not sure I'm ready, sir.
1TO1000223	That's not necessary, Benji.
1TO1000224	Enough! There has to be a way to halt this simulation. A passcode or something.
1TO1000225	Thanks for the compliments, Sergeant.
1TO1000226	There's no time for chit chat, Sergeant.
1TO1000227	Yeah, I guess I did kind of save the day.
1TO1000228	All in a day's work, Benji.
1TO1000229	You save some, you lose others. Who cares as long as the job gets done?
1TO1000230	Don't worry, Benji. I'll make officers out of all of 'em.
1TO1000231	I never asked to be a role model. I just want to get through this.
1TO1000232	These soldiers aren't even real. This is all a sham.
1TO1000233	I wouldn't even presume to argue with this simulation's A.I. subroutines.
1TO1000234	Yeah, you're right. Sorry Benji!
1TO1000235	I suppose. Let's just get through this.
1TO1000236	Let's just drop the whole thing, okay?
1TO1000237	So, where do we stand with the Strike Team?
1TO1000238	Let's get the Strike Team moving, Sergeant.
1TO1000239	Let's do this smooth and by the numbers. Follow my lead.
1TO1000245	Very funny, Lieutenant.
1TO1000246	Suicide Squad? Why do they call it that?
1TO1000247	Hey, I didn't sign up for this.
1TO1000248	This Strike Team... I've never led troops like that before.
1TO1000249	I hope you know more about this Strike Team, cause I sure don't.
1TO1000250	You can tell General Chase I don't need a Strike Team... I work alone.
1TO1000251	I'm looking for your latest intel reports.
1TO1000252	Give me the latest on the Chimera Depot.
1TO1000253	Give me the latest on the Listening Post.
1TO1000254	Give me the latest on the Pulse Field.
1TO1000255	I need some new gear. Can you set me up?
1TO1000256	How do I put together my Strike Team?
1TO1000257	Can't I just take a whole bunch of guys with me?
1TO1000258	What if I lose a Strike Team member?
1TO1000260	I need some more information about my objectives.
1TO1000261	About the Chimera Depot...
1TO1000262	What exactly IS a Chimera?
1TO1000263	How do I take out the Fuel Tanks?
1TO1000264	What's the point of taking out the Chimera Depot?
1TO1000265	Let me ask you about another target.
1TO1000266	About that Listening Post...
1TO1000267	How exactly do I "secure" the Listening Post?
1TO1000268	What can I expect to find inside the post?
1TO1000269	What's the urgency in securing this facility?
1TO1000270	About the Pulse Field...
1TO1000271	What does the Pulse Field do?
1TO1000272	How am I going to destroy the Pulse Field?
1TO1000273	This is the last objective?
1TO1000274	Let me change the subject.
1TO1000276	What, that's it? I was just starting to have fun!
1TO1000277	Am I done? Is the simulation over?
1TO1000279	You've already lost, General. Don't throw away your dignity.
1TO1000280	It's over, Jingwei. Surrender and lay down your arms.
1TO1000281	I'm going to kill you SO MUCH.
1TO1000285	I've got some equipment in need of repairs.
1TO1000291	I need some more ammo.
1TO1000294	You're dismissed from the Strike Team, soldier.
1TO1000295	Have the Strike Team hold up right here.
1TO1000296	Have the team move out.
1TO1000297	Have them send us an Infantryman.
1TO1000298	Have them send us a Grenadier.
1TO1000299	Have them send us a Missile Unit.
1TO1000300	Have them send us a Sniper.
1TO1000301	Have them send us a Mister Gutsy.
1TO1000302	Have them send us a Sentry Bot.
1TO1000303	Actually, cancel that order.
1TO1000304	Have the Strike Team head for the Chimera Depot.
1TO1000305	Have the Strike Team head for the Listening Post.
1TO1000306	What's our current status on the targets?
1TO1000307	Can I change my gear?
1TO1000308	The stuff you have is okay, but I need something with more... punch.
1TO2000002	What's going to happen to the baby?
1TO2000003	Remember your little ambush at the gate? Let's settle the score.
1TO2000004	I'm having second thoughts about all this.
1TO2000005	Teddy bear delivery for Marie! Here you go.
1TO2000006	Would it help if I brought toys for Marie?
1TO2000009	Tell me where Wernher is, or I'll kill each and every slave, right now.
1TO2000010	One chance, Wernher. Leave now, and never come back.
1TO2000011	Wernher, how about saving us both a lot of trouble and leaving quietly?
1TO2000012	Seriously, I don't want to have to kill you.
1TO2000013	If you want to live, you'll tell me where Wernher is hiding.
1TO2000014	I can't believe you were going to steal a baby from her loving parents.
1TO2000015	Where did you get that powered armor?
1TO2000016	Do you ever miss the Brotherhood of Steel?
1TO2000017	How's Marie doing?
1TO2000018	How's Marie?
1TO2000020	If it's any consolation, Ashur says the cure will be shared with everyone.
1TO2000021	How's the baby doing?
1TO2000022	How's research coming on the cure?
1TO2000024	I've got some more ingots for you.
1TO2000025	I can't find any more ingots out there.
1TO2000026	That's all the ingots I've got.
1TO2000028	Here are a few ingots.
1TO2000044	Tell me about The Pitt.
1TO2000045	Can we talk about The Pitt?
1TO2000046	Tell me more about The Pitt.
1TO2000047	Have things gotten better?
1TO2000049	How's everything going in The Pitt?
1TO2000050	How did The Pitt get started?
1TO2000051	How did you rebuild after the Scourge?
1TO2000052	Why do you keep workers in The Pitt?
1TO2000053	Why do you keep slaves in The Pitt?
1TO2000054	Why are The Pitt's workers treated so poorly?
1TO2000055	Why are The Pitt's slaves treated so poorly?
1TO2000058	Any trouble with the locals?
1TO2000059	Family? You're all slaves. You're not family.
1TO2000060	What does that even mean?
1TO2000061	So you're just happy to be where you are?
1TO2000062	Why are you so cheery?
1TO2000073	Give me my stuff.
1TO2000074	I could use some protection on the inside.
1TO2000075	You look like someone who's got strings he can pull.
1TO2000080	Know any discreet sharpshooters?
1TO2000081	I could use a weapon on the inside.
1TO2000082	Let me into the arena.
1TO2000083	Why do I need to give you my stuff?
1TO2000084	I'll keep my stuff. I don't need to go into the arena.
1TO2000085	Here, take my gear. It better all be there when I ask for it back.
1TO2000086	Wait, can you tell me more about what you're doing in The Pitt?
1TO2000091	I'm sorry, but it was the only way to lure Wernher out of hiding.
1TO2000092	Um... It won't happen again?
1TO2000094	What do you mean about the city's future?
1TO2000095	So, how about my reward?
1TO2000096	So, you're not going to kill me?
1TO2000097	What's going to become of the workers?
1TO2000098	Now that you have Marie back, please set the slaves free.
1TO2000104	I heard The Pitt was building an army. I'm here to join.
1TO2000105	It's complicated. How about we just say I'm new in town and looking for work?
1TO2000106	I'm just here to kill you and reap the profits.
1TO2000107	I'm the badass who'll be running this place once I kill you.
1TO2000108	I'm the hero who's going to kill you and free the slaves!
1TO2000109	I'm just here to kill you and reap the rewards.
1TO2000110	Never heard of him. Why? <Lie.>
1TO2000111	I met the man, but he seemed like trouble, so I steered clear. <Lie.>
1TO2000112	Yes, I do. He's the one who brought me here.
1TO2000113	Sounds like a good deal. I'll track him down.
1TO2000114	Thanks, but I've got other plans.
1TO2000115	Mind if I think about it?
1TO2000120	You mean, I'm a citizen of the Pitt? Thank you, sir!
1TO2000121	About time somebody paid me for all this work.
1TO2000122	So, what do I do now?
1TO2000123	Guess it's time to kick back and live the life of luxury.
1TO2000124	He made me an offer, but now that I know the score, I'm joining your side.
1TO2000126	He said you had the key to ruling the city, and I'm here to collect.
1TO2000127	He said your discovery will free the slaves and cure them. How could I say no?
1TO2000128	He wanted me to steal a valuable cure. I'm just in it for the caps.
1TO2000130	Sorry. Here's Marie.
1TO2000131	Here's your daughter, safe and sound. And Wernher's gone, too.
1TO2000132	Nope. I just thought you'd want to say goodbye to your daughter.
1TO2000133	I guess, but it sure was fun while it lasted.
1TO2000134	What's with all the questions?
1TO2000135	Why should I tell you anything?
1TO2000137	I'm here to find a cure for the mutations.
1TO2000138	No, I haven't heard anything.
1TO2000139	I'm from outside The Pitt. I'm here to help free the slaves.
1TO2000140	Midea is helping Wernher.
1TO2000141	Wernher is trying to free the slaves.
1TO2000142	Marco is making weapons.
1TO2000149	No hard feelings, but I'm not taking any more of your shit.
1TO2000150	How about I put you to the whip, huh?
1TO2000175	Yup, that's me!
1TO2000177	Sure, if I have to.
1TO2000178	You got anything for me?
1TO2000179	That enough for something?
1TO2000181	This better be worth it.
1TO2000182	Pay up, stingy bastard.
1TO2000191	Let me see what drinks you have.
1TO2000195	Not at all. Some of my best friends are Ghouls.
1TO2000196	What do you mean about Ashur's "keen eyes"?
1TO2000197	Don't be so cold, Vikia. Don't you want a piece of this?
1TO2000198	I assure you, I'm more than your equal. Much more.
1TO2000199	Glad I kept you entertained, then!
1TO2000200	Trust me, I know how to work hard.
1TO2000201	How many other soldiers came from the Hole?
1TO2000202	That seems like a real risk, considering there are so few safety rails.
1TO2000203	Oh, that's real appetizing.
1TO2000205	Whoa. What happened to you?
1TO2000206	I'll tell you what's special about me: I kick ass.
1TO2000207	Why are you such a bitch?
1TO2000208	Good thing you didn't. I would have shot back.
1TO2000209	You really think you work harder than the slaves Downtown?
1TO2000210	I bet none of you have seen the things I've seen.
1TO2000211	If you don't like it, I hear there's an opening for work Downtown.
1TO2000212	I'm more than just meat. You wait and see.
1TO2000217	What are you doing? Shouldn't you be working?
1TO2000219	No thanks, I'll pass.
1TO2000220	Give me some food.
1TO2000221	Where can I find Ashur?
1TO2000222	He just expects me to jump to attention?
1TO2000223	I need a weapon. Where can I find Marco?
1TO2000224	Yeah. Where is he?
1TO2000225	I've already found him. No worries.
1TO2000226	Oh yeah? Why shouldn't I just tell them what you're up to?
1TO2000227	I guess you're right. What are you working on?
1TO2000228	I need a weapon. Can you help me out?
1TO2000229	I'll leave you to it, then.
1TO2000230	Maybe I'll go tell them anyway.
1TO2000231	And what are you doing?
1TO2000232	I'm a slave. I couldn't make it out there. Let me back in. <Lie.>
1TO2000233	I heard you had a good thing going here. I've come to join up with you.
1TO2000234	I am death. I've come for you.
1TO2000238	You didn't really expect me to steal a baby, did you?
1TO2000239	Sorry, but I just couldn't kidnap an innocent baby, even for your freedom.
1TO2000240	Did you know the cure is actually a baby?
1TO2000241	I joined with the winning side. Now shut your mouth, slave.
1TO2000243	I'm not so sure this was the right thing to do.
1TO2000244	I don't feel right about kidnapping. She's going to be safe, right?
1TO2000246	Seems like an awful lot of fuss over one little baby.
1TO2000248	As long as the kid's all right. Take her.
1TO2000249	Whatever. I've done my part, now where's my reward?
1TO2000250	Arena? Before I go anywhere, you're going to explain this plan to me.
1TO2000251	And he'll just give it to me?
1TO2000252	Do I have to kill him to get it?
1TO2000253	An arena? Interesting. So, that's part of your plan?
1TO2000254	Whoa, whoa! Slow down! What's going on here?
1TO2000255	Sounds dangerous. What will I be doing?
1TO2000256	Actually, that doesn't sound very dangerous.
1TO2000257	What the hell is a Trog?
1TO2000258	So where can I get some weapons?
1TO2000259	So, I'm just supposed to strangle them with my bare hands if I meet one?
1TO2000260	I think I can handle it.
1TO2000261	What is that, some kind of fish?
1TO2000262	And let me guess: the area is full of Super Mutants?
1TO2000263	So, what's the catch?
1TO2000264	I didn't come here to work, I came to save you all!
1TO2000265	I see your point. What do you need me to do?
1TO2000266	That's not so bad.
1TO2000267	Let me guess, the area is full of Super Mutants.
1TO2000268	I'm not happy about it, but since I'm stuck here: whatever.
1TO2000270	Whatever it is, I can handle it. So... what is it?
1TO2000271	The reward better be worth all of this. What do I need to do?
1TO2000272	You're right. What can I do so I don't stand out?
1TO2000273	This place is a nightmare!
1TO2000274	Thanks for helping me out back there.
1TO2000275	I'll find out where he is, and then this is over. Just wait.
1TO2000276	Yeah, because I've never solved my problems with violence. <Intimidate>
1TO2000277	I don't want to do it, but it's the only way. You're forcing my hand, Midea.
1TO2000278	Tell me about this cure.
1TO2000279	I want to talk about you.
1TO2000280	I want to talk about The Pitt.
1TO2000281	I want you to tell me about you and your people.
1TO2000282	I'll take the Bolt Thrower
1TO2000283	I'll take the axe.
1TO2000284	Skip it. I don't need a weapon.
1TO2000285	Who's Wild Bill?
1TO2000286	Yes, I found him in the Steelyard.
1TO2000288	Who's Wild Bill again?
1TO2000289	No, I'm still looking.
1TO2000290	Yes, I'll help out.
1TO2000291	No, I don't want to help.
1TO2000292	Bill's dead. I found his body in the Steelyard.  I'm sorry, Milly.
1TO2000293	Bill said to let you know he's OK, but he can't come back anytime soon. <Lie.>
1TO2000294	I'm just kidding, I found Bill dead in the Steelyard.
1TO2000295	I heard Bill's blood-curdling screams and I knew I was too late... <Lie.>
1TO2000296	I saw multiple Trogs clawing, tearing, chewing on his limbs... <Lie.>
1TO2000297	I scared off the Trogs and ran to Bill.  He was still alive... <Lie.>
1TO2000298	Barely. He was calling for you. I had to put him out of his misery... <Lie.>
1TO2000299	He's one tough bastard. Took every shot of my pistol... <Lie.>
1TO2000300	And one large concrete block... to the head. <Lie.>
1TO2000301	No, I can handle it.
1TO2000302	Yes. Fix me up.
1TO2000303	I'm ready to fight.
1TO2000305	Who am I going to be fighting?
1TO2000306	Let's do it!
1TO2000307	I want to fight in the Arena.
1TO2000308	Where do I sign up?
1TO2000309	What goes on down here?
1TO2000311	Yes. Put me down for a fight.
1TO2000312	What are the Arena Rules?
1TO2000313	Do I get any weapons?
1TO2000314	Tell me about other slaves who have fought in the Arena.
1TO2000316	I'm not taking you anywhere, but I need your clothes. Now.
1TO2000317	I'm not taking you anywhere. You're free to go.
1TO2000318	Good. Now get out of here before I change my mind.
1TO2000319	Thanks. Now take off. I'm done with you.
1TO2000320	You're free now. But I need your help dressing like a slave.
1TO2000321	Just get out of my sight. I don't care where you go.
1TO2000322	I need a set of slave clothes. Where can I get some?
1TO2000323	Great. Thanks. Be careful out there.
1TO2000324	Gross. I'm not wearing a dead guy's clothes. Give me yours. Now.
1TO2000325	I need your clothes. Give them to me. Now.
1TO2000345	600 for all three? You've got a deal.
1TO2000347	This is too much work. I'll just kill you.
1TO2000349	Yeah, that's me. I'm here to buy these slaves.
1TO2000350	Do you really care if I'm a man or not? I'm here to buy these slaves.
1TO2000352	Who are you waiting for?
1TO2000353	I'll leave you to that, then.
1TO2000354	I'm whoever you want me to be, baby.
1TO2000355	Who, me? No. I'm just here to kill you slaving bastards.
1TO2000356	Oops. I'm in the wrong place. I'll just be going.
1TO2000358	I want to buy your slaves.
1TO2000359	I just wanted to check on you.
1TO2000360	Can't we talk this through?
1TO2000361	I'm going to find you and kill you.
1TO2000364	That's nice, but why do you have your daughter in your lab?
1TO2000365	Pardon me, but Lord Ashur said you could show me some sort of "cure"?
1TO2000366	I don't care about your spawn. Where's the cure?
1TO2000367	I've got a bad feeling this isn't just "bring your daughter to work day"...
1TO2000368	What are you talking about? That's a baby, not a vaccine.
1TO2000369	Wait, you mean she has a natural and transferable immunity of some sort?
1TO2000370	You're kidding me. A baby can't be the cure!
1TO2000371	Okay, so the baby's the cure? I'll be taking her, thanks.
1TO2000372	Aren't you worried about hurting Marie?
1TO2000373	You're using your own child as an experiment? You monster!
1TO2000374	If there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.
1TO2000377	That means kidnapping this baby is the key to ruling this city. Yoink!
1TO2000378	Sorry, but the slaves don't have time to wait for a cure. I'm taking Marie.
1TO2000379	That makes Marie very valuable, doesn't it? And now she's mine!
1TO2000380	Wait, I meant, um, isn't she cute? Here you go.
1TO2000381	I've got your kid. You wouldn't dare shoot at me.
1TO2000391	Nah, I'm just messing with you.
1TO2000392	Yes, I'll have some food.
1TO2000393	Sure, I'll have some more food.
1TO2000394	I'm a little irradiated. I could use some help.
1TO2000395	I'm still irradiated. I could use some more help.
1TO2000397	Time for a rematch, just you and me.
1TO2000399	I'm fine, Phantom.
1TO2000401	Don't call me a pet, you freak.
1TO2000403	Your riot isn't going to change anything. Except getting the slaves killed...
1TO2000408	I guess there's no other option. Goodbye, Wernher.
1TO2000409	I came because of the radio message. What's the problem?
1TO2000410	Did you escape or something?
1TO2000411	Wait, slow down. Cure for what?
1TO2000412	They just left the city for dead?
1TO2000414	So, where do I come in?
1TO2000415	A cure? Are you sick? Stay away from me!
1TO2000416	A cure? You're sick? Agh! Get away!
1TO2000417	What happened to the people who survived?
1TO2000418	Weren't you in a hurry? Storytime is over.
1TO2000419	If your people need you, what are you doing here?
1TO2000420	So what happened after the Brotherhood came through?
1TO2000421	Just skip to the part where I come in. [TEMP SHORTCUT]
1TO2000422	What's wrong with your people?
1TO2000424	The radio message said something about a reward. Let's skip to that part.
1TO2000425	I'm a better fighter than you, that's who. Can't you handle a couple Raiders?
1TO2000426	Yeah, fine. I was just kidding.
1TO2000427	What? It's not my fault you can't shoot straight.
1TO2000428	I remember hearing about The Pitt from a guy in the Citadel.
1TO2000429	Your plans are over, Wernher. Ashur knows everything.
1TO2000430	You never told me it meant kidnapping!
1TO2000432	She's here, but you never told me this meant kidnapping.
1TO2000434	It's here and safe. How's this going to put me in charge of The Pitt?
1TO2000435	The baby's here, and she's safe. How will this help the slaves?
1TO2000436	I've got it here, safe and sound. Now, where's my reward?
1TO2000438	Sounds good. Let's finish this.
1TO2000439	That wasn't the deal, Wernher. I'm having second thoughts about all of this.
1TO2000441	Sure, fine, whatever. Let's get this over with.
1TO2000442	He'd forgive me if I put an end to you. And I intend to.
1TO2000443	I guess you're right, since I already killed his wife.
1TO2000444	How am I supposed to do that?
1TO2000445	Sounds like fun. Let me at 'em!
1TO2000446	I could have sworn I killed most of them. Is this really necessary?
1TO2000447	I wiped out a lot of them, already. Isn't the job already done?
1TO2000448	And how am I supposed to get out of there?
1TO2000449	Sounds dangerous. How about helping a lady out?
1TO2000450	Sounds like a plan. How do I kill the lights?
1TO2000457	As long as the slaves are free and Marie is safe.
1TO2000458	I expect my reward, now.
1TO2000459	That leaves me as the new Lord of The Pitt.
1TO2000460	So, what do I do, now?
1TO2000461	So I freed the slaves. Why isn't everyone cheering?
1TO2000462	Oh, good. I love surprises. What is it?
1TO2000463	If that's how it has to be, I understand.
1TO2000464	You're sure he can't come?
1TO2000465	You're sure she can't come?
1TO2000466	This doesn't sound good.
1TO2000469	You sure I can't sneak a weapon in?
1TO2000470	I'll take the gun.
1TO2000471	Gimme the knife.
1TO2000472	Nevermind. I'm fine without it.
1TO2000473	Get in. Find Midea. Got it.
1TO2000474	Yeah, but I don't think I trust you.
1TO2000475	Ah! Where did you come from?
1TO2000476	I had a couple of questions first.
1TO2000477	All right, I'll meet you over by the tunnel.
1TO2000479	What do we need to do first?
1TO2000480	Yeah, a disguise is a good idea. I'll do that.
1TO2000481	Disguise or not, I should rescue those slaves.
1TO2000482	I don't need a disguise. I'll find a way in.
1TO2000483	What's your goal?
1TO2000485	What am I trying to get?
1TO2000488	Tell me about your people.
1TO2000489	Who's in charge of The Pitt?
1TO2000491	Is there anyone helping you free your people?
1TO2000492	Where do your people come from?
1TO2000494	What happens to people who get sick?
1TO2000496	How did the city get started?
1TO2000497	Tell me about what the Brotherhood did.
1TO2000498	Who lives there?
1TO2000499	I had some questions about the mission.
1TO2000500	Where can I find steel ingots?
1TO2000501	Anyplace else to find ingots?
1TO2000521	I'm through talking with you.
1TO2000522	I'll go put out those lights.
1TO2000523	I'm going to go now.
1TO3000001	Officer Lepelletier said you'd be rewarding me...
1TO3000002	A guy named Split Jack is behind the attacks.
1TO3000003	They're not going to pay you to protect something they're giving away for free.
1TO3000004	Griffon's up to something with the Aqua Pura. What do you know about it?
1TO3000005	I've seen your bottling operation. The jig is up.
1TO3000006	Care to tell me where this water operation of yours is located?
1TO3000007	I am the Prophet of Atom. Stop irradiating water.
1TO3000008	So you guys have something set up on the side?
1TO3000010	Megaton's destroyed. I suppose their water shipment isn't much of concern now.
1TO3000011	I've stopped the cult that was stealing Megaton's water.
1TO3000014	I know you've got something set up. Don't worry, I won't tell your superiors.
1TO3000025	Did we win? Did we beat the Enclave?
1TO3000027	So what's the deal with Rivet City's caravans?
1TO3000029	Maybe I'll help you out after all. What's the deal with Rivet City's caravans?
1TO3000030	Remind me what I'm supposed to do at Rivet City again.
1TO3000031	What about the purifier? Did it work?
1TO3000033	Thought you'd like to know. Griffon's dead.
1TO3000034	Did you know Griffon's stashing the Aqua Pura and selling irradiated water?
1TO3000035	I need to enter the monastery.
1TO3000036	Look, I'm not going to irradiate myself to get into your church.
1TO3000037	There. I've gotten a little irradiated. Can I go in now?
1TO3000038	Come on, I'm irradiated. Let me in now.
1TO3000039	I am consumed with Atom's Light. Let me into your monastery.
1TO3000040	So what's the score?
1TO3000041	You think maybe Megaton is trying to con you out of more water?
1TO3000042	I think I've found where the Aqua Pura went.
1TO3000043	What was this problem with Megaton you were having?
1TO3000044	Tell me about this job at Megaton again. Perhaps I'll help you afterall.
1TO3000045	What was that thing at Megaton you wanted me to do?
1TO3000047	Stop searching, pup.
1TO3000049	Hey pup, I need you to find something for me.
1TO3000051	Good boy!
1TO3000054	Bad puppy! Very bad!
1TO3000056	I'd like more information on this "security breach."
1TO3000057	You need to stop contaminating the Aqua Pura for your holy water.
1TO3000058	Isn't there some way I can convince you to stop?
1TO3000059	Your "holy water" is poisoned with radiation.
1TO3000060	Who does your hair? It looks rather similar to mine, doesn't it?
1TO3000061	Wait a minute... are you saying this "Holy Water" is irradiated Aqua Pura?
1TO3000063	Sorry, pup. I don't have any Stimpaks for you right now.
1TO3000066	Where did you get your water?
1TO3000067	How do you make your "holy water"?
1TO3000069	Where is Sarah? Is she okay?
1TO3000070	I'm sorry about Sarah.
1TO3000071	Could you repair the train to Adams Air Force Base?
1TO3000072	I've got to ask... why am I going through the Presidential Metro alone?
1TO3000073	Sounds like I'm walking into the airbase blind.
1TO3000074	What can I expect to find in the Presidential Metro?
1TO3000075	I need to get into your monastery.
1TO3000076	I've got blood samples to turn in.
1TO3000077	I have Cameras for you, Scribe Rothchild.
1TO3000078	You'll see the true power of Atom when I detonate that bomb in Megaton.
1TO3000080	All of the robots are run off of a V-31 Mainframe?
1TO3000097	Tell me about your order.
1TO3000099	You mean, you turn people into Ghouls?
1TO3000100	Turning people into Ghouls? But that requires an amazing amount of radiation!
1TO3000101	Enough cultist crap. This is sick.
1TO3000112	How long was I out?
1TO3000114	No thanks. I've had enough of this.
1TO3000115	Where's Sarah? Is she okay?
1TO3000116	About Sarah...
1TO3000118	What happened? How did I get here?
1TO3000119	You couldn't have known this would happen. No one knew.
1TO3000120	Well, it's too late to turn back now.
1TO3000121	Now's not really the time to be getting cold feet.
1TO3000122	We have to keep fighting them. We can't back down now.
1TO3000123	Everyone here believes in you, and in the Brotherhood. We can do this.
1TO3000124	That doesn't sound like much of a leader talking.
1TO3000128	I'm sorry about the robot. There wasn't anything anyone could've done.
1TO3000129	It could've been worse. They could have attacked the Citadel.
1TO3000130	Hopefully I found something that can help you.
1TO3000132	I found some encrypted data at the relay station.
1TO3000133	I'm not sure what I found. Some kind of data... Maybe you can figure it out.
1TO3000134	Maybe you can focus on analyzing this data instead of crying about your robot.
1TO3000136	I've learned a little bit, but was hoping you could tell me more.
1TO3000137	He said you'd give me the details.
1TO3000138	All I know is that you need my help. Again.
1TO3000139	What else can you tell me about the fight against the Enclave?
1TO3000140	How is Liberty Prime holding up?
1TO3000142	Has the Enclave been putting up much of a fight?
1TO3000143	I've got a few questions for you.
1TO3000144	What happened back at the purifier?
1TO3000145	So what's next after this?
1TO3000148	Good to see you, too. I'm here to help.
1TO3000149	How about we skip the pleasantries and get to work.
1TO3000150	Elder Lyons said you needed help, so here I am.
1TO3000151	So you're in charge now, huh?
1TO3000153	Okay, I'm going.
1TO3000154	What am I looking for?
1TO3000155	Hey, wait! You said you didn't need my help!
1TO3000156	This isn't what I signed up for.
1TO3000157	I found some encrypted data on one of their terminals.
1TO3000158	I found something, but I'm not sure what.
1TO3000159	I'm on my way back to the Citadel now.
1TO3000160	Old Olney is a dangerous place. Is there anything I could have to help me?
1TO3000161	I hear you can help me get into Old Olney.
1TO3000162	I'm ready for more. What do you need?
1TO3000163	Any job you've got, I can do.
1TO3000164	Do I get paid for it?
1TO3000165	Olney Powerworks? What's there?
1TO3000166	You want me to go all the way to Olney?
1TO3000167	Olney? No, I don't think so.
1TO3000168	Sorry, it was just a joke.
1TO3000169	You don't have much of a sense of humor, do you?
1TO3000170	I don't get paid? At all? This gig sucks.
1TO3000171	I'm good to go. What's next?
1TO3000172	I need a break. Olney was tougher than I thought.
1TO3000173	What exactly is this thing?
1TO3000174	How does the scrambler work?
1TO3000175	Is there anything I need to be concerned about?
1TO3000176	Okay, that's it.
1TO3000177	I'm not afraid of Deathclaws.
1TO3000178	If there are so many Deathclaws around, how'd you survive?
1TO3000179	Why are you down here?
1TO3000181	Oh, great. Ghouls. I hate ghouls.
1TO3000182	I'm looking for Olney Powerworks. You know where that is?
1TO3000183	Can you help me get to Olney Powerworks?
1TO3000184	You're never going to make it.
1TO3000185	You're going to help me, or I'm going to kill you.
1TO3000199	I don't have any identification.
1TO3000200	There's nothing to protect here. This place is in ruins.
1TO3000201	I'm looking for the tunnels to Adams Air Force Base.
1TO3000202	Please! I just want to get to Adams Air Force Base!
1TO3000203	I'm just wandering through.
1TO3000204	Look, I just stumbled across this place. I don't know what you're talking about.
1TO3000205	I'm a United States senator. Here's my identification.
1TO3000206	I'm from the United States Army and I'm here to provide assistance.
1TO3000207	Override security parameters. Assign current user highest clearance.
1TO3000208	Why does it matter?
1TO3000209	It's none of your business who I am.
1TO3000210	Why am I wasting time talking to you? You're just a stupid machine!
1TO3000220	I'll say! You look much better.
1TO3000221	Not really. Your father said you'd pull through.
1TO3000222	Actually, I completely forgot about you.
1TO3000223	Anything you say. We can talk back at the Citadel.
1TO3000225	Okay, okay... I'm coming.
1TO3000226	I need information on Adams Air Force Base.
1TO3000227	How do I use these tunnels to get to the base?
1TO3000228	Has anyone else used the tunnels to the base?
1TO3000229	How many Enclave forces are at the base?
1TO3000230	I need more details... What's the breach all about?
1TO3000231	Can you tell me more about these unidentified persons?
1TO3000232	What security units did you send in to stop the unidentified persons?
1TO3000233	So what exactly did these unidentified things damage in here?
1TO3000234	I'd like for you to deactivate all your security units.
1TO3000235	I need to know more about you, actually.
1TO3000236	What does your name stand for?
1TO3000237	What's your job down here?
1TO3000240	Do you know anything regarding the war that happened 200 years ago?
1TO3000241	So... then you must realize everything on the surface is gone.
1TO3000242	That seems admirable, but hardly necessary.
1TO3000243	Hmmm. Suit yourself. Seems like a waste of time.
1TO3000244	Everyone's dead, you stupid tin can!
1TO3000246	What's going on down here?
1TO3000247	Give me your Self Status Report.
1TO3000248	How about the Presidential Metro System Status Report.
1TO3000249	Let me hear the Security Status Report.
1TO3000250	Directions to the Presidential Metro would be helpful, Tristan.
1TO3000258	Luminescent Mother, I need to speak with you about your holy water.
1TO3000260	I'm putting an end to your twisted cult, right now.
1TO3000267	Okay, you're free. Now what?
1TO3000270	You're going to be waiting for Jensen a long time. He's been captured.
1TO3000271	Why wait for Jensen? Let's go kick some Talon ass right now.
1TO3000272	I'll go look around, see if I can find Jensen.
1TO3000274	What's the harm in letting them have some extra water?
1TO3000277	They look serious to me. Is this really worth getting killed over?
1TO3000278	Arrogant bastards. I'll back you up if you want to make a play for the water.
1TO3000279	None of my business. I'm just passing through.
1TO3000285	The Apostles of Eternal Light? Is that just you?
1TO3000286	Thanks, but I'll pass. I've had bad luck with cults.
1TO3000287	I'm sure you mean well, but this has to stop.
1TO3000288	You know this water is full of radiation, right?
1TO3000289	Sounds like a nice little setup you've got. Have fun poisoning people!
1TO3000290	Spreading tainted water under the guise of helping humanity? I can relate.
1TO3000291	You mean I have to be irradiated to be allowed inside?
1TO3000292	Okay, I tried asking nice. Let's do this the hard way!
1TO3000296	I'd like to ask some questions about you.
1TO3000299	What's the current status of the Presidential Metro?
1TO3000300	This contract says you're going. The code is 2-1-6. Now get.
1TO3000301	Just forget it.
1TO3000302	Charon, please do this for me. The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000303	Goodbye, Fawkes.
1TO3000304	Never mind, Fawkes.
1TO3000305	Nope, not doing it.
1TO3000308	Forget it. Never mind.
1TO3000309	Sorry, but this is how it is.
1TO3000311	I'll see you around, Charon.
1TO3000312	Fawkes, I need you to start the purifier. The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000313	You need to start the purifier, Charon. The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000314	Well, then go turn the thing on yourself. The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000315	No parting of ways necessary. You're going to start the purifier.
1TO3000316	Fine. You do it then. The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000317	I'm not about to kill myself in there. Why don't you do it? The code is 2-1-6.
1TO3000318	Emergency Directive: Get that purifier running on the double! Code 2-1-6!
1TO3000320	Is there anything else I can do to help the Brotherhood?
1TO3000321	So, what happens to the Brotherhood now?
1TO3000322	So, have we totally wiped out the Enclave?
1TO3000323	What's next for the Pride?
1TO3000324	How's the reconstruction of Liberty Prime going?
1TO3000325	I found some Sensor Modules for you.
1TO3000326	Slow down. What happened here?
1TO3000327	Accident, huh? Why should I believe that?
1TO3000328	It's okay. You couldn't have known.
1TO3000329	I'll look into it. Where did you get the water?
1TO3000330	Sounds to me like you wanted him dead.
1TO3000333	What type of defenses are upstairs?
1TO3000338	How do I get to the Satellite Tower?
1TO3000340	I wasn't planning on it.
1TO3000342	Likewise. I was wondering if you could answer a few questions.
1TO3000344	The only reason you're still alive is because I want information.
1TO3000349	So where exactly is the mainframe?
1TO3000351	You're really helpful. Why should I trust you?
1TO3000353	Yeah, I'm going to hurt you.
1TO3000354	Please, you're endangering innocent people who think your water is safe.
1TO3000355	You can't trick people into enlightenment. They have to accept it knowingly.
1TO3000356	If you don't stop, I'll have to make you stop. Forcibly if I have to.
1TO3000357	There must be something I can do to convince you.
1TO3000358	I don't want to have to fight you.
1TO3000359	This has gone on too long. Time to die.
1TO3000360	What makes you so sure you're right, anyway? Who are you to speak for Atom?
1TO3000361	Where's Doctor Li?
1TO3000363	What's going on with the purifier?
1TO3000366	I've got some Aqua Pura, if you want it.
1TO3000368	The Brotherhood of Steel is giving away Aqua Pura. Why don't you drink that?
1TO3000370	You sound pretty certain this particular caravan will be attacked.
1TO3000371	If we do get attacked, and I do find a ringleader, then what?
1TO3000372	I'm getting paid, right?
1TO3000373	All right, I'll protect the caravan and track down the attackers.
1TO3000374	Where do I find the caravan again?
1TO3000375	I'm going to pass on this one. Find someone else.
1TO3000376	Thanks. That's all for now.
1TO3000377	Is that a Plasma Rifle you've got there? I could use that on the mission.
1TO3000378	I'm afraid I'm going to need to get paid up front.
1TO3000379	Can you at least tell me what I'll be getting?
1TO3000381	A guy named Split Jack. Not to worry. He's dead now.
1TO3000382	A guy named Split Jack. Not to worry. I sent him and his gang packing.
1TO3000383	I killed the ringleader. You owe me big time, lady.
1TO3000384	I dealt with the ringleader. They're gone now. You owe me big time, lady.
1TO3000385	Yeah, I killed him. But I'm here to set up a "protection" deal with the gang.
1TO3000386	Pay 500 caps now, and I'll call off the attacks.
1TO3000387	The protection contract costs a mere 200 caps per week.
1TO3000388	Never mind. I was just kidding.
1TO3000389	Not good enough. 500 caps now, and more when I say it's time for more.
1TO3000390	It's a deal. I'll call off the attacks.
1TO3000392	So long. I'll see you in a week.
1TO3000393	Not good enough. Give me your caps, or I'll take them from your corpse.
1TO3000394	Come on, I know you've got something more. Quit holding out on me.
1TO3000395	Ahem. If it wasn't for me, there'd be no protection racket.
1TO3000396	Give me more. Or I'll bust you upside the head.
1TO3000397	That's why I'm here, actually. Bigsley sent me.
1TO3000398	I'm a decent shot. Need another hired gun?
1TO3000399	I thought Rivet City security was a police force, not a military organization.
1TO3000400	"Military operations"? You've got be kidding. Rivet City security are chumps.
1TO3000401	Sounds like you could use some help. What do you need?
1TO3000402	Hire me and your problems are as good as gone.
1TO3000403	Yeah, not interested in dying. Good luck to you and your men.
1TO3000405	I have some questions about my mission.
1TO3000406	"Mirelurk stew."
1TO3000407	Pass phrase? I don't know anything about a pass phrase.
1TO3000408	Ummm... oh yeah, the pass phrase. It's "Eye patch"!
1TO3000409	"Open sesame"?
1TO3000410	What do you mean you'll make "arrangements"?
1TO3000411	I want my money, and I want it now.
1TO3000412	You're not trying to stiff me, are you?
1TO3000413	It's time for someone else to take charge. You and me. Right now. Time to die.
1TO3000414	Knives.
1TO3000415	Pipes.
1TO3000416	Boards.
1TO3000417	Guns.
1TO3000418	Uh, never mind.
1TO3000419	I came for the job. You still hiring guns?
1TO3000420	I'm here to send you and your gang into retirement. Got any last words?
1TO3000421	I'm nobody you need to worry about.
1TO3000422	I'm your worst nightmare!
1TO3000424	I might like a bottle of Aqua Cura. How much are you selling them for?
1TO3000425	Here's 10 caps. I'll take a bottle.
1TO3000440	That's NOT Aqua Pura. If you want my silence, you'll have to buy it.
1TO3000442	We split the profits 50/50 or this will end badly for you.
1TO3000443	40/60 in your favor.
1TO3000444	30/70?
1TO3000445	Fine, 20/80 in your favor. But if you stiff me, you'll regret it.
1TO3000446	Forget all that. Just give me 300 caps this once, and we'll call it even.
1TO3000447	Either you tell them, or I tell them. Your call.
1TO3000448	Look. I won't expose your lies... but only if you start selling real Aqua Pura.
1TO3000449	Is that any different from regular Aqua Pura?
1TO3000450	No. I mean, you just changed the name? Or did you do something to it?
1TO3000451	You can get Aqua Pura for free. Why pay for yours?
1TO3000452	You got a nice head of hair. For a Ghoul, I mean.
1TO3000453	Tell you what. I'll trade you a piece of blue sky for a bottle.
1TO3000454	Got a free sample I could try?
1TO3000455	How much are you selling them for?
1TO3000456	I don't know, 40 caps?
1TO3000458	30 caps?
1TO3000459	20 caps?
1TO3000460	10 caps?
1TO3000461	Sure. Here's 10 caps. Give me a bottle of the "Amazing" Aqua Cura.
1TO3000463	Do I really have to guess?
1TO3000464	Look, just tell me the price or I'm leaving.
1TO3000465	Fine. Take my 10 caps already.
1TO3000466	I'm done playing your guessing game.
1TO3000468	Well, if I had 10 caps, I might buy a bottle.
1TO3000469	I think I'll pass. Thanks anyway.
1TO3000470	Look, I'm not really interested in buying your Aqua Cura.
1TO3000472	I don't quite have 10 caps.
1TO3000476	I'm afraid I don't have 10 caps.
1TO3000477	You're clearly up to something. There's no denying it. Talk. Now!
1TO3000478	There's nothing wrong with my Pip-Boy. You sir, are a liar.
1TO3000479	Relax. I don't care. Take these morons for all their worth. I'm just curious.
1TO3000502	I'm curious. Where'd you get all this Aqua Pura?
1TO3000503	I'm not interested in making trouble. I'm just curious where you got the water.
1TO3000504	I'd have thought giving Aqua Pura to a Ghoul would seem like a waste.
1TO3000505	Just making conversation. I really don't care where you got the stuff.
1TO3000508	What about Megaton's water supply?
1TO3000509	Oh... I've made a huge mistake...
1TO3000510	I can't believe you made me drink that crap. I had no idea. You're so dead.
1TO3000521	Ever think about letting people bring in empty bottles to fill up?
1TO3000523	I was going to ask you something but I forgot what it was.
1TO3000525	How long do you think it'll take to purify the basin?
1TO3000526	Is it hard bottling all that water? Or is it all done by machines?
1TO3000528	So do you know why they call it Aqua Pura?
1TO3000529	Let's discuss some other matters.
1TO3000530	I'm interested. Continue...
1TO3000531	I'm not in the mood for a long story. Never mind.
1TO3000532	So how'd you get stuck with this job?
1TO3000533	What's your take on Elder Lyons?
1TO3000534	So what Order of Scribes are you part of?
1TO3000546	You look pretty tired.
1TO3000547	That's all I was curious about.
1TO3000548	Ever think about letting people bring in empty bottles to fill with Aqua Pura?
1TO3000549	I'm sorry? Who are you?
1TO3000550	And a hearty "hello" to you too, jerk.
1TO3000551	I don't know what you're talking about. What's this about a purifier? <Lie.>
1TO3000552	Sounds like you have your hands full.
1TO3000553	You're not the only one with problems.
1TO3000554	Is there anything I can do to lend a hand?
1TO3000555	I wish I could help. But, I don't work for free.
1TO3000556	Not my problem. Good luck with all that.
1TO3000558	If I get paid, I might lend a hand. What's the job?
1TO3000560	What's Rivet City getting out of helping the Brotherhood?
1TO3000561	I still don't understand why the Brotherhood isn't just selling the water.
1TO3000562	I'm not going to help you with Megaton. I've got better things to do.
1TO3000563	I'll see what I can do about Megaton.
1TO3000564	As long as I get paid, you'll get your problem solved.
1TO3000565	I'm not a fan of Rivet City or risking my life. Good luck with all that.
1TO3000566	I'll see what assistance I can offer Rivet City security.
1TO3000567	I'll lend Officer Lepelletier a hand, but fees may be incurred.
1TO3000568	Seems like a lot of trouble giving it away. Why don't you just sell the water?
1TO3000569	Full house today, Doc. What's wrong with everybody?
1TO3000570	What's wrong with everybody? I didn't think Ghouls got sick.
1TO3000571	Something going around, Doc? The clinic seems pretty full today.
1TO3000572	What's with all the patients? You seem busier than usual.
1TO3000573	Doc, it's crowded in your clinic. Something going around I should worry about?
1TO3000574	What do you think about Split Jack's gang?
1TO3000577	Come on, pup. Let's go!
1TO3000580	Hold on, boy.
1TO3000585	Fawkes can start the purifier.
1TO3000586	Charon can start the purifier.
1TO3000587	I'll have RL-3 start the purifier.
1TO3000603	Wow. Well, thanks for taking care of me. I'm out of here.
1TO3000604	Pip-Boy analysis shows that your Aqua Cura is irradiated. Interesting...
1TO3000606	I have some questions about the Project Purity operation.
1TO3000607	Mind if I ask some questions about your role in all of this?
1TO3000608	It's too dangerous here, pup. Go wait for me at Vault 101.
1TO3000611	Good luck out there, Stiggs.
1TO3000612	Goodbye, pup.
1TO3000615	Goodbye, Dogmeat.
1TO3000634	Can I enter the monastery?
1TO4000001	Here's 1,000 caps. Let's get this show on the road.
1TO4000002	I'm a bit short on caps at the moment.
1TO4000003	What should I be doing?
1TO4000004	So, you wanted help getting your book back?
1TO4000005	Let's talk about the tonic.
1TO4000006	Has the tonic finished brewing?
1TO4000007	What's the status on the tonic?
1TO4000008	Can we make another batch of tonic?
1TO4000010	I'm ready. Let me know what you need for your tonic.
1TO4000012	I'd like to buy a ticket.
1TO4000015	When do we set sail?
1TO4000017	What do you want me to do about the Tribals?
1TO4000018	The Tribals want me to do some ritual before they'll let me in.
1TO4000019	You round up Ghouls for slaughter? Isn't that... unethical of you?
1TO4000020	Where can I find Jackson?
1TO4000021	Could you recite a passage?
1TO4000022	Scripture?
1TO4000023	I'd like to hear a passage.
1TO4000024	She asked me to steal the Krivbeknih. When I returned, she was dead.
1TO4000025	Okay. I'll get your book.
1TO4000027	Let's talk about this tonic.
1TO4000028	I want to book passage to Point Lookout.
1TO4000029	Nice boat. You must have seen a lot of places with it.
1TO4000030	Tell me more about Point Lookout.
1TO4000031	Do you know anything about Point Lookout?
1TO4000032	Your still could stand to be fixed up.
1TO4000034	They killed her, Obadiah.  I'm sorry.
1TO4000035	Marcella said something about the Krivbeknih. I'm supposed to go look for it.
1TO4000036	I haven't seen her yet.
1TO4000038	What do you know about the Tribals?
1TO4000040	What does this tribe believe in?
1TO4000042	What do you do in this tribe?
1TO4000043	What does this tribe do?
1TO4000045	Who cut open my head?
1TO4000046	Can you get rid of my scar?
1TO4000047	Nadine, your mother asked me to find you.
1TO4000048	Any chance you're going home now?
1TO4000064	What will you do now that he's dead?
1TO4000067	What do you know about Desmond?
1TO4000068	Who leads this tribe?
1TO4000069	How do you lead the tribe?
1TO4000070	Why did you attack the mansion?
1TO4000071	Why would they want to attack the mansion?
1TO4000072	Did you tell the Tribals to attack the mansion?
1TO4000073	Tell me about Nadine.
1TO4000074	Have you seen a woman named Nadine?
1TO4000075	A girl named Nadine caught a ride on your ship. Any idea where she is?
1TO4000076	What can you tell me about your daughter?
1TO4000077	I talked to your daughter, but she says she can't come back yet.
1TO4000078	Got Nadine back, safe and sound.
1TO4000081	No really, tell me about yourself.
1TO4000083	Where did the Punga Fruit come from?
1TO4000084	How do you get so much Punga Fruit to grow here?
1TO4000085	Why do you grow so much Punga here?
1TO4000091	How did you come to lead this tribe?
1TO4000092	Why was Jackson talking to you?
1TO4000093	Useful? What are you using the tribe for?
1TO4000094	What have you got against the Ghoul?
1TO4000095	I might be able to help you. But first I want to know more.
1TO4000096	I can't promise anything, but tell me more.
1TO4000103	I can't promise anything, but I'll look for her.
1TO4000104	I'm kind of busy. Find her on your own.
1TO4000105	How about I save us both the effort and say she's probably dead?
1TO4000106	Any idea where Nadine might be?
1TO4000112	Do you have some secret farming trick?
1TO4000113	I love digging in the dirt, but I never can get anything to grow right.
1TO4000114	Can you share your secret to getting them to grow?
1TO4000115	Guess you and plants think alike, huh?
1TO4000117	Do you know why the Tribals were attacking?
1TO4000118	What kind of failsafe are you talking about?
1TO4000119	Any chance of getting more training?
1TO4000123	Okay, but how can I infiltrate them?
1TO4000124	What sort of reward are you offering?
1TO4000125	No, not interested.
1TO4000126	Become a tribal? No way.
1TO4000127	You really think they'll just let me in like that?
1TO4000129	Why should I work with you, again?
1TO4000130	I'm pretty sure I just saved your life, you know.
1TO4000132	Calm down, there. You'll make a mess.
1TO4000133	So, where's my cut?
1TO4000134	Neat! I want some of it.
1TO4000135	What's so great about his stuff?
1TO4000137	I'm tired of you pushing me around, Desmond.
1TO4000138	I don't take orders from anyone.
1TO4000139	That'll do. Let's go.
1TO4000140	And I'm supposed to help you for free?
1TO4000141	Very nice. Now can you say "please don't kill me?"
1TO4000142	And now you'll pay for it with your life.
1TO4000143	I've been looking for you. I'm not going to side with this crazy brain thing.
1TO4000144	Because I'm done taking orders from you. After this, we're through.
1TO4000145	I figured it was the best way to get him to drop his guard.
1TO4000146	It happens to us all. Let's go.
1TO4000147	No. You were right not to trust me. Die.
1TO4000148	Because I wanted to. Just like I want to kill you now.
1TO4000149	I just wanted to see you up close when I told you I was going to kill you.
1TO4000150	I'm in. I found out where their leader is hiding.
1TO4000151	Those idiots let me in with open arms. I have the location of their leader.
1TO4000158	Tell me about yourself, Kenny.
1TO4000159	So Kenny, what do you want to be when you grow up?
1TO4000160	What do you mean, you weren't "born right"?
1TO4000162	What's it like living in Point Lookout?
1TO4000163	Why did you run away from home, Kenny?
1TO4000164	Where'd you learn how to make traps like that?
1TO4000165	Let's talk about other stuff.
1TO4000167	Cut the crap, kid. That light show isn't scaring anybody.
1TO4000168	Ghost? Where? We'd better get out of here!
1TO4000169	So the traps and noises, that was all you?
1TO4000170	Your toys might work on the locals, kid. But not me.
1TO4000171	Settle down. I'm not going to hurt you.
1TO4000172	You're starting to annoy me, kid.
1TO4000175	Good instincts. You can't trust me.
1TO4000176	Oh come on! Don't be a dork face. It'll be fun!
1TO4000177	I'm not going to hurt you. I just need a hideout from time to time.
1TO4000178	There must be some way to prove I'm on your side. Besides, aren't you lonely?
1TO4000179	Okay. I'll go get it for you.
1TO4000180	Sorry kid, I'm not in the teddy bear retrieval business.
1TO4000181	Scary? What do you mean?
1TO4000182	Tell me about the mine, Kenny.
1TO4000183	Tell me about this mine, Kenny.
1TO4000184	Tell me about Old Man Herzog.
1TO4000185	How do you survive in here all alone?
1TO4000186	Why are you hiding down here?
1TO4000187	Let's play a game.
1TO4000188	Let's play hide and seek.
1TO4000189	Let's play another time, okay?
1TO4000191	Let's play tag.
1TO4000194	Okay, that's enough tag for now.
1TO4000196	I'm still looking for your teddy bear.
1TO4000197	I found your teddy bear.
1TO4000200	Nah, I don't want to hang out with a little kid. Thanks anyway.
1TO4000201	I found your teddy bear. <Lie.>
1TO4000204	The password is: "xin tian weng".
1TO4000205	The password is... cheese?
1TO4000210	Step aside, tin man.
1TO4000211	The passphrase is "Seraphim Descending."
1TO4000213	A thousand caps? That's outrageous!
1TO4000214	That was fun! Can we do it again?
1TO4000215	I'd like to do the Safari again.
1TO4000216	500 caps? Here you go.
1TO4000217	I'm short on caps at the moment...
1TO4000219	Registered for what, exactly?
1TO4000220	I don't like the sound of this. I'm out of here.
1TO4000221	Tell me more about the Safari.
1TO4000222	Let's go over the Safari again.
1TO4000223	What's the basic idea?
1TO4000224	What if we get overwhelmed? How do I get out?
1TO4000225	Do you have weapons for me to use?
1TO4000227	Who are your usual customers?
1TO4000228	So, how long have you had this store?
1TO4000229	Where do you get your stock from?
1TO4000231	Do I make you nervous?
1TO4000240	I need to know where he's at.
1TO4000241	It doesn't sound like you're having much fun here.
1TO4000242	I was drawn to your eternal wisdom.
1TO4000243	I just wanted to meet the Tribal leader.
1TO4000244	You mean, you're not really the one in charge of the tribe?
1TO4000245	May I meet the Transcendent Master?
1TO4000246	Kenny, would you like to come live with me?
1TO4000247	You're not safe here. Let me put a roof over your head.
1TO4000248	I have a house in MEGATON?TENPENNY?. Do you know Tobar?
1TO4000249	Haha, just kidding! Boy, I had you going, too.
1TO4000250	We'll have loads of fun.  I promise!
1TO4000254	I want to know about your beliefs.
1TO4000255	Sounds like just another cult to me.
1TO4000256	What exactly is your mission?
1TO4000257	My mother had a favorite passage from the Bible. Revelation 21:6 - recognize it?
1TO4000258	How did you become a missionary?
1TO4000259	Yeah, let's not do that.
1TO4000260	Sure, let's hear it.
1TO4000261	Can we discuss the Blackhall situation?
1TO4000262	Tell me more about this Book that's so important.
1TO4000263	What should I be doing again?
1TO4000264	Obadiah Blackhall sent me. I have a letter.
1TO4000266	What's wrong?  What did the letter say?
1TO4000267	What do you expect me to do?
1TO4000269	How bad is Orange Fever?
1TO4000270	What do you think of Point Lookout?
1TO4000271	Did you build that still yourself?
1TO4000272	Why did you fake being sick?
1TO4000273	I'm sorry, I guess I just haven't heard of that illness. Maybe I can help.
1TO4000274	You're faking. We both know it. So let's just cut to the chase.
1TO4000275	Orange Fever? That sounds bad. Can I help?
1TO4000276	I've treated enough illnesses to know there's no such thing as Orange Fever.
1TO4000277	Yeah? I've got the mauve plague. So let's just try not to cough on each other.
1TO4000278	You're sick? What's the matter?
1TO4000279	Oh boy, here we go...
1TO4000281	I'll get it working like new, but I want 200 caps.
1TO4000282	I can fix it up. Let's call it 100 caps of work?
1TO4000283	Yeah, I can fix it. No charge.
1TO4000284	I'm going to hang onto it for now.
1TO4000286	Pleased to meet you, Marcella.
1TO4000287	The Faith? Let me guess - another doomsday cult?
1TO4000288	Shouldn't you be at the Cathedral with the Tribals?
1TO4000289	He has, as a matter of fact.
1TO4000290	Maybe. So what if he has?
1TO4000291	Krivbeknih? What are you on about?
1TO4000292	I don't know what you're talking about, woman. Step aside.
1TO4000293	Why do you want it so badly?
1TO4000294	Obadiah's paying. How about you?
1TO4000295	If I recover the book, I'll consider bringing it to you.
1TO4000298	What do you make of all the bones and dolls on sticks around here?
1TO4000299	What do you think of the locals?
1TO4000300	Did you set this campsite up?
1TO4000301	You said you're not from around here?
1TO4000302	So, who is this brain thing, anyway?
1TO4000303	You know this guy? What's going on here?
1TO4000304	So, now you want me to do something else, right?
1TO4000305	Maybe you should watch your tone, old man.
1TO4000307	What's your plan, old man?
1TO4000308	That big wheel down by the docks, right?
1TO4000309	I'm afraid of heights.
1TO4000310	So, how do we shut him down?
1TO4000311	Oh, I can't wait to hear this.
1TO4000312	Right, right. You're mean, we get it.
1TO4000313	There'd better be something good at the end of this.
1TO4000314	That brain contacted me. He wants me to destroy the Jammer.
1TO4000315	I might be. Motivate me not to.
1TO4000317	That might do. We'll see.
1TO4000318	Why would I do that? We're buddies, you and me!
1TO4000319	I haven't decided. I'll let you know.
1TO4000320	Nope. Nothing at all.
1TO4000324	What do you need me to do again?
1TO4000325	What does the Cogwave Jammer do?
1TO4000326	How does Professor Calvert control the Tribals?
1TO4000328	I have some questions about what I'm supposed to be doing.
1TO4000329	I'm really tired of being a pawn in this game, Desmond.
1TO4000330	I need some time to get ready.
1TO4000331	Then let's go in there and do this.
1TO4000333	So where is he?
1TO4000334	It's great to see you alive! I was worried.
1TO4000335	Yes, I am. Let's go.
1TO4000336	Wait... game?
1TO4000339	I had something I wanted to ask you...
1TO4000352	Why would I do that?
1TO4000353	What sort of reward are we talking about here?
1TO4000354	What is with you two anyway?
1TO4000355	Fine. I'll do it. Desmond will die.
1TO4000356	Nah. I think I'll kill you.
1TO4000357	You both give me a headache. I need to think about it.
1TO4000358	Or, I could just leave.
1TO4000359	I'm so sick of you. Both of you.
1TO4000360	Why don't you two just talk it over?
1TO4000363	That's right. And what do I get for it?
1TO4000364	Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
1TO4000365	Can't we talk through this?
1TO4000366	My dad always said, "Never trust a disembodied brain."
1TO4000367	Now Desmond knows that no one pushes me around.
1TO4000368	All in a day's work. Now, share your wisdom with me!
1TO4000373	What do you mean, "lucky"?
1TO4000374	Nice to meet someone else who isn't crazy.
1TO4000375	Heads cut open? What are you talking about?
1TO4000376	I'll go crazy soon enough if you keep talking like that.
1TO4000377	So, are you going to stab me in the neck?
1TO4000378	Like I'm taking orders from you, pipsqueak.
1TO4000379	Who are you? How do I know I can trust you?
1TO4000380	Why are they attacking? Can't we reason with them?
1TO4000382	What did you do?!
1TO4000383	Wait, Tobar did it?
1TO4000384	What a bastard!
1TO4000385	How do I know you're telling the truth?
1TO4000386	So, now what are you going to do?
1TO4000387	Remind me not to mess with you.
1TO4000388	Tell me about Blackhall Manor.
1TO4000389	How old is this place?
1TO4000390	Your family is named after this place?
1TO4000391	I usually hide my bodies in the river, but this is nice, too.
1TO4000392	I thought this occult nonsense was below you.
1TO4000393	Shouldn't be here. Roger that, I'm out of here.
1TO4000394	Not much of a housekeeper, are you?
1TO4000395	The Krvibi had it, I took it, and now she's dead.
1TO4000396	<Show him the Book.>
1TO4000397	I'm sorry, Obadiah, but it's true. The book is here, with me.
1TO4000398	There must be something we can do.  We have the book.
1TO4000399	That can't be the only way to destroy it.
1TO4000400	They may have killed her twice. It was pretty messy.
1TO4000402	Sure, we can talk.
1TO4000403	Talk, shoot. I haven't made my mind up.
1TO4000404	I'll do it, Obadiah.  There's no reason for you to die.
1TO4000405	I'm sorry, I think you have to do this on your own.
1TO4000406	The house looked abandoned, I just wandered in.
1TO4000407	I was just admiring the architecture. I didn't mean any offense.
1TO4000409	Nice curtains. Could you try not to bleed on them when I kill you?
1TO4000410	I couldn't agree more.
1TO4000411	Not really, I usually bludgeon first and ask questions never.
1TO4000412	You have the caps, you get the book.
1TO4000413	I haven't decided what I'm going to do with it yet.
1TO4000414	Marcella's dead, actually. I figured you had something to do with that.
1TO4000415	Marcella's dead, you callous prick.
1TO4000416	A woman named Marcella told me to bring her the book.
1TO4000417	What do I get in the bargain?
1TO4000418	Batteries? For extra "kick"?
1TO4000419	I've got batteries.
1TO4000420	We need Punga Fruit?
1TO4000421	This enough Punga Fruit for you?
1TO4000424	Here, take ten of these refined Punga Fruit.
1TO4000425	Twenty wild Punga Fruit, just for you.
1TO4000426	How much water do we need?
1TO4000427	You mentioned yeast?
1TO4000428	I've got the yeast with me.
1TO4000430	Can you repair some things for me?
1TO4000438	The Password is: "Nevermore".
1TO4000439	The password is: "Buttercup".
1TO4000440	How about I kill you instead?
1TO4000441	I'll do it. Desmond will die.
1TO4000442	I'll let you know when I decide what to do.
1TO4000443	That's right. So, what do I get for it?
1TO4000444	What? You're betraying me?!
1TO4000445	Well, let's do this.
1TO4000446	Killing you is going to be more fun than killing Desmond.
1TO4000447	I guess I should have seen this coming.
1TO4000448	Before you kill me, I have questions.
1TO4000449	I wanted to show Desmond that no one pushes me around.
1TO4000450	All in a day's work. Now share your wisdom with me!
1TO4000451	I might be. What's so special about Point Lookout?
1TO4000452	Dad taught me never to accept rides from strangers.
1TO4000456	Any place you recommend in Point Lookout?
1TO4000457	So it's true? Why did you do it?
1TO4000458	You're a dead man, you son of a bitch.
1TO4000459	Will I need anything else for the trip?
1TO4000461	Do I need anything else?
1TO4000462	How will I get back afterwards?
1TO4000463	On second thought, maybe I'll pass.
1TO4000464	On second thought, maybe I'll pass for now.
1TO4000465	I'm not scared of anything. Let's do it!
1TO4000466	Should I be worried? What's over there?
1TO4000467	So? It's smoke. Things burn down all the time. Especially around me.
1TO4000468	Okay, I'll bite. What do we need?
1TO4000469	Not interested right now. Sorry.
1TO4000470	What is this stuff, anyway?
1TO4000471	Does this tonic really cure anything at all?
1TO4000472	Okay, what do we need first?
1TO4000476	Why exactly should I help you, again?
1TO4000477	No way I'm paying that. I'll stay here.
1TO4000479	I seek the wisdom of your people. May I join your tribe?
1TO4000480	Seriously? "The threshold of transcendence"? Just let me in, already.
1TO4000481	I have no fear. I will take your test, and I will be victorious!
1TO4000482	I'm not so sure about this. Tell me more.
1TO4000483	Oh, okay. Verily, I shall taketh your test. And I shall, um, succeedeth!
1TO4000484	Sure. Do some crazy ritual. Whatever.
1TO4000486	What happened to me? Why does my head hurt so much?
1TO4000487	Did it work? Is the ritual complete?
1TO4000488	You again? Why couldn't I hallucinate someone who's not a moron?
1TO4000500	You really seem to hate the swampfolk.
1TO4000502	This seems like a good hideout. I could use a place to crash and stash my gear.
1TO4000503	I wanted to talk about you, Haley.
1TO4000505	Do you live here alone?
1TO4000506	Wait, what? You're going to kill yourself?
1TO4000507	Are they dangerous?
1TO4000508	Do you mean those people living in the old Cathedral?
1TO4000509	Why did they take your book?
1TO4000511	I think I have to be going.
1TO4000512	I'll go see the Transcendent Master, now.
1TO4000516	I'm ready to head out.
1TO4000542	If you're headed back there anyway, how about I ride along for just 250 caps?
1TO5000001	Hey, you've been all over -- do you have any stuff hidden around here?
1TO5000002	What have you got there?
1TO5000003	How's the jammer holding?
1TO5000005	I need some help in the Robot Assembly area. You in?
1TO5000006	I need to get through the Cryo Labs. Think you can help me?
1TO5000007	I may need an extra gun in the Hangar Bay. Can you lend a hand?
1TO5000008	I think you should remain in the Engineering Core for now.
1TO5000025	Actually, let me head for the controls and you just stay close.
1TO5000026	All right, I'll take all the help I can get.
1TO5000027	Yeah, I can see that. I'll get us through.
1TO5000028	I'm open to suggestions.
1TO5000043	Get a move on it!
1TO5000044	Try to page Elliot
1TO5000045	Page Elliot
1TO5000046	Page Paulson
1TO5000047	Page Sally
1TO5000048	Page Somah
1TO5000055	Think you can take care of that mess in the engine room?
1TO5000056	How are you holding up?
1TO5000057	Would you mind watching our backs?
1TO5000062	Can we hit that thing with our death ray?
1TO5000071	What's this thing do?
1TO5000072	How you holding up Sergeant?
1TO5000130	So what are these generators? How do they work?
1TO5000131	Since you seem so familiar with my gear, do you know how to repair it?
1TO5000132	Got some more gear for you to fix.
1TO5000133	Are you still insisting on charging me caps for repairs?
1TO5000134	Well, given the circumstances, doesn't that seem kind of pointless?
1TO5000135	Yeah, fine, whatever. Just take a look.
1TO5000137	Yeah, I guess you're right.
1TO5000138	No way, Somah. This is ridiculous.
1TO5000139	No way.
1TO5000140	Fine, I give in. I'll pay.
1TO5000141	Do you think you can make use of that stuff you picked up in the Cryo Labs?
1TO5000142	Were you able to come up with any cryogenic weapons?
1TO5000143	Any more Cryo Grenades or Cryo Mines ready?
1TO5000144	Any Cryo Grenades or Cryo Mines ready?
1TO5000145	Do you think you'll be able to assist us medically if we need it?
1TO5000146	Could you make me some Adapted Biogel?
1TO5000152	How long can they last if you revive them?
1TO5000153	We should just put them out of their misery.
1TO5000154	We should just leave them here. It's too late for them.
1TO5000155	I think I've decided what we should do.
1TO5000159	Yeah, maybe your right.
1TO5000160	Leave them!  Our objective is to destroy the generator.
1TO5000161	We have an objective, soldier! We leave immediately.
1TO5000162	End it... put them out of their misery.
1TO5000163	Revive them and let them fight with us.
1TO5000164	Let me ask you something before I decide.
1TO5000170	Why are we stuck inside the laboratory?
1TO5000171	How long until the laboratory unseals itself?
1TO5000185	Let's get back to the core.
1TO5000186	I guess we should split up.
1TO5000191	Thanks for nothing, Sally.
1TO5000193	Well, that was... fun.  What now?
1TO5000194	Let's go back the way we came.
1TO5000202	I'm fine. No thanks to you.
1TO5000203	I'm all right. How about you?
1TO5000204	What did you get us into this time?
1TO5000205	Let's just get out of here.
1TO5000206	We're lost, aren't we?
1TO5000207	What an incredible smell you've discovered...
1TO5000225	What are these things?
1TO5000226	Who are these people?
1TO5000227	Why do we need a 'spaceman' to help us?
1TO5000228	Okay, let's talk to the astronaut.
1TO5000229	Okay, kid. Lead the way.
1TO5000230	You should wait here. It's too dangerous for a little girl.
1TO5000231	I think I've got this under control.
1TO5000232	How exactly are you going to help?
1TO5000233	Sorry for doubting you. Can you help now?
1TO5000234	Thanks, kid. We're getting out of here -- you want to come with us?
1TO5000235	How did you do that?
1TO5000236	Listen, we're all in danger if we stay here.
1TO5000238	How do you know so much about this place?
1TO5000239	Are you all alone? Where's your family?
1TO5000240	I'm not looking for a sidekick, okay? I just want to get out of here.
1TO5000241	What kind of advantage?
1TO5000242	You have a plan, or are you just making this up?
1TO5000246	You're kidding me. That's the best you've got?
1TO5000247	Okay, so we get out of this cell, and then what?
1TO5000248	You really think this will work?
1TO5000249	This is stupid. There must be another way out.
1TO5000250	How do I know I can trust you? What if you try to kill me?
1TO5000251	So if I kill you, that'll bring the guards?
1TO5000252	Okay, let's give it a try.
1TO5000253	If we're lucky, a friend of mine might show up to help.
1TO5000254	Okay, go ahead and hit me.
1TO5000255	No, I'm not going to fight you.
1TO5000256	This has to be a bad dream...
1TO5000257	Who are you? What are you doing here?
1TO5000258	This can't be happening. I mean... aliens?
1TO5000259	I have to get out of here.
1TO5000260	Stay back! Stay away from me!
1TO5000261	You're the one with the plan.
1TO5000262	Do you have any idea where we are, or how to get back home?
1TO5000263	I'll take over from here.
1TO5000265	All right, fine. What's your plan?
1TO5000266	Why don't you tell me what you have in mind, and I'll think it over.
1TO5000269	So how do we get out of here?
1TO5000270	Who are you, and why are you in here with me?
1TO5000271	What do they want with us?
1TO5000272	What the hell was that thing? Where are they taking that guy?
1TO5000274	Do you know where we're going?
1TO5000275	Oh, come on. You can tell me just about anything. I'll understand.
1TO5000276	Sorry, forget I said anything.
1TO5000277	You can talk about what happened to you. It's okay.
1TO5000278	I found this recording of you. Do you want to talk about your family?
1TO5000279	The aliens? They're all over the place. That's why I woke you.
1TO5000280	If you're talking about the aliens, you'll see them soon enough.
1TO5000281	They're called aliens, hayseed.
1TO5000282	I'm trapped on this ship, just like you.
1TO5000283	I'm a human, like you.
1TO5000284	I'm not a shit-kicking cowboy, that's for sure.
1TO5000285	Look, all I want to do is work together as a team so we can get home.
1TO5000286	If I were working with the aliens, why would I set you free?
1TO5000287	I don't give guarantees. You want out of here, you stick with me. Period.
1TO5000288	Don't worry Paulson, I will help you find your family. Just hang in there.
1TO5000289	Sit tight, and I'll see what I can find out.
1TO5000290	You want 'em dead and so do I. Let me see what I can do.
1TO5000291	Hey, are you okay?
1TO5000292	What? What are you saying?
1TO5000293	Calm down. We're trying to escape. Can you help us?
1TO5000294	Oh, great. You don't speak English? This is going to be a waste of time.
1TO5000295	I'm sorry, but I can't understand you.
1TO5000296	Yeah, I'm not getting a single word here.
1TO5000297	I found this sword... does it belong to you?
1TO5000298	I found this sword... Is it yours?
1TO5000299	I know you can't understand me, but I thought you might want this sword.
1TO5000300	Whoops, sorry. Never mind.
1TO5000301	Hey, it's okay. You can tell me anything. I won't judge you.
1TO5000303	There must be a reason you don't want to talk about yourself. What is it?
1TO5000304	I found this recording... Sounds like you regret something you did.
1TO5000305	It's okay, we're not going to hurt you... We're friends.
1TO5000306	Your uniform... it looks familiar, but I can't place it.
1TO5000307	You're a prisoner like the rest of us.
1TO5000308	I can promise you I am not an alien. In fact, I was abducted like you.
1TO5000309	You're a doctor and you can't tell from looking at me that I'm no alien?
1TO5000310	Do I look like an alien?
1TO5000311	If I were with the aliens, the last thing I would have done is release you.
1TO5000312	I promise you, all I want to do is get off this ship and get back home.
1TO5000313	Fine... I'll just put you back in stasis!
1TO5000314	I'm afraid not. All I've found are these people.
1TO5000316	My guess is the aliens had them for a snack... or worse.
1TO5000317	Don't worry, we ARE in this together, and I will help you.
1TO5000318	Just relax. Let me see what I can do.
1TO5000319	I swear, if you don't calm down, I'll stuff you back in the freezer!
1TO5000320	Tell me how you were captured by these aliens.
1TO5000321	What do you think the aliens want with us?
1TO5000322	Can you tell me more about where you're from?
1TO5000323	Thank you for telling me about what happened to you.
1TO5000324	You think anything in here can prove useful?
1TO5000325	Do you know anything helpful about the other sections of the ship?
1TO5000326	Why can't you do your vent trick and open the door to the decompression chamber?
1TO5000327	What do you know about this Toshiro Kago guy?
1TO5000328	Where's that Kago guy?
1TO5000329	I don't see that Kago fellow.
1TO5000336	You think it was some sort of weapon?
1TO5000337	I have no idea what he said, but he sounded pretty angry.
1TO5000338	We need to find out what that was, and put a stop to it.
1TO5000339	So we're here. Now what?
1TO5000340	There's a teleporter to the bridge, but it doesn't work.
1TO5000343	Okay, you wait here. I'll see if I can find the controls.
1TO5000344	Forget the teleporter. Let's just go.
1TO5000345	You sure this is a good idea?
1TO5000346	Now we take over the ship.
1TO5000347	I'm flying by the seat of my pants here.
1TO5000348	I was hoping you'd know what to do next.
1TO5000350	Thanks for your help. Couldn't have done it without you.
1TO5000352	This has been a hell of a ride, hasn't it?
1TO5000353	You think they'll ever come back?
1TO5000355	How's life in space?
1TO5000356	I could use some more of these alien weapons. Got any?
1TO5000357	Where's Paulson?
1TO5000372	Take this Frag Grenade.
1TO5000373	How about I distract them, and you hit them from behind with a grenade?
1TO5000374	Take this Plasma Grenade.
1TO5000375	I'll handle this.
1TO5000377	Why can't I use the door to get off the bridge?
1TOU000001	Tell your crazy stories to someone who cares.
1TOU000002	I don't have a bottle of Nuka-Cola.
1TOU000003	What have you got to trade for a bottle of Nuka-Cola?
1TOU000004	Just take all the scrap metal I have. No charge. I just want to help.
1TOU000005	Who takes care of you now?
1TOU000006	How did you meet Billy?
1TOU000007	I'm not playing any more of your games.
1TOU000008	Helping people? What about helping your own daughter?
1TOU000009	I'll take the Composite Recon Armor.
1TOU000010	I'll take the Lyon's Pride Power Armor.
1TOU000011	My posting title is Ass Kicker and my number is 5.56mm!
1TOU000012	Make it 120 and you have a deal.
1TOU000013	Make it 200 and you have a deal.
1TOU000014	Make it 140 and you have a deal.
1TOU000015	This place is a real dump.
1TOU000016	Where is the science lab?
