1ME0000001	An item's condition affects how well the item works, as well as its value. Weapons of lower condition will do less damage, and jam more frequently. Armor of lower condition will offer less Damage Resistance.
1ME0000002	You can repair items in your Pip-Boy by selecting Repair on the item. You can only do this if you have similar items to use for parts. Whatever item you choose to repair with will be scrapped completely.
1ME0000003	The degree to which damaged items can be repaired is dependent on your Repair skill. In many cases, if your skill is too low, you will not be able to repair a weapon or piece of apparel beyond its current condition.

1ME0000011	When you reach the required number of Experience Points, you will level up automatically, so long as you're not in combat.
1ME0000012	Every time you level up, your Health increases, you gain Skill Points to assign to your skills, and you can choose a new perk.
1ME0000014	When in dialogue with a character, simply select the response that seems most appropriate to the situation... and be prepared for the character you're talking with to react accordingly.
1ME0000015	Occasionally, you will be presented with a Speech Challenge. A Speech Challenge is a response preceded by the word "Speech" and the percentage chance of success; the higher your Speech skill, the greater the chance of success.
1ME0000016	Succeed in a Speech Challenge, and you'll achieve the results indicated by the response. Fail a Speech Challenge, and future Speech Challenges with that character will be lowered.
1ME0000017	You may also be presented with responses preceded by a certain Attribute or Skill, like [Strength] or [Science]. These responses are only visible if you have the minimum required value in the Attribute or Skill. So, there is never a percentage associated with these responses, because there is no way to "fail" them -- selecting a special Attribute or Skill response is always to your benefit.
1ME0000019	Some terminals are protected, and can't be accessed without a password. If your Science skill is high enough, you can attempt to hack the terminal.
1ME0000020	Selecting the correct password will grant you access. If your guess is incorrect, you will be shown how many letters match the correct password, and in the correct location.
1ME0000021	You have 4 tries to guess correctly. If you fail, the terminal will remain inaccessible until you own the password. You can exit hacking at any time and try again.

The number of attacks you can make is limited by your Action Points.
1ME0000039	The Barter screen allows you to trade, buy or sell items. The types of items that can be traded, bought, or sold depend on the person you're trading with. The prices you get for buying or selling depend on your Barter skill.
1ME0000040	To Barter, simply select an item and move it from your inventory into the other person's (if you want to sell or trade one of your own items) or from the other person's inventory into your own (if you want to buy or trade for one of their items).
1ME0000041	As items are moved back and forth, caps will also be automatically moved between both parties. This is represented by the large "caps" arrow in the middle.
1ME0000042	If the arrow is darkened, it means one of you doesn't have enough caps to complete the transaction. You cannot accept the barter if you don't have enough caps. But you can accept it if the other person doesn't have enough, but at this point, you are giving items away for free.
1ME0000046	When you are hurt, there are several ways to restore your health:

1ME0000049	* Eat food or drink water.
1ME0000050	* Sleep in a bed.
1ME0000052	The Maps are located in your Pip-Boy's Data section.
1ME0000053	The Local Map displays an overhead map of your current location, as well as any nearby doors.
1ME0000054	The World Map shows an overhead map of the entire Capital Wasteland area, and markers for any places that have been discovered during the course of your adventures. You can even fast travel directly to any place you have previously visited.
1ME0000055	You can zoom the maps in and out, or place (or move, or delete) a custom map marker.
1ME0000056	If your active quest has any quest targets, these will be displayed on both the Local and World Maps.
1ME0000057	On the World Map, your path to a quest target is indicated by a dotted line. In some cases, you may need to take a route through different areas, and the dotted line will reflect that.

1ME0000376	The aircraft above is the original Wright Flyer I designed by Orville and Wilbur Wright. On December 17, 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the vehicle performed its maiden flight for a mere 12 seconds, covering a distance of only 120 feet . This historic event marked the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.
1ME0000378	The Type 1861 "Springfield" Rifle-Musket was the standard weapon for the infantry soldier in the American Civil War. It was a muzzle-loaded weapon which fired a .58 caliber "Minie Ball" using percussion caps instead of the traditional flintlock. Almost a million of these weapons were manufactured for the soldiers during the war.
1ME0000379	On loan from the International Ordnance Museum, these cases display the various types of weapons and ammunition used by the military in past conflicts all over the globe.
1ME0000381	Perhaps the most well-recognized weapon in the modern U.S. Military arsenal, the M199 earned its nickname "The Backtalker" from the unusual report the firing mechanism makes as it ejects a spent shell. Firing standard 5.56mm rounds, the M199 is still the official infantry weapon of the U.S. Army.
1ME0000384	This is the only known prototype of the X277 "Viper" Magnetic Rail Cannon developed for the U.S. Military by West-Tek. Also commonly referred to as a "Railgun", the weapon uses energy cells to propel a depleted uranium round across a series of magnets discharging it at extremely high velocity. Deemed too costly to produce on a mass scale, the project was abandoned in 2044.
1ME0000387	This flag was recovered from the wreck of the U.S.S. Ebon Atoll, a U.S. Navy Missile Cruiser, sunk off the coast of Alaska in 2066 with all hands lost. The cutting edge vessel's loss was due to a nuclear torpedo strike from the U.S. Navy Submarine, the U.S.S. Interference during the Anchorage Campaign. The submarine mistook the cruiser for an enemy vessel during radio silence and sunk it before obtaining visual confirmation. This ranks as one of the most tragic disasters in U.S. Naval History since World War II.
1ME0000389	These portraits created by the renown Contemporary Artist Lincoln Myers depict some of the more overlooked American Inventors. From top to bottom, left to right: Richard G. Drew (adhesive tape, 1925), James Ritty (cash register, 1879), Carl C. Magee (parking meter, 1935) and Mary Anderson (windshield wiper, 1903).

1ME0000415	This is the actual USSA Deep Space Suit worn by Captain Carl Bell on May 5, 1961. Captain Bell is credited as being the first human in space on board the Space Capsule Defiance 7, but this has been constantly refuted by both the Soviet Union and China. Defiance 7's flight lasted for a total of 12 minutes and 7 seconds as it achieved one full revolution around the Earth.
1ME0000417	This is the actual skeleton of Captain Carl Bell who died on May 5, 1961 after his Space Capsule crash landed. Captain Bell is credited as being the first human in space on board the Space Capsule Defiance 7, but this has been constantly refuted by both the Soviet Union and China. Defiance 7's fight lasted for a total of 12 minutes and 7 seconds as it achieved one full revolution around the Earth. Donated by Edwina Bell.
1ME0000419	On July 16, 1969, the Virgo II Lunar Lander "Valiant 11" became the very first manned space vehicle to touch down on the moon. The Valiant 11's crew consisted of Captain Richard Wade, Captain Mark Garris and Captain Michael Hagen of the USSA. We salute these brave and noble men who took the very first steps on a planetary body other than our own.
1ME0000421	This unusual flag was recovered from the surface of the moon by the very last manned flight to its surface in 2052. The flag is from the old "Valiant 12" Virgo III Lunar Lander that touched down November 14, 1969. Its remarkable condition can be attributed to its construction; the flag is actually made of special materials to withstand the harsh environment of space.
1ME0000423	This exhibit is undergoing renovation and should return soon. Thanks!
1ME0000425	The Delta IX Rocket was donated by the United States Space Administration and by a grant from the United States Department of Antiquities.
1ME0000427	This is a scaled model of a prototype military transport vehicle being developed by the U.S. Military. The XVB02 "Vertibird" is a VTOL ("Vertical Take Off and Landing") craft with an extremely durable armored fuselage and can be armed with a variety of offensive weapons and defensive countermeasures. This is the most advanced aircraft of its kind ever developed, and the military hopes to press them into service by 2085.
1ME0000429	You notice that the freezer is a little smaller than all of the others. After closer inspection, you find that there is a secret compartment in the back. Unfortunately, it is locked and you are unable to pick it. There must be a key to open this lock.
1ME0000430	(Perception [%] passed)
1ME0000432	You see a secret compartment in the back of the freezer, just like the note said. However, you don't have the key to open the compartment. It must be back on the shelf of the storage room.

1ME0000513	Karma is an overall indication of your sense of good, evil... or neutrality.  Your Karma starts at Neutral, and changes based on your actions. It can go up to Good or Very Good, or down to Evil or Very Evil.
1ME0000514	Your Karma determines how people treat you, and whether many of them will help you or not.
1ME0000515	Achieving a particular Karma level comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Stay Neutral, and you don't have to worry about being hunted by law-abiding Regulators or heartless Talon Company Mercenaries. But, you'll then miss out on the benefits of being Good or Evil, like receiving special items or gaining access to restricted areas.

1ME0000543	To sneak or crouch, [%].
1ME0000545	Your health is low. You may want to use a stimpak or find some water to drink.
1ME0000547	Your stealth state is displayed when you crouch ([%]). [HIDDEN] means nobody detects you. [CAUTION] means someone is searching for you. [DANGER] means you have been detected by an enemy. How stealthy you are is affected by many factors: * Sneak skill: Your Sneak skill only helps you when you are crouching. The higher your Sneak skill, the easier it is to remain undetected, steal an item, or pick someone's pocket. * Line of sight: An enemy is much less likely to detect you if he can't see you. * Light level: You are harder to see in darker areas. * Movement: You are hardest to detect when motionless, easiest to detect when running. * Apparel weight: Heavier apparel makes more noise when moving. * Sound: Most melee weapons make very little noise; bigger guns make a lot of noise. Attacking while undetected gives you an automatic "sneak" critical.

1ME0000606	The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., allows you to pause the game, assess any combat situation tactically, and target the specific body parts of any enemies onscreen. Pressing and holding [%] will pause the game and scan the area of targets. To zoom in on an enemy, simply select it and release [%]. You are now able to target the individual body parts of that enemy. The percentage value next to a body part indicates the chance to hit that body part with each shot. The small bar next to the body part indicates its condition; when the condition of a body part is completely reduced, that body part is crippled, and the targeted enemy will suffer the obvious ill effects -- crippling the legs reduces movement speed and any lunging attacks; crippling the arms affects accuracy, etc. When using a melee weapon or unarmed combat, you will need to be close to have a chance to hit. Both melee and grenades are "full body" attacks, and you cannot specify a specific body part. Every attack on a body part uses up Action Points. Generally, the smaller a weapon, the fewer Action Points are required for every shot. Keep in mind that you're not limited to shooting at just one target -- at any time, you can switch available targets, and attack them as well, so long as you have remaining Action Points. When you've used up all of your Action Points, and are ready to leave V.A.T.S., press [%].

1ME0000722	In addition to showing the direction you are currently facing, your compass displays several other useful pieces of information.
1ME0000723	If you have an active quest, any quest targets will be displayed on your compass as arrows. A quest target will flash faster and faster as you get closer to it. If you have placed your own marker on the map, this will be displayed as a transparent arrow.
1ME0000724	People and creatures that you perceive are displayed on the compass as vertical bars. Red bars indicate enemies.
1ME0000725	Out in the Wasteland, the compass also indicates nearby locations as small triangles.
1ME0000727	The quest screen in your Pip-Boy's Data section tracks your progress in every quest you have undertaken. To the left is a list of quests: those with bright text are active; those with darkened text have been completed or somehow failed. Your active quest is marked by a small box.
1ME0000728	On the right-hand side of the screen are the objectives for each quest. The active objectives have bright text and are on the top of the list; the completed or failed objectives have darkened text and are at the bottom of the list. Some objectives are marked as "(Optional)," and their completion is not necessary to successfully finishing the quest.
1ME0000729	You can select any quest as the currently "active" one, or immediately view the location of the active quest's current target on the World Map (if the location is known). Quest Targets are show on your compass and maps for the active quest only.
1ME0000731	You can hotkey inventory items and then use or equip them without accessing your Pip-Boy.
1ME0000732	To hotkey an item, hold a number key (1-8) and then left-click on an item in your Pip-Boy.
1ME0000733	Now when the Pip-Boy is closed, you can use or equip that item simply by pressing the corresponding number key. Holding down any number key will display all of your current hotkey assignments.
1ME0000735	Crimes are divided into two categories: major and minor.
1ME0000736	Minor crimes cause only the victim to become hostile to you:
1ME0000737	* Theft: If the owner sees you steal something that she owns, she will try to take it back from you. If you try to escape, or persist in stealing from her, she will attack you (or run for help). If you fight back, you are now committing a major crime (Assault, see below).
1ME0000738	* Trespass: If the owner sees you open a locked door, container, or computer, he will immediately attack you.
1ME0000739	Major crimes cause the victim and the victim's friends to become hostile to you:
1ME0000740	* Assault: Attacking someone without provocation, or fighting back when someone attacks you for a minor crime.
1ME0000741	* Murder: If there are witnesses who care about the victim, they will become hostile to you.
1ME0000742	If a fight starts that you did not intend, you can attempt to yield by holstering your weapon. This may or may not be successful depending on how the attacker feels about you.
1ME0000744	* AG: Agility

1ME0000767	Each time you take a chem or drink alcohol, your chance of becoming addicted to it goes up. If you stop using the drug for a while, this chance will drop. Each drug has its own addiction chance, so using one type will not increase your chance of becoming addicted to another.
1ME0000768	Addiction will hurt some of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. These penalties go away temporarily if you take that drug again. A doctor can cure you of any addiction, for a price.
1ME0000769	You cannot become addicted to Stimpaks, Rad-X or RadAway.

1ME0000785	You can be exposed to radiation either directly from the environment, or by ingesting irradiated food or water. A small amount of radiation will not hurt you, but as your accumulated exposure goes up, you will begin to suffer ill effects, including death, eventually.
1ME0000786	Radiation Poisoning Effects:

1ME0000791	* 1000 rads: Death!
1ME0000792	Radiation Poisoning does not wear off, but can be healed by a doctor, or by taking RadAway. You can also protect yourself ahead of time by taking Rad-X, which increases your Radiation Resistance.
1ME0000793	Your accumulated radiation exposure is displayed in your Pip-Boy, in the Status section of the Stats tab.
1ME0000795	All the radio signals you have discovered are listed on the Radio screen in the Data tab of your Pip-Boy. Signals listed in bright text are within range, and can be listened to.
1ME0000796	Signals listed in darkened text have been discovered, but you are no longer within range -- in order to listen to one of these stations, you have to move back into the signal's receiving range.
1ME0000798	You now have radiation poisoning. Visit a doctor or take RadAway to lower your radiation level. You can also protect yourself ahead of time by taking Rad-X, which increases your Radiation Resistance.

1ME0001103	"Yeah? Up yours too, buddy!"
