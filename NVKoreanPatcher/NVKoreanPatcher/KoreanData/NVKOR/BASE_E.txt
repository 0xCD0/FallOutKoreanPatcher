TTW0000408	I told Joey this was a bad idea. I told him it stunk like rotten meat, yeah, but he didn't like that. No one tells Joey what to do. Joey does what he wants, and we follow.
TTW0000409	Yeah, we all follow - except me. Haha! Motherfuckers. I saw them coming before everyone else. First watch and I got the fuck out of there. Slipped out before anyone even knew they were coming - saw my chance and I took it.
TTW0000410	It's a goddamn shame, is what it is. A waste of fucking muscle. Way to go, Joey.
TTW0000411	I watched them rip open your guts and spill your insides onto the pavement - what a smell that would have been. Fucking ripe. Nasty.
TTW0000412	The survivor population continues to become more agitated. A group of three men were caught trying to sneak inside of the perimeter last night. They were arrested and escorted away without further incident, except for waking up the rest of the camp. I think we will see them again.
TTW0000413	We have to keep order. Just hold out until we can make contact with other units. Radiation sickness takes time. A woman was complaining of incessant itching all over her body. Her shirt had melted into the skin of her back. It was impossible to remove. There are so many bodies. We have to burn them to prevent disease from spreading.
TTW0000414	We have not been able to make contact with any other units in this area.
TTW0000415	The survivors have organized themselves and elected a leader. We negotiate with him now to distribute medicine and food. He understands that our supplies are nearly diminished. We all face dehydration and starvation. The first stages of radiation poisoning are showing now. Some are showing acute symptoms while others seem completely unaffected.
TTW0000416	Most of the survivors had been inside. They had been lucky enough to be in buildings that didn't collapse in rooms without windows or basements that shielded against the firestorm. The air is sucked out of your lungs. The fires burn so hot, consuming so much oxygen that people are pulled into them with the rushing wind. Parts of the city are still burning, far off in the distance.
TTW0000417	Funny - it's completely silent.
TTW0000418	Rumors started spreading that we were killing the sick and the old to save food for ourselves. The truth is we don't have any. Food - we ran out three days ago and just haven't told them, for fear this would happen. We have lost control.
TTW0000419	They marched on us before nightfall and demanded to be let beyond the perimeter. Hunger is a strong motivator. I heard the shot, and then we returned fire. Corporal Bradley was killed defending his post. One of them had found a pistol.
TTW0000420	We killed two men and one woman. The rest were dispersed with tear-gas. It was the same man that had been caught sneaking into the camp before. He had lost all of his hair.
TTW0000421	We are waiting now for them to come back. There is a national guard depot to the North. It may not be there anymore. We will try and make for this position in better hopes of making contact with other units.
TTW0000422	How will they greet us? How will we greet them?
TTW0000423	The toilet in 5th stall in the men's room on concourse 4 is STILL backed up and flooding the floor. I've gotten 5 complaints about it today! Somebody needs to get up here and fix this ASAP!
TTW0000424	I've got a light out in one of my fixtures. Can someone please come replace it for me?!
TTW0000425	Please disregard that previous message, for some reason it sent twice. Sorry!

TTW0000430	Chirst, Jerry! How many times have I told you NOT to turn on the security systems without letting people know?! That turret scared the fucking shit out of me. I swear if you do it again I'm taking this to HR.
TTW0000431	A notice to all employees. We will be running a drill on Sunday, October 24 regarding security systems and fast response. All personnel on normal shifts should be aware that this is a drill!

TTW0000434	Some senators just burst into my office here and said that the bombs have started to fall! They've demanded that I take them to shelter, so I'm taking them down into the fallout shelter on the emergency reactor sublevel for safety. If anyone finds this, come get us when this is all over!
TTW0000435	That's great Tom, she'll be happy to hear that.
TTW0000436	My husband is out of town next weekend. Can't wait to see you! XOXO
TTW0000437	The auto-start on the emergency reactor STILL doesn't work. This needs to be fixed ASAP! If the power goes out and that reactor doesn't kick on the station will go into security lockdown, and we do NOT want that to happen!

TTW0000490	What are you?
TTW0000491	Las Vegas? Your AI really thinks that I can get to Las Vegas from here? Fine, prove it.
TTW0000492	Sorry, I don't have that much money.
TTW0000493	Ok, I buy it but dont try to fool me, robot.
TTW0000494	Your robotic brain seems to be damaged. This is crazy. But thanks for the conversation.
TTW0000495	You were talking about a trip to Las Vegas earlier. Can you still arrange this trip?
TTW0000496	I want to buy a ticket to Las Vegas.
TTW0000497	I happen to have a spare 12.7mm Pistol
TTW0000498	I got this colt SSA, can you use it?
TTW0000499	I've got a 1911 you can use
TTW0000500	Here, take this 9
TTW0000501	I've got this hunting revolver, think you can handle it?
TTW0000502	I've got this custom Hunting Revolver, try not to break your wrist.
TTW0000503	Here, I took this Sequoia from a Ranger's corpse.
TTW0000504	Hmmm... think I could slip bigger weapons past the guards?
TTW0000505	Wow. Bringing up morale must be difficult.
TTW0000506	I can't take you right now, stay here. I'll come back for you.

TTW0000523	That's correct, it does. But we can work miracles with our holy water. Free of impurities this Aqua Pura is perfect for carrying Atom's blessing.
TTW0000524	Fine. 50/50 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week and I'll give you your share.
TTW0000525	Fine. 60/40 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week and I'll give you your share.
TTW0000526	Fine. 30/70 it is. But only of the profits. I still have to recoup my initial investment. You come back once a week and I'll give you your share.
TTW0000527	Really? All of it? Not even a single tattered paperback? Oh that's terrible. Just like the Library of Alexandria County. What a loss to the world.
TTW0000528	In light of your candor all I can promise is that Arefu will no longer be a target of the Family. Beyond that I make no such other promises.
TTW0000529	Normally I don't traffic in unsubstantiated rumor but... they say old Pinkerton is hiding out somewhere in Rivet City and that he did it.
TTW0000530	That's just what I would expect to hear from another spy from the Wasteland.You have one hour to leave the Republic of Dave or be executed.
TTW0000531	You drive a hard bargain friend. But seeing how we haven't been able to solve the problem ourselves, fine. You got a deal. But I expect results!
TTW0000532	Well yes, but it was hardly anyplace of importance until I arrived on the scene. That's all ancient history now. No one would ever care about it.
TTW0000533	That's just a technicality, really. This wasn't what you'd call a settlement until I whipped them all into shape. More of a camp, really.
TTW0000534	This is outrageous! Preposterous! Forced out by a bunch of dirty Ghouls and some bleeding heart activist? Where will I live? How will I get there?
TTW0000535	You horrible little zombie-lover! What right do you and your disgusting buddies have to push honest hardworking important people around like that?
TTW0000536	Alright, I suppose someone with medical training has to have at least a bit of compassion. And maybe you can talk some sense into the boy.
TTW0000537	I suppose. Just make it quick.
TTW0000538	Look. I can't let you in. If you did something stupid, it's my ass on the line. I'm not going to risk it. I need this job.
TTW0000539	You think pursuing the super mutants will be the death of Elder Lyons?
TTW0000540	I'm obviously in the wrong place. I'll just be on my way.
TTW0000541	I was impressed. Looks like you folk enjoy a fine selection.
TTW0000542	I didn't see anything alarming down there. People have to eat.
TTW0000543	Yeah... uh... I'm going home now.
TTW0000544	Doctors need to charge patients to cover the cost of treating them. Basic medical care is expensive.
TTW0000545	I understand you and Bittercup came here together.
TTW0000546	What's the history with you and Bittercup?
TTW0000547	If you keep messing with her your little club is going to get on the Overseer's shit list.
TTW0000548	Leave my friend alone!
TTW0000549	They killed her. They're eating her eyes right now. They're coming to eat yours next.
TTW0000550	I'd like to say I'm sorry.
TTW0000551	This fabulous negligee can be all yours for the low, low price of 300 caps!
TTW0000552	I like this and I'd pay 300 caps for it. So that's what I'm going to need to part with it.
TTW0000553	You popped out of nowhere and became a pain in my ass. 400 caps, including a convenience fee.
TTW0000554	I won't take less than 400 caps.
TTW0000555	You want this so bad, how about I stuff your corpse in it and use it in adult-themed puppet shows?
TTW0000556	If I'm risking my ass for breakfast cereal it better be worthwhile. 30 caps a box.
TTW0000557	You can't survive out here without protection. Why don't you come with me?
TTW0000558	Why don't you let me whisk you away from here?
TTW0000559	I heard you were having a half-price sale.
TTW0000560	I'm here right now, saves you having to take it to market. I'm not paying more than 50 caps.
TTW0000561	Slavery's a business, and businesses cost to operate. The information you need is worth 50 caps.
TTW0000562	We should split this up. No point in me killing you over it.
TTW0000563	We split the water or I use it to waterboard you, your call.
TTW0000564	You ever been killed before? Because if you don't back off you're going to be.
TTW0000565	Raiders don't rob, they kill. No one's ever heard of a wasteland mugger.
TTW0000566	Your robot looks like it's stuck in a diagnostic loop.
TTW0000567	It needs a hard reset, but to do that I need to remove some panels.
TTW0000568	The job's labor intensive, I'm going to need compensation.
TTW0000569	The problem was a shorting power supply. I had to disable it before it exploded.
TTW0000570	Your robot had dysfunctional hard disk. It's nothing to be ashamed of and affects 2 out of 5 robots.
TTW0000571	With a laser, you'd be asking with a blast of coherent light. Doesn't have the same ring, though.
TTW0000572	C'mon, twerp. Get your ass outside.
TTW0000573	Give me the fungus, or I'll blow the entrance and trap all your little shits underground.
TTW0000574	I think you kids over-estimate the value of your fungs.
TTW0000575	You've got better material than some comics I've seen.
TTW0000576	That was... um... really funny.
TTW0000577	The day I showed up here is going to best day of your life. For me, it's a Tuesday.
TTW0000578	C'mon, you can trust me.
TTW0000579	Why does Princess hate her nickname?
TTW0000580	Tell me why Princess is angry about her name.
TTW0000581	Where'd the other guard go? Lose her teddy bear?
TTW0000582	It's rough, but sometimes you have to lose people to learn how to not lose more in the future.
TTW0000583	If you don't use your mouth to talk to me I will slap it off of your face.
TTW0000584	Blowing me off is not a good idea.
TTW0000585	An outsider's perspective might help Leo see how much harm is addiction causes his family.
TTW0000586	He's showing obvious signs of jet addiction. I may be able to help him.
TTW0000587	Trust me. I'm a doctor.
TTW0000588	Moriarity's looking for money, not your life. If you give me the money I'll tell him you're gone.
TTW0000589	Just give me the caps and I'll tell him you're gone.
TTW0000590	Something I can do to help you get over whatever problem it is you have with me?
TTW0000591	Can't we just be friends?
TTW0000592	You need to adjust your attitude before I crack open your skull and use it as a toilet.
TTW0000593	You want that drink before or after I rip your tongue out?
TTW0000594	Give me back my money.
TTW0000595	Ever think about the futures you're throwing away? Not just yours, but Andy and Jenny's, too.
TTW0000596	You're hurting your family. Jenny and Andy care about you.
TTW0000597	I was yanking your chain. Dad spoke fondly of you.
TTW0000598	I was kidding! Dad talked about you all time. Now really, where is he?
TTW0000599	Jacking up the price is no way to get repeat customers. 100 caps was fair.
TTW0000600	Let's just take a step back. 100 caps was reasonable, wasn't it?
TTW0000601	I need any help you can give me to locate my father.
TTW0000602	If you gave me the password to Moriarity's terminal, it'll stick it to him and help me find my dad.
TTW0000603	Help me get into that terminal. Finding my Dad means everything to me.
TTW0000604	A physician can make a better contribution to the Good Fight than a wanderer like me can.
TTW0000605	If I find my Dad, maybe he can help with the Good Fight.
TTW0000606	My dad is one of your oldest friends. Do you have any gear to help me find him?
TTW0000607	I saw your husband kissing a lady that wasn't you.
TTW0000608	What's the story with you and Mr. Rockwell?
TTW0000609	Rumor is you and Mr. Rockwell are friends.
TTW0000610	I heard your parents are getting a divorce because of you.
TTW0000611	Your mom and dad hate you and are getting divorced.
TTW0000612	I don't have any medicine on me, but buffout should be able to jolt his system into action.
TTW0000613	Slowing the pace to take care of Garza will let the Enclave catch us. We need to leave him behind.
TTW0000614	I hate to say it, but you slowing us down will kill us all.
TTW0000615	Bet a good-looking guy like that know's how to make a girl feel good.
TTW0000616	Kids are expensive to take care of -- I'm going to have a lot of costs once I leave here. 1200 caps.
TTW0000617	2000 is steep. How about 1200?
TTW0000618	Man, I'd love your job. Bet it pays well, too.
TTW0000619	Rory's a big strong man. He told me he wants you to be safe and that he can take care of himself.
TTW0000620	The majority decides who's insane, even if you're surrounded by madmen.
TTW0000621	Mutant freaks locking up one they think is a freak. Ironic, isn't it?
TTW0000622	From the way you're talking, I bet you know where the GECK is.
TTW0000623	I'm impressed that a computer can become president.
TTW0000624	I know I can't kill you with weaponry, but you need to die.
TTW0000625	You're an abomination! You have to die!
TTW0000626	Computer, disable Raven Rock and shutdown systems.
TTW0000627	I'll see you in hell.
TTW0000628	What you've set in motion needs to end. You and the base down need to be shutdown.
TTW0000629	You wouldn't do that. But I would. <Hack into Eden to initiate self-destruct and shutdown.>
TTW0000630	You are operating outside of your programming parameters. Your judgment can't be trusted.
TTW0000631	Your progress is built on flawed logic. Your entire enterprise could collapse at any moment.
TTW0000632	Stay here while I get the money. I'll be right back.
TTW0000633	Calm down. I'm supposed to be here.
TTW0000634	I'm using your face to paint the walls with your blood if you don't get out of my way.
TTW0000635	Despite you killing my dad, I think you're a good person made to heinous things. You deserve better.
TTW0000636	Nations have risen and fallen since the War. Your rule isn't legitimate because America's gone.
TTW0000637	If you look at your Constitution, it's illegal for Eden to be president.
TTW0000638	You do realize you're fighting for something everyone else has forgotten about.
TTW0000639	Why give your allegiance to a machine?
TTW0000640	Are you really stupid enough to let orders from a computer get you and other people killed?
TTW0000641	What's your plan? Keep fighting for centuries unitl everyone that disagrees with you is dead?
TTW0000642	I usually get paid more than this for daring rescues.
TTW0000643	Shut up or I'll drive a spike through the bottom of your chin and into the roof of your mouth.
TTW0000644	Double that will be fair. How many other volunteers do you have to handle those two?
TTW0000645	Humanity's made mistakes, but there's still a chance for us. And for you.
TTW0000646	You should embrace humanity instead of... whatever it is you're doing.
TTW0000647	You're wrecking the town with your fights!
TTW0000648	I'm a good enough doctor that I can explain this to you without getting torn up.
TTW0000649	It appears that the burst of radiation has turned you into a Ghoul.
TTW0000650	It looks like the sudden radiation burst turned you into a ghoul.
TTW0000651	There's no reason to turn me into a night light for this one. I can explain it to you.
TTW0000652	I bet you have a lot of stories. Can't you share one?
TTW0000653	Rivet City is has been around a lot longer than 12 years.
TTW0000654	C'mon, share a story.
TTW0000655	You're unqualified to write this. Please stop.
TTW0000656	You writing this book is going to kill more people than if it never existed.
TTW0000657	I don't know if your book will be a success or not, but I know you make an impact with the caravans.
TTW0000658	I'm an expert in robotics. I'll just go ahead and write that section.
TTW0000659	Raider's aren't well organized and don't believe in self-pereservation, I used that against them.
TTW0000660	Technically, it's the landmines that blow up.
TTW0000661	You added too much chemical stimulant. The results were explosive. Literally.
TTW0000662	Their stories conflict and there's not enough evidence to support any of them.
TTW0000663	Installing it was easy. Getting there wasn't.
TTW0000664	The building is there, but you won't find any intact books in that place.
TTW0000665	I killed the raiders and got the food. Isn't much to tell.
TTW0000666	Radiation sickness is for the weak.
TTW0000667	The reason we get blown up is so we can get blown up again.
TTW0000668	Your repellent stick made the molerats' head explode. It is an excellent weapon.
TTW0000669	Their shells are pretty tough, but they go down easy if you shoot them in the face region.
TTW0000670	I feel like I got tag-teamed by a pair of fuckbots with the hydraulic penis upgrade.
TTW0000671	The tough bastards on the upper deck built the whole settlement themselves.
TTW0000672	I rammed the widget in the widget-hole, then I blasted the robots.
TTW0000673	All those books are good for is kindling.
TTW0000674	If nothing I else, I learned raiders are terrible at running grocery stores.
TTW0000675	Either it's radiation poisoning, or just my glowing personality.
TTW0000676	If I trigger one of those mines, I'll be gone before it blows.
TTW0000677	I wish I had one of these to explode uncouth people with.
TTW0000678	It's hard to be charming when they start shooting before you can speak.
TTW0000679	I apologize in advance if all this blood leaking out of me ruins your floor while we chat.
TTW0000680	None of them agree on a story. So let's just say I built the place.
TTW0000681	Manipulating robots is like manipulating people - get the thing in the right slot and you're golden.
TTW0000682	It's crawling with raiders. I think the place gives them quick cover -- they aren't there to read.
TTW0000683	They kept their best gear in the pharmacy, they had the meds in the back. That's raiders for you.
TTW0000684	I feel my DNA crying. Are you going to eat those pancakes? They speak to my hunger.
TTW0000685	Mainly, you just look out for things that shouldn't be there if you don't want to die.
TTW0000686	Turns out side effects of the repellent include exploding heads and death.
TTW0000687	Pain is just nerves carrying signals to the brain.
TTW0000688	It began as a research station. Fortunately, they're doing more science than SCIENCE!
TTW0000689	I reprogramed the robots, but they were lousy fighters.
TTW0000690	If nothing else, the raiders had a will to survive and would fight anyone who interfered with that.
TTW0000691	I'll shrug this off right after I puke up an organ or two.
TTW0000692	There were explosions and a sniper. Pretty typical stroll through the greater D.C. area.
TTW0000693	Their heads exploded. You don't need to tone down the repellent, mole rats just need to get tougher.
TTW0000694	I didn't see any infighting or struggle for dominance.
TTW0000695	I hardly even feel pain anymore. I think my body is building a natural immunity to bullets.
TTW0000696	They cleared out the mirelurks. Then the humans moved in.
TTW0000697	I'm not going to turn down the chance to fight robots. All I did was hack the mainframe.
TTW0000698	You can protect the catalog. I don't think it'll stay intact much longer by itself.
TTW0000699	I tried haggling, but with the way they shot at me I think the store had a fixed pricing policy.
TTW0000700	I'm as fit as a fiddle. Do fiddles have bones sticking out of them?
TTW0000701	You don't get near them. And if you do, run like hell.
TTW0000702	They had... explosive enthusiasm when introduced to the repellent. As in, they literally exploded.
TTW0000703	I don't think they have an expletive for this kind of pain. Goddamnshitfuck comes close, though.
TTW0000704	The place was booby-trapped. Amateur attempt, I got around.
TTW0000705	I checked out the Super-Duper Mart, but nothing's there.
TTW0000706	I tested it out, and it works just fine.
TTW0000707	I went to the site of the library, but the building was destroyed.
TTW0000708	Rivet City is actually the remains of an ancient, underwater civilization.
TTW0000709	I went to Minefield. See? Here's a mine.
TTW0000710	The Super-Duper Mart is completely devoid of anything worthwhile.
TTW0000711	It works well enough.
TTW0000712	The whole building got blown up.
TTW0000713	Rivet City is the remains of the lost city Atlantis, risen again!
TTW0000714	Have we completed the research?
TTW0000715	This kid is young enough you can mold him into whatever kind of slave you want. 300 caps.
TTW0000716	You're going to make a mint off this kid. 200 caps.
TTW0000717	This kid needs to be with people his own age. Give him a chance.
TTW0000718	Stick with me kid, and you'll be fine.
TTW0000719	There's no such thing as monsters. Worst you can get is scary animals.
TTW0000720	You're trying to make them smaller by modifying their genetics before they hatch.
TTW0000721	Why didn't you try this in a controlled environment first?
TTW0000722	It was for the greater good. Your experiments killed a lot of people because you played God.
TTW0000723	Man isn't ready to play God.
TTW0000724	How much do you normally pay people to clean up your mistakes?
TTW0000725	I'm going to need a strong incentive to do this.
TTW0000726	The Nuka-Cola Corporation sent assassins. They said she was being made an example of.
TTW0000727	The Nuka-Cola Corporation had her killed!
TTW0000728	I'm John-Caleb Bradberton, the owner.
TTW0000729	I'm Mrs. Bradberton, the owner's wife.
TTW0000730	I own this place. Stand down, robot!
TTW0000731	I'm risking my ass so you can get some ass. You need to pay me double.
TTW0000732	It would be awesome if you paid me twice that.
TTW0000733	Come on. No secrets between friends.
TTW0000734	Come on. No secrets between friends. What's the special reward?
TTW0000735	You'd think you wouldn't need a doctor to point out drinking radioactive mixtures is bad for you.
TTW0000736	If I buy the Temple slaves from you, it'll save you a lot of time and money.
TTW0000737	How much is finding these slave worth to you?
TTW0000738	I'll find them. I'm an expert slave tracker guy.
TTW0000739	I don't have a dog in this fight. Let me go and I won't say a thing.
TTW0000740	I'm a robotics expert, I'm familiar with the concept of an android.
TTW0000741	Has anyone from the Commonwealth approached you about getting plastic surgery?
TTW0000742	If you tell me who you've performed plastic surgery on lately, I'll give you candy!
TTW0000743	A patient of mine needs facial reconstruction. Have you ever performed it?
TTW0000744	Do you think someone could get surgery to get a new face without it being botched?
TTW0000745	I was talking to a guy the other day, claimed he had his face completely changed to escape his past.
TTW0000746	So how many faces would you say you plastically surgerize in your line of work?
TTW0000747	If you tell me how to perform plastic surgery, I'll be your friend!
TTW0000748	You know any juicy secrets about face re-arranging?
TTW0000749	Anyone ever get their face blown off around here and you had to staple it back on?
TTW0000750	There's this guy I know. Really ugly bastard. I want to change his face. What do?
TTW0000751	Ever perform plastic surgery?
TTW0000752	Know anyone who has a lipoplasticator or micro dermal graftilizer?
TTW0000753	You got a face carver I can borrow?
TTW0000754	Know where I can find one of them fancy face-carving lasers?
TTW0000755	You can have this apple I found if I can borrow your plastic surgery stuff.
TTW0000756	I'm sure you've got plastic surgery tools around here somewhere. You look like a prime candidate
TTW0000757	I need to find a Micro Dental Graphic Equalizer for epididymis augmentation surgery. I think.
TTW0000758	Do you have that thing that lets you do surgery on the facial region?
TTW0000759	What do you know about androids?
TTW0000760	Did you hear about that robot man? Rumor is he ate a small child.
TTW0000761	I'm trying to track down an escaped android from the Commonwealth.
TTW0000762	You know anything about an android that got some face work done?
TTW0000763	Know anything about an android who got plastic surgery?
TTW0000764	Seen any androids with pretty new faces?
TTW0000765	Heard an android got it's face changed. What's the scoop on that?
TTW0000766	C'mon, one badass motherfucker to another. What's the deal with this Commonwealth android?
TTW0000767	This android's a wily son of a bitch. Any idea where he slinked off to?
TTW0000768	You know anything about a mind wipe on that escaped android?
TTW0000769	I heard about mind wiping an android. I guess it's like baby wipes and you're a kid so spill it.
TTW0000770	I know the Lakelurk King. If you tell me about android mind wipes you could rule by his side!
TTW0000771	Why don't we go down to the Muddy Rudder and talk about android mind wipes?
TTW0000772	Tell me what you know about mind wiping androids or I'll slap a holotape or something!
TTW0000773	You should pass your knowledge of android mind wipes on to me. Quick, before you go feral!
TTW0000774	What do you know about programming engram clusters into AI subroutines?
TTW0000775	How do you get stuff into an android's brain?
TTW0000776	You should setup a workshop on programming android brains. Here's my 25 cap registration fee.
TTW0000777	Let's go find an android together and fiddle with it's brain bits.
TTW0000778	The Brotherhood hates seeing technology in pain. I have an android that's in need of brain surgery!
TTW0000779	You're hundreds of years old. Teach me how to program a robot brain so that you may always live.
TTW0000780	Tell me who did the mind wipe on the android and you'll win a fabulous dream vacation!
TTW0000781	Hey, Sea! Seagrave! Seagrave Holmes! What's the word on that android memory transfer?
TTW0000782	Say who the android memory job or I swear to God I will eat a T-45d helmet right in front of you.
TTW0000783	I'm looking to make an evil robot army and need to know who transferred that android's memories.
TTW0000784	I heard that Commonwealth android got it's AI swapped out.
TTW0000785	I wonder if the android got it's AI swapped with a mole rat. That would be hilarious, wouldn't it?
TTW0000786	How about I swap something electronical with you for your knowledge on android mind swaps?
TTW0000787	Seagrave! Let us go forth into the world and swap android AIs across the countryside!
TTW0000788	Can you swap android AI into a power armor suit? It could be all like "pew pew, target on the left!"
TTW0000789	This is just a rumor, but I heard you can put AIs inside potatoes while transferring between hosts.
TTW0000790	If the situation was this simple, I don't think you'd be this shaken.
TTW0000791	He needs contact with the outside.
TTW0000792	Let me through. It's important and stuff.
TTW0000793	I have a letter to deliver.
TTW0000794	This place isn't the answer. You need to go home and face your demons.
TTW0000795	You need to go home and think about what you've done.
TTW0000796	The only way to beat your nightmares is to face them. And the best place to do that is home.
TTW0000797	You need to go home and think things through.
TTW0000798	Blood preserved in bloodpacks stops you from having to feed on people. Why not use those?
TTW0000799	Arefu is defenseless. You might not think you're human, but you don't think you're a monster.
TTW0000800	I know exactly what you are.
TTW0000801	You're some sort of hillbilly murder cannibals.
TTW0000802	I got a delivery for Ian.
TTW0000803	I'm not helping unless I know who this guy is.
TTW0000804	If I don't know what it is, how should I know if I should be scared too?
TTW0000805	What happened to you?
TTW0000806	Dying? How awful!
TTW0000807	I don't see that it matters much. Oasis is off the beaten path.
TTW0000808	If you want this job done right, it's not a job that can be done cheap. 500 caps.
TTW0000809	I want 500 for the job.
TTW0000810	You think wiping a whole town off the map comes that cheap? I'm going to need 500 more caps.
TTW0000811	I might disarm it. If you disagree with that, you should direct counter-arguments to my wallet.
TTW0000812	I told Simms I would disarm it. Money could convince me otherwise.
TTW0000813	This is happening. Either accept reality or leave.
TTW0000814	This might solve your problems, but it's not solving mine. I need a higher payment.
TTW0000815	I had a mishap learning how to use it. Now that I know, it won't happen again.
TTW0000816	You look like a man who can be negotiated with. Is there a cover charge I can pay?
TTW0000817	If you don't know who you're dealing with, you're about to become awfully familiar.
TTW0000818	I liked your buddies over at the Lincoln Memorial more. I was less inclined to kill them.
TTW0000819	Huh. There's like, four extra wires in here.
TTW0000820	They told me to cut the green wire to disable it. By the by, I'm color-blind.
TTW0000821	And I just slide this pre-war credit card through the lock...
TTW0000822	What's the key used for?
TTW0000823	Give me a straight answer on what happened in there!
TTW0000824	A gift of the key would be a wise diplomatic move, Mister President.
TTW0000825	A gift would be a wise diplomatic move, Mr. President. Something personal.
TTW0000826	I think it would be good for the continued existence of the Republic, Mister President.
TTW0000827	I'm here for your key.
TTW0000828	Hand over the key, clown shoes.
TTW0000829	Can't I just have the key as a present? No one's given me a present in awhile.
TTW0000830	Dukov has I key I need and I know you two are real close. Steal it for me?
TTW0000831	Been a long time since this all went down. Do you remember where Fort Constantine is?
TTW0000832	I put a bullet right between Ted Strayer's eyes.
TTW0000833	I blew Dukov's brains out.
TTW0000834	Dave's head popped like a zit.
TTW0000835	Chief Gustavo is having his face gnawed off by a giant mole rat!
TTW0000836	Come on. You can tell me. Ahzrukhal said so.
TTW0000837	Why didn't you just come out and say you wanted some money? Here's 20 caps.
TTW0000838	I'm going to need your key if you don't want bad things to happen to you.
TTW0000839	If you don't give me the key I'll make an origami swan with your corpse and hurl it into the river.
TTW0000840	Give me all your stuff or I'll make an origami swan with your corpse and hurl it into the river.
TTW0000841	You know, life is precious. I think yours is about 300 caps precious.
TTW0000842	I want more than that to spare your miserable life.
TTW0000843	I'm Thomas Jefferson and I'm here for that piece of paper with the stuff written on it.
TTW0000844	I'm Thomas Jefferson girlfriend and I'm here for that piece of paper with the stuff written on it.
TTW0000845	How is it you know so much about the Declaration but don't have it?
TTW0000846	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave. I tried to stop them.
TTW0000847	Your father set this in motion, saying dead people can't leave the vault.
TTW0000848	The Overseer's insane and thought no one would leave if they all died.
TTW0000849	One of the rebels did it to force everyone to leave.
TTW0000850	The vault's isolation is what keeps it safe. There are threats out there you cannot comprehend.
TTW0000851	I still say it is ludicrous to leave the vault.
TTW0000852	The vault's population isn't high enough to remain isolated forever.
TTW0000853	If I told you the things I'd seen, you'd brand me a liar. Nowhere out there is safer than in here.
TTW0000854	I'm not a charity. I need some sort of payment up front to use while finding your violin.
TTW0000855	I have costs I need to cover, and costs are always passed to the consumer.
TTW0000856	This is a priceless piece of history. And the price I'm offering it at is 300.
TTW0000857	C'mon, it's a Stradiwhovius. 300 caps.
TTW0000858	This is the kind of class and elegance your bar has never seen before. 300 caps.
TTW0000859	C'mon, this thing is from the 17th or 18th century. The ancient Egyptians probably played it!
TTW0000860	Please wake her, I really want to find out what happened to her.
TTW0000861	She could have vital information. We need to wake her.
TTW0000862	If you revive her, we can understand things better. You might even be able to treat her.
TTW0000863	You're adopted and nobody loves you. Run away; no one wants you here.
TTW0000864	Why not try mentoring Ted Strayer? You need someone to talk to, he needs guidance.
TTW0000865	As long as you have access to drugs, you're never going to recover. Tell me where your stash is.
TTW0000866	<Hack Private Jones to make it respond to a fake security emergency.>
TTW0000867	Robot! I doth command you to go elsewhere or something.
TTW0000868	Your secrets are always safe with me.
TTW0000869	Dave uses his power to push all of you around. If you don't stand up to him, who will?
TTW0000870	Exalted President Dave, I am an ambassador from the Wasteland to your Republic.
TTW0000871	I come bringing peace and hope and other stuff. Good stuff.
TTW0000872	I've been a collector of fine Dave memoriabilia for years now, I'd be happy to sell you some.
TTW0000873	I come from the nation of Franksinatrastan. We need any assistance you can give to ward off raiders.
TTW0000874	I have important business with Mister Tenpenny.
TTW0000875	I have a business offer for Mister Tenpenny. He's going to be pissed at you if he misses it.
TTW0000876	I just need to talk to Tenpenny.
TTW0000877	Yes. As in: I won't choke you to death with my bear hands.
TTW0000878	Yes. As in: I won't put you full of holes and use you as a collander.
TTW0000879	Yes. As in: I won't shove a live grenade down your pants and stroll away.
TTW0000880	Yes. As in: I won't cut your throat and pour your blood into a bucket.
TTW0000881	Yes. As in: I won't melt you into a puddle of goo.
TTW0000882	It was the only way to lure Wernher out of hiding.
TTW0000883	I couldn't get to Wernher any other way.
TTW0000884	Can't say that's a name I'm familiar with.
TTW0000885	Never heard of him. Why?
TTW0000886	I talked to him. Felt like he was trying to sell me a diseased brahmin, so I left.
TTW0000887	I met the man, but he seemed like trouble, so I steered clear.
TTW0000888	You sure are nosey.
TTW0000889	I found Bill. He said there's something he needs to see through and that he won't be back soon.
TTW0000890	Bill said to let you know he's okay, but he can't come back anytime soon.
TTW0000891	I heard Bill screaming in agony. When you hear a man screaming like that, you're too late...
TTW0000892	Well, I found Bill, but he was a dreadful conversationalist.
TTW0000893	I'm the buyer for the slaves.
TTW0000894	Do you mind that I'm a woman? I'm the buyer for the slaves.
TTW0000895	You're saying Marie has a transferable natural immunity.
TTW0000896	It's over. If you leave the Pitt and never look back, I'll spare you.
TTW0000897	If you don't make like a tree and get the fuck out of here you're a dead man.
TTW0000898	Wernher is jeapordizing what he's fighting for by continuing on. You need to tell me where he is.
TTW0000899	Sounds dangerous. How about helping a girl out?
TTW0000900	Our boys fought like old people fuck. Whose the bloat fly-brains in charge of this clusterfuck?
TTW0000901	This situation is totally and royally fucked up and I will have the commander's head on a platter!
TTW0000902	Slow down! Can we just talk for a bit?
TTW0000903	I'm kind of lost. Can I talk to the man in charge?
TTW0000904	I'm just trying to figure out what's going on here.
TTW0000905	I can be more helpful if I had a better idea of what's going on.
TTW0000906	It's over General. Stand down before there's any more needless loss of life.
TTW0000907	If you have any heavy-hitters I could use, I could take out the bastards even faster.
TTW0000908	Turning people into ghouls requires a sudden, massive dose of radiation.
TTW0000909	I'm from the United States Army and I'm here to help.
TTW0000910	I'm like, a soldier or something.
TTW0000911	These people are in dire need of some extra water.
TTW0000912	You should back down before people get hurt.
TTW0000913	Mind if I take that plasma rifle? I need serious firepower to carry out my orders.
TTW0000914	Can I have that plasma rifle?
TTW0000915	All I need is 500 caps and your water shipments stop getting tainted with blood.
TTW0000916	If I hadn't set this up, you wouldn't be in the protection racket. Give me a bigger cut.
TTW0000917	I think I deserve a bigger cut.
TTW0000918	You need to stop this. The water caravans benefit everyone.
TTW0000919	A lot of things about your operation don't add up.
TTW0000920	What's your angle? If you're selling irradiated water why bother getting clean water too?
TTW0000921	It's obviously different from Aqua Pura somehow, it's a valid question.
TTW0000922	This whole operation seems awfully expensive to run on pure altruism.
TTW0000923	How do you fund all this?
TTW0000924	C'mon. Something this big, no way absolutely everything is done by the book.
TTW0000925	These plants grow really well. What's your secret?
TTW0000926	Is it okay if I hang out with you sometimes?
TTW0000927	Look! I found Kenny-Bear!
TTW0000928	I found your teddy bear. No worse for wear.
TTW0000929	No medicine I've heard of is made in a still. What's going on?
TTW0000930	Seems legit. What do you need?
TTW0000931	I've never heard of Orange Fever and you're not exhibiting any classic signs of illness.
TTW0000932	My God. It's the orangest of all fevers. Are you going to survive without my help?
TTW0000933	I am the only one with the expertise to fix this for miles. I'm not doing it for less than 200 caps.
TTW0000934	I haven't decided either way. If you have any convincing arguments, you can make them to my wallet.
TTW0000935	I was just admiring the architecture.
TTW0000936	If we do anything to change how they're being stored, we could agonize them. Best to move on.
TTW0000937	If you need to talk to help cope with what's going on, it's okay.
TTW0000938	I found the recording you made about what happened. Do you want to talk about it?

F3NGA01715	In order to heal a crippled limb, you have three choices: sleep in a bed, find a doctor, or use aStimpak to heal yourself. In Hardcore Mode, you may only heal crippled limbs by using Doctor'sBags or by visiting a doctor for medical care.Stimpaks can be used for general healing (which will also slightly heal crippling damage), or they can be applied directly to a limb to heal crippling damage.To heal a crippled limb directly using a Stimpak, navigate to the Stats screen in your Pip-Boy,then left-click on a limb to use a Stimpak on that limb.

F3NPA00223	In order to heal a crippled limb, you have three choices: sleep in a bed, find a doctor, oruse a Stimpak to heal yourself. In Hardcore Mode, you may only heal crippled limbs byusing Doctor's Bags or by visiting a doctor for medical care.Stimpaks can be used for general healing (which will also slightly heal crippling damage), or they can be applied directly to a limb to heal crippling damage.To heal a crippled limb directly using a Stimpak, navigate to the Stats screen in yourPip-Boy, then left-click on a limb to use a Stimpak on that limb.
