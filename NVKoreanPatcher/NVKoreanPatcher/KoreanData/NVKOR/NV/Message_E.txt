0ME0000001	You quickly find a manilla folder with Pacer's name on it in the drawer marked "N-R".
0ME0000003	You quickly find a manilla folder with Bill's name on it in the drawer marked "N-R".
0ME0000005	The box contains a large amount of Jet. You could lace the Jet with some Psycho if you had some.
0ME0000007	Leave the jet alone.
0ME0000008	Take the jet.
0ME0000009	Take the Jet and leave Ralph's forged letter.

0ME0000011	Spike the Jet with Psycho.
0ME0000012	You carefully add Psycho to Pacer's Jet, guaranteeing an altogether different high the next time he uses it.
0ME0000014	The drawers of this filing cabinet are all labeled "Patient Records" followed by a subset of the alphabet.
0ME0000016	Leave the filing cabinet alone.
0ME0000017	Search for Pacer's patient file.
0ME0000020	The degree to which damaged items can be repaired is dependent on your Repair skill.
0ME0000029	Every time you level up, your Health increases, and you gain Skill Points to assign to your skills. You will also gain a new perk every other level.
0ME0000038	You have 4 tries to guess correctly. If you fail, the terminal will remain inaccessible until you own the password. You can exit hacking at any time and try again. However, exiting the terminal will force its security to reset, delaying your ability to start hacking again.
0ME0000071	The World Map shows an overhead map of the entire Mojave Wasteland area, and markers for any places that have been discovered during the course of your adventures. You can even fast travel directly to any place you have previously visited.
0ME0000091	Caravan players begin the game by establishing a mutual bet. There is only one betting phase per game. Since Caravan has its roots in merchant caravans, players are allowed to use any common currency available, regardless of its origins. Though bottle caps are common, players may also offer NCR dollars or Legion coins. Once a bet is established, players move on to deck building.
0ME0000093	To play Caravan, you must assemble a deck that consists of at least 30 cards. Cards may be found in the world or purchased from vendors. You may assemble any arrangement of cards, but certain deck compositions will have strengths and weaknesses against any given opponent.
0ME0000094	Once you have selected a satisfactory deck, you may proceed to game play. This interface will always remember the last Caravan deck you assembled, allowing for easy modifcation on subsequent games.
0ME0000096	The first phase of Caravan game play involves each player drawing eight cards from his or her deck. From this hand, each player, in turn, lays down one numbered card or ace per "track" on the three caravans. A player's three caravans are competing for contracts with their opponent's caravans opposite them on the same track.
0ME0000097	If a player has no numbered cards or aces in his or her hand, or if he or she is unhappy with any given card currently in hand, the player may discard and draw from his or her own deck. However, discarded cards are out of play for the current game and a smaller deck increases the player's odds that they will be forced to forfeit the game through exhaustion.
0ME0000099	Most game play in Caravan occurs during the Contract War. In this phase, both players are attempting to build their caravans and get them signed. To do this, their caravan must be neither light (below 21) or burdened (over 26). They must also compete with their opponent on the same track to prevent being outbid within the legal range.
0ME0000100	On each of the three tracks, a caravan is considered signed if its value is from 21 to 26 and it is higher than the opponent's caravan on the same track. If two caravans are tied, neither is signed until the tie is broken. The game ends when all three tracks have signed contracts. Note: it is possible for a player to win while signing only two of the three contracts (the third going to the opponent). In such cases, all winnings still go to the overall victor.
0ME0000101	Players have the following options on their turn:
0ME0000102	* Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck.
0ME0000103	* Discard one card from his or her hand and draw a new card to replace it.
0ME0000104	* Remove one of his or her own caravans from the table, discarding all cards in it.
0ME0000105	Caravans are primarily built with numbered cards and aces, which can be placed in the player's caravans according to the following rules. Caravans with more than one card have a direction (ascending or descending) and a suit. Direction is determined by the last two cards in a caravan, suit by the last card in a caravan. All subsequent cards must continue in the same direction OR they must match suit. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit.
0ME0000106	Face cards can be attached to numbered cards and aces in any player or opponent caravan. Face cards affect numbered cards and aces in various ways:
0ME0000107	* Joker - Played against A, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it is an ace or numbered card (see below).  Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
0ME0000108	* Ace - Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table.  E.g. a joker played on an ace of spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
0ME0000109	* 2-10 - Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.
0ME0000110	* Jack - Played against A, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.
0ME0000111	* Queen - Played against A, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand, changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
0ME0000112	* King - Played against A, 2-10. Multplies the value of the card upon which it is played. Multiple kings on the same card will have a multiplicative effect. E.g. one king on a 3 = 6. Two kings on a 3 = 12.
0ME0000114	All weapons fall under a weapon skill category that determines how effective the weapon is: Guns, Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee Weapons, or Unarmed. Compare the small icon below and to the left of the weapon's icon to the icon shown on the Pip-Boy's skill menu.
0ME0000115	* DAM/DPS: These indicate the base Damage and Damage Per Second, respectively. Weapons with a low DAM have difficulty penetrating armor. If you hit a target's Damage Threshold, switch to a weapon with a higher DAM or use ammo that reduces the target's Damage Threshold (e.g. Armor Piercing).
0ME0000116	* STR and Skill: Many weapons have a Strength and/or skill requirement. If your character does not meet the Strength or skill requirement for the weapon, its aim will wobble (if a firearm) or it will attack more slowly (if a hand-to-hand weapon).
0ME0000117	* CND: A weapon's Condition affects the amount of damage is does. At 75% Condition or higher, a weapon does maximum damage and only needs to be maintained. A weapon with low Condition will do less damage and may jam when reloaded.
0ME0000118	* Repair / Mod: These options take you to the Repair and Mod submenus, where you may repair damaged equipment or attach weapon modifications, respectively.
0ME0000120	Apparel can consist of many different types of gear ranging from clothing and armor to sunglasses and hats.
0ME0000121	* DT: Some apparel grants Damage Threshold (DT) to the wearer. Your DT is the sum of all DT for currently equipped apparel plus any bonuses from perks or chems. DT is directly subtracted from incoming damage, so a higher DT provides superior protection. Though a small percentage of damage can get through even the thickest armor, a high DT is quite valuable.
0ME0000122	* CND: Apparel's Condition (CND) affects how much protection it provides. Apparel above 50% CND provides maximum protection and only needs to be maintained.
0ME0000123	* Light/Medium/Heavy: Medium and Heavy apparel will slow characters down when equipped.
0ME0000124	* Repair: This option opens the Repair submenu, which allows apparel to be repaired by salvaging parts from similar items.
0ME0000126	Ammunition is used by almost all Guns and Energy Weapons but is sometimes used by other weapon types. Basic ammo types have no special effects, but ammo subtypes may increase damage, reduce an enemy's Damage Threshold, or even decrease a weapon's spread. Effects are listed on the ammo submenu when the ammo is highlighted. Most weapons can use any ammo subtype that starts with the same name as the base ammo. Common ammo subtypes include:
0ME0000127	* Armor Piercing: Ignores a large portion of the enemy's Damage Threshold, does slightly more damage.
0ME0000128	* Hollow Point: Does much more damage, but is easily blocked by armor.
0ME0000129	* Over Charge: Used by Energy Weapons, increases damage but degrades the weapon more quickly.
0ME0000130	* Slug: Used by shotguns, slugs replace buckshot with a single, large bullet that is more accurate.
0ME0000131	To switch ammo subtypes, equip them on this menu. Outside of the Pip-Boy, press 2 to cycle through ammo subtypes for your currently equipped weapon.
0ME0000133	Ammunition is used by almost all Guns and Energy Weapons but is sometimes used by other weapon types. Basic ammo types have no special effects, but ammo subtypes may increase damage, reduce an enemy's Damage Threshold, or even decrease spread. Effects are listed on the ammo submenu when the ammo is highlighted. Most weapons can use any ammo subtype that starts with the same name as the base ammo. Common ammo subtypes include:
0ME0000138	To switch ammo subtypes, equip them on this menu. Outside of the Pip-Boy, press [%] to cycle through ammo subtypes for your currently equipped weapon.
0ME0000140	Three basic types of objects in the world can launch the crafting interface: Campfires, Workbenches, and Reloading Benches. Each station allows the creation of a subset of items. Though many recipes are visible at any time in the game, some recipes will only appear when the player completes a quest or finds a special item. You may also find that certain companions or special locations can open special crafting interfaces for the player.
0ME0000141	Recipes have skill and ingredient requirements that must be met to proceed. If any requirement is darkened, that requirement has not been met. Any recipe that has all of its requirements fulfilled will appear fully lit. After using a recipe, the product(s) of the recipe will all immediately be available in your inventory.
0ME0000143	You have established a reputation with a group of people in the wasteland! Whether that reputation is good or bad, you're finally somebody, and people associated with that group will start to react to what you've done. There are many different factions in the wasteland, and you can develop a distinct reputation with each one.
0ME0000144	As you perform actions that benefit a group, you will gain Fame. If you peform actions that harm a group, you will gain Infamy. Your reputation with any given group is a measure of the combined total of Fame and Infamy that you have earned. The benefits and drawbacks of any given reputation depend on the group itself. You may receive discounts with merchants, provoke attacks from hired thugs, or simply be treated differently.
0ME0000145	Though you will initially start out with a Neutral reputation with any given faction, your Fame and Infamy will eventually push your reputation in different directions. You can see all of your current reputations under the General section of your Pip-Boy.
0ME0000146	Good Reputations:
0ME0000147	* Smiling Troublemaker - Some good, a little bad.
0ME0000148	* Good Natured Rascal - Good, a little bad.
0ME0000149	* Accepted - Some good.
0ME0000150	* Liked - Definitely good.
0ME0000151	* Idolized - Most good.

0ME0000160	* Merciful Thug - Bad, a little good.
0ME0000161	* Shunned - Some bad.
0ME0000162	* Hated - Definitely bad.
0ME0000163	* Vilified - Most bad.
0ME0000165	Welcome to Hardcore Mode! There are three basic needs that Hardcore Mode requires you to monitor: dehydration (H2O), starvation (FOD), and sleep deprivation (SLP). Each of these needs must be monitored and kept in check or you will suffer penalties and, in extreme cases, death.
0ME0000166	Your needs are continually ticking away and can be monitored on the Status screen of your Pip-Boy. When you start to suffer ill-effects from neglected needs, your HUD will display the corresponding code for that need. Be aware that waiting, sleeping, and Fast Travel will also affect your needs. If performing any of these activities would result in death, you will be prevented from doing so.
0ME0000167	* Dehydration (H20) - Dehydration increases at a faster pace than starvation or sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by drinking water or eating certain types of food. Some drinks, such as alcohol and soda, can increase dehydration, so be careful!
0ME0000168	* Starvation (FOD) - The onset of starvation is slower than dehydration, but quicker than sleep deprivation. It can be relieved by eating food.
0ME0000169	* Sleep Deprivation (SLP) - Sleep deprivation is the most low-maintenance of the basic needs. Though a few chems and drinks can help offset sleep deprivation, nothing beats sleep itself.
0ME0000175	I'm four whole feet, grandma!
0ME0000185	Sunny Smiles has things to teach your character. Are you sure you wish to keep traveling in this direction?
0ME0000187	No, I'll go see Sunny.
0ME0000188	I don't need to learn anything from Sunny.
0ME0000189	This appears to be a good location to attach one of the deployable ballast packages. Would you like to attach it to the plane?
0ME0000191	Attach Ballast
0ME0000192	Leave
0ME0000219	This man looks like he has a serious infection. Improper treatment will kill him, would you like to treat him? (Medicine 40 or higher Required)
0ME0000222	Attempt to treat him.
0ME0000223	With a combination of natural herbs, bandages, and some disinfectant, you are able to clean the wounds and help boost the patient's immune system enough that he'll survive.
0ME0000225	You decide you need to perform a tracheotomy to open up his air pathway.  As you haphazardly stab the patient in the neck, a piece of your straw snaps off in his throat causing the patient to choke to death.
0ME0000227	Without examining the leg further, you decide it requires amputation.  Before you even make it down to bone, you realize you might have skipped a few important steps...  The patient quickly bleeds to death from a severed artery.
0ME0000229	With limited medical knowledge, you mistakenly administer a lethal dose of painkillers mixed with antibiotics.  The patient lets out one last labored breath before succumbing to the overdose.
0ME0000234	Treat the infection.
0ME0000235	This man's leg is seriously damaged and will require amputation. Improper treatment will kill him.  Are you sure to want to attempt the operation? (Medicine 50 or higher Required)
0ME0000239	CHOP! CHOP! CHOP! (Low Intelligence)
0ME0000240	This man's leg is seriously injured.  It may require amputation to save him.  Are you sure to want to attempt the operation? (Medicine 50 or higher Required)
0ME0000245	This man appears to be severely injured.  Swelling around his face and neck is interfering with his breathing.  Are you sure to want to treat him? (Medicine 60 or higher Required)
0ME0000248	Treat the patient.
0ME0000249	This man appears to be severely injured.  Swelling around his face and neck is interfering with his breathing.  Improper treatment will kill him.  Are you sure to want to treat him? (Medicine 60 or higher Required)
0ME0000253	Upon further examination after cleaning the leg, you realize it can be saved.  You carefully remove the existing stitches, clean the wounds thoroughly, then re-stitch the wounds closed using a much more effective procedure.
0ME0000255	After carefully considering treatment options, you realize the patient is merely having a strong allergic reaction.  By cleaning all wounds of ant venom, and administering a steroid compound, you reduce the swelling and the patient's breathing returns to normal.
0ME0000277	In the year 2271, the Desert Rangers of Nevada and rangers of the New California Republic met at this spot to sign the Ranger Unification Treaty. Under this treaty, the Desert Rangers agreed to be absorbed into the NCR in exchange for NCR's protection of Hoover Dam, New Vegas, and southern Nevada against the forces of Caesar's Legion.
0ME0000279	The Ultra-Luxe Floor Manager is coming to speak with you.
0ME0000281	Sorry, but you have reached the jackpot limit, but feel free to explore the other services here at the Atomic Wrangler!
0ME0000405	Poison Removed
0ME0000407	Gomorrah's Manager is coming to speak with you.
0ME0000409	The note reads: "I'm taking most of the boys west to go check out this vault we heard about. Stay here and keep an eye on things until we get back, and keep a closer eye on the Fiends - those guys are crazier than Scrambler. If there's any trouble, radio ahead."
0ME0000411	The battle for Hoover Dam will determine the fate of New Vegas for decades to come.
0ME0000412	If there's anything you want to do before you enter the battle, do it now - before you cross the point of no return.
0ME0000414	I'm not ready yet.
0ME0000418	You have equipped faction armor! Faction armor disguises you as a member of that faction. Members of that faction now consider you a friend, while enemies of that faction will attack you on sight regardless of your personal faction relation with them. Any reputation changes that occur while wearing faction armor still affect your character.
0ME0000419	Security personnel such as guards and watchdogs will see through your disguise and alert anyone nearby, so watch out!
0ME0000433	The box now contains nothing save for a simple handwritten note.
0ME0000435	The box contains a large amount of Jet, now laced with Psycho.
0ME0000437	This person appears to be near death. To remove them from the cross would kill them.
0ME0000439	The 9mm submachinegun preserved in the glass case to the left of this plaque is the ACTUAL weapon Vance carried in a paper-wrapped box under some suitcases in the trunk of his car during his and Vikki's crime spree! Never fired, and luckily untouched by the hail of bullets that ended its notorious owner's life, the weapon's mint condition inspires dread in all who look upon it. Experts speculate that Vance might have killed as many as fifty people had he ever fired the gun - so long as his aim was exact and he was starting off with a full clip - or even more if he had additional ammo clips and remembered to reload!
0ME0000441	The generator looks to be fine, but some kind of large vermin has chewed into the power cable. With the proper know-how and some scrap metal, you could repair the connection and improve its output bandwidth. Otherwise you'll need help.
0ME0000442	(Repair of 35 or higher and one piece of scrap metal required)
0ME0000445	Repair the wire.
0ME0000446	This mainframe is currently unresponsive. The amount of power reaching the terminal seems to be insufficient.
0ME0000448	Leave.
0ME0000449	You fixed the wiring. Sufficient electricity should now be flowing to the mainframe computer.
0ME0000455	This is a Mark III Auto-Doc, primarily used for routine surgeries. The control systems have been damaged beyond repair, rendering the Auto-Doc useless, but the diagnostic scanning unit is still intact.
0ME0000458	Take the diagnostic scanning unit.
0ME0000459	This one of Dr. Richards' patients. You should speak to him before you investigate them.
0ME0000461	This man appears to be suffering from multiple machete wounds. Improper treatment will kill him. Would you like to treat him? (Medicine 35 or higher required)
0ME0000462	Alternatively, if you have Med-X, Whiskey, and Surgical Tubing you may be able to treat him.
0ME0000465	Attempt to treat with medicine.
0ME0000466	Use medical equipment to treat.
0ME0000471	Treat with medicine.
0ME0000473	This patient's condition is worse, but still stable. There is nothing more for you to do here.
0ME0000475	Dr. Richards has revoked your operating privileges in his medical bay. You can no longer operate on any patients.
0ME0000477	With limited medical knowledge, you bumble around with a scalpel and cut a vital artery. The patient starts hemorrhaging and dies from blood loss.
0ME0000479	As you start to administer medications to the patient, his fever spikes and his breathing quickens. His injuries are well beyond your skill to treat.
0ME0000481	You have just enough skill to recognize that you are about to do more harm than good. You stop before causing any serious complications.
0ME0000483	You carefully clean the wounds and apply antibiotics before stitching the wounds closed. The patient will recover completely in time.
0ME0000485	There's no response from the elevator.
0ME0000487	You are now dressed as a member of the White Glove Society.
0ME0000489	You are no longer dressed as a member of the White Glove Society.

0ME0000507	The mess of wires and scrap metal confuses you. Perhaps if you knew a bit more about semiconductors and power cell technology, you might know where to begin disassembly.
0ME0000509	This nuclear bomb appears to be a dud. However, it appears as though the core components could be salvaged.
0ME0000512	[Science 60] <Salvage the components>
0ME0000513	You quickly disassemble the core components of the bomb's fission reactor.
0ME0000523	This robot has been fitted with a variety of tools specialized for industrial maintenance. There is a slot at the back of the head where it looks like a keycard could be fit.

0ME0000533	You quickly install the device as directed. Immediately a small green light on it begins pulsing, indicating that it has begun transmitting.
0ME0000537	These replica outfits show just how conscious Vikki was of the styles of the period. Vikki was well known for her sense of fashion and her fixation on expensive clothing was thought to be one of the reasons the pair chose a life of crime.
0ME0000539	These mannequins display replicas of some of the clothing that was found in the trunk of Vikki and Vance's death car. Vance didn't share Vikki's sense of fashion, and chose to dress himself how he envisioned a gangster would dress.
0ME0000541	The collar has begun to emit a high-pitched beeping noise.
0ME0000543	Your collar has begun beeping more insistently.
0ME0000545	You must have a Science skill of at least 40.
0ME0000548	The crystals on this rock seem to indicate a pocket of potassium nearby, some strategically placed C4 could be enough to destroy both the cave and the vault.
0ME0000551	Plant enough C4 to destroy the caves.
0ME0000552	Plant enough C4 to destroy the caves and the vault then run like hell.
0ME0000553	You need at least 3 packs of C4 to get the job done.
0ME0000556	You notice that duty roster has been accessed by an unknown login ID. It'd be a good idea to keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary.

0ME0000576	The console is unresponsive. For it to operate properly, it would need to be activated during peak sunlight hours (9 AM - 3 PM), a power configuration would need to be set up in the tower's mainframe, and the two ground-level terminals would need to have an active uplink to the mainframe.
0ME0000579	Random Position is [%]
0ME0000587	This is a Stealth Boy Mark II prototype. As it is only a prototype, there are numerous fluctuations in its stealth field which would yield unpredictable results in a field test. A specialist in electronics could stabilize the field output.

0ME0000639	As you start to administer medications to the patient, his fever spikes and his breathing quickens. His sickness is well beyond your skill to treat.
0ME0000643	This robot has been fitted with a variety of tools specialized for industrial maintenance. However, there is nothing left in the room for it to repair.
0ME0000647	Mister
0ME0000648	Ma'am
0ME0000649	To grab the Brahmin skull, look at it and [%].
0ME0000651	Good! Now [%] again to let go of the skull.
0ME0000659	Thinking the patient has an infection, you administer a large dose of antibiotics. The patient suffers a severe allergic reaction and slips into a deep coma.
0ME0000661	Argyll has revoked your operating privileges in his medical bay. You can no longer operate on any patients.
0ME0000663	This one of Argyll's patients. You should speak to him before you investigate them.
0ME0000665	You begin to operate on the patient's leg, and things quickly start to go bad. You manage to tourniquet the wound to staunch the bleeding, but it is clear that the leg will never be fully functional again.
0ME0000667	You pull out your blade and hack blindly at the leg. After a series of random and frenetic cuts you notice the leg is looking better. It looks like he'll be able to keep it after all.
0ME0000686	Title, not text when changing names!
0ME0000688	The console hums quietly, powered by some unknown source. There is a round slot on the console - about the size of a large poker chip.
0ME0000691	Insert the Platinum Chip into the slot.
0ME0000692	The dynamite contained within this box is very old and unstable. Only someone skilled with explosives could hope to salvage any of the dynamite.
0ME0000693	[Explosives of 25 or greater required.]
0ME0000695	Leave the box alone.
0ME0000696	Salvage what dynamite you can.
0ME0000697	This 9mm submachine gun is broken but can possibly be restored to a fully functioning weapon.
0ME0000698	[Repair of 25 or greater required.]
0ME0000701	Repair the 9mm submachine gun.
0ME0000702	There appears to be enough chemical components available to create a small quantity of chems - assuming one has the knowledge to do such a thing.
0ME0000703	[Science of 25 or greater required.]
0ME0000706	Create some Stimpaks.
0ME0000707	Create some drugs - Psycho, Buffout, Mentats, Steady, and Rebound.

0ME0000711	Activate surgery mode and remove Caesar's tumor.
0ME0000712	Activate autopsy mode and kill Caesar.
0ME0000715	Stonewall blocked a knockdown attempt!
0ME0000717	"This godforsaken radio still doesn't work. Damn it, I'm a scout, not an electrician. Must've got some sand in it or something. At least that crazy storm is good for keeping people away. This place wouldn't make much of a safehouse if other people were traipsing in and out all the time. I'd hate to have to find another location again, but if the supplies, and especially the equipment weren't safe, I guess I'd have to."
0ME0000719	Put the journal back down.
0ME0000720	"This location looks like it might make a good safehouse. Warm, dry, and some sort of crazy natural phenomenon at night that should keep the predators away. I'd love to start getting set up, but there are a few nearby points of interest I need to gather intel on first. Not sure how long that'll take."
0ME0000722	"Finally got started getting this place in order. Put out enough supplies to last a while, swept up some. Gonna hit the hay and continue tomorrow."
0ME0000725	Read the next entry.
0ME0000726	"Found a nice little spot to scout the prison from. Place has been pretty active recently. Those thrice-damned powder gangers have been spreading out, so I need to be careful to avoid them. It doesn't help that I have to get back early each night or risk getting blinded by the sand."
0ME0000730	Upon further examination after cleaning the leg, you realize it cannot be saved. You carefully begin to amputate the limb. During surgery, you notice the man's hand is gangrenous. You amputate that as well, saving his life.
0ME0000732	Without thinking, you start amputating the leg. Partway through you realize you started amputating the wrong leg. As you start amputating the other leg, the patient dies of shock.
0ME0000735	Alternatively, if you have a Medical Brace, Med-X, and a Bonesaw you may be able to treat him.
0ME0000738	Attempt to operate with medicine.
0ME0000739	Use medical equipment to operate.
0ME0000744	Perform the operation with medicine.
0ME0000746	You carefully clean the wounds and apply antibiotics before grafting extra skin over the wounds. The patient will make a complete recovery.
0ME0000748	You quickly grab some ice to treat the burns. Unfortunately, the ice doesn't help but only compounds the problem. The patient screams and dies due to cardiac arrest induced from the sudden pain.
0ME0000750	This man appears to have suffered a close range blast trauma. His upper torso is covered in cuts and is severely burned. Improper treatment will kill him. Would you like to treat him? (Medicine 75 or higher required)
0ME0000751	Alternatively, if you have Tweezers, Med-X, and a Super Stimpak you may be able to treat him.
0ME0000760	Treat the wounds with medicine.
0ME0000762	Dr. Richards no longer wants you looking into his patients.
0ME0000768	This is an ancient and very obsolete Mark I Auto-Doc. Despite the similarities in appearance to more advanced models, it shares no compatible parts.
0ME0000770	You need to have a higher Endurance before your body can accept any more implants.
0ME0000772	This is a Mark III Auto-Doc, primarily used for routine surgeries. However, the diagnostic scanning unit is burnt out, rendering this Auto-Doc useless.
0ME0000775	Install the replacement diagnostic scanning unit.
0ME0000780	Without a replacement firing mechanism, this howitzer is useless.
0ME0000782	Leave the howitzer alone.
0ME0000783	Replace the firing mechanism.
0ME0000788	You created several white phosphorous artillery shells.
0ME0000790	You repaired the howitzer. The NCR will be in for a surprise.
0ME0000794	You're listening to Black Mountain Radio.

0ME0000845	Boone now has 1st Recon Survival Armor, fitted with extra features and storage designed to help a sniper and his comrades survive the harsh desert environment. It will not count against his carrying capacity.
0ME0000852	As you flip the breakers, you hear the terminals around the room power down one by one.
0ME0000854	Opening the box you find a series of breakers that appear to correspond to the terminals nearby. Most of them appear to have their power cut.
0ME0000856	Leave the breakers alone.
0ME0000857	Resupply power to the terminals.
0ME0000858	As you flip the breakers, you hear the terminals around the room powering up one by one.

0ME0001029	Jam Opening Mechanism
0ME0001040	You plug your remote detonator into the terminal and set the primary trigger mechanism to begin the diagnostics on the generators, activating the detonator should cause the generators to explode.
0ME0001042	You think if you had a remote detonator, you could set it up to cause the generators to explode.
0ME0001044	A thorough examination of the nearby machinery reveals that the radio is directly linked to another system somewhere in the area, but isn't connected to the overall broadcast hub. It would be relatively simple to patch it into the speakers that dot the area.
0ME0001046	Leave the radio alone.
0ME0001047	Press the button.
0ME0001048	Patch the radio into the broadcast system.
0ME0001053	The radio appears to be connected to a series of nearby machines. The microphone hooked into it has a blinking button on the side.
0ME0001057	A second after you press the button, a harsh voice comes over the radio's speaker.
0ME0001059	The radio remains patched to the broadcast system.
0ME0001062	Link the radio to its original connection.

0ME0001214	You quickly ascertain that the robot's current AI state is set to hibernate, likely a self-defense mechanism after the unit suffered catastrophic damage. Whoever repaired it probably didn't know how to reset its AI. After flipping the right switch, the robot jumps to life.
0ME0001216	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get him, you fools!
0ME0001218	The transceiver is now dead. The connection must have been cut from the other side.
0ME0001220	The robot lies inert on the table, giving no indication of having worked recently, or ever. A nameplate on part of the surface is scratched and mostly faded, but you can still make out the faint word "Rhonda". If you knew more about how robots function, you might be able to get it working again.

0ME0001234	Veronica has returned to the 188 Trading Post.
0ME0001236	The note reads: "Not many patrols out here lately, which means not much loot.  Our crew is thinking we should make a move soon.  Follow the tracks up north; head towards the Strip. You in?  Ain't on the chain gang anymore, but we still gotta stick together."
0ME0001238	The note reads: "Some of the fellas farther north are trying to organize.  We're starting to think it's a good idea.  Got to pool resources if we're gonna survive out here.  Sure you've noticed the decline in travelers.  If they're getting wise, so should we."
0ME0001242	All of the broken solar arrays are repaired.
0ME0001245	That person is busy talking to someone else at the moment.
0ME0001363	You found a Limited Edition Mojave Landmark Snowglobe!
0ME0001364	These rare, pre-War artifacts are widely considered to be useless baubles, but rumor has it some collectors will pay dearly for them.
0ME0001368	V29-321G may look like a big, fat, red rocket, Rocketeers, but Ol' Fatty here ran circles around the Earth not so long ago, so let's see you keep up! Sure, V29-321G's re-entry gave it its more commonly-known nickname "Big Fat Fiery Fred," but here at REPCONN we chose to focus on the successes and apply what we learned about explosive-resistant shielding to future models and even our landing platforms!*
0ME0001369	* The newly-(re)constructed REPCONN Launch Facility was a direct beneficiary of this discovery.
0ME0001371	Officially called the "Z43-521P" by silly engineers, we prefer to call this little scrapper by its true nickname, the "Green Bean." After all, which would you prefer in your backyard garden - a smoldering Z43-521P, or a green bean?* One sounds like it belongs if mentioned on the news, and make news it did... featuring REPCONN's plasma engine, it was soooo newsworthy that we decided to take the Quantum Matter Modulation unit out and see if we could use it for non-explosive uses.
0ME0001372	* Rocket nickname chosen after results of first trial landing.
0ME0001374	We've all heard "stories" that radiation is dangerous - fact or fiction?* A common site in factories, military installations, and the basements of selected government-funded middle schools, these safety barrels* are just what the name implies - safe. While their attractive coloring can be interpreted as a warning, for REPCONN, it's an invitation to a future filled with nuclear power!
0ME0001375	* Rhetorical questions and nomenclature of exhibit items cannot be used as a basis for criminal prosecution.
0ME0001377	Whoa, watch your step! You don't want to be facing this fearsome fellow if you accidentally stumble into a restricted area. Whether sporting the latest in dual miniguns, rockets, or laser cannons, the Sentrybot not only takes it job seriously, it also takes no prisoners! It's proof of RobCo's commitment to defense that these deadly guards are concealed in chambers throughout this facility, so let this be a warning: Watch where you step, or out'll come RobCo, guns blazing!
0ME0001378	Exhibit Brought to You By Your Friends at RobCo
0ME0001380	RobCo's always had an eye for robotics, and this little fellow is no different! This robotic marvel can not only recognize your face and voice with advanced facial and auditory recognition technology, it can also broadcast video and audio as well! Think of it - all the sights and sounds of your radio and TV in your living room at home blasted directly at you on the street, subway, bathroom, or wherever you may be! Never fear, you'll never miss a news bulletin or presidential address again, no matter where you are!
0ME0001383	You never can have too many hands - three, why not four? That was RobCo's inspiration behind the popular (and cost-effective) Mr. Handy model, the first of the line shown here. Always a help around the household, whether with Mom in the kitchen using its titanium circular power saw or in the garage with Dad using its armor-piercing laser array, Mr. Handy is not just helpful... he's your friend, too.
0ME0001386	Some folks have asked - why not a Protectron with wheels? RobCo wasn't afraid to answer that question: The Protect-O-Bot is theanswer. While safety standards prevented this free-wheeling dynamo from entering mass market production despite RobCo's best intentions and teams of lawyers, we take consolation in letting you can see this extremely well-funded experiment as it was intended - a robot moving so fast it looks like it's standing still!
0ME0001389	Just like the rocket you see here, we're aimed at the sky, but we've got a ceiling in the way! See, Rocketeers, while REPCONN is (was) focused on non-radioactive* propulsion engines, we still need to sneak back and use some of our older "proven" techniques with nuclear-driven engines to make space travel a reality. Partnered with our new buddy RobCo, we've dug up older, cheaper technology for upcoming orbital projects. No worries, even if you can't always see what we're up to up there - we can see you!
0ME0001390	* Any implication of radioactive material as negative is unintentional and in no way reflects RobCo or its subsidiary REPCONN.
0ME0001392	What's this? A dull rod? Not so, Rocketeers! This "dull rod" once powered REPCONN's old nuclear-propelled rockets and still contains harmless* traces of radioactive material. As an exercise, stare closely* at the rod and try to spot the telltale glow!
0ME0001393	* While this case is lead-lined (standard in these cases, not specifically requested for this display), do not touch, look, or stand too close to this exhibit - keep your legs moving and see the rest of the museum!
0ME0001395	Why, look here! A pile of itty-bity safety barrels,* all nestled together like a family sitting down to dinner! Now, while it's claimed even the safest nuclear waste disposal procedures seep poison into the environment that never, ever goes away, in REPCONN's case, we say it all depends on where you put them - and Nevada's just the place!
0ME0001396	* Nomenclature for "hazardous waste barrels" as per REPCONN glossary specs.
0ME0001398	Hold up, Rocketeers, what's this? This trio of cylinders isn't a trio of cylinders at all!* They're containers holding what some* scientists call "plasma." Can you say "plasma?" REPCONN's always looking to the future, and in our future, we don't have to worry about radiation, health risks, or lawsuits when using this new and improved fuel source to blast our rockets into and out of the sky!
0ME0001399	* Clarification: "Cylinders" and "plasma" are factually correct designations of display items, both by definition and by the scientific community.
0ME0001401	A model of our solar system (not actual size). Beautiful, isn't it? RobCo, with its subsidiary REPCONN, has often gazed into the night sky, seeing the rich pageant of stars and planets above us. Our goal? To send unmanned rockets to these other systems, seeing their beauty firsthand while mining ever deeper into each planet's surface for precious resources needed here at home. This is our promise to mankind, extending our reach into a future where the number of RobCo and REPCONN rockets match the stars in the sky.
0ME0001402	This Exhibit Brought To You By Your Friends at RobCo
0ME0001404	This sleek and purple R77-293A "Needlenose" is what happens when you mix fossil and plasma in a rocket and shake it up! The fossil fuels punch this sharp-nosed terror through the sky, and the plasma is used to shoot it through space to planets where REPCONN can mine more fossil fuels,* continuing the whole cycle again!
0ME0001405	* Interplanetary mining and resource rights still in negotiation.
0ME0001407	Force your parents a short drive south, and you'll see the retractable dome of REPCONN's launch facility (not actual size!). You may have heard wild stories about rocket flights and their impact* on nearby towns and communities, but REPCONN feels you can't put a price of space exploration - after all, Rocketeers, you do want to go into space someday... don't you?
0ME0001408	* Statement is figurative and inadmissible as evidence in a court of law.

0ME0001484	Karma is an overall indication of your sense of good, evil... or neutrality.  Your Karma starts at Neutral, and changes based on your actions. It can go up to Good or Very Good, or down to Evil or Very Evil. Kind or self-sacrificing acts will net you good Karma. Selfish and malicious acts will earn evil Karma. Sometimes, killing a particularly saintly or terrible enemy will modify your Karma as well.
0ME0001485	Though some people in the world react to Karma, most base their opinons off of Reputation. Karma is simply the universe's way of tracking your good and bad deeds in the world.
0ME0001487	Addictions Removed

0ME0001622	From this moment forward, we shall each and every one of us revere you as the Saint of the Great Journey. We shall never forget you.
0ME0001624	We ask that you forgive us, Chris, and give us your blessing, as we bestow ours upon you. We are but humble servants of the creator's divine and mysterious will.
0ME0001626	It is your sacrifice that will bring us to the promised land. Seekers, board the rockets, take your seats. The Great Journey awaits! We go now to the Far Beyond!

0ME0001630	The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., allows you to pause the game, assess any combat situation tactically, and target the specific body parts of any enemies onscreen.    Pressing and holding [%] will pause the game and scan the area of targets; arrows to the left and right indicate threats that are currently offscreen.    To zoom in on an enemy, simply select it and release [%]. You are now able to target the individual body parts of that enemy.    The percentage value next to a body part indicates the chance to hit that body part with each shot. The small bar next to the body part indicates its condition; when the condition of a body part is completely reduced, that body part is crippled, and the targeted enemy will suffer the obvious ill effects -- crippling the legs reduces movement speed and any lunging attacks; crippling the arms affects accuracy, etc.    When using a melee weapon or unarmed combat, you will need to be close to have a chance to hit. Both melee and grenades are "full body" attacks, and you cannot specify a specific body part. As you raise your Melee Weapons or Unarmed skill, you will gain the ability to perform special attacks with weapons using those skills.    Every attack on a body part uses up Action Points. Generally, the smaller a weapon, the fewer Action Points are required for every shot. Keep in mind that you're not limited to shooting at just one target -- at any time, you can switch available targets, and attack them as well, so long as you have remaining Action Points.    When you've used up all of your Action Points, and are ready to leave V.A.T.S., press [%].

0ME0001885	Blackjack is a game played with one more standard decks of playing cards. In Fallout: New Vegas, it is played between the Courier and a casino dealer. The goal is to play a hand of two or more cards up to, but not exceeding, a combined value of 21 points. The value of each hand is determined by adding together the values of each individual card. Cards 2-10 are worth their listed value. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more advantageous. A hand that exceeds 21 in total value is considered a "bust" and immediately loses.
0ME0001886	After the initial bet is made, the player and dealer are both dealt two cards. Based on the Courier's current hand, the player has different options:
0ME0001887	* Hit - Add a new card to the Courier's hand. The player must accept the value of this card, though aces provide whatever value is most advantageous at any given time.
0ME0001888	* Stay - Courier's hand is effectively "locked" and the dealer will deal cards into his or her own hand until his or her hand is at least 17. Note: at some casinos, dealers will continue to hit on a "soft" 17 that contains an ace. In either case, the dealer has no decision-making process and will always follow the listed rule.
0ME0001889	* Double Down - The Courier's bet is doubled but the dealer will give the Courier's hand only a single additional card.
0ME0001890	* Split - If the Courier's initial hand is a pair, the player may double his or her bet and split the pair into two separate hands that are played individually.
0ME0001891	* Surrender - This option is only available immediately after the first cards are dealt. It offers the player the option to sacrifice half of his or her bet and immediately fold. It is typically only done when the player's hand is particularly bad and the dealer is showing a very strong hand (for example, an ace).
0ME0001892	Once the dealer has completed dealing into his or her own hand following the player's choice to stay, the values of the Courier's hand and the dealer's hand are compared. Assuming neither party has busted (gone over 21), the higher value wins. In the case of a tie, the hand is considered a push. If the dealer has "blackjack" (an ace and a ten-value card), he or she automatically wins unless the Courier also has blackjack. In that case, the hand is considered a push.
0ME0001893	Individual casinos use different numbers of card decks, pay out natural blackjack hands at different odds, and shuffle their decks with varying frequency. Pay close attention to these details to develop advanced playing strategies.
0ME0001895	Roulette is a game of chance in which a ball is spun on a spinning wheel marked with 38 colored and numbered pockets. As the ball loses momentum, it eventually drops into one of the pockets. Before the ball is spun, players place bets on individual numbers or groups of numbers, the colors red or black, or whether the number will be odd or even. If the ball lands in a pocket covered by one of the player's bets, he or she receives a reward proportional to the odds of his or her bet. Player bets fall into two categories: inside bets and outside bets.
0ME0001896	Inside Bets - Inside bets are placed on the numbered sections of the board or on the outside edges.
0ME0001897	* Straight-Up - A single number. The chip is entirely inside the square.
0ME0001898	* Split - Two adjoining numbers. The chip is placed on the line between the numbers.
0ME0001899	* Street - Three numbers in a horizontal line. The chip is placed at the edge of a line.
0ME0001900	* Six Line - Two adjoining streets. The chip is placed at the edge between two streets.
0ME0001901	* Corner - Four numbers in a square. The chip is placed at the intersection of the four numbers.
0ME0001902	* Basket - 0, 1, and 2; 0, 00, and 2; or 00, 2, and 3. The chip is placed at the intersection between the three numbers.
0ME0001903	* Top Line - 0, 00, 1, 2, and 3. The chip is placed at the corner of 0 and 1.
0ME0001904	Outside Bets - Outside bets are played off of the main numbered section of the board and never include 0 or 00.
0ME0001905	* 1-18, 19-36 - The first and second halves of the numbered board.
0ME0001906	* Red, Black - Red and black numbers.
0ME0001907	* Even, Odd - Even and odd numbers.
0ME0001908	* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Dozen - The first (1-12), second (13-24) or third (25-36) set of numbers.
0ME0001909	* 1st, 2nd, 3rd Column - A bet on an entire vertical column of numbers. The chip is placed at the base of the column.
0ME0001911	Slots are casino gambling machines that have three or more reels that spin when a button is pushed or lever is pulled. Each reel randomly stops on or between one of many symbols on the reel. Depending on the combination of symbols that comes up, the player will either lose his or her bet or receive a payout based on the odds of the combination coming up.
0ME0001912	Different slot machines have different numbers of symbols and correspondingly different payout odds. You can check the payout odds from within the game at any time.

0ME0003065	Weapons and apparel with low Condition suffer from decreased Damage and Damage Threshold, respectively. There are two primary ways to repair low Condition equipment: self-repair and repair vendors.
0ME0003066	* Self-Repair: In your Pip-Boy, the Repair menu shows any equipment you currently have that can be used to repair the selected piece of equipment. Highlight the piece of equipment you would like to sacrifice to make the repair. The efficiency of your repair is affected by your character's Repair skill.
0ME0003067	* Repair Vendors: Some characters in the world have the ability to repair equipment in exchange for caps. Though they require no special gear to perform the repair, they are limited by their own skill. Extremely talented repair vendors may be able to restore a weapon or piece of apparel to almost perfect condition, but it may be expensive.
0ME0003068	Once a weapon is above 75% Condition or piece of apparel is above 50% Condition, it is functioning as well as it can. Repairs made above that Condition are simply maintaining the equipment to keep it at peak performance for a longer period of time.

0ME0003080	You repair the gun controls and set the AA gun to attack any nearby aircraft.
0ME0003082	You take a look at the gun controls and realize you have no idea what you are doing. It's probably best to leave the controls alone.
0ME0003084	You've already rigged the control console. You leave it alone before you attract any unwanted attention.
0ME0003086	You cut a few solders on the circuit board and rewire it to slowly build up a charge that will cause the gun to explode sometime during the speech.
0ME0003088	As you start to work on the circuit board, a series of sparks shoots out. You stop before causing damage and attracting attention.
0ME0003090	This is private Watson's Helmet. If you had C4 and a detonator you could rig up a nice little surprise for the President. (Explosives 50 or higher Required)
0ME0003092	Leave the helmet alone.
0ME0003093	Hide C4 in the Helmet.
0ME0003094	You already rigged Watson's helmet with C4. You decide to leave it alone so you don't attract unwanted attention to it.
0ME0003096	You don't have any C4 to put in the helmet.
0ME0003098	You're not sure how to rig up the C4 in the helmet without it being noticed. You quickly put the helmet down before anyone sees you messing with it.
0ME0003100	You quickly cram a brick of C4 into Watson's helmet and rig it to your detonator. This will really blow their minds.

0ME0003207	This girl appears to have been tortured for several hours and then murdered. Judging by the rate of livor mortis, you guess the body has been here for 12 to 14 hours.

0ME3000344	The Laser Tripwire Emitter is currently off.
0ME3000346	This is your heart. Apparently, cranial surgery complications required its removal, and until your brain is returned, your heart can't be trusted to keep beating in your body. Your new heart seems to be working just fine, however.
0ME3000348	Here is your spine. Without a brain stem to snap it on to, here it floats. Your back doesn't feel any different from the spine's removal - if anything, whatever was placed in there makes you feel stronger.

0ME3000374	Enemy frenzied!
0ME3000376	Based on the other tanks in the room, you can safely assume this where your brain would be floating. It's currently missing from both the tank and its proper place in your head, but you seem to be doing just fine without it.
0ME3000378	Your brain floats here. You seem to be doing just fine without it.
0ME3000380	Your original spine used to float here.
0ME3000382	Your original heart used to be floating in here.
0ME3000384	This option doesn't seem to be available right now. Some sort of control override must be in place.
0ME3000386	Your brain used to float here.
0ME3000388	You have found a recalibration file for the Sonic Emitter. Take it to the Jukebox in the Sink to recalibrate the Sonic Emitter for new effects.
0ME3000390	You don't have the caps for that procedure.
0ME3000392	Old World Blues has been loaded. Your level cap has been raised by 5.
0ME3000394	You've gotten a fragmented signal on your Pip-Boy - a coded transmission of some sort with a sad, jazzy undercurrent that makes your head hurt. As far as you can tell, it appears to be an invitation to the Midnight Science-Fiction Feature! at the Mojave Drive-In (please arrive early to catch the trailers).

0ME4000035	Send Eyebot Shutdown Command (Science)
0ME4000036	This is an intact nuclear warhead. If what Ulysses said is true, the Laser Detonator in Hopeville should be able to trigger these to explode.
0ME4000038	ED-E has restored power to the silo's access controls.
0ME4000040	This terminal can only be accessed by an Eyebot.

0ME4000096	Try something else.
0ME4000097	Ask ED-E for help.
0ME4000098	This will launch Ulysses' missiles against targets in the heartland of the NCR, raining nuclear fire down on its cities and its people. Are you sure you want to continue?
0ME4000100	No.
0ME4000102	This will launch Ulysses' missiles against targets in the lands east of the Colorado controlled by Caesar's Legion, raining nuclear fire down on its cities and its tribes. Are you sure you want to continue?

0ME4000138	It looks like Ulysses left you one last package...
0ME4000140	This will launch Ulysses' missiles against targets in the heartland of the NCR and the lands held by Caesar's Legion, raining nuclear fire down on both factions. Are you sure you want to continue?
0ME4000144	You have gained the Camarader-E Perk (Rank 2), allowing ED-E to manufacture Small Energy Cells or Microfusion Cells once per day.
0ME4000146	You found a module on this broken Eyebot that can upgrade ED-E. Installing this module grants you the first rank of the Camarader-E Perk, allowing ED-E to repair your currently-equipped weapon once per day.

0ME4000150	It's Just Lucky You're Alive! (+4 Luck for 3 minutes)
0ME4000152	Your merciless nuclear assault on Caesar's Legion has devastated the lands east of the Colorado and reached even the borders of the Mojave. At Cottonwood Cove, you can now take a journey by river to the site of Dry wells, a devastated Legion encampment. Be prepared - the area is highly irradiated and infested with Legion ghouls.
0ME4000153	You have also unlocked the Scourge of the East Perk, allowing you to put a single point into any of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. You also gain reputation with the NCR for breaking the back of Caesar's Legion, but you lose reputation with Caesar's Legion.
0ME4000155	Your merciless nuclear assault on the NCR has devastated the lands of California and reached even the borders of the Mojave. At the Mojave Outpost, you can now travel through the western gate to Long 15, the site of a devastated NCR outpost. Be prepared - the area is highly irradiated and infested with former NCR ghouls.
0ME4000156	You have also unlocked the Bear-Slayer Perk, allowing you to put a single point into any of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. You also gain reputation with Caesar's Legion for annihilating the NCR's homeland, but lose reputation with the NCR.

At the Mojave Outpost, you can now travel through the western gate to Long 15, the site of a devastated NCR outpost. At Cottonwood Cove, you can now take a journey by river to Dry Wells, the site of a devastated Legion encampment. Be prepared - both areas are highly irradiated and infested with feral ghouls.
0ME4000159	You have also unlocked the Dead Man's Burden Perk, allowing you to put a single point into any of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. You also gain reputation with the Boomers and the Powder Gangers for your... destructive tendencies, but you lose reputation with the NCR and Caesar's Legion.
0ME4000161	The Divide broke cities, flayed skin from bone and threatened to destroy the world, but you survived it - and stopped it. You can put a single point into any of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes. You also gain reputation with the Followers of the Apocalypse and the Brotherhood of Steel for stopping another Armageddon.
0ME4000163	It looks like the missile hit somewhere on the other side of the Divide. You think you could reach the location of the blast from Hopeville... that is, if you feel brave enough to explore ground zero of a nuclear blast.
0ME4000165	You left ED-E behind in Ulysses' Temple - not that you needed the help anyway. As long as you have no companions, your attacks inflict +10 percent damage and you have +10 percent accuracy in VATS.

0ME4000217	The coordinates you received lead you to this canyon filled with storm-tossed wreckage. Beyond lies the Divide.
0ME4000218	Lonesome Road is intended for experienced Couriers (Level 25 or higher). You cannot take companions with you on the road ahead (nor bring any you find out with you). You can carry whatever equipment and gear you have with you without restriction, however.
0ME4000219	If the journey proves too difficult, or you need to resupply, you can retrace your steps and return to the Mojave at any time. If you are prepared, then continue on into the storms of the Divide... history awaits.
0ME4000221	Walk away.
0ME4000222	Walk the Lonesome Road.
0ME4000223	You've found the Laser Detonator Ulysses spoke of, a piece of Pre-War tech that can detonate the nuclear warheads scattered around the Lonesome Road. You can use it to open new paths, kill your enemies from afar, or even discover secret loot caches. Just point it at a warhead, hold down the trigger, and watch the explosion.
0ME4000224	If what Ulysses said is true, you'll need this to advance, which means there must be a warhead blocking the way forward. You'll need to find the correct warhead and detonate it.
0ME4000226	The mainframe is locked down with a secure, military-grade encryption sequence. The codes you uploaded to ED-E's system should be able to unlock it.
0ME4000229	Ask ED-E to unlock the mainframe.
0ME4000230	Use the controls' lever to restore power to the silo.
0ME4000232	Use the control station's lever to open the Ashton silo.
0ME4000234	You have found a Flash Bang grenade! Flash Bangs are special grenades that:
0ME4000235	- Deal Fatigue damage.
0ME4000236	- Reduce enemy weapon skills.
0ME4000237	- Have a chance to Frenzy Tunnelers.
0ME4000239	Your Pip-Boy has received a signal - coordinates that lead to the Canyon Wreckage west of Primm. Following the coordinates are the words "Courier Six." It's signed, "Ulysses."
0ME4000241	Lonesome Road has been loaded. Your level cap has been increased by 5.
0ME4000243	You cannot bring others with you into the Divide. This road is one you must walk alone.
