0DE0000082	> Let it be recorded that on this day, April 23rd, 2237, Raymond Lorn was dismissed from his post as Elder for committing the crime of murder. Brother Lorn was known to have hostile feelings toward the victim, Senior Scribe Ritter. The guilty party insists that Ritter's death was a tragic case of friendly fire (the bunker was under attack at the time), but the tribunal felt they could not let him persist as Elder with such suspicion hanging over him.
0DE0000083	> Be it known that from this day, the 7th of October, 2259, Kenneth Jones shall no longer bear the title of Elder. Brother Jones has willfully gone against the Chain That Binds and has been forced to step down. Head Paladin Lindquist succeeds him as Elder.

Orders are to flow from on high down through the ranks. An order from a superior must always be obeyed, that their wisdom may be carried out without hesitation.[CRLF][CRLF]2. Orders are to observe the flow and not skip ranks. A superior may only give orders to his direct subordinates, and not to those beneath them. In this way harmony of intent and cohesion of thought is maintained.

0DE0000185	In 2277, NCR forces defeated Caesar's Legion during the Battle of Hoover Dam. The NCR has held Hoover Dam since then, but the Legion has not made it easy for them.

0DE0000188	Though they have had a rough history, the legendary Great Khans are one of the longest-lived gangs to come out of the southwest.
0DE0000189	Brutalized by the NCR, the once-legendary Vipers and Jackals gangs have become little more than opportunistic, petty raiders.
0DE0000190	The New California Republic Rangers are volunteer elite special forces renowned as much for their shrewd reconnaissance capabilities as their bravery and combat prowess.
0DE0000191	Troopers are volunteer and conscripted forces in NCR's military. They vary widely in devotion, experience, and even in basic equipment. What they lack in consistency they make up for in numbers.
0DE0000192	Explorers are Caesar's advance scouts. Typically equipped in light armor and carrying binoculars, they are the Legion's message runners and keen eyes across the Mojave.
0DE0000193	Caesar's most trusted commanders are the centurions: battle-hardened front-line officers who dress in patchwork armor pieced together from their fallen foes.
0DE0000194	Legionaries are the standard soldiers in Caesar's Legion. Their level of experience and overall toughness can be determined by noting the color of their armor.
0DE0000195	Not commonly seen on the front lines, the vexillarius is a standard-bearer for Caesar's Legion. Their presence on the battlefield inspires legionaries to fight to the death for the glory of Caesar.
0DE0000196	Mr. House is the mysterious overlord of The Strip. He controls his small empire from the confines of the Lucky 38 casino, where no other living person has set foot for over two hundred years.
0DE0000197	The Followers of the Apocalypse are an organization with roots in the pre-NCR Boneyard. Dedicated to teaching the poor and healing the sick, they are also considered anarchist revolutionaries by many people in positions of power.

0DE0000204	Caravan is not played in casinos, but is very popular among caravan guards and other frequent travelers on the Long 15.
0DE0000205	Because Caravan allows players to build decks from any cards they can find, crafty caravan guards often come up with devious decks and strategies.
0DE0000206	Caravan is played for standard money of any and all kinds: caps, NCR dollars, or Legion coins. Because the players are often poor, the stakes tend to be low.
0DE0000207	Crafting can be done at any Workbench, Campfire, or Reloading Bench. Some companions even have the ability to help the player craft anywhere in the wasteland.
0DE0000208	Though you can see many crafting recipes at the start of the game, some recipes will not show up until you take special perks or have discovered them in the wasteland.
0DE0000209	Whether you're good, bad, or somewhere in between, all major communities and organizations in the Mojave Wasteland will pay attention to your reputation.
0DE0000210	Stealing, hurting people, and otherwise being a nuisance can negatively impact your reputation with a group.
0DE0000211	The Boomers are said to be xenophobic tribals armed with even more firepower than the Gun Runners. No one ventures into or out of their heavily guarded lands.
0DE0000212	Damage Threshold is subtracted directly from the DAM a weapon does. If DT is higher than the DAM of a weapon, very little damage gets through.
0DE0000213	If you see a red shield next to an enemy's health, it means that their armor's Damage Threshold is absorbing your weapon's damage. A broken red shield means you have completely negated their Damage Threshold.
0DE0000214	If you see a shield next to a your health HUD, it means that your Damage Threshold is absorbing an enemy weapon's damage. A broken shield means they have completely negated your Damage Threshold.
0DE0000215	Travelers along the Long 15 have complained to NCR rangers that caravans have been harassed and attacked by fearsome Super Mutants living in the irradiated ruins of Black Mountain.
0DE0000216	Travelers from northern NCR have been whispering about a small community of Super Mutants located high in the snow-capped mountains west of New Vegas.
0DE0000217	Players win and winners play, but the Strip's casinos don't generally tolerate openly worn weapons or gamblers who are too lucky at the tables.
0DE0000218	Food heals more slowly than stimpaks, but is more common in the Mojave Wasteland. The Survival skill can increase the healing benefits of all forms of food, including Campfire crafting recipes.
0DE0000219	As your Unarmed skill increases, you will unlock the ability to do uppercuts (50 Unarmed) and crosses (75 Unarmed) - both inside V.A.T.S. and out.
0DE0000220	Some individuals in the wasteland have the ability to teach you special unarmed moves.
0DE0000221	All companions give the player a bonus perk while they are in the party. Keep two companions around for double the perks!
0DE0000222	XP for kills made by companions is awarded to the player.
0DE0000223	Companions will heal themselves if they get a chance, but if you want to ensure they live a long life in your service, use the Companion Wheel to administer stimpaks directly.
0DE0000224	With the expansion of post-apocalyptic society across the American southwest, courier groups like the Mojave Express have appeared to take on the difficult task of carrying letters and packages over enormous distances.
0DE0000225	The higher the Charisma, the higher the Nerve. Nerve grants significant combat bonuses to all companions.
0DE0000226	"Prospector" is a polite word for "scavenger". Prospectors can be found all over the Mojave Wasteland, usually looking for the rare unopened safe at the bottom of an irradiated mineshaft.
0DE0000227	Though people around New Vegas have little interest in Pre-War tourist trinkets, there is one influential figure who has a soft spot for snow globes...
0DE0000228	Magazines provide temporary bonuses to skills but are much more common than the highly-prized skill books.
0DE0000229	The Wild Wasteland trait converts a few normally "ordinary" occurences into zany, wacky encounters. Do not take this trait unless you prefer your Fallout experience to be a bit more goofy than usual.
0DE0000230	The Shotgun Surgeon perk negates 10 points of enemy Damage Threshold while you are using any shotgun - handy for taking out lightly-armored opponents who would normally foil your buckshot.
0DE0000231	With Splash Damage, all of your explosions are increased in size, allowing you to carpet bomb an even larger area.
0DE0000232	Sad that you're too weak to keep a light machine gun on target? Take the Weapon Handling perk to remove 2 points from all weapon Strength requirements.
0DE0000233	Do companions annoy you by constantly running into your bullets and missiles? Take the Spray and Pray perk to drastically reduce the amount of damage your attacks inflict on all currently hired companions.
0DE0000234	Not sure what your reputation is with a current group? If you've earned one, you can find it in your Pip-Boy under Stats - General.
0DE0000235	The distinctive black ranger combat armor consists of the Desert Rangers' traditional trench coat worn with Pre-War riot armor. Ranger patrol armor is hand-manufactured in the NCR.
0DE0000236	Chief Hanlon is the head of the NCR Rangers and one of of its longest serving members. He coordinates the actions of the Rangers from their headquarters at Camp Golf.
0DE0000237	Legate Lanius, the Monster of the East, is the military commander of all Caesar's forces in the field. He is legendary for his devotion to Caesar and for his ability to sense weakness in any army.
0DE0000238	After the Legion lost the Battle of Hoover Dam, Caesar had his legate, Joshua Graham, covered in pitch, set on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon. Superstitious legionaries and tribals believe he lives on as the Burned Man.
0DE0000239	The King is dedicated to the cause of independence and personal liberty in Freeside. His gang, the Kings, attempts to keep some semblance of order in the streets.
0DE0000240	Due to disagreements over how technology should be controlled in the wasteland, the Brotherhood of Steel waged a long and bloody war against the NCR. Despite superior equipment and training, the Brotherhood eventually went into retreat.
0DE0000241	Though they were a powerful force in the west decades ago, the Enclave has not been seen or heard from in the Mojave Wasteland for years. Members who were not hunted down are believed to have traveled east - or successfully integrated into the NCR.

0DE0000443	Vault 11 has been abandoned for decades, though few people know the story of its terrible past.
0DE0000444	At the Battle of Hoover Dam, the tide turned for NCR when rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters lured Caesar's soldiers into the booby-trapped ruins of Boulder City.
0DE0000445	Established long ago in California, the Crimson Caravan Company and the Gun Runners are two of NCR's oldest and most powerful merchant houses.
0DE0000446	The families that now run the Strip of New Vegas were little more than squabbling tribes a few decades ago.
0DE0000447	Mojave Outpost is the site where the NCR Rangers and Desert Rangers of Nevada signed the Ranger Unification Treaty. It also marks the boundary of fully NCR-controlled territory.
0DE0000448	All territory east of the Colorado River is recognized as Caesar's land, an area indisputably under the control of the Legion and agents acting on Caesar's behalf.

0DE0000475	At the first rank of this perk, animals simply won't attack. At the second rank, they will actually come to your aid in combat, but never against another animal.

0DE0000481	With the Robotics Expert perk, you do an additional 25% damage to any robot. But, even better, sneaking up on a hostile robot undetected and activating it will put that robot into a permanent shutdown state.

0DE0000487	With the Entomologist perk, you do an additional +50% damage every time you attack a mutated insect, like the Radroach, Giant Mantis, or Radscorpion.

0DE0000498	Goodsprings was a ghost town before the war but continues to be important to Long 15 travelers for its fresh water supply.
0DE0000499	Often the first place NCR travelers stop after the Mojave Outpost, Primm is also where a lot of folks realize they left New Vegas with barely enough money to make the long trek back to The Hub.
0DE0000500	Though Boulder City survived the Great War without much damage, the NCR intentionally razed most of the town with a series of explosions during the Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DE0000501	The Silver Rush casino was in competition with The Atomic Wrangler until the owners ran afoul of the Van Graff family.
0DE0000502	The Old Mormon Fort is the oldest building in New Vegas and was recently occupied by the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DE0000503	The King's School of Impersonation is the "world" headquarters of the Freeside gang known as The Kings.
0DE0000504	Mr. House's Lucky 38 casino towers over the New Vegas Strip, mysterious and impenetrable to visitors and locals alike.
0DE0000505	Fully renovated by The Chairmen, the Tops is billed throughout New Vegas as a place for men to kick back, drink, laugh, and have a good time.
0DE0000506	The Omerta family sells a variety of services and delights to its patrons at Gomorrah, but most visitors are there for one thing: sex.
0DE0000507	The pinnacle of New Vegas refinement and class, the Ultra-Luxe casino is home to the discriminating White Glove Society and their pampered guests.
0DE0000508	Freeside was built up around the intersection of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Boulevard. The influx of destitute travelers in recent months has created problems for its local residents.
0DE0000509	The Strip is the heart of New Vegas, where Mr. House and the casino families are rebuilding the city in the image of its Pre-War glory.
0DE0000510	The NCR has maintained an embassy on The Strip for several years, but has had little success in building friendly relations with Mr. House or the ruling families.
0DE0000511	Though New Vegas is littered with debris of the Pre-War world, Michael Angelo continues to create new art and signs for Mr. House in his workshop on The Strip.
0DE0000512	It's not much to look at, but if you can't afford to get into The Strip, the Atomic Wrangler's the best place to gamble in Freeside.
0DE0000513	Not sure what skill a weapon uses? Look at the lower left corner of its Pip-Boy icon and compare it to the weapon skills.
0DE0000514	Explosive weapons are best used when dealing with crowds or in situations where precision is not a high priority.
0DE0000515	Guns are the most common ranged weapons in the Mojave Wasteland. They are numerous and varied and ammunition is relatively easy to acquire.
0DE0000516	Most Melee Weapons are completely silent, making them excellent stealth weapons.
0DE0000517	When your character's Melee Weapons score hits 50, you will be able to perform special power attacks and V.A.T.S. moves with different Melee Weapons.
0DE0000518	Talented Unarmed combatants in the Mojave Wasteland can teach specialized fighting styles to improve your abilities.
0DE0000519	Most Energy Weapons fall into one of two categories: laser, which is fast, accurate, and low-damage, and plasma, which is slow-moving and very high-damage.
0DE0000520	Energy Weapons are less common and varied than Guns, but have a small number of ammunition types and can be quite potent.
0DE0000521	A weapon's DPS is its Damage Per Second and is calculated using the weapon's base damage (modified by condition), your weapon skill, and the weapon's rate of fire.
0DE0000522	If you do not meet a weapon's Strength requirement, you may be less accurate with it or attack more slowly.
0DE0000523	At 75% Condition, a weapon will never jam and does maximum damage. At 50% Condition, armor protects against maximum damage.
0DE0000524	A wide variety of weapon mods are available from merchants for Guns, Energy Weapons, and even a few Explosives. Attaching them is as simple as using your Pip-Boy and opening the mod menu for your weapon.
0DE0000525	Weapon mods can increase ammo capacity and damage, reduce spread and weight, or add special equipment like scopes.
0DE0000539	You can run faster with your two-handed weapons holstered. One-handed weapons will not slow you down.
0DE0000540	Repair your weapons and armor regularly -- the lower their condition, the worse they will perform.
0DE0000541	For ideal shooting conditions, make sure you stop, crouch, and aim before firing.
0DE0000542	In Casual Mode, limb damage can be repaired directly by applying Stimpaks to affected areas, using the Pip-Boy. In Hardcore Mode, a Doctor's Bag or an actual doctor is required.
0DE0000543	Two-handed weapons and medium or heavy apparel will slow you down when they're equipped.
0DE0000544	If your weapons aren't strong enough to penetrate an enemy's armor, use armor-piercing ammo, attack from stealth, or use a weapon with higher DAM!
0DE0000546	A weapon with high DPS but low DAM is best used against unarmored opponents.
0DE0000547	Drinking water provides healing but may increase your radiation level. In Hardcore Mode, drinking water is vital for keeping your dehydration level down.

0DE0000573	You have +10 Action Points but your reckless nature causes you to have -2 Damage Threshold.

0DE1000110	The Sierra Madre was believed nothing more than a Mojave legend, a fabled City of Gold, where fortune could be found.
0DE1000111	The Pip-Boy 3000 is a safe, secure piece of Pre-War technology. It guarantees privacy, safety, and guidance in times of need.
0DE1000112	The Clinic boasted a holographic security system. The Security Hologram was immune to attacks. Only its emitter could shut it down.
0DE1000113	Mojave travelers have mysteriously vanished after claiming to have heard a woman's voice on a Pre-War radio broadcast. They are never heard from again.
0DE1000114	According to prospector stories, the Sierra Madre lies in a dead city, surrounded by a poisonous cloud.
0DE1000115	Bomb collar technology existed before the war, they come in several models. Their Pre-War use was unknown.
0DE1000116	In Hardcore mode, the poisonous Cloud that blankets the Sierra Madre slowly reduces health the longer one is outside.
0DE1000117	The Sierra Madre's concentrated toxic clouds erode health more quickly.
0DE1000118	Construction of the Sierra Madre casino began a few years before the Great War.
0DE1000119	The Sierra Madre chief architect and financier was Frederick Sinclair. The casino was intended as a place for guests to reverse their fortunes and "begin again."
0DE1000120	The origins of the Ghost People are a mystery, as is their strange reverence of the holographic ghosts that fill the city streets.
0DE1000121	The Ghost People are difficult to kill, and anyone who has survived an encounter with them suggests simply avoiding their attention.[CRLF]
0DE1000122	Dismemberment, energy weapons, explosives... and devouring... work best against the Ghost People of the Sierra Madre.
0DE1000123	Speakers were specially shielded to prevent vandalism. Some have broken over time, however, and these damaged speakers can be destroyed.
0DE1000124	While radios can be destroyed, destroying the Villa speakers depend on how well the speakers have held up, and if there are terminals controlling them.
0DE1000125	As part of casino policy, Sinclair forbade chems and "foreign substances" in the Villa and the Sierra Madre.
0DE1000126	All of the Madre's and Villa's conveniences were supplied by machines tied to the casino.
0DE1000127	Where the Vending Machine technology came from is unknown. While they take Sierra Madre Chips, they seem to supply a number of non-commercial services.
0DE1000128	It is easy to become separated and lost in the Cloud and the Villa. Keep teammates close - or tell them to wait in a place where you can find them again.[CRLF]
0DE1000129	Radios that interfere with collars can be shot or switched off. Speakers, however, may be shielded depending on the activation light.
0DE1000130	According to legend, the Sierra Madre is said to be filled with Pre-War ghosts, and sections of the city are haunted.
0DE1000131	The Residential District of the Villa was a place for the casino's high rollers and entertainers to enjoy the outdoors of the Villa... in seclusion.
0DE1000132	Radio interference can be ended by destroying or switching off radios.
0DE1000133	The Nightkin are Super Mutants, stealth troops created by the Master. They scattered across the wasteland after his defeat, taking refuge in remote locations.
0DE1000134	Nightkin's prolonged used of Stealth Boy technology has led to mental instabilities, including schizophrenia and multiple personality disorders.
0DE1000135	It is unknown why Sinclair tied the opening of the casino's gates to the Gala Event.
0DE1000136	The Sierra Madre's Gala Event is said to be a series of lights, music, fireworks in the sky, and a final stunning light show.
0DE1000137	The Sierra Madre was Frederick Sinclair's last venture before the Great War.
0DE1000138	Elijah has sent other teams into the Villa's streets. What happened to them is unknown.
0DE1000139	The Ghost People seem to prefer primitive traps, favoring falling beams, bear traps, and luring prey into toxic areas.
0DE1000140	Sinclair was drawn to the nostalgic Art Deco era, and it's reflected in the architecture of the casino.
0DE1000141	The Dead Man's Hand is said to be composed of Aces and Eights, a hand of cards a Pre-War legend was holding when shot in the back.
0DE1000142	Both Puesta del Sol and Salida del Sol had switching stations regulating their power.
0DE1000143	RobCo guarantees the safety and security of your Pip-Boy from anyone seeking to tamper with it. Your personal logs and archives are yours and yours alone.
0DE1000144	The strength of the Sierra Madre broadcast is unusual, as is the frequency, normally reserved for emergency broadcast signals before the war.
0DE1000145	The Villa streets are filled with evidence of the previous teams. Graffiti suggests they turned on each other, even when their lives were at stake.
0DE1000146	Sinclair forbade any other food or vending machines in the Villa beyond the ones he'd installed there.
0DE1000147	The alloy that makes up the Pre-War kitchen knives is unknown, and seems to have decayed in contact with the toxic cloud.
0DE1000148	Sinclair, the financier and architect of the Sierra Madre casino was obsessed with security, believed due to his own financial losses.
0DE1000149	It is said that a Sierra Madre snowglobe survives somewhere in the Villa.
0DE1000150	Puesta del Sol stands for "Sunset," and the view from the Puesta del Sol rooftops was said to be breathtaking.
0DE1000151	In order to meet deadlines, the construction of the Sierra Madre and the Villa were handled by two different companies.
0DE1000152	Puesta del Sol's construction lagged behind Salida del Sol. It was as if construction efforts ran out of steam - and money.
0DE1000153	Puesta del Sol's construction crews had numerous clashes and arguments with the casino construction crews.
0DE1000154	Sierra Madre security began to conduct inspections of the Puesta del Sol construction offices and confiscating prohibited chems and other substances.
0DE1000155	The origin of the Cloud surrounding the Sierra Madre is unknown.
0DE1000156	The whispers that fill the streets of the Villa seem to come from Pre-War speakers, still piping in recorded music on reels that long since eroded.
0DE1000157	Early in the Villa's building stages, construction crews suffered numerous setbacks - and accidents.
0DE1000158	Shipping problems also plagued the Villa - construction explosives, countless crates of steak knives, and more were shipped to the Villa, paid for, and left.
0DE1000159	Salida del Sol stands for "Sunrise," and it was the home of the church and homes of many of the casino staff.
0DE1000160	The Sierra Madre is said to have an automated front desk that would escort guests to their rooms upon arrival. The status of this system is unknown.
0DE1000161	The doors of the Sierra Madre were designed to hermetically seal in case of emergency.
0DE1000162	It is said the dead in the Sierra Madre continue to gamble and drink among ghosts and whispers of times gone by.
0DE1000163	The walls of the casino are lined with a metal that interferes with radio reception and broadcasts.
0DE1000164	The bomb collars don't seem to work between floors of the casino, although they do work if two individuals are on the same floor.
0DE1000165	Part of Sierra Madre security was to prevent contraband or "foreign influences" from entering the Villa area. Visitors were often searched, and their belongings taken by the casino.
0DE1000166	The security center for the Sierra Madre was said to have arms and armaments beyond conventional casino security.
0DE1000167	The reason for the mines, heavy weapons, and other military gear in the casino's security centers is unknown. Some speculate Sinclair feared a Chinese attack on American soil.
0DE1000168	The Sierra Madre Holograms follow simple routines - vendors, bartenders, ushers, and greeters.
0DE1000169	Holograms cannot be targeted or harmed - only avoided, or their emitters destroyed.
0DE1000170	One of the draws of the Gala Event was a performance by Dean Domino in the Tampico Theater.
0DE1000171	The kitchens of the Sierra Madre were shooting for a 5 star rating, and sought to bring in the best chefs in the world.
0DE1000172	The financier and architect of the Sierra Madre casino, Frederick Sinclair, suffered many crippling losses in the 2070s.
0DE1000173	Vera Keyes was a Pre-War Hollywood starlet. Her claim to fame was a number of poorly-written romances that nonetheless drew in large box office crowds - and poor reviews.
0DE1000174	Pre-War tabloids and gossip columns claimed that Vera Keyes and Dean Domino had a torrid affair, predating her relationship with Sinclair.
0DE1000175	Not much is known about Vera Keyes, only that that is not believed to have been her real name.
0DE1000176	Tabloids and newspapers often called Vera Keyes a "kept" woman. Sierra Madre security proved them right.
0DE1000177	"Love Sets Sail" received the largest box-office draw of all of Vera's movies - and the most scathing of reviews.
0DE1000178	The Sierra Madre is a legend, like the Big Empty, the Burned Man, and the rumors of survivors from the Divide.
0DE1000179	It is believed Holograms stemmed from Stealth Boy technology rising from scientific drive to match the Chinese stealth suits.
0DE1000180	Hologram technology never achieved the same level of prominence, notably due to the excessive energy constraints.
0DE1000181	There are no reports of hologram technology being popular in the Pre-War era, and certainly no reports of Holograms employing weapons.
0DE1000182	The Hologram's hostile stance is said to have been inspired by a Pre-War sci-fi horror movie that made the world stand still.
