0DI0000001	You have quite the menagerie at your disposal. If you can get the posse down to "small gang" size, I'll happily go with you.
0DI0000002	As the old saying goes, two's company, but three's a small army. Okay, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea.
0DI0000003	A courier, a doctor, and cybernetic dog. After we deal with this whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem we should open an act at the Tops.
0DI0000004	There's something about that robot that doesn't seem... all right to me. I'm not saying we shouldn't take it with us.
0DI0000005	I'm just saying that if it were to fall into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
0DI0000006	Well, there are worse things happening in the world, right?
0DI0000007	After spending thirty years of my life hiding my association with the Enclave, I'd love to stroll the wasteland with a twitchy Eyebot.
0DI0000008	Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I do.
0DI0000009	Back in your good graces again? I knew you'd see the light.
0DI0000010	I don't think you need to worry about the specifics. Basically, expect a lot of firepower and dead bodies.
0DI0000011	Enclave technology is even more advanced than Brotherhood equipment, and in the hands of soldiers as experienced as Moreno and the others...
0DI0000012	Let's just say it's truly a sight to behold.
0DI0000013	You'll need someone to watch your back - Craig Boone, an NCR sniper, will be joining you. Keep your head down out there!
0DI0000014	A pity. I guess I'll have to find some other way to acquire her caravan's assets. Thanks for letting me know.
0DI0000015	Told you everything about us, did he? Well, it's been a while since I've had my hands on the controls of a vertibird.
0DI0000016	There's a chance I could crash us in the middle of Lake Mead - that place seems to attract aircraft, for some reason.
0DI0000017	But, if I'll get one more chance to fly, count me in. I'll be there. My part of the pass phrase is "Dear."
0DI0000018	Been awhile, Arcade. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
0DI0000019	Arcade, huh? Heard he was with the Followers of the Apocalypse. So, what's the point of all this? Can't find any younger mercenaries?
0DI0000020	Corporal White? I don't know where he - uh, I mean, never heard of him. Uh, I gotta go...
0DI0000021	I expect results sooner rather than later.
0DI0000022	They'll be of no use to the Legion, then.
0DI0000023	You squandered a potentially valuable resource. Do better with your next assignment or there will be trouble...
0DI0000024	Good. It will be valuable to have allies on the Strip when Hoover Dam is taken. Now, as for your next assignment...
0DI0000025	You've been resourceful in the past. Why are you a failure now?
0DI0000026	You'd best step up your performance with this next assignment...
0DI0000027	Then get to it.
0DI0000028	A perfectly satisfactory way of resolving the threat they posed. It's impressive that you made it through their barrage.
0DI0000029	Now, as for your next assignment...
0DI0000030	Good. Make sure they help the Legion when the time comes. As for your next assignment...
0DI0000031	Yeah, all right. If McLafferty complains long enough, my folks might haul me back to California just to shut her up. Tell the old hag I'm gone.
0DI0000032	Simple enough to change. I doubt the Legion's listening in on us - they're not that sophisticated - but better safe than sorry, right?
0DI0000033	Very well. You can tell Reyes that this station is secure.
0DI0000034	What, again? Didn't I just change those damn things? All right, fine - show me the new codes.
0DI0000035	Oh. Uh... well, yeah, I can do that. Um, thanks.
0DI0000036	You must be mistaken - I haven't filed any report like that. Trained deathclaws? I would have remembered that.
0DI0000037	If someone is saying I filed that report, that's a load of crap. I won't have my name attached to a clerical error.
0DI0000038	Good. I'm sure you were thorough. Here's your payment for a job well done.
0DI0000039	Shit. Is he serious? The 25% increase in weapons is doable, but a 50% increase in ammunition is nuts.
0DI0000040	We just don't have the supplies on hand to meet that kind of demand for new weapons.
0DI0000041	Well, you've proven yourself reliable so far. Would you be interested in more important jobs?
0DI0000042	Yes, I'd heard something about his untimely death. There will be a lot of questions from his family, so I trust you had nothing to do with this.
0DI0000043	I guess the one bright spot is that I can strike his name from the payroll after all.
0DI0000044	Yes, but at significant cost. I understand that you not only agreed that the company pay off his gambling debts, but he also gets severance.
0DI0000045	I'm disappointed with this outcome, but what's done is done. At least we're rid of Henry.
0DI0000046	Yes, I understand that he's decided to quit outright and not even ask for compensation. I'm a bit curious what exactly you said to him.
0DI0000047	Then again, perhaps I'd rather not know. Thank you all the same - I'm very happy to be rid of that man.
0DI0000048	Yes, I heard. I believe we're now responsible for paying off his gambling debts, but that you bargained him down from a more outrageous demand.
0DI0000049	Well done. I'm very pleased to be rid of that man.
0DI0000050	Very good. On occasion it's proven to be more profitable in the long run to simply buy out the competition, and this is one of those occasions.
0DI0000051	The Gun Runners detected an intruder roaming around, so they'll like be aware of the theft soon enough.
0DI0000052	This unfortunate circumstance will prevent us from immediately using their blueprints to manufacture weapons. A pity.
0DI0000053	The Gun Runners will be looking for revenge for the murder of their people. I won't sell you out, but be careful out there.
0DI0000054	We'll be unable to make use of their schematics any time soon. Not what I was hoping for when I asked you to do the job. Take your pay.
0DI0000055	I hear it's business as usual at the Gun Runners, as if nothing unusual happened. Excellent work.
0DI0000056	We'll be able to use the schematics you acquired to begin manufacturing our own weapons immediately. We'll provide some to you at a discount.
0DI0000057	I can probably handle that. Just the same as changing a light bulb, except stickier and smellier. Right?
0DI0000058	Anyway, what did you bring me?
0DI0000059	That puts a dent in the town treasury. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
0DI0000060	Whoa, whoa. Thought you looked familiar. I'm just doing a job, nothing more. Politics aren't my thing, so if you say go, we'll go. No hard feelings.
0DI0000061	Because you're a friend of the Followers, I can give you a bit of a discount.
0DI0000063	Thought I recognized the fellow with you. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
0DI0000064	There's a name I haven't heard in awhile. So, what's this reunion all about, then?
0DI0000065	Hello, Arcade. Making some new friends, are you?
0DI0000066	Why the need for a bunch of old warhorses like us?
0DI0000068	Antique rangefinder? I'm trying to think of something that'd be more worthless.
0DI0000069	Maybe an antique horoscope. Or an antique sandwich.
0DI0000070	I'll tell you something. Good luck finding that thing. But if you do find it, don't waste your time trying to sell it to me.
0DI0000071	All right, that's a start. But now you have to convince them to support my Legion.
0DI0000072	Tell them they'll be allowed to continue practicing their dietary habits without interruption. They can eat a portion of what they conquer.
0DI0000073	Good. Your first challenge will be to reach their settlement without getting blown up. After that, should be easy.
0DI0000074	[SUCCEEDED] And you think the value of their attack on HELIOS, the chaos it will sow behind the Profligates' lines, is worth letting them live.
0DI0000075	All right, let it be so. The Brotherhood will have to be dealt with eventually, but for the moment, they live to serve.
0DI0000076	[FAILED] And you think they'll stop at that? How long before they attack the dam, or Vegas?
0DI0000077	The risks outweigh the rewards. Go back to their bunker and finish the job.
0DI0000078	Good. I don't know what kind of security he has inside the Lucky 38, but if you can find a way of catching him off-guard, do so.
0DI0000079	Is that right? You are good, aren't you?
0DI0000080	If the Boomers are out of the picture, I can focus on other preparations - but not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
0DI0000081	Is that so? You are good, aren't you?
0DI0000082	If the Boomers will toe the line, I can focus on other preparations. But not without first rewarding your initiative. Now moving on...
0DI0000083	The leader of the tribe is a woman named Marjorie. My understanding is that she strongly opposes a reversion to cannibalism.
0DI0000084	If she's intractable, you might find Mortimer, her second-in-command, more flexible.
0DI0000085	You destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker? Very well.
0DI0000086	I'll trust your word, and reward you as though you wreaked this destruction at my behest.
0DI0000087	Of course, if the Brotherhood should suddenly rise up to oppose my rule, you will be held responsible. Now, moving on...
0DI0000088	Very well. This latest victory brings to a close my efforts to reshape the power balance of the Mojave - and not a minute too soon...
0DI0000089	That's what I like to hear.
0DI0000090	One of my Frumentarii has set up camp near Hoover Dam. His name his Cato Hostilius.
0DI0000091	Go to him. He'll have further instructions.
0DI0000092	Don't have it. Benny stole it, right before he stabbed us in the back. He's probably back at the Strip by now, laughing at me.
0DI0000093	One of my patrols was on its way back from Novac when it came under fire from the Great Khans.
0DI0000094	They radioed for reinforcements, but instead of waiting for us, they chased the Khans into the ruins where they were caught in a crossfire.
0DI0000095	No deaths, but not all of the squad got out. The Khans have Private Ackerman and Private Gilbert as hostages.
0DI0000096	You're right about that.  Saint James! Got a thief here!
0DI0000097	Oh, I think I'd like that. A lot. Maybe even give you a discount for my... company.
0DI0000098	You did? Well, that's one hell of a service to humanity, then.
0DI0000099	I guess I always thought maybe I'd be the one to do it, but I just... never got my nerve up.
0DI0000100	Maybe I'll sleep good tonight... Here, take this. It's how I say thanks.
0DI0000101	It's about time. I saw some of the townies gathering at the saloon, so we've got a militia to take down. We get rid of them and we own this place.
0DI0000102	Good. We'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
0DI0000103	We ain't got much in the way of supplies, so if you could shake down the old doctor and the store owner for some stuff, we'd be in good shape.
0DI0000104	Once you're done with that stuff - or none of it - say the word and we'll make our move.
0DI0000105	I figure we'll hang around Goodsprings for awhile, maybe get some of the other gangs to join up with us.
0DI0000106	Won't kill anybody else unless we have to. Just as long as people do what we tell them, they'll be all right.
0DI0000107	[SUCCEEDED] All right, but put everything back the way you found it!
0DI0000108	[FAILED] No offense, pardner, but I'd rather not have you rooting around in there. It's technical-like.
0DI0000109	Oh, b-b-because of what that fuck Cook-Cook did? W-well, it's n-not the same thing, but D-Doc Usanagi helped me with my s-s-stuttering.
0DI0000110	The d-doc has a c-clinic north of here. Can't m-m-miss it. You should t-talk to Bitter-Root, too. He's b-been to see the doc, too.
0DI0000111	It's a pride thing with her, and totally unnecessary. I mean, look at me - I was Ranger Sterling until the Legion got through with me.
0DI0000112	I was bitter, but if I'd kept my mouth shut, the NCR would've discharged me and sent me home. Instead, I asked if there was still a place for me.
0DI0000113	I had to prove I could still handle a gun alongside all the recruits, but look at me now - First Recon and still going strong. You tell Betsy that.
0DI0000114	Whatever you need, we'll make sure it gets done.
0DI0000115	If you need help from my team, just give the word. Driver Nephi's earned himself a few bullets in the gut.
0DI0000116	10 of Spades really ought to keep his mouth shut, but he's right. There were a lot of things in my past I just couldn't leave behind.
0DI0000117	It helped. A little. Well, more than a little. Betsy ought to pay a visit to Usanagi since it can't hurt none.
0DI0000118	This is Powder Ganger territory - my territory. Most of the guys around here understand that. One, Chavez, doesn't.
0DI0000119	Chavez formed his own crew and have been hitting traders on their own. Everybody I've sent after him either got killed or weren't able to catch him.
0DI0000120	That leaves you. What do you say?
0DI0000121	Nothing's changed. Chavez won't answer to me, but he and his crew operate in my territory. Deal with him.
0DI0000122	Sounds like they're already here. There's no way I'm letting them take me alive.
0DI0000123	There's no reason for you to stick around and help us, but feel free to kill a few of the bastards on your way out.
0DI0000124	I'm happy you cleaned that up for me, but we've got another situation to worry about. There's a merchant hanging around near the prison.
0DI0000125	Something feels funny about him, and I want you to deal with him. Shake him down if he's legit, but if he's not, take him out.
0DI0000126	Good. Had him figured for NCR, one of the rangers maybe. Anyway, speaking of the NCR, I need you to take a walk down to Primm.
0DI0000127	The NCR hasn't raised hell over our breakout, and I want to find out why. They're up to something, I can feel it.
0DI0000128	Assuming an NCR pardon comes with the job - and it had better - I'll also need to be able to do things my own way.
0DI0000129	Due process has its place, but sometimes it's just a waste of time. I'll need to know that I'm not going to end up right back in prison.
0DI0000130	My terms are the same. A pardon from the NCR and the freedom to do the job anyway I see fit.
0DI0000131	The loss of morale in the NCR must have been staggering when their leader fell. It's proof that no one is out of the Legion's reach.
0DI0000132	We are preparing to move against the Dam, and Legate Lanius has a part for you to play in the battle. Report to him at his camp.
0DI0000133	Killing Kimball would've struck fear into the NCR. It's unfortunate that you weren't able to take advantage of this opportunity.
0DI0000135	No... I suppose not. You've proved that you're a friend to us many times. I apologize for my temper.
0DI0000136	Very well. I'll have him seized and brought to Caesar as his personal physician.
0DI0000137	So shall I have him seized or not?
0DI0000141	Little escapes the notice of Caesar. He has eyes everywhere.
0DI0000142	I am Vulpes Inculta, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the greatest of his Frumentarii.
0DI0000143	I am the greatest of his Caesar's Frumentarii. It was not a challenge to find you. Nor is this my first visit to the Strip.
0DI0000144	Yeah, was a stupid idea, anyway. See you around.
0DI0000145	Hmm... this is exactly the kind of symbol the Khans could unite behind.
0DI0000146	We'll begin readying the camp to move. As soon as Caesar makes his move, we'll depart. We will make ourselves strong again, and we shall conquer!
0DI0000149	Great Khans! Drive Caesar's dog out of our camp! If he's too slow to flee, kill him!
0DI0000150	Glad to hear it! I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
0DI0000151	Before you go, I've got another job available.
0DI0000152	The station's been silent for quite some time now... I guess this confirms what we've all feared. Thanks for letting me know.
0DI0000153	I'll switch over all radio broadcasts to the new encrypted channels - this ought to help us stay a step ahead of any spies.
0DI0000155	We've received some disturbing reports from some of the Ranger stations - heavy casualties at Alpha, Super Mutant Legionaries at Delta.
0DI0000156	The weirdest one has to be the Great Khans and their trained Deathclaws at Foxtrot. These reports can't be accurate. Can they?
0DI0000157	I know you've already been out there, but could you do me a solid and confirm these reports with the Rangers who sent them in?
0DI0000158	Have you now? Hmm. Well, you're a bold one, I'll give you that, but why should I do this for you?
0DI0000159	Hmm. I have heard some things from my most trusted Khans that makes me wonder whether this alliance is a good idea after all.
0DI0000160	But I want to leave a legacy of greatness when I die. My tribe deserves better than this, cowering in a canyon and living on scraps.
0DI0000161	Tell me then, if I don't join with Caesar's Legion, where will I find my tribe's lost glory?
0DI0000162	I heard you try to convince Papa Khan not to join with Caesar's Legion. I'd like to talk to you about that for a moment.
0DI0000163	Let me see. My God, this is even worse than I thought. Okay, you have my support. I'll tell Papa the alliance is a bad idea.
0DI0000165	That's a complicated question. They've done horrible things to our people to be sure, and I've gladly killed many of their soldiers in battle.
0DI0000166	But I can't bring myself to hate them the way Papa does. Things would damn sure be better for us if they were in charge than Caesar.
0DI0000167	You're the chief now. What do we do?
0DI0000168	Without Papa Khan's guidance, I don't know what else to do. All right - you can tell the NCR the Great Khans will fight for them when Caesar attacks.
0DI0000169	Oh, it's cool, man. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
0DI0000170	Oh, it's cool, man, I got your back.
0DI0000171	Huh? Look, man, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
0DI0000172	Sure, Caesar's a drag, but as long as we got each other, we don't care who the top dogs roll with.
0DI0000173	Oh, it's cool, kitten. Diane passed me the haps on that fandango with Anders. I got your back.
0DI0000174	Oh, it's cool, kitty cat, I got your back.
0DI0000175	Huh? Look, kitty cat, me and Diane, we don't dig on that politics stuff, savvy? We just make the product and make it get to a good home.
0DI0000177	Doctor Henry? Now there's a name I haven't heard in years. Hard to believe he's still alive.
0DI0000178	As for your request, it's, uh, a bit ghoulish if you ask me, but Rey is pretty old and I'll probably have to put him down soon enough.
0DI0000179	As for the price for this favor, 700 caps sounds about right. Rey's like family, and I've got other dogs to take care of.
0DI0000180	Like I said before, give me 700 caps and Rey's brain is yours.
0DI0000181	Don't worry, Jack and I have talked it over. We'll talk up the idea of breaking the alliance.
0DI0000182	Anders got back a little while before you did, he told me what happened. If that's how the Legion treats my people, I don't want any part of them.
0DI0000183	Hey, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
0DI0000184	Ah, yes. I think I know which friend you mean. Even if there weren't Deathclaws in the quarry, there'd still be no delivery.
0DI0000185	The supplier, a guy in Primm named Tyrone, is a cheating son of a bitch who won't deliver even though he's already been paid in advance.
0DI0000186	It's neural degradation. Bio med gel can only preserve a living brain for so long, so you'll need to find a replacement.
0DI0000187	I haven't left Jacobstown in years, but there was one woman in Novac... Gibson? I remember her living with a pack of hounds.
0DI0000188	Aside from her, I know that the Fiends and Caesar's Legion fight alongside dogs. There could be viable specimens among them, if you can get to them.
0DI0000189	I don't see him with you. Bring him to me and I'll take a look. Otherwise, I'll just be guessing.
0DI0000190	Who won the second Battle of Hoover Dam?
0DI0000191	No one by that name has come here, I'm afraid. You must've heard wrong. You can ask around if you'd like - they'll all tell you the same thing.
0DI0000192	I suppose there's no point in denying it any longer. I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
0DI0000193	We don't have the money to pay for the water, so I rigged the pump station to divert water to the local cisterns from time to time.
0DI0000194	Cyber-dog? Like the ones I've seen up in Denver? I know what you're talking about, and it would make Lupa immortal in a way.
0DI0000195	You sure? Last chance to back out.
0DI0000196	That's okay, I'll fix him! Can I have him now?
0DI0000197	No, imbecile, that's not how it works. I set up the fights, then you go in the arena and fight.
0DI0000198	Thank you, Colonel Moore. And thank you, my fellow Californians, who have come so far to answer the call to service put forth by the republic.
0DI0000199	It is for you that I have come here, and it is because of you that I am able to do so.
0DI0000200	We enjoy our privileges because you take the greatest of risks and are prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices.
0DI0000201	It is because of men and women like Private First Class Jeremy Watson that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.
0DI0000202	Born in a tin shack on the outskirts of One Pine, Jeremy Watson never had it easy.
0DI0000203	His father worked as a caravan guard on the Short Loop, and his mother, like many Californians, braved the ruins of the Old World as a prospector.
0DI0000204	They suffered through water shortages, raider attacks, and the Brotherhood War. Like our mighty Sierra Nevadas, they endured.
0DI0000205	But the time came when they could no longer shoulder the burden alone.
0DI0000206	Twelve years ago, they called out for help, and the republic heard them. Troopers and rangers, just like you, answered the clarion call.
0DI0000207	Men and women stepped forward to say, "I will carry the weight."
0DI0000208	And at Owen's Lake, we made true on our promise, driving out the raider tribes to establish a lasting peace in the eastern Sierra Nevadas.
0DI0000209	We carried the weight, and though we left behind many of our brothers and sisters on that battlefield, it did not break us.
0DI0000210	Ten years ago, Chief Elise met with representatives of the Desert Rangers to discuss terms of what would become the Ranger Unification Treaty.
0DI0000211	The treaty was more than a resolution to welcome the Desert Rangers into the republic.
0DI0000212	It was a covenant to protect southern Nevada against Caesar's Legion and the tyranny of his regime.
0DI0000213	There are some back home who ask me, "But who are we protecting?  What is Nevada to us?"
0DI0000214	Sometimes we forget that the light of our society shines beyond our borders.
0DI0000215	Sometimes we take those privileges for granted that our forebears fought so hard to achieve.
0DI0000216	We must always remember that wherever Californians stand, we carry our principles with us:
0DI0000217	equal respect, representation, and protection under the laws of a just republic.
0DI0000218	This was the same fire that burned in the heart of the Old World that preceded us.
0DI0000219	We are the heirs of that civilization, torchbearers eastward of the Pacific, into the darkness of this wasted land.
0DI0000220	When the republic called on the men and women of California to carry that fire across the Mojave, Jeremy Watson answered. You answered.
0DI0000221	Together, you carried the weight. And when PFC Watson's platoon came under attack at Forlorn Hope, he took the greatest risk,
0DI0000222	not only for his fellow Californians, but for California itself.
0DI0000223	He was prepared to make the most noble of sacrifices, to defend the principles of our republic, even here, on Nevada soil.
0DI0000224	His actions are a beacon to all of us who stand here today in tribute to his valor.
0DI0000225	Private First Class Jeremy Watson, on behalf of the senate and people of the New California Republic,
0DI0000226	it is my honor to present you with the Star of Sierra Madre.
0DI0000227	Not far from this spot, a monument stands as a tribute to the sacrifice made by those who came before us,
0DI0000228	the men and women who fulfilled the promise we made to the Desert Rangers.
0DI0000229	Its back is inscribed with the names of the troopers and rangers who carried the weight.
0DI0000230	And because they made the most noble of sacrifices, it did not break us.
0DI0000231	Four years ago, we held this dam. Four years ago, we carried the weight.
0DI0000232	Four years ago, we drew a line through the Mojave as clear as the Colorado River, a line that Caesar cannot cross.
0DI0000233	Today, you stand here with our brothers and sisters to hold that line. Today, you honor all Californians by carrying that weight.
0DI0000234	Today, you are the waves of the Pacific, pushing ever eastward. You are the sequoias rising from the Sierra Nevadas, defiant and enduring.
0DI0000235	You are the great western light of California, torchbearers in the darkness, living reminders of all that is best in our republic.
0DI0000236	Thank you. Thank you.
0DI0000237	Okay, let's get the fuck out of here. What the hell are you waiting for? You think I want to get shot?  Let's go!
0DI0000238	Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for coming out here today for this very special occasion.
0DI0000239	It is my pleasure to introduce to you. The President of the New California Republic, Aaron Kimball!
0DI0000240	Tell your ruler we have no interest in such ties. Caesar's Legion is a collection of unclean barbarians.
0DI0000241	Any time the White Glove Society is mentioned in the same breath, it sullies our good name.
0DI0000242	As much as Mortimer and some of the other members have tried to convince me otherwise, I will not have us seen as savages.
0DI0000243	Looking to elevate his social status, is he?
0DI0000244	I'll admit, I could see benefits to living under his rule. Certain... transgressions he'd be willing to overlook.
0DI0000245	But that's neither here nor there, I'm afraid. Marjorie won't have it, as long as she fails to see the wisdom of my perspective.
0DI0000246	I don't care for their incivility or the hodgepodge of sporting equipment that passes for fashion with them.
0DI0000247	Nevertheless, I have heard Caesar has a stately dignity about him. And I understand his policies will agree with our new menu.
0DI0000248	I prefer Mr. House, of course, but he may not be around forever. And the NCR will surely set back our cuisine. Tell your Mr. Caesar we are with him.
0DI0000249	You there! Stop!
0DI0000250	Imposter!
0DI0000251	An outsider! In the bunker!
0DI0000252	The name's Knight. Billy Knight. And this here is what a lifelong career in comedy will get you.
0DI0000253	Really? The Tops, huh? Well, it's no Shark Club, but I hear security on the Strip is real tight. Even Mr. Bishop wouldn't hit a joint like that.
0DI0000254	I'll check it out. Thanks!
0DI0000255	I saw him heading for his suite just a few minutes ago. Looked like a fox that just got caught in the henhouse. Maybe you'll catch him there.
0DI0000256	It was a while ago! He came through in a real hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out in the hall!
0DI0000257	Dig it, baby, he beat feet to his suite. You scare the big boss man or something?
0DI0000258	Sure! He came through here in a big hurry - didn't even stop to say hello! I think he went down his secret escape elevator out there in the hall!
0DI0000259	He was around not too long ago. He's probably down on the casino floor now.
0DI0000260	You can wait for him here, if you like. I'm incapable of asking you to leave.
0DI0000261	No problem. Hey, do me a favor when you get back to Reyes and tell her that we don't need any more damn ammo. Wouldn't mind more water, though.
0DI0000262	Good question! My function is to monitor Mr. House's data network and decode his encrypted transmissions!
0DI0000263	Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a PDQ-88b Securitron, but you can call me Yes Man!
0DI0000264	Ain't been on the strip long, have you, pal? Name's Swank. This is my joint.
0DI0000265	Baby, I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. Name's Swank. This here's my joint.
0DI0000266	I have the delightful task of tabulating stockpiles, kill ratios, mission success rates, radiation deaths, and other truly fascinating numbers.
0DI0000267	I've come across numerous inconsistencies between our numbers and our reports - especially with regards to intercepting hostiles.
0DI0000268	I'm wondering if our radio security codes have been compromised. I need someone to deliver security code upgrades to each of the Ranger stations.
0DI0000269	I am ready to process our transaction.
0DI0000270	I respect the way you've conducted yourself around here. Reminds me of myself in some ways.
0DI0000271	From now on, you want to buy from chet's, I'll give you wholesale prices.
0DI0000272	Can do.
0DI0000273	Too dangerous. Gonna kill all yourselves if I let you touch it. Better to leave it buried - safer that way.
0DI0000274	Told you before - it's too dangerous for a bunch of amateurs to handle.
0DI0000275	Yeah. He doesn't look very tough, though. I hear he's afraid I'll shoot him down from one of the windows when I see him, and he's right.
0DI0000276	I'll have a much bigger problem once his friends show up. There's no way I could handle all of them in a gunfight.
0DI0000277	I'm going to lay low for as long as I can, assuming the town doesn't throw me to the wolves. I've got no chance against the gang on my own.
0DI0000278	I'm still laying low.
0DI0000279	Got a special discount for you, after what you done for us.
0DI0000280	I'm sure I've got something you'll like.
0DI0000281	Say no more. I'm in.
0DI0000282	No. I got a funny feeling about you, and there's no way I'm trusting you to watch my back.
0DI0000283	Let me get out of town before we talk. Too many unfriendly ears around.
0DI0000284	What the hell for? Just farmers and ranchers out here. Not much worth stealing.
0DI0000285	Didn't you already ask me about this? What the hell for - this place is worthless.
0DI0000286	Err, thanks, I guess. Cobb wasn't the problem, though - I could've handled him if he ever found me.
0DI0000287	Cobb's friends are the bigger problem, and when he doesn't get back, they'll be coming here for blood. There's no way I fight can them all.
0DI0000288	Trouble with rustlers? Count me in, pardner. Those varmints will be running home with their tails between their legs soon enough.
0DI0000289	I've already talked to Anderson, actually. Came in, confessed, and gave you credit for the whole thing.
0DI0000290	First time I've ever seen anything like that. Was like you'd done him some huge favor. I've gotta hand it to you.
0DI0000291	This Dazzle must be some girl.
0DI0000292	Don't tell me. He married the hooker.
0DI0000293	The rapist with the flamethrower? Yeah, that's a combination I stay the fuck away from.
0DI0000294	I was stalking him for a while. I'm real good at that. Watching people from where they can't see me, you know?
0DI0000295	Only one thing I learned about that asshole. He keeps a bunch of Brahmins. Most of them he roasts whenever he feels like it, but there's one...
0DI0000296	...must be his pet, or some shit. Doesn't let anybody near that Brahmin. Somebody puts a bullet in her, I bet that'd piss him off good.
0DI0000297	Might make him careless, too.
0DI0000298	That right? You killed one of the psychopaths on my shitlist? Let me see the scumbag's head...
0DI0000299	You killed another one? Let me have a look at the head...
0DI0000300	If that's true, that'd be the last of them...
0DI0000301	Goddammit. That's Violet, all right. You've made me one happy son of a bitch, you know that?
0DI0000302	Here. This is the bounty I put on her head. It's yours.
0DI0000303	Well, that could be Violet, or it could be someone else entirely. I'll take your word for it, but I can't give you a full reward.
0DI0000304	Well, well, well. Driver Nephi. Nothing to say, you son of a bitch? No tips on my golf swing?
0DI0000305	Lost a lot of good men to this psychopath. Morale's going to be better, now that he's gone. Here's the bounty I promised.
0DI0000306	I guess we can send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope. They need all the help they can get there.
0DI0000309	Now that's over with, I'd send 1st Recon down to Camp Forlorn Hope, but I heard it's overrun by the Legion. Bastards.
0DI0000310	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so I can't authorize a full reward. If he really is dead, we're all better off.
0DI0000312	That's supposed to be Driver Nephi? The head's in really bad shape, so a full reward is out of the question.
0DI0000314	Yeah... that's Cook-cook. Did he always smell like this? Even before he was dead? And the Fiends let this guy touch their food?
0DI0000315	Well... this is payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
0DI0000316	This is Cook-cook? You sure did a number on his face. I'm not allowed to give you the full reward, but thanks for taking this guy down.
0DI0000317	It's payback for at least one of my troopers. She'll be glad to know he's dead. Here's your caps.
0DI0000318	Think you can take down another one of these scumbags? Up to you. But I can trust you to do the job, and I'd hate to see you walk away.
0DI0000319	That's two psychopaths dead. If you can bring down the third, there's a bonus in it for you.
0DI0000320	You've been one hell of a stroke of good luck, you know that? Those three scumbags probably killed twenty NCR troopers. And you bring them down alone.
0DI0000321	Wish I had a few grunts as good as you. Damn good working with you.
0DI0000322	Am I selling? Yeah. Am I selling to you? No. Sorry to hurt your feelings, but you're small time. Move along.
0DI0000323	[SUCCEEDED] You might be on to something. I like to hang on to any weapons mods I run across...
0DI0000324	Take a look.
0DI0000325	[FAILED] Do I look like a fucking arms caravan to you?
0DI0000326	Do you think the Gun Runners keep the NCR military supplied by carrying weapons and ammo from the Boneyard out here by the armload?
0DI0000327	Get a clue. We have caravans. We deal in bulk.
0DI0000329	That's not too bad. If that's what it takes to be rid of them...
0DI0000330	My caravan was on the return trip from California and heading back up to the company branch in New Vegas when we got jumped.
0DI0000331	Not even a "drop your weapons and hands up" before the bullets started flying. We put up a good fight, but there was too many of them.
0DI0000332	I took a few of the bandits down before I ran, so I figure their friends are out for revenge.
0DI0000333	A silver tongue would help. Convincing Trudy that we had a good plan to win the fight would also help.
0DI0000334	I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
0DI0000335	If the Khans are to be immortal, we must make our own destiny. We won't fight for Caesar, but when he strikes, we will ride out one last time.
0DI0000336	The demons appeared from nowhere... except it might be more accurate to say they never actually "appeared" at all.
0DI0000337	The demons are invisible. Where one of them stands, the most one sees is the air shimmering, like sunlight on water...
0DI0000338	They set upon us as we were on our way to worship one morning. We had just entered the basement.
0DI0000339	My flock fought bravely, and killed a few, but at such cost. Nearly half of us died or went missing.
0DI0000340	The rest of us retreated up here. One of the demons raved at us, but they have not tried to attack us since.
0DI0000341	Still, their demonic presence brought all progress towards the Great Journey to a standstill.
0DI0000342	But now you have come. Once again, the creator has sent a human to help us across a seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
0DI0000343	Yes, over the intercom. Threats of death should we step outside, guarantees of safety should we stay locked away.
0DI0000344	It went on for hours, and did not always make sense. But that was the first day only. Since then, silence.
0DI0000345	Will you drive away the demons, wanderer?
0DI0000346	Yes, wanderer?
0DI0000347	Damn it. That'll wipe out the town treasury. If that's what it takes...
0DI0000348	I don't think "give" is in Chet's vocabulary. Even with the town at stake, he'd still make you barter with him.
0DI0000349	[SUCCEEDED] Well-spoken, traveler. Well spoken indeed. Perhaps it's time to find our own destiny unburdened by the past.
0DI0000354	[FAILED] You talk like glory is a hollow, meaningless thing. Maybe to you it is, but not to the Great Khans.
0DI0000355	Show me something to inspire my people, or we march with Caesar, despite my misgivings.
0DI0000357	Good. Glad you didn't kill them. Letting them walk away proves we're not bloodthirsty mutants.
0DI0000358	If NCR or anybody else is looking for an excuse to attack Jacobstown, they're not going to get it from us.
0DI0000359	Easy Pete's pretty protective of his dynamite. You'd have to convince him you know a thing or two about explosives before he handed it over.
0DI0000360	[SUCCEEDED] I should have you torn apart for speaking like that - but maybe you're right. The glory of the past is an empty dream.
0DI0000362	The Followers of the Apocalypse keep many records of the past. It's been a long time since we associated with them, but they might have something.
0DI0000363	Until you do find me something, though, know that I still plan to lead the Great Khans to fight for Caesar.
0DI0000364	Doc's inside the Lodge.
0DI0000365	This shouldn't be too surprising, but I'd prefer you let the Followers examine him. Hopefully the reasons are obvious.
0DI0000366	How many chips would you like?
0DI0000367	All right, all right! I believe you. Just don't say anything to my folks. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
0DI0000368	No, not yet.
0DI0000369	It looks like that last bit you brought me was enough to fill the quota.
0DI0000370	Here are the caps I promised you.  Make sure to let Contreras know the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
0DI0000371	Something tells me this isn't the first time you've done things that the NCR would find... objectionable.
0DI0000372	Here, take some of these. And don't tell anyone where you got them.
0DI0000373	I shouldn't have said anything in the first place, and I'd rather not get you into the habit of crossing the NCR.
0DI0000374	I understand. No hard feelings, but you will, of course, keep our conversation on the matter strictly confidential.
0DI0000375	A deal's a deal. We'll be on our way.
0DI0000376	I have several basic implants available that can enhance your physical abilities - make you faster, smarter, stronger, that sort of thing.
0DI0000377	I've also got two much more expensive implants. One's a sub-dermal implant that will make you more resistant to damage.
0DI0000378	The other implant induces a mild regenerative effect. Your wounds will practically heal before your eyes.
0DI0000379	Uh, no. Implants, not plants. They're little machines I can put inside you to make you faster, quicker, or smarter. I recommend the smarter implant.
0DI0000382	One other thing I forgot to mention - your body may be able to handle only a limited number of implants.
0DI0000383	The healthier you are, the more implants I'll be able give you. Now, what surgery are you considering?
0DI0000384	Which surgery option are you considering?
0DI0000385	There aren't any more implants I can give you - you've already bought everything I had available.
0DI0000386	All right, let me do a quick test to make sure your body can handle another implant...
0DI0000387	All right, you're healthy enough to handle another one. Which surgery are you considering?
0DI0000389	I'm afraid you can't handle any more implants right now. Your body isn't durable enough to take it. Sorry.
0DI0000390	If I say the Brotherhood should be destroyed, it's necessary.
0DI0000391	My Legion can win a fight against the Brotherhood of Steel, but it would be costly. Your job is to make sure there's no Brotherhood for us to fight.
0DI0000392	Oh? You're going to defy me?
0DI0000393	What Marco said is true. The Legion attacked my village when I was 16.
0DI0000394	My parents were killed as examples. The rest of us, chained and dragged to some kind of camp. A Centurion there chose me as his tent servant.
0DI0000395	He was handsome, and gentle, most of the time. Said it was our secret, and he'd protect me. Gave me little gifts, stupid things.
0DI0000396	But Caesar punishes homosexuality with death, and we nearly got caught, and there were suspicions. So when he took me out into the desert...
0DI0000397	Well, I knew he was going to get rid of me. So I kicked him where it counts and I ran. And then swam. And ran some more. Wound up here.
0DI0000398	Baby, who I am doesn't matter. I'll be anybody you need me to be. It's better that way, you'll see.
0DI0000399	I'm just a fantasy come to life. But you already knew that.
0DI0000400	Fair enough. Since you seem to have pieced it together, I won't insult you by denying it any further.
0DI0000401	I killed Corporal White to protect Westside's self-reliance. It was rash, and I regret it now.
0DI0000403	I'll take a look, but you better have a good reason for asking me to violate his privacy.
0DI0000404	What?... Those bastards! Selling folks off to the Fiends? Selling children - to Cook-Cook...?
0DI0000405	I've seen enough. They're done for, both of them.
0DI0000406	What? Why the hell would I want to do that?
0DI0000407	This again. What makes you think I've changed my mind?
0DI0000408	All right! We got all sorts of shit in here. Nice job. Better take some for yourself in case you get hit.
0DI0000409	[SUCCEEDED] I was planning on sitting this one out, but for some reason I can't help but like you. I'm with you.
0DI0000410	Let me have a word with a few other folks and I'll see if I can't round up some more members for this militia you're creating.
0DI0000411	While everyone does own a gun, we could stand to be a little better equipped. The general store probably has what we need in stock.
0DI0000412	[FAILED] All the more reason for me to sit this one out. I'll be rooting for you, though.
0DI0000413	If you were able to get Ringo out of this mess, you'd have a decent reputation around Goodsprings. I'd even set you up with a discount.
0DI0000414	Of course, helping Ringo would also make the Powder Gangers mad, and they've got a lot of friends out there.
0DI0000415	Don't know why you'd want to go do a thing like that. Yeah, you'd get on their good side, but people around here wouldn't appreciate it one bit.
0DI0000416	The Lieutenant's been talking to you, hasn't he? Look, I don't need a head doctor - I'm First Recon, damn it.
0DI0000417	You don't see the others crying about every little bruise and scrape, do you?
0DI0000418	[SUCCEEDED] Just another injury to take care of, huh? Well, when you put it that way... all right. You can tell the Lieutenant I finally caved.
0DI0000419	There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
0DI0000420	[FAILED] I already told you that I'm fine. I don't need a head doc.
0DI0000421	That'll be Eddie. You can usually find him sitting in the warden's old chair up in the main building.
0DI0000422	Not sure who's gonna take over with Eddie dead.
0DI0000423	Have a look.
0DI0000424	Go to him, and you will understand.
0DI0000425	Well, you see, I... fuck. I'm really a bounty hunter trying to catch some Powder Gangers, but they probably saw through me, just like you did.
0DI0000426	I've been hanging around hoping to ambush some of them, but haven't had any success.
0DI0000427	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... that's a good point. Sorry I, uh, tried to ambush you there. No hard feelings, I hope.
0DI0000428	[FAILED] I don't think it's a waste of time. A handful of dead Powder Gangers ought to get the NCR to cough up some caps.
0DI0000429	[SUCCEEDED] Guess I was a little too obvious. I'm actually a bounty hunter - I was hoping to bag some Powder Gangers if they tried to rob me.
0DI0000430	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm a merchant, just like I said.
0DI0000431	As it so happens, I do have some thrust modules, but they're expensive. 500 caps worth of expensive.
0DI0000432	Still got them. 250 caps and they're yours.
0DI0000433	Still got them. 500 caps and they're yours.
0DI0000434	It's nice to see things going the way they're supposed to, for a change. I'm going to pay you out of my own pocket for this one.
0DI0000435	Very well, show me what you've brought so that I can analyze its potential.
0DI0000436	And your cyber-dog is... where, exactly? I can't perform the operation without him, hopefully for obvious reasons.
0DI0000437	You did? Who was it? Any information you can give me would be a big help for my reports.
0DI0000438	I appreciate the information, but I really wasn't kidding when I said I didn't have the manpower. If you could deal with him, I'd be in your debt.
0DI0000439	I can only do that if you're a friend of the Legion. I don't want to get crucified.
0DI0000440	Here. Come back in a day if you need more.
0DI0000441	I can't give you any more right now. Come back in a day.
0DI0000442	Now why would I want to do that? His performances make me quite a lot of money.
0DI0000443	Oh really? Are you going to waste my time again, or do you have something substantive to offer?
0DI0000444	I don't know a thing about no missing refugees from that Aerotech camp. Go cry to somebody else.
0DI0000445	Yeah, that's a pretty piece of work. Makes me wonder why you'd turn on the NCR, especially when they had us cold.
0DI0000446	Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
0DI0000447	What's to negotiate? The NCR backs off, we walk out of here, nobody gets hurt.
0DI0000448	Still going on about this, huh? Pretty sure I already said we want the NCR to back off and let us out.
0DI0000449	What? I was talking about Death, kid. Guess that one went right over your head, didn't it? Old Sergeant Dornan would've had a field day with you.
0DI0000450	There's a twitch in my trigger finger, I've lost my eagle eyes, and the other day I could've sworn I heard Sergeant Dornan chewing me out.
0DI0000451	I'm old and I'm starting to feel it. It's not pleasant, especially when you know your mind's slipping away.
0DI0000452	We all gotta go sometime, but I was hoping for something a little more heroic.
0DI0000453	Now just hold on. I never voted to take on the Powder Gangers. That's a thousand cap investment you're talking about.
0DI0000454	This again? Like I said, I'm against taking on the Powder Gangers. My supplies aren't cheap, you know.
0DI0000455	It looks like our little town got itself dragged into the middle of something we don't want anything to do with.
0DI0000456	About a week ago, this trader, Ringo, comes into town. Survivor of an attack, he says. Bad men after him, needs a place to hide.
0DI0000457	We figured he was just in shock, so we gave him a place to lie low. We didn't actually expect anyone to come after him.
0DI0000458	The one in the fancy suit seemed to be calling the shots, that's as much as I know. Other folks in town might know more.
0DI0000459	Word of advice, though: if you ever catch up with him, watch out. The man's got cold eyes like a snake. Can't be trusted, I'd say.
0DI0000460	What? No!
0DI0000461	Yeah, I guess there's a thing or two I could show you. Sounds like you need all the help you can get after what they done to you.
0DI0000462	Meet me outside, behind the saloon.
0DI0000463	The LT t-t-told you about that? Shit. Man, that's sh-sh-shit.
0DI0000464	Th-this again?
0DI0000465	Well shit, feel free to stick a knife in the old ego. I thought I'd made a name for myself around here.
0DI0000466	Guess that's as good a reason as any to quit this stinkin' trade. No glory. No easy money, no women, and no glory.
0DI0000467	Shit, I'd settle just for the women.
0DI0000468	Good. That's damn good. I figure it's about time we got lucky out here, so maybe you can snuff one of these maniacs.
0DI0000469	Uh, yeah, actually. I'm still good for the money, but I'll get it some other way. You can tell the old hag I'm gone.
0DI0000470	All right, then. We'll be on our way.
0DI0000471	Some of the other Followers mentioned you. All right - the truth, then.
0DI0000474	It's all about quantity over quality. Trouble is, you'll be cleaning and fixing your gun a lot more than usual when you use those kind of bullets.
0DI0000475	He's a convict. Just without the chains. Said his name was Cobb. "Powder Gangers" is what they call themselves. Plenty more like him out there.
0DI0000476	[SUCCEEDED] That does sound like a good plan. All right, you seem to know what you're doing, so you can count me in.
0DI0000479	[FAILED] No thank you. Good luck with your, uh, "ambush."
0DI0000480	Oh, yeah. F-fine. Just a little st-st-stutter. Had it since I was a kid. Doesn't stop me from k-kickin' ass.
0DI0000481	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. Never had you pegged for the drill instructor type, but you got my attention.
0DI0000482	You can tell the Lieutenant that I finally caved. I'll... get help. There's a Doctor Usanagi who's supposed to be good at this sort of thing.
0DI0000483	[FAILED] "People" ought to mind their own business.
0DI0000484	Sure. The outside looks okay, but I think something broke on the inside.
0DI0000485	There'd be caps in it for you. I do like to hear what's going on in the world. And that Mr. New Vegas seems like such a gentleman.
0DI0000486	Yep, I heard it turn right back on after you got done tinkering with it. Here's some caps for the work.
0DI0000487	This was none of their business - or yours. You've got no right to talk to people behind my back about this.
0DI0000488	You must have something important in mind. I'm willing to go to this little reunion, but my work here isn't complete.
0DI0000489	Help me get my research to a stage where I can hand it over to my assistant, Calamity, and then ask me about this again.
0DI0000490	I'm intrigued, so I'll go to this reunion. I'll be handing things over to Calamity, so talk to her if anything comes up.
0DI0000491	Oh, you'll need my word from the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "friends." Don't forget it.
0DI0000492	Heavy weapons trooper. Nothing better than hosing down a target with an excess of bullets and laser fire.
0DI0000493	By the time I got through with things, not much was left standing. Any morons who didn't run when they saw me coming got what they deserved.
0DI0000494	Back then, it was war. If we'd been on the winning side, I'd be called a hero.
0DI0000495	You must've heard her radio broadcasts? Though why a human would follow her invitation here is beyond me... unless you didn't listen very closely.
0DI0000496	The voice on the radio belongs to Tabitha, the "supreme commander" of Black Mountain - or, as she calls it, the "State of Utobitha."
0DI0000497	She took control of this place almost two years ago. The Super Mutants here do whatever she says - and she says humans are to be killed on sight.
0DI0000498	You're helping the Legion, a slaving army that will almost certainly kill and enslave the majority of people in New Vegas.
0DI0000499	What? Did you expect me to applaud your efforts to support a deranged warlord?
0DI0000500	Caesar is bad. You are bad for helping him. Please stop.
0DI0000501	I have to say I don't understand where you're going with Mr. House. The man's been manipulating the locals for as long as anyone can remember.
0DI0000502	If you help him kick the NCR and Legion out, he's going to keep right on doing it. The people in Freeside will be just as bad off as they ever were.
0DI0000503	If you can find a way to push Mr. House out of the picture as well, I think everyone will be better off.
0DI0000504	Helping the NCR is better than helping Mr. House, but I don't think it's the best solution for the people in New Vegas.
0DI0000505	If the NCR can take full control of Freeside and the Strip, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
0DI0000506	Besides, even if New Vegas eventually gets representation in the NCR senate, it's not like the NCR runs efficiently.
0DI0000507	I think you're on the right track.
0DI0000508	The only way to ensure relative safety and independence for the people of New Vegas is to prevent others from taking control of the region.
0DI0000509	That means no NCR, no Mr. House, and no Legion.
0DI0000510	It could be better. If we can find a way to work toward the independence of New Vegas, that would be ideal.
0DI0000511	But really, as long as you don't help out the Legion, anything's better than that.
0DI0000512	Mental trauma can be just as debilitating as physical injuries. Fortunately, I'm well-qualified in such treatment. I'll make time in my schedule.
0DI0000513	I'm assuming you're referring to mental trauma. I'll make time in my schedule.
0DI0000514	That's great! I can't believe you went through all this trouble for me. Thank you!
0DI0000515	I see. Well, thank you for trying. I'm off to go see my admirer now.
0DI0000516	I never was happier than when I was in the cockpit. I was able to go just about anywhere and everywhere, limited only by the fuel I could carry.
0DI0000517	There were more than a few missions where I took the scenic route home just so I could stay in the air. Caught hell for it every time, but worth it!
0DI0000518	Some of the things we did were questionable, I know. That's just how it was back then. Figure I've done enough good to make up for any sins, anyhow.
0DI0000519	I miss those days sometimes. We all had a purpose, you know? I admit that some of the folks in charge were pretty ruthless.
0DI0000520	The rest of us, though - we were just trying to civilize things. The NCR was still new and it didn't look like they'd last all that long.
0DI0000521	Then, we lost the oil rig and shortly after that, the base at Navarro. Nobody left except us Remnants.
0DI0000522	Weapon mods are things like silencers, scopes, bigger magazines.
0DI0000523	Special ammo includes things like armor-piercing bullets which don't hurt the target as much but let you punch through armor easier.
0DI0000524	There's also hollowpoint bullets which have the opposite effect - you can kill unarmored targets easier, but they don't do shit against armor.
0DI0000525	It is now. Me and the rest of the guys busted out of the NCR prison east of here and took over. Now we're calling the shots.
0DI0000526	Cook-Cook, one of the fiends, ambushed her and Ten of Spades. They both managed to escape, but not before Cook-Cook raped her.
0DI0000527	Betsy's shrugged it off like it was nothing, but her behavior keeps getting worse - always making passes at every woman who wanders by.
0DI0000528	It's inappropriate for anyone in First Recon to behave that way. I could discipline her, but I'd rather she get medical help.
0DI0000529	I'd appreciate it. As her CO, I could order her to get help, but I'd have her agree with the idea.
0DI0000530	Yes. Talk to Betsy and try to convince her to get medical help for her trauma. I sure hope you understand what I'm asking.
0DI0000531	Yes, the others in the squad said you'd come to them about her. It's a start, but let's hope she sticks with her treatment as long as it's necessary.
0DI0000532	I'm afraid she'll ditch Usanagi early if she feels its taking too long - she won't want to look bad in the eyes of the rest of First Recon.
0DI0000533	I caught the tail end of what you said to her. Betsy looked like she'd been slapped right back into basic for a few seconds there.
0DI0000534	Let's hope that Betsy sticks with the treatment. Knowing her, she won't keep seeing Usanagi if she feels things are taking too long.
0DI0000535	I wish someone with your medical training had come along sooner. I think she'll actually stick with her treatment because of what you said.
0DI0000536	I was afraid that Betsy wouldn't go for long-term treatment because she didn't want to look bad in front of the rest of the squad. You settled that.
0DI0000537	Do me a favor and let Usanagi know Corporal Betsy is coming. I'd like to make sure the medical clinic has time for her.
0DI0000538	Legionaries - we have a problem!
0DI0000539	Oh, so you're talking about one of them packages. That job had strange written all over it. But we couldn't turn down the caps.
0DI0000540	Sure. I'll tell you what I know.
0DI0000541	Beagle had some notes he was taking while he was eavesdropping around the Powder Gangsters. He'll be your best source of information on that subject.
0DI0000542	Well, I don't got any work right now, sorry to say.
0DI0000543	I'll tell you whatever I can. Do you have a delivery order you can show me?
0DI0000544	Then you'll have to be extraordinarily persuasive. Or kill them - their leaders, at least.
0DI0000545	Get to it, will you? You're wasting my time.
0DI0000546	So what you're telling me is, you're useless. You have no ability to influence events, so I'm forced to work around your incompetence.
0DI0000547	Try to do better with your next assignment...
0DI0000548	We keep getting deliveries of ammunition for some reason. I don't mind target practice, but there isn't all that much to shoot at out here.
0DI0000549	Radio signal out here can be pretty spotty because of all the hills. Sometimes our scheduled updates don't go through.
0DI0000550	When it happens enough times, they send someone over to check up on us. Lately, we've been getting extra medical supplies for some reason.
0DI0000551	I'm in no rush to give the supplies back, either.
0DI0000552	Yeah, it's a damn shame. There was a lot of talk about expelling her from the Rangers, especially once the gambling and drinking started.
0DI0000553	Being posted here is her second and last chance, and so far, I'm not impressed. Lenk's jumpy all the time, and the others are sick of it.
0DI0000554	Here's all the caps I've saved up so far. See? That's a pretty good chunk of what I owe right there!
0DI0000555	Ah, yes, her infatuation with a Boomer she's never met. It's a small camp, and word gets around.
0DI0000556	She's aware she's breaking her contract, which is undoubtedly why she sent you to talk to me instead of coming herself.
0DI0000557	Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed. That's the price of contract breaking - take it or leave it.
0DI0000558	My terms haven't changed. Janet is free to leave, but she forfeits the wages she's owed.
0DI0000559	Here you go. Let him know he needs to make another payment if he wants more of this stuff.
0DI0000560	Alright, whatcha got?
0DI0000561	[SUCCEEDED] Wha-? No, no wait. Look, I just need time. Don't rat me out to them.
0DI0000562	You want me to quit the Crimson Caravan? Fine, I quit. You can tell McLafferty that she won't see my face again.
0DI0000563	[FAILED] As if they'd even talk to you. You're nobody. I'm Henry-fucking-Jamison.
0DI0000564	Oh, like you wouldn't believe. The NCR makes a habit out of wrecking homes. I came out here to get away from them - didn't work out so well.
0DI0000565	Next thing I know, I'm squatting in "their" land. Never mind that I'd already been living here for years.
0DI0000566	Half a year or so. The Casa's a dump and Marco's a pig, but Pretty Sarah makes sure I don't get hassled.
0DI0000567	I don't get as many customers as Sweetie or Maude. But the customers I do get always come back.
0DI0000568	She's an honest woman. Splits the earnings fair, and keeps Sweetie and Maude in line.
0DI0000569	Minds her own business, too. She knows what it's like for people to go through things they'd rather not talk about.
0DI0000570	Old but spry, honey. So long as my back don't give out, I can make a living lying on it.
0DI0000571	May not be as fresh as Sweetie or Jimmy, but Pretty Sarah keeps me around for a good reason - experience!
0DI0000572	They don't look like much, but they earn a pretty good living by selling scrap and salvage.
0DI0000573	Dermot saves his money. Saint James spends his on Sweetie. A good customer, that one.
0DI0000574	Coyotes? Yeah, they run folks onto the Strip, have some kind of connections over there. Everybody makes a living one way or another.
0DI0000576	It's worth every cap, baby. I'll do things to you you didn't think was possible, and leave you feeling like everything's right in the world.
0DI0000577	I'm not surprised. Whip out your caps and away we go.
0DI0000578	Same price as before, baby, and worth every little cap.
0DI0000579	If I don't have anything you like, well... tough. I don't do special orders.
0DI0000581	This? This is - or was - the big house. The New California Republic Correctional Facility. Not much "correcting" went on here, just slave labor.
0DI0000582	One day, us prisoners decided to liberate ourselves. Killed the warden, killed the guards, took over the whole damn territory.
0DI0000583	Well, I don't know. Depends on if you can make it worth my time. A hundred caps sounds right to me.
0DI0000584	Yeah, all right. Figure you could help us out the way you helped out Cobb's crew over in Goodsprings.
0DI0000585	Why? It's because I mess up people so bad they don't know what part goes where when I'm done.
0DI0000586	I'll grab my tools.
0DI0000587	[SUCCEEDED] What you say is true. I apologize for my rash action - it was out of grief and loyalty. I hope you understand.
0DI0000588	[FAILED] Save your excuses.
0DI0000589	Caesar chose not to give me that information. I was only told to find you and bring you the message.
0DI0000590	No, but there really ought to be. I'm just taking the initiative, is all.
0DI0000591	You're not stationed here, but your rep with the NCR speaks for itself. It's mostly rifle rounds, but I'll throw in a few boxes of pistol ammo.
0DI0000592	I really shouldn't be doing this for you, but there's no way we're going to use all of this or be able to carry it with us.
0DI0000593	Sorry, it's against regulation for me to give away NCR supplies to anyone not stationed at this post. Wouldn't want you using it against us.
0DI0000594	Do? We don't, like, do anything. We make the magic happen.
0DI0000595	We keep the Great Khans from falling apart, essentially. Jack manufactures the chems, I organize the runners and the shipments.
0DI0000597	Smart, charismatic. Hell of a mean streak. Doesn't care for humans. Prefers fighting them to talking.
0DI0000598	He's got a lot of pull with Nightkin, though. He talks, they listen. Was hoping he could draw other Nightkin to Jacobstown.
0DI0000599	Keene is saner than most, but I know he's thinking of going his own way again. He's aggressive, impatient. Can't stand sitting around.
0DI0000600	Up to Lily. Not my call. Might lead to a faster cure. Might not. Don't want any harm coming to her.
0DI0000601	[SUCCEEDED] I've always known when to fight and when to back down, and it seems to me I ought to back down this time.
0DI0000602	My men and I are leaving. You won't see us around here again.
0DI0000603	[FAILED] I've faced down a charging Deathclaw and didn't blink. What makes you think I'd back down from you?
0DI0000604	Oh... that. Yes. Anderson filled me in on the details. Just let me know when you'd like your... order to be filled.
0DI0000605	Yes, it just came in. Here's all of it.
0DI0000606	I'm sorry, but your order won't be in for a while. Please come back in a day or two.
0DI0000607	Then get yourself back there, and get it done.
0DI0000608	I don't have to explain the reasoning behind my commands. I just give them - and you do them.
0DI0000609	That said, every once in a while I hear something so ignorant, I have to respond. This is one of those times.
0DI0000610	The Profligates' morale is in the shitter. They've occupied the Mojave for years, getting picked off one by one. They were told it'd be easy.
0DI0000611	They keep being told that victory is right around the corner, that Vegas will roll over, become the sixth state of their little union.
0DI0000612	It's President Kimball who's been telling them that. When he dies, the enormity of his lies will come crashing down, the punchline to a bad joke.
0DI0000613	Promising, but I won't be able to synthesize the drug anytime soon. I really should get back to my work.
0DI0000614	Hmmm... there's still power, but the casing is cracked. I'm astonished that exposure to the stealth radiation could induce mutations so rapidly.
0DI0000615	More importantly, this explains why my research into this group of Nightstalkers hasn't come up with a cure for the Nightkin.
0DI0000616	There's only one avenue left for me - I need to run the Mark II test on Lily. It's the only way.
0DI0000619	I did have a test in mind using Lily, but since she's dead, that's no longer a possibility. Regrettable. Anyway, you've done all you can.
0DI0000620	Thank you. I strongly suspect that the source of the mutation is artificial, but the Super Mutants found nothing. Your fresh eyes may do better.
0DI0000621	Lily might be interested in coming with you - she's lost a few of her Bighorners to Nightstalker attacks and would enjoy a little revenge.
0DI0000622	Let me see that... "filthy savages? Probably have to decimate the lot of them?" Are these the words of our "friend," Caesar?
0DI0000624	What's this? Ah, yes, I've heard that the Legion has sometimes had to quell tribes that did not share its vision.
0DI0000625	The Khans, though, are protected by Caesar's emissary - I have Karl's word we will remain our own tribe as long as we remain loyal to Caesar.
0DI0000626	Take your slander elsewhere.
0DI0000627	Happy to do it.
0DI0000628	Humans are always staring at things. We Nightkin don't like being stared at. Is is... uncomfortable.
0DI0000629	I'd noticed Snuffles limping, but I didn't realize the problem was that serious. Thanks - that beast helps keep spirits up around here.
0DI0000630	<happy bark!>
0DI0000632	Then we are out of here. Here - a souvenir for you. It's Benny's lighter. Shove it up his ass when you catch up with him.
0DI0000633	She said what? Why didn't she just say so when I was there? Actually, come to think of it, I was pretty angry when I went down there.
0DI0000634	I vaguely recall something about upending a few tables, maybe knocking out one of her doctors. Anyway, that's incredible news!
0DI0000635	Only thing is, there's too much going on around here for me to make a trip like that, and I need all of my guys just to keep things settled here.
0DI0000636	You seem to be awfully interested in my boy Rex here. And you've done some good work for me already. I'll tell you what.
0DI0000637	You promise to get Rexie here to that doctor, and I'll lend him to you. What do you say?
0DI0000638	Yes? Did you reconsider?
0DI0000639	Sure can. Take the road southeast out of town till it hits the freeway. Primm is the town with the roller coaster, straight south. Can't miss it.
0DI0000640	NCR patrols do a good job of keeping the highway clear, but I'd keep your gun where you can reach it easily. You never know who you'll run into.
0DI0000641	Off the road, you'll probably start running into hostile wildlife. My advice would be to stick to the highway when you can.
0DI0000642	Not much, other than they're a bunch of freeloaders who expected a few rounds on the house. I was able to get them to pay up, though.
0DI0000643	Of course, one of the Great Khans did knock my radio to the floor "by accident," and it hasn't been working since.
0DI0000644	Don't mention it! I'm always ready to lend a helping hand to a stranger in need.
0DI0000645	The stupid girl should know by now that even the rags on her back are a privilege. Anyway, my mongrels like their new toy.
0DI0000646	Tell you what - you square off with four of my best dogs. No armor and no weapons except a machete. You survive and I let you have the bear.
0DI0000647	You ready to fight my mongrels, then?
0DI0000648	Well done. It will be very useful in the coming battle against the snipers the NCR will no doubt have hidden in the hills near the Dam.
0DI0000649	Know your place, woman. Unlike the Profligates of the NCR, only men fight in the Legion.
0DI0000650	Only you may enter. Tell your companion to wait and speak to me again.
0DI0000651	That can be arranged. You will be facing off against a couple of disobedient slaves - not much of challenge, but it might be entertaining to watch.
0DI0000652	There's a captured NCR trooper available - Sergeant Andrews. He's already been challenged once and survived, so he should be a worthy opponent.
0DI0000653	I have a dangerous one for you - an NCR Ranger by the name of Stella. We got lucky, since we rarely capture Rangers alive.
0DI0000654	Even though she's a woman, she's killed every man who's faced her in the arena, even one of the elite Centurions. With her bare hands.
0DI0000655	Sorry, but there's nobody left who'd even be a challenge for you.
0DI0000656	I never finished my training - the Legion saw to that when they overran my town.
0DI0000657	I do know basic first aid, but I've had to rely on tribal remedies to treat illnesses and injuries - healing powders and all that.
0DI0000658	I'm always running low on xander root. Plenty of broc flowers, though.
0DI0000660	So I did. As you may have noticed, our position here in New Vegas is tenuous.
0DI0000661	We've made great strides, sure, but the NCR is not welcomed here, merely tolerated. And even then, not by everyone.
0DI0000662	We've had reports of violence against NCR citizens in a neighborhood just to the northeast called Freeside. Ever been there?
0DI0000663	Yes, have you reconsidered? NCR citizens may be dying as we speak in that hellhole.
0DI0000664	Oh, I've already heard. Pacer is dead. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
0DI0000665	In fact, I've heard that many are assuming the NCR did it without even looking into the matter. This is the worst thing that could possibly happen!
0DI0000666	What do you have to say for yourself?
0DI0000667	Oh, I've already heard. The Kings are up in arms. The entire area is gripped by chaos and the violence has only increased.
0DI0000670	Yes, do you have something to report?
0DI0000671	Yes, how did it go?
0DI0000672	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by.
0DI0000673	Oh, right. She radioed ahead and mentioned that somebody was coming by. Odd that she'd send a civilian instead of a trooper, though.
0DI0000674	"High casualties?" We've had one broken ankle, but nobody at this post has died.
0DI0000675	Legionaries?! We have a problem!
0DI0000676	Wahoo, you did it pardner! Bully for you! Ol' Festus knew you could do it. I suppose you'll be wanting that prize now.
0DI0000677	Well then, hold onto your hat, because it's a doozy. Not many people have heard the true story behind Sunset Sarsaparilla. It's a right honor.
0DI0000678	And now, without further ado, your prize - The Legend of the Star...
0DI0000679	Looooong ago, people didn't have a heap of choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
0DI0000680	Now, the threat of legal action forces me to say that Nuka-cola is a swell beverage, but sometimes people just wanted something different, you know?
0DI0000681	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, and asked his patrons what flavor they'd like it to be.
0DI0000682	After getting no help from them, a stranger at the end of the bar suggested the man make a sarsaparilla flavored drink.
0DI0000683	The stranger said he would happily share his family's recipe for the drink, on one condition.
0DI0000684	The condition being that the stranger would be allowed to sample a bottle whenever he liked, to ensure the recipe was being followed to the letter.
0DI0000685	The man happily agreed, thinking the drink would make him rich, and the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day.
0DI0000686	The next morning, the sheriff stopped by and reported that the stranger's body was found on the side of the town road. He'd been killed by bandits.
0DI0000687	The man, cursing his luck, closed the saloon early that day, just as the sun began to set.
0DI0000688	But after he had locked the doors, he turned around to find an unfamiliar bottle on the bar, with a note beneath it.
0DI0000689	The note was sealed with blue wax in the shape of a star. Opening it, the man found it contained a recipe for a sarsaparilla-flavored drink.
0DI0000690	Sampling the bottle's contents and finding it singularly delicious, the man gave silent thanks to his mysterious benefactor, wherever he was.
0DI0000691	Being an honorable man, the saloon owner paid for the stranger's funeral, thinking it was the least he could do to repay him.
0DI0000692	The saloon owner went on to become rich selling the new drink, and to this day some bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla have a blue star under their caps.
0DI0000693	Some say the saloon owner ordered it done, in honor of the stranger. Others say it's the stranger, sampling the bottles like he promised.
0DI0000694	And that's the Legend of the Star. Hope you enjoyed it, and hope you continue enjoying Sunset Sarsaparilla!
0DI0000695	By my hat, you're flush with Stars, ain't you? Scratch up a few more and the prize's yours.
0DI0000696	Well, what in the Sam Hill are you doing still listening to me? Get a wiggle on and find those last few Stars!
0DI0000697	It looks like you've got a fair number of Stars in your saddlebags. You're still a few cards short of a hand, though.
0DI0000698	That's a good start there, soft-horn, but that's not enough by a long chalk.
0DI0000700	This is the New Vegas branch of the Gun Runners, supplying the wasteland with only the finest armaments since 2155.
0DI0000701	All right, then. Hopefully I've got something to wet your whistle.
0DI0000702	Come talk to me when I'm in my store and I'll be glad to do business with you.
0DI0000703	He was a drill instructor I knew. He was also the meanest bastard I've ever known.
0DI0000704	Once, he caught this private out of uniform and old Dornan went off on the most ear-blistering rant known to man. It was inspiring.
0DI0000705	Bad trouble.
0DI0000706	He's some trader who decided he'd rather shoot than pay the toll for being in our territory. He's hiding somewhere in town.
0DI0000707	Would serve these idiots right if me and my guys shot the place up after we got payback on Ringo.
0DI0000708	The LT, Gorobets, gave it to me. See, I w-w-wanted to be Ace of Spades. But the LT says, sorry kid, you're t-t-too green. So he calls me Ten instead.
0DI0000709	It's okay, though. I get a few more k-k-kills under my belt, he'll move me up to Jack. Jack of Spades. Sounds better, right?
0DI0000710	I keep at it, eventually I'll make it to Ace. Think I'll skip Queen, though.
0DI0000711	You killed him? Well, shit. Here I'd dreamed up this whole elaborate revenge fantasy.
0DI0000712	Didn't really think I'd do it, but as long as the tubby bastard was actually alive, I could pretend like I would.
0DI0000713	Here. I owe you. Take it and get out of here, before I indulge my inner bitch and spoil the moment.
0DI0000714	As a matter of fact... it's funny that you'd ask. Couple nights back, I was on watch in the yard...
0DI0000715	Got myself a habit of looking all around - not just where I'd expect to find trouble. Old habit, but it's saved my hide, on occasion.
0DI0000716	Round about one in the morning, I spied some lights in the control tower. Now that's the third time I've spied those lights, mind you.
0DI0000717	And every time I ask about it, they tell me the place was empty. I'm just saying... it didn't look empty to me.
0DI0000718	Because I killed a couple marks for him, that's why. You ever hear of Jackson? Or Night Terror?
0DI0000719	Damn right I do. Who do you think you can take down?
0DI0000720	The Gun Runners have been putting rapid-fire death-dealing in the hands of anyone who needed to defend himself for over a century.
0DI0000721	We're the NCR's #1 supplier of weapons and ammunition. You might call us an unofficial branch of the army.
0DI0000722	I'm a salesman. I swing through McCarran and the dam once a week or so to take orders. But lately I spend most of my time in this piss heap.
0DI0000723	Ever since the 15 shut down, all caravans come through here - right to me. I check the stock and direct deliveries onward to meet orders.
0DI0000724	Sure, it stinks to hang out here, but it won't be forever. Plus I can afford a monthly bender on the Strip and still build up my nest egg.
0DI0000725	Like you have a clue what that even means.
0DI0000726	This thing on my head is headache medicine. It works real good, except I can't think when it's on. Really think, I mean.
0DI0000727	I can take off my medicine and do some thinking. People say it's real interesting. I don't know, because I never hear it.
0DI0000728	Some people say that it's a gift. Other people say that it's the kind of thinking anyone could do if they watched more than they talked.
0DI0000729	I don't know which is true. I see a lot, I think a lot. There's a lot to hear through the 188, too, that maybe accounts for the thinking.
0DI0000730	Squad marksman. I'm pretty proud of the fact that I never killed a single soul who wasn't trying to kill me or one of my team first.
0DI0000731	Internal sabotage took down the oil rig - never did get the full story. The NCR took out Navarro, saying we posed a threat to the region.
0DI0000732	Shit. Long as I can r-r-remember. Had a rifle in my hand since I was three, that's what my dad always says.
0DI0000733	Learned to shoot on our ranch. Way west of here. Same as the LT, he's a f-farm kid too.
0DI0000734	I'm sorry to say that it was. Civilian casualties was acceptable and sometimes... encouraged. My former squadmate Moreno didn't need encouraging.
0DI0000735	Moreno and I might've killed each other if Captain Kreger hadn't been there to pull us apart.
0DI0000736	I was the officer in charge, and Johnson and Moreno were my heavy hitters. Henry handled tech things, and Whitman flew the chopper.
0DI0000737	Johnson and Moreno never got along, and I had my hands full keeping those two apart some days.
0DI0000738	It was a difference in philosophy, mostly. "Mercy" was not part of Moreno's vocabulary.
0DI0000739	Oh. They recruited me... what, a year ago? Taught me to kick even more ass than before. These guys... they really know how to kick some ass.
0DI0000740	I'm really very boring. You'd get better stories out of a Freeside junkie.
0DI0000741	Won't be a problem. We have plenty of spice traders working with us back home, and we could get meat from local Brahmin ranchers.
0DI0000742	The bigger issue is payment. To supply the camp with meat with cost some serious caps.
0DI0000743	Absolutely not. Lily's done enough, and she doesn't need to do any more. We're close enough to a cure already, and don't need to rush it.
0DI0000744	Doctor Henry. He's one of you - go speak with him instead of me.
0DI0000745	Such as?
0DI0000746	[SUCCEEDED] That thought had crossed my mind as well, actually. Fine, make it 2000 caps and we'll call it square.
0DI0000747	[FAILED] Sorry, but I've got men to pay and equipment to maintain. 2500 caps or no deal.
0DI0000748	Vertibird pilot. Seventy-one missions and only lost one chopper. Rotor malfunction over Klamath. Hard landing, but I walked away.
0DI0000749	I help tend the crops, stand watch for Fiends, and generally help keep things civilized.
0DI0000750	Do? I don't do anything. I'm retired.
0DI0000751	I was a soldier. Why do you even care? I came out here to forget about the past, so quit bringing it up.
0DI0000752	Uh... okay, look... first, I didn't have anything to do with that trooper. That was all Anderson.
0DI0000753	Second, even though the whole scheme was Anderson's idea, it's the only way the co-op could stay in business. The water means everything.
0DI0000754	Good. Two of my scouts have reported seeing patrols of men in power armor near Hidden Valley. Begin your search there.
0DI0000755	Best prices around so long as you don't try putting anything someplace it was never intended. How's that sound?
0DI0000756	If you're looking to get perverted, go talk to Sweetie. She's less particular than I am.
0DI0000757	No discounts for repeat customers... I think we did it before, anyways.
0DI0000758	I bring in the customers, and she makes sure no one gets rough. Sarah's good people. Good enough, anyway.
0DI0000759	Nah, nah - means I poked through old buildings looking for working tech and such. Some folks just call it "salvaging," but never liked the term.
0DI0000760	Way I see it, salvage means it's broken, near-worthless. Me, I looked for the good stuff - guns, chems, spare parts. Good money in it.
0DI0000761	None of your damn business. You ought to know better than to ask a man that kind of question.
0DI0000762	Corporal Sterling was an NCR ranger until he was captured by the Legion. They tortured him pretty badly.
0DI0000763	He wasn't able to be a ranger after that, but his eyes are still sharp so I had him transferred to First Recon.
0DI0000764	I was always the guy who could get things, if you know what I mean. Figured I might as well keep on doing it.
0DI0000765	That's us. We got sent here to fix the rails and make some new ones, and for that we got to use dynamite.
0DI0000766	Of course, dynamite works pretty good against caravan guards, too. So, that's what we do - rob and blow things up.
0DI0000767	Not much, just killed a bunch of people. Maybe a couple of kids, too. Whatever.
0DI0000768	He's the best the Legion has to offer, or so the Legionaries say. Brute of man, wears a fancy metal mask into battle.
0DI0000769	He killed one of my pack Brahmin simply because it was in his way. I knew better than to complain about it, though.
0DI0000770	I know the Captain well. If you wish to be of service, go talk to him.
0DI0000771	Bear in mind that you are now responsible for guarding the secret of his true allegiance. If the NCR finds out, we'll know how that happened.
0DI0000772	I know the Captain well. The destruction of the NCR monorail was his doing.
0DI0000773	Of course, if the NCR were to hear of that, it would be obvious who told them.
0DI0000774	Sure thing. Let me have a look.
0DI0000775	Coming from anyone else, I'd say they were drunk or crazy, but that look in your eyes - I believe you.
0DI0000776	I can pay you, but it ain't much for what you pulled off. I'll get on the ham radio first thing and tell people all about you, though.
0DI0000777	If Ringo doesn't head out on his own, I think we should hand him over. The town shouldn't get itself mixed into the problem.
0DI0000778	Don't mistake that for coward talk, though. We're a town of survivors, and we'll fight tooth and nail if pushed, but we don't go looking for trouble.
0DI0000779	Was a prospector until I decided to settle here to get away from the NCR. Now I just take it easy and help out with the Brahmin and Bighorners.
0DI0000780	Nope. Had a pretty good claim once, way out east by the river, but got run off by Raiders. Eventually, got too old to keep going out.
0DI0000781	Not in Goodsprings, no. But if you're up for a little scavenging, there's always the schoolhouse.
0DI0000782	Most of what's in there is junk, but there's this old safe that even Easy Pete wasn't able to crack with dynamite.
0DI0000783	If you want to take a shot at it, take these.
0DI0000784	I know that... thing... as much as anyone else around here. It mostly keeps to itself, which is just fine by me.
0DI0000785	Good riddance to it is all I have to say. Never liked having it around.
0DI0000786	Violet's got dogs. Lots of dogs. While they're ripping you to shreds up close, she'll be putting rounds through you with her rifle.
0DI0000787	Driver Nephi is a monster in close combat with that golf club of his, and that man is about as fast on his feet as any Legionary.
0DI0000788	If you haven't already, see about getting Gorobets and First Recon to help you - they've got things to settle with Driver Nephi, too.
0DI0000789	Cook-Cook loves using his flamethrower on his victims, usually after he rapes them. Little Buster can tell you more about him than I can, though.
0DI0000790	I haven't had the pleasure. I have crossed paths with Legate Lanius, his second-in-command, however. It was... unpleasant.
0DI0000791	We recently obtained an artillery weapon, but we don't have the part or the skill to fix it.
0DI0000792	The artillery weapon needs the firing mechanism replaced. Any help you can offer would be appreciated.
0DI0000794	What about it? Do you have some advice?
0DI0000795	Thanks to you, I think we're in good shape. The squad seems to be functioning much better as a unit now.
0DI0000796	He did, huh? Well, good luck with that. You'd have an easier time teaching radroaches to march in formation.
0DI0000797	Hoo-hoo! Hot damn, it's gonna be a party in the camp tonight!
0DI0000798	Yo, I'll tell you what this squad needs. A healthy dose of angry juice.
0DI0000799	You actually did it? My friend, I am without doubt a genius, but I must say, you've given me a run for my money. Bravo. Bravo.
0DI0000800	That seems highly illogical. What reason would he have for doing that?
0DI0000801	Boy, the squad sure is working together a lot better now! I think we're gonna be A-Okay!
0DI0000802	To me? Well, I'll tell you what I think this squad needs: a little more basic human niceness.
0DI0000803	It helped, but we've still got a grenade range inspection to pass.
0DI0000804	It really, really didn't.
0DI0000805	Not even a little bit, no.
0DI0000806	Yeah, what about it? I told you, we need marksmanship and explosive handling improvements.
0DI0000807	Like I said, you get the juice, we'll cut loose.
0DI0000808	And what do you propose?
0DI0000809	You did? Does that mean you're going to help?
0DI0000810	Three flavors to choose from - Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy. Sweetie's the house favorite, for reasons that should be obvious.
0DI0000811	Maude is what you might call the discount rack. She's what a customer wears if he doesn't have the caps to afford Sweetie - or just likes them old.
0DI0000812	Jimmy's more of a "specialist." I only hear good things.
0DI0000813	All right, then. Looks like I need to talk slow and use small words. There's Sweetie, Maude, and Jimmy.
0DI0000814	Fewer than I used to. Go see for yourself.
0DI0000815	Heh, yeah good old Klamath. Not a bad place if you like hunting, eating, and skinning geckos all day! Heh heh.
0DI0000816	It's a pretty dull place, but I hear there was a bit of excitement when this tribal from Arroyo came to town years back. All before my time, though.
0DI0000817	Err... yeah. It was a long time ago. Things were better back then.
0DI0000818	Kickin' ass. Mostly kickin' ass. See, we're watching the perimeter right now. Looking for those F-f-fiends to come back.
0DI0000819	When they show their faces, that's when we go to work. One shot, one k-k-kill. That's the First Recon way.
0DI0000820	I call her La Longue Carabine. Didn't always have the scope - I added that myself.
0DI0000821	Been shooting with her so long... couldn't bring myself to toss her away. Would have felt guilty to part with the old girl.
0DI0000822	The other snipers use bolt-action, but Gorobets reckoned it didn't matter none if I was different, so long as I can hit my targets.
0DI0000823	Oh, shit, I don't know.  Got to be at least a month. Longer than I last at most jobs.
0DI0000824	You trying to start trouble? Or do you really not know where I got that name?
0DI0000825	Don't get me wrong - the NCR's got a lot of decent folk in it. It's just that they make you part of them whether you like it or not.
0DI0000826	Towns like Goodsprings and Primm don't stay independent for long, not if you've got something the NCR wants. Still, the NCR keeps the Legion away.
0DI0000827	They're slavers, led by a guy named Caesar. Or Caesar. Not sure how you're supposed to say it.
0DI0000828	A couple of years ago they tried to take over Hoover Dam, but the NCR beat them back. The NCR didn't - or couldn't - finish the job, though.
0DI0000829	The Legion's got its strength back and is getting ready for another round at the Dam. My money's still on the NCR winning, but you never know.
0DI0000830	We've been hearing stories about Legionaries on the Nevada side of the river, so keep a gun handy. You don't want to get caught by them.
0DI0000831	The Dam powers a lot of New Vegas. And then there's all that clean water lying in Lake Mead, too. Anybody who owns the Dam owns the territory.
0DI0000832	Meat and hide, mostly. Can't put a pack on 'em - they just lay down until you take it off.
0DI0000833	Can find a bunch of wild ones high up in the hills, but gotta be careful around 'em. They can put up a decent fight if cornered.
0DI0000834	I help folks strip down the more complicated bits of salvage they bring in - engines, mostly.
0DI0000835	The bits and pieces we take out are usually worth more than the whole thing put together.
0DI0000836	Couple of years now. I was a trader for awhile, but got tired of all the walking. Westside was a good place to settle down as any.
0DI0000837	I deliver things and stuff for the people here. They give me caps to do it.
0DI0000838	I talked to the cashier at Gomorrah into forwarding me some chips - I was convinced I was due for a hot streak.
0DI0000839	It, uh, didn't go so well. The Omertas were nice and said they'd give me some time to pay them back.
0DI0000840	They also said if they had to talk to me about my debt again, they wouldn't be nice the next time.
0DI0000841	Of course. Which one?
0DI0000842	Very well. What job did you need more information on?
0DI0000843	Something has actually come up. A prospector recently came through here and spent a lot of caps on supplies.
0DI0000844	Closer inspection of these caps has revealed them to be brand new. This is a problem.
0DI0000845	The most likely source of these new caps is the old sarsaparilla bottling plant. Go there, locate the bottle cap press, and disable it.
0DI0000847	I want my debt with the Omertas paid off. And I want one of those severance package things. A big one.
0DI0000848	My terms are the same as before. They pay off my debt to the Omertas, and I get a big fucking severance package.
0DI0000849	I look after the only reasons anyone would want to spend any time here. I'm a pimp.
0DI0000850	All Marco does is collect rent and take a small cut of my action. He sure as hell doesn't clean the rooms.
0DI0000852	Now that Marco's no longer around, I guess it's up to me to collect rent, too.
0DI0000853	I'm called Sweetie because I'm the sweetest piece you'll find anywhere outside of the Strip. I could work in those casinos if I wanted.
0DI0000854	I'm afraid I don't know much myself. Mr. House has got his own casino, the Lucky 38, but nobody goes in or out except his robots.
0DI0000855	The other casinos follow Mr. House's rules, so I guess that makes him the leader of New Vegas. As far as I know, nobody's ever laid eyes on the guy.
0DI0000856	I think that robot who pulled you out of the dirt belongs to Mr. House. If Mr. House is looking after you, that's gotta be a good thing, right?
0DI0000857	There's always something interesting going on, but the biggest news has to be the coming dustup between the NCR and the Legion over the Dam.
0DI0000858	The New California Republic's got the most power in Nevada. Money, troops, you name it.
0DI0000859	They do what they can to keep things safe in the region, but if you ask me, they're trying to do too much. They're spread too thin.
0DI0000860	We're the finest sniper outfit in the whole NCR. If you need a bullet put into a target's eye from 800 yards away, you call us.
0DI0000861	Some of my team aren't without their share of scars, though, like Betsy and Sterling.
0DI0000863	I worked in a casino in New Reno, and one of the pit bosses decided he didn't like me. Framed me over some caps, and I ended up in here.
0DI0000864	Me? I ran with the toughest gang in the Hub. You've heard of the Hub, right? It's, uh, west of here, I think, back in California.
0DI0000865	Nope, not for you. Rumor is you've been working against us, so the deal's off.
0DI0000866	Yeah, we do. Here.
0DI0000867	We're out at the moment. Come back later.
0DI0000868	Dynamite. Lots and lots of dynamite. You should've seen the body parts flying everywhere.
0DI0000869	[SUCCEEDED] I apologize for my rash action. I understand fighting and killing, not healing. I acted out of grief and loyalty.
0DI0000870	[FAILED] It's obvious you know as little about medicine as I do. Spare me your excuses.
0DI0000871	The mighty Caesar has bestowed upon you his Mark and guaranteed safe-conduct. If he wanted you dead, you would be dead already.
0DI0000872	I am Gabban, of Caesar's Legion. I serve my master as the one of his Frumentarii.
0DI0000873	We Frumentarii are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
0DI0000874	They're family, you dig? They've always looked out for us, made sure we had something to eat and a place to crash.
0DI0000875	Papa may look like a big angry bear, but he's a softie at heart. Regis is cool - scary, but cool. The rest are all pretty groovy, even little Jerry.
0DI0000876	I'll spare you the history lesson - talk to Papa Khan if you want to hear that story.
0DI0000877	Things have been rough for a while now, even with Jack working all the time and my runners making deliveries daily we're barely getting by.
0DI0000878	Maybe this alliance with Caesar will help, but I don't know.
0DI0000881	Lot of bad blood between Super Mutants and humans. Goes back years. Some here still got the scars and memories.
0DI0000882	Me, I don't really have a problem with the NCR. Set their sights a little too high sometimes, but they try. Legion, that's another story.
0DI0000883	Your injuries aren't too severe. I can patch the scrapes and lacerations pretty easily.
0DI0000884	Some of these lacerations are pretty severe and could get infected.
0DI0000885	I'm surprised you're still standing. You've lost a lot of blood and should be stabilized immediately.
0DI0000888	The Nightkin have varying degrees of mental instability due their addiction to Stealth Boy use. I've been trying to come up with a cure.
0DI0000889	I'm currently investigating the local Nightstalker population since they seem to have developed a natural stealth field.
0DI0000890	I've also gotten my hands on a working Stealth Boy Mark II prototype, but that experiment is riskier. I'd rather not pursue that research just yet.
0DI0000891	Certainly did. Hubby and me had an old rad meter to help us tell the difference between what you could salvage and what'd kill you.
0DI0000892	I kept a glowing container from REPCONN around here for years serving no better purpose than a nightlight. Damn thing wouldn't sell.
0DI0000893	Then along comes the most peculiar-looking fellow, all decked out in a yellow radiation suit, of which he was proud all out of proportion.
0DI0000894	The man outright asked if I had anything radioactive for sale - imagine that! But he paid handsome for that jar of goop.
0DI0000895	Only saw him that once. He said something about heading over to Clark Field to put his suit through its paces. A strange one, he was...
0DI0000896	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take her out.
0DI0000897	I hate to say it, but as long as the Alpha Male is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere, even with the Deathclaw Mother out of the picture.
0DI0000899	The co-op is comprised of Westside locals and run by Clayton Etienne. They produce all of their own food and share in the profits of the co-op.
0DI0000900	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, and I help the locals in Westside grow crops. Unlike the NCR, the Followers don't expect anything back.
0DI0000901	The soil and the hot, dry environment don't make it easy, but we get by all right.
0DI0000902	We've even got our own food store, the Westside Co-op, complete with basic refrigeration.
0DI0000905	Are you kidding me? Never felt better!
0DI0000906	Are you kidding? The supplies in this are going to save lives. Thank you.
0DI0000907	Shoot.
0DI0000908	He's the best warrior in the Legion. A full Legionary by the time he was 12, he's never lost a battle.
0DI0000909	Had the Legate been in command during the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Legion would've won. I have no doubt about that.
0DI0000910	No, I do not require the "services" of a degenerate such as yourself.
0DI0000911	There is a gambler, Martina Groesbeck, who has a knack for learning other people's secrets and passing that information along for a price.
0DI0000912	The Omertas, who run Gomorrah, have become suspicious of Martina's frequent visits to their casino. Soon they'll pay her a visit of their own.
0DI0000913	As I said before, Martina Groesback is a useful, if unwitting, source of information. The Omertas want her dead, while I need her alive.
0DI0000914	For now, anyway. She'll need to lay low while the Omertas are scrambling to find out what happened.
0DI0000915	They'll eventually send more men after her, but I'm sure I'll come up with a better solution to the problem by then.
0DI0000916	Excellent. Had you simply killed them, the Omertas would've sent another group after Martina eventually.
0DI0000917	You've saved me the trouble of coming up with a more permanent solution, and Martina is free to go about her business as usual. Well done.
0DI0000918	I see. Was it ill fortune, or is Caesar's faith in you misplaced? Either way - it's done.
0DI0000920	I'm Jane, one of Mr. House's girls. We keep him... entertained. We don't get many guests lately; perhaps we can entertain you as well.
0DI0000921	The leader was a New Vegas-type, typical city boy. He had a bunch of Great Khans with him, probably hired guns.
0DI0000922	The Great Khans normally stay in their own territory way up northwest, on account of them being enemies with the NCR.
0DI0000923	Twice. Both times, I drank a lot of liquor and lost most of my caps at the card tables. In that order, now that I think about it.
0DI0000924	If you ever get to New Vegas, be sure to visit Gomorrah. It's the best casino in the city. You won't regret it.
0DI0000925	Word of advice - behave. Between the NCR military police and Mr. House's robots, you don't want to be causing trouble on the Strip.
0DI0000926	I hunt geckos, mostly. The meat's pretty good and I can always find a buyer for the hides.
0DI0000927	I also help keep the town clear of radscorpions and coyotes. Not many people live in Goodsprings, so wildlife is always creeping in.
0DI0000928	That's great to hear, really great. I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
0DI0000929	So, what brings you here?
0DI0000930	Ah, new to the hunt, are you? Well listen carefully, as ol' Festus don't like to repeat himself.
0DI0000931	Select Sunset Sarsaparilla bottles will have special caps with blue stars on them. These caps are known as Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
0DI0000932	Why are these stars there, and what do they mean? Nobody knows! Except maybe ol' Festus, hee hee.
0DI0000933	Rustle up enough of them and you can win a prize! So get out there, and start drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
0DI0000934	Oh, sorry. I thought everybody knew already. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
0DI0000935	I'm, uh, staying in town for a bit.
0DI0000936	Like I said, I'm not from Goodsprings. I'm a trader with the Crimson Caravan Company.
0DI0000937	Mostly traders looking to buy Bighorner meat and hides. The traders are the main reason the general store manages to stay in business.
0DI0000938	Most travelers heading south on in the I-15 just push on towards Primm unless they're in desperate need of supplies.
0DI0000939	Used to be a Ranger... one of the first they sent out east, back before we took the Dam. Observation and reconnaissance.
0DI0000940	We took the lay of the land, checked out the locals, and kept ourselves inconspicuous. Couple friends of mine were the first to scout the Dam.
0DI0000941	That was back in '73, if I recall. Lot of those Rangers are dead now.
0DI0000942	Vegas always chewed men up... it's just a little more literal, nowadays.
0DI0000943	Well hey, the field's wide open, now that I'm gone. Probably lots of people looking to get in, once they hear I quit.
0DI0000944	Guess not. I don't mean nothing by it.
0DI0000945	You really want to talk to somebody, try 10 of Spades. He's always got plenty to say.
0DI0000946	Me, I'm here to do my job. For now, that job is shootin' Fiends.
0DI0000947	10 of Spades always had plenty to say, before he got himself killed. Me, I'm just here to do my job.
0DI0000948	Name's Keith. You feeling lucky? I got games of chance, games of skill, games of you-name-it. Want to win a little cash?
0DI0000949	Makes no difference to me. I'd be happy to see any one of them dead. Who will it be?
0DI0000950	Some squatters decided to take space where they don't belong, over by the playground. We'd prefer to keep 'em off the streets and out of sight.
0DI0000951	Maybe you could go and talk to them... convince them to see things our way.
0DI0000952	Good work with those newcomers. I think you can handle more serious business... with more serious rewards.
0DI0000953	There's a handful of greasers down in the sewers causing trouble. They ain't packing too much iron, but I'd like them dealt with all the same.
0DI0000956	You know, this time I may actually need a gun with a brain.
0DI0000957	Talk to Mrs. Hostetler. She's near the Crimson Caravan. I think her daughter's making bad "friends," the kind that'll slit your throat in the dark.
0DI0000958	All Gun Runner merchandise is constructed on-site.
0DI0000959	That's not junk. That's other people's thoughts. People had to think to make them, and the thoughts got stuck inside.
0DI0000960	I need other people's thoughts to fill my head when I'm not thinking myself. Otherwise it's... kind of empty.
0DI0000961	Johnson Nash's my name. Husband to Ruby Nash. Lived in Primm going on eight years now, thick and thin.
0DI0000962	I'm a trader primarily, for what it's worth with things like they are. I also run the local Mojave Express outpost.
0DI0000963	It's about time one of you guys showed up - I've been waiting long enough. The NCR will probably give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
0DI0000964	Huh - didn't know there were women Powder Gangers. Oh, well - the NCR will still give me a nice bounty for your corpse.
0DI0000965	I'm Ruby Nash. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
0DI0000966	My husband and I are Primm long-timers. He fancies himself a trader, and I know my way around a kitchen.
0DI0000967	Maybe you are and maybe you aren't, but I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
0DI0000968	Let me take a look. Really? That's it? You've got a few scrapes and a hangnail. Come back when you're really hurt.
0DI0000969	You got to be kidding me. You're fine - this is just a ploy to get a free sucker, isn't it?
0DI0000970	Let's see... Physically, you're fine. Emotionally... well, I'm not the right kind of doctor for that.
0DI0000971	I don't see nothing wrong with you.
0DI0000972	That's not the worst injury I've seen - hell, it's not even the worst this week. I think we can patch you up.
0DI0000973	This doesn't look too bad. We'll have you good as new in no time.
0DI0000974	That's not so bad. I'll have you looking good as new. I mean, what are the chances of me botching another routine procedure in the same day?
0DI0000975	Don't look like nothing too serious. Lemme patch you up.
0DI0000976	Unless you dipped that in cheese fondue, I'd say it's infected. Let me fix that up for you.
0DI0000977	Sure. I can help you out.
0DI0000978	Yeah, that's looking pretty bad. I think we can do something about it though - just a minute.
0DI0000979	Damn, that's got to hurt. Okay, hold still, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
0DI0000980	Jesus, I don't think that's supposed to just dangle like that. And what the hell is that thing there?
0DI0000981	It's gonna be expensive. Try not to speak. Just nod yes or no.
0DI0000982	Holy God, what battlefield did you just crawl off of? I'm going to be honest, this is kind of out of my league, but I'll do what I can.
0DI0000983	I wasn't going to say anything, but when you walked in here I thought you were a ghoul. We better get to work on this quick.
0DI0000984	This? This is nothing. You should see some of the wounds I've seen paladins come back with.
0DI0000985	That's not so bad. I should be able to treat you rather quickly.
0DI0000986	By Steel, I haven't seen wounds like these since HELIOS. I've got to get you treated quickly.
0DI0000987	I'm sorry, but is that supposed to be a joke? There's nothing wrong with you. I can tell just by looking.
0DI0000997	Sure, I could patch you up. Nothing too serious. I don't work for free though.
0DI0000999	You're right. You do need a doctor. Lucky I happened along. But first let's discuss my fee...
0DI0001000	You're not kidding. You're in bad shape, friend. I'd be happy to fix you up... for a reasonable fee.
0DI0001002	No, Legate Lanius is Caesar's second. The Legate replaced the Burned Man after the Legion's defeat at the Dam several years ago.
0DI0001003	Legate Lanius has not chosen anyone to be his second yet. It would be an honor to be selected, though.
0DI0001004	[FAILED] I know important people here in the Strip. Powerful people. You, uh, can't get anything out of me.
0DI0001005	[SUCCEEDED] I am sorry, meant no offense. The billboards are not ready yet... Please, I need more time, more materials!
0DI0001006	I don't have a mama or papa anymore. I see them sometimes when I take off my medicine, but they can't stay. I'm pretty used to being on my own.
0DI0001007	The Burned Man was Caesar's advisor and general when the Legion was originally formed. The Burned Man led us to a disastrous defeat at the Dam.
0DI0001008	On Caesar's orders, the Burned Man was covered in pitch by the Praetorian Guard, lit on fire, and cast into the Grand Canyon.
0DI0001009	Caesar has forbidden us from ever speaking his true name again, and so we simply refer to him as the Burned Man.
0DI0001010	Military operations are classified information. The brass is familiar with the situation at the NCRCF.
0DI0001011	Military operations are classified information.
0DI0001012	I have no idea. I just go and do what they tell me.
0DI0001013	I would certainly hope that someone should handle it! Not that they tell me anything.
0DI0001014	We'd be the last to know.
0DI0001015	I hope they do, but I haven't heard nothing.
0DI0001016	Your guess's as good as mine. Probably better.
0DI0001017	There's a prison north of here? Well, don't go picking up any hitchhikers and you should be all right.
0DI0001018	I might know something. But my memory ain't what it used to be. Sometimes it needs motivating.
0DI0001019	Ain't that a coincidence! My mind's still hazy on the subject.
0DI0001020	I wouldn't know anything about that, dear. You might ask Johnson.
0DI0001021	I might know something. 'Bout 100 caps worth of something, let's say?
0DI0001022	What a coincidence! I'd still like my 100 caps!
0DI0001024	Because spending myself to the edge of artistic oblivion for Mr. House sums up my existence since I had to leave Vault 21, that's why.
0DI0001025	Legate Lanius will take Caesar's place at the head of the Legion. The Legate is a fine warrior, and the Legion will do well under his command.
0DI0001026	The message? You know about that...?
0DI0001027	There was some kind of message, but... I don't seem to remember it.
0DI0001028	Yeah... that air! Smell it!
0DI0001029	We don't talk about that. Next topic.
0DI0001030	Most of my body is scarred all over, like a ghoul. Nobody around who'd want to screw that. No, I just run things.
0DI0001031	I got my start at the Gomorrah, good money, but I saw how those Omertas hook girls on free Jet or Med-X - then start charging.
0DI0001032	Slavery through a needle is what that is. I earn less out here, but I keep more.
0DI0001033	They're tough sons of bitches, mean but not crazy - they'll leave you alone unless you've got something they want.
0DI0001034	The Great Khans deal in illegal chems. There's a good chance that most chems you come across were made by Great Khans.
0DI0001035	It's a two-player game, and the winner takes the whole pot. You build a "caravan" using the cards in your deck.
0DI0001036	The goal is to create caravan bids that beat your opponent's bids, so there's more strategy than luck involved.
0DI0001037	It's why you won't see Caravan in any casino - too slow-paced, and more importantly, no house edge.
0DI0001038	Here, take this holotape - it goes into more specifics about the rules. You'll also need a deck, so take one of my spares.
0DI0001039	So... you feel like playing a game?
0DI0001041	If they've proven hard to kill, yes. Whatever it takes to get the job done, even if means hiring help from outside the military.
0DI0001042	This is where the NCR sent prisoners to "reform" through hard labor. I never saw much reforming around here, myself.
0DI0001043	We've got the biggest, baddest fort in the wasteland. There's water and power, and if we need grub, we just go out and steal it.
0DI0001044	I keep an eye on my buddy Eddie. Anybody messes with him and I scramble them real good.
0DI0001045	Used to guard Eddie, but not anymore.
0DI0001046	Where to begin? That they are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
0DI0001047	But the depths of their moral sickness, their dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
0DI0001048	Where to begin? That you are weak, and we are strong? This much was known already.
0DI0001049	But the depths of your moral sickness, your dissolution? Nipton serves as the perfect object lesson.
0DI0001050	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling and the sale of unlicensed chems.
0DI0001051	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for the sale of unlicensed chems.
0DI0001052	Keith! In the name of the NCR, I'm placing you under arrest for illicit gambling.
0DI0001053	Come quietly now, I don't want to have to hurt you.
0DI0001056	Nightkin suffer schizophrenia from the Stealth Boys they're always using. One of the reasons I settled Jacobstown was so they could be cured.
0DI0001057	While they're in town, the Nightkin aren't allowed to have Stealth Boys so their craziness doesn't get worse.
0DI0001058	Trouble is the Nightkin don't like being visible, either. They don't take being exposed too well.
0DI0001059	Sometimes it seems like I spent the better portion of my youth in that old wreck of a building.
0DI0001060	Me and my hubby, may the man rest in peace, used to scavenge there. If it weren't bolted down, you can bet we took it and sold it.
0DI0001061	A lot of the scrap you see around here is from REPCONN, even my favorite chair.
0DI0001062	You... you did? That's pretty amazing - I figured you'd need artillery to take him out.
0DI0001063	I hate to say it, but as long as the Deathclaw Mother is still alive, that pack isn't going anywhere. She'll take another mate and keep laying eggs.
0DI0001068	Lottery? You remember the lottery?
0DI0001069	Goddamn you! I don't need to remember that!
0DI0001070	My story's a long one, friend, and I can't say as it's all that interesting.
0DI0001071	I'm glad to see you've given it some thought. Are you willing to go talk to them?
0DI0001072	Thanks for doing this. Remember, we need their resources to help us in the upcoming battle. Do whatever it takes.
0DI0001073	I hope you've returned with good news. Are they willing to help the NCR?
0DI0001074	What's the word with the Boomers? Have you talked with them yet?
0DI0001075	Baby, you stick with me, you won't have to work a day in your life. Don't fret about caps, you just sit there and look pretty for me.
0DI0001076	The machine? Harmless, no matter what Trudy says. She thinks it's hiding something, but I think it's just a broken down relic with no place to be.
0DI0001077	Sure. What did you want to know?
0DI0001078	Going on six months, now. But I reckon we'll be moving out, soon enough. Can't talk about the details.
0DI0001079	'Til then, we'll man the towers and keep an eye on the Fiends. We've had more than our share of trouble from their direction.
0DI0001080	Whole things smells of Caesar to me. 'Course, that's just guesswork, but I'd still bet a few caps that he's stirring up the locals against us.
0DI0001081	Simple. I'm going to make myself some easy money. I got a plan.
0DI0001082	Once I get my caps from Dhatri, I'm going to head on over to Gomorrah and win big at cards.
0DI0001083	There's not as many people playing at Gomorrah, so that means I've got better odds of winning big. I got this figured out.
0DI0001084	A while, I guess. I don't keep too careful track of time.
0DI0001085	I like to keep things simple. Just focus on now. That's why they made me a sniper.
0DI0001086	You let your mind wander back a ways, and you lose sight of what's in front of your eyes. Good way to miss a mark.
0DI0001087	Yes, he's an account manager for the Crimson Caravan Company. He works such long ours to provide for our daughter and me.
0DI0001088	You should speak to him if you get the chance - he's always saying how badly understaffed they are.
0DI0001089	Thanks. Let me know what you find out. Here's hoping she's okay.
0DI0001091	Hey, pipe down. We can't talk about that here, out in the open.
0DI0001092	Oh, you mean you want a cure. Oh.
0DI0001093	If you've seen half the things I've seen out in the Wasteland, I can't say I blame you. I might be able to help with that.
0DI0001094	Well, then, take two shots of whiskey and call me in the morning. Heh heh, little doctor humor. Okay, let's have a look.
0DI0001095	I can't say that's something I treat all the time, but I should have something to help you through it.
0DI0001097	I see. Spare me the details. Goddamn. She had the yellowest smile...
0DI0001098	You did your part, so I'll do mine. Go ahead and root around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
0DI0001099	I'll be here. Just don't expect me to fend off a gang of Super Mutants while you're gone.
0DI0001100	Okay. Just don't be gone long. I sunburn easily.
0DI0001101	I'll sit tight.
0DI0001102	Shoulda brought something to read...
0DI0001103	Okay, boss. I'll just wait here, alone, while my heavily armed companion goes out of earshot. I'm sure nothing will happen.
0DI0001104	<Makes beeping sounds>
0DI0001106	Sitting tight. And pretty.
0DI0001107	All right, give a yell if there's trouble.
0DI0001108	I'll hold up here, don't be long.
0DI0001109	Don't go too far now, dearie!
0DI0001110	Stay where grandma can see you!
0DI0001111	Grandma will be right here if you need anything, pumpkin!
0DI0001112	You better not be leaving me here.
0DI0001113	Lot of the mutants here found out about Jacobstown because of Neil. Our isolation works against us sometimes.
0DI0001114	In what currency would you like your payout? Non-caps currencies will have fractions paid out in caps.
0DI0001115	I represent the Nightkin. Marcus may lead this town, but the Nightkin listen to what I have to say.
0DI0001116	That doesn't mean I don't respect Marcus for what he's trying to do. However, he doesn't truly understand the difficulties of being a Nightkin.
0DI0001117	Same as any civilized town - don't start any fights or steal anything, we'll treat you fair. Not a lot to ask.
0DI0001118	Ranger Station Charlie. We're responsible for keeping the highway up through Novac civilized.
0DI0001119	Tough, independent, and as ruthless as they come. They're holed up in Red Rock Canyon, and it's this station's job to keep an eye on them.
0DI0001120	I... don't want to talk about it.
0DI0001121	"For?" No, not exactly. It was a long time ago. Things are a lot different these days, and those days are way behind me.
0DI0001122	Yes. Specializing in neuroscience, both human and canine. Of course, this lab is nothing compared to what I had when I was with the Enclave.
0DI0001123	What can I get you?
0DI0001124	Don't have any other place to go. I'd just end up back in another prison, or dead out in the wasteland.
0DI0001125	Yet you failed, and you must pay.
0DI0001126	Women are beneath notice, as Caesar has taught us. I'm only allowing you to speak to me because you are Caesar's guest.
0DI0001127	I may yet, if Caesar commands it.
0DI0001128	I am one of Caesar's Frumentarii, an infiltrator, a spy. You were not difficult to track.
0DI0001129	The Legion is civilization reborn. Our culture is based on virtues such as martial excellence, loyalty, and justice.
0DI0001130	But you'll learn all there is to know in due time. Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East, will soon arrive to command Caesar's troops in battle.
0DI0001131	The Dam will fall, and the rest of the Profligate west will soon follow.
0DI0001132	The way I heard it, the Brotherhood of Steel ran the place before the NCR took it away from them. I'm not sure who started shooting first.
0DI0001133	But, when it was over, the Brotherhood, with all their fancy armor and weapons, was on the run. Nobody's heard from them since.
0DI0001134	Most of the time, I'm Doctor Henry's research assistant. We're looking into ways to cure the, uh...
0DI0001135	I'm also handy with tools, and once in awhile I venture down into the valley to trade Big Horner hides and meat for supplies.
0DI0001136	They moved into the quarry after the Powder Gangers came through and made off with most of our dynamite.
0DI0001137	We shut the quarry down while we waited for the NCR to get us some more blasting sticks, but now the Deathclaws have shown up.
0DI0001138	The NCR's a no-show, and my men and I have got nothing to do but sit on our asses all day. It's damn frustrating.
0DI0001139	Freedom? Thank God Frank thinks we're enslaved.
0DI0001140	Now we can actually start fresh. Thank you for helping us.
0DI0001141	Freedom? I don't know where we'll get a new start, but any place is better than rotting with the legion or Frank.
0DI0001145	These will be a big help, thanks.
0DI0001146	I might have some answers for you. What did you want to know?
0DI0001147	I don't go looking for fights with them, but they don't have the best interests of people in mind. Certainly not locals.
0DI0001148	The bottom line for NCR is productivity and growth. Politicians back in Shady Sands are completely detached from the people actually living here.
0DI0001149	Oh, so you have heard of me. Yeah, that's right. I was the big draw at the Shark Club, people used to pay hundreds of caps to see me.
0DI0001150	What lottery? The lottery, that's what lottery! Are you stupid?
0DI0001151	Only lottery that matters! Oh my God smell that air!
0DI0001152	I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you repeat it?
0DI0001154	While Sunset Sarsaparilla is perfectly safe, a recent independent study - whose validity is currently being challenged - revealed the following:
0DI0001155	Excessive ingestion of sarsaparilla can lead to deleterious effects including, but not limited to:
0DI0001156	kidney damage,
0DI0001157	nausea,
0DI0001158	digital numbness,
0DI0001159	anxiety,
0DI0001160	loss of visual acuity,
0DI0001161	dizziness,
0DI0001162	occasional nosebleeds,
0DI0001163	joint inflammation,
0DI0001164	tooth decay,
0DI0001165	sore throat,
0DI0001166	bronchitis,
0DI0001167	organ rupture,
0DI0001168	and halitosis.
0DI0001169	Note that you'd have to drink a heap of Sunset Sarsaparilla to match the quantities used in the study. How much, you ask?
0DI0001170	A lot. A whole helluva lot. In fact, you'd have to get full as a tick on Sunset Sarsaparilla to even come close.
0DI0001171	Anyway, thanks for stopping by, partner! And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
0DI0001172	This kiosk was specially constructed around me to deter theft and assault.
0DI0001173	See, I thought the bounty hunting trade would be easy money, but it turns out it's hard work. So screw it.
0DI0001174	Also - I ran into this mark who was a little too tough for me. I mean, I could've taken him.
0DI0001175	But with this guy, it might have cost me some bad burns or an ass-rape. I'm all for risking my life, but I'm a little sensitive about my asshole.
0DI0001176	Yeah, look... he's not my real father. He just looked after me, for a while.
0DI0001177	It's a long story. And I'd get tired of talking before it was through.
0DI0001178	It's like I told you. Dhatri's not my real father. He just looked after me for a while.
0DI0001179	This is what I been waiting to see! A big bad Khan bringing in the medicine! How about you toss some psycho my way?
0DI0001180	What the fuck are you doing here? You got some kind of fucking death wish, asshole?
0DI0001181	I wasn't expecting a resupply so soon, so you have anything from Red Rock Canyon to sell me?
0DI0001182	NCR? Here? Not for long.
0DI0001183	How the hell did you get in here? Where the fuck are my guards?
0DI0001184	Take down this password, it'll get you into the Overseer's area upstairs I think.
0DI0001185	Thanks for the help. We'll find our own way out.
0DI0001189	Thanks for the assistance taking out Motor-Runner. I'll be heading back to McCarran. I'll put in a good word for you.
0DI0001190	There's usually a gun merchant hanging around topside. I'm sure she'll take care of you.
0DI0001191	Oh, I don't sell things, mister. I sell thoughts.
0DI0001192	Oh, I don't sell things, ma'am. I sell thoughts.
0DI0001193	Great! What do you want me to think about? I can think about You, Here... or Everywhere. What do you want?
0DI0001194	Sure, I could do some more thinking. What should I do my thinking about this time?
0DI0001195	That's all right, mister. You will someday.
0DI0001196	That's all right, ma'am. You will someday.
0DI0001197	Sorry, sir. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
0DI0001198	Sorry, ma'am. All that thinking has made my head hurt. I don't think I'll be doing any thinking for a long time.
0DI0001199	Let me see what I can do.
0DI0001200	My mother taught me never to say something 'less it was nice. So I don't have nothing to say about Primm, for the time being at least.
0DI0001201	It's a sad state of affairs. Discuss it with Mr. Nash if you care to. Just makes me want to cry.
0DI0001202	Thanks to you, Primm's on the way back up. With folks watching over us, I think the raiders will keep their distance.
0DI0001203	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, I admit it. They've been collecting dust since before I got here. You can have them dirt cheap.
0DI0001204	What? What happened?
0DI0001205	I'm afraid to ask.
0DI0001206	Dobson's my name. I'm an NCR Ranger, operating out of Camp McCarran north of here. Redding man by birth, though.
0DI0001207	It'll be easy enough to purge all rads from your system.
0DI0001208	Yeah, I was there. I was Captain Dhatri, then. That whole situation was a mess and could easily have been avoided with good intel.
0DI0001209	The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place.
0DI0001210	By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started.
0DI0001211	The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him. I took over and salvaged the situation as best I could.
0DI0001212	For my effort, I was promoted to major. Not quite the way I'd have wanted it.
0DI0001213	A great warrior. When he was but a recruit, I watched him kill ten men in the arena with his bare hands.
0DI0001214	He doesn't feel pain and he never, ever shows mercy. If all Legionaries were like him, the Legion would be invincible.
0DI0001215	To call Lanius ferocious would be an understatement. In battle, he seizes the enemy in his jaws and will not let go.
0DI0001216	He thinks nothing of suffering losses, so long as the enemy suffers more. Though unsubtle, he is not dim. He detects traps, and sets his own.
0DI0001217	Be glad you will not have to face his judgment... if you are true to Caesar.
0DI0001218	Lanius served Caesar well, as his greatest battlefield commander.
0DI0001219	With Lanius at the head of the Legion, however, I doubt he'll have much use for my services. He prefers... direct methods.
0DI0001220	Well, I'll give you a hint - they used to just call me Gibson. I hope you can figure out the rest.
0DI0001221	I don't mind, to be honest. Living long is a real accomplishment these days. Remains to be seen if I end up dying peaceful in my bed.
0DI0001222	Prospectors looking for salvage, usually. They always run when they see the mutants.
0DI0001223	The Great Khans come this way once in awhile, but they keep their distance. I think they're mostly keeping an eye on us.
0DI0001224	This is Sloan, a camp for us quarry workers. The actual quarry, Quarry Junction, is up the road north of here. The whole thing is an NCR operation.
0DI0001225	We make cement for the NCR using the limestone we dig out with dynamite and draglines. Dirty work, but the pay's good.
0DI0001226	Wish we got paid in caps, though. Not a lot of merchants like taking NCR paper money.
0DI0001227	Torres must be getting desperate if she's accepting help on this one. I'll tell you what I told her.
0DI0001228	My records show that Initiate Stanton was the last to check it out, but checked it back in a day later.
0DI0001229	You a merc? Then I guess you'd want to talk to my, uh... father. Major Dhatri. He's our CO.
0DI0001230	You really ought to avoid using those kinds of chems, but I'll see what I can do.
0DI0001231	We know they supply the Fiends with illegal chems, but they never stick around in NCR territory for long. They know the land, and move quick.
0DI0001232	There's talk from time to time about taking out their base at Red Rock Canyon, but nothing ever comes of it. The Great Khans are tough fighters.
0DI0001233	If we ever did go up against them on their home turf, we'd win, but casualties would be high.
0DI0001234	That beat up old thing? What do you want to know?
0DI0001235	Well, I was thinking I might set this bunker up as a safehouse. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
0DI0001236	'Course, seems a lot less remote since you showed up. Plus I haven't been able to get my radio working, and a safehouse's no good without one.
0DI0001237	I reckon I'll stick around awhile, patrol for troublemakers, see if I can get that radio working.
0DI0001238	Well, I thought I might set up a safehouse in one of the bunkers here. Between the remote location and the dust storms, I figured it was ideal.
0DI0001241	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. Jacobstown was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place to find a cure.
0DI0001242	Instead, we wait and wait. I'm sick of waiting.
0DI0001243	The Stealth Boys we use have cumulative, adverse effects on our minds. But, thanks to you, it seems a cure is on the way at last.
0DI0001244	My grandfather opened up this shop. Took over from him when the Fiends killed him.
0DI0001245	Maybe. What do you want to know?
0DI0001246	Thank you. I change names and jobs every decade or so, just to keep things interesting. I picked "Calamity" this time because it sounded nice.
0DI0001247	I've never really done much science stuff until now. I'm pretty good at it, or so Doctor Henry tells me.
0DI0001248	I have reserved a small part of my supplies for sale. The profits go directly to the purchase of additional supplies to help the less fortunate.
0DI0001249	I prefer the solitude, and having a bunch of Super Mutants around tends to keep things safe and quiet.
0DI0001250	Adoptive father, yes. I was very proud when he made First Recon. I know that every time I send them out, I could be sending him to his death.
0DI0001251	But, if it's not me, it'll be somebody else. At least this way I get one more chance to see him.
0DI0001252	I was. I thought I'd accepted the fact that I could be the one ordering him to his death, but it's been more difficult than I thought.
0DI0001253	Excuse me, but I'd rather not speak of this.
0DI0001254	I've been there once, and I don't recommend it. It's just a way to burn through a month's pay in five minutes.
0DI0001255	I've seen a lot of folks come through here thinking they'll have the easy life once they get there. It never happens.
0DI0001256	It's a tradition in the Praetorians to specialize in unarmed combat because weapons can break or jam when needed most.
0DI0001257	However, our unarmed techniques favor offense over defense. We can charge the enemy and flatten him with our first strike before he can react.
0DI0001258	You have a poor reputation in the Legion. It wouldn't be acceptable for me to teach you anything right now.
0DI0001259	[FAILED] I've watched you move, and I can tell you simply don't have the skill to learn the technique.
0DI0001260	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. This will take some time, and I'm not a forgiving teacher.
0DI0001262	It's not something we like to speak of. The Burned Man was our greatest warrior, even greater than Legate Lanius, but he failed Caesar at the Dam.
0DI0001263	He's been dead for several years now, but the rumor is that Caesar has scouts out looking for him all the same. The Burned Man was a very tough man.
0DI0001264	Ask someone else, woman.
0DI0001265	Ah, yes - we are forbidden from speaking his true name. He was a shaman of some kind before he met Caesar, a holy man from out of the Utah.
0DI0001266	The Burned Man proved dangerous, unpredictable, and impossible to kill. He helped Caesar form the Legion but almost led it to destruction.
0DI0001267	Not a whole gang or anything - just two, maybe three. I was a caravan guard, so I know how to handle a gun pretty well.
0DI0001268	I handle communications for Camp Forlorn Hope, compiling reports I've received from the Rangers at Camp Golf as well as the brass at McCarran.
0DI0001269	Unofficially, I'm also in charge of radio security. No one else seems to take it as seriously as I do.
0DI0001270	As are all crimes. If you feel strongly about it, attack us, and soon you won't feel a thing.
0DI0001271	So you've said.
0DI0001273	Thank you, this will keep us well-stocked for a good long while.
0DI0001274	I am Cursor Lucullus, and my orders are to escort you to the Legion's camp at Fortification Hill. Are you ready to go?
0DI0001275	Keeping watch on the Great Khans mostly. They usually stick around Red Rock Canyon, but at least one large group left recently.
0DI0001276	We called it in, but haven't heard anything about any Great Khan incidents. Whatever they're doing, they're keeping a low profile.
0DI0001277	Oh, this old thing? Why, thanks, friend. This here guitar is just about the only thing my daddy left me.
0DI0001278	All quiet at the moment. Ranger Beaumont is in charge here, but he's off leading a patrol.
0DI0001279	It was quiet until those rockets blasted off over our heads.
0DI0001280	There was a hell of a boom over at REPCONN. Looks like the ghouls had some sort of accident with their rockets.
0DI0001281	I operate the radio and call it in if we see any Great Khans moving out in large groups from Red Rock Canyon.
0DI0001282	New in town, pardner? Well, let ol' Festus give you the lay of the land.
0DI0001283	If you're here to redeem your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars, dump 'em into the slot in the barrel below and I'll count 'em up.
0DI0001284	If you don't know what Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars are and think ol' Festus is just shooting his mouth off, say "Star Info".
0DI0001285	If you're here to challenge ol' Festus to a game of Lucky Horseshoes, say "I feel lucky".
0DI0001286	Lastly, if you're here about the health advisory that aired on channel 6 recently, say "Silly Ol' Advisory."
0DI0001287	No! Queenie! Hahahaha! I'm going to burn the world for you, Queenie!
0DI0001288	You want to help us out? What makes you think we want you around here, huh?
0DI0001289	Hsu sent you? This was my mission!
0DI0001290	He sent you? Why?
0DI0001291	[SUCCEEDED] Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
0DI0001292	[FAILED] Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
0DI0001293	You like it any better if I tell you to fuck off?
0DI0001294	Thinking hurts you, too? Aw, I wish I could let you have the one on my head but I can't. It hurts real bad when I don't wear it.
0DI0001296	You bet.
0DI0001297	You done everything you could, youngster. It's over for Primm. Ain't nothing to be done about it.
0DI0001298	Well I guess you're gonna have to find us a new lawman.
0DI0001299	I suggest talking to those NCR troopers across the bridge. I also overheard the Powder Gangsters talking about some ex-sheriff on lockdown there.
0DI0001300	Right now Beagle is the closest Primm's got to any organized law, but he's still stuck up in Bison Steve.
0DI0001301	First thing I'd say his get his sorry butt outta there.
0DI0001302	Your guess is good as mine. You might luck upon someone who's a natural-born sheriff.
0DI0001303	I heard of one fella what got himself locked in that NCR jailhouse up I-15. Maybe that ain't the best credential, but a sheriff's a sheriff.
0DI0001304	I imagine the NCR would be able to bring some law to the town, too. But from what I seen they barely got the firepower to protect themselves.
0DI0001305	With the NCR driven off? I figure our only hope'd be for someone like you to find us someone who's crazy or dimwitted enough to take the job.
0DI0001306	With Meyers dead and his deputies gone, Primm's only hope is to accept NCR rule. If you run across one of their patrols, tell 'em so.
0DI0001308	Yes, that's the stuff. And the container's shielding must be intact, or you'd be dead by now.
0DI0001309	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all that's needed now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
0DI0001311	Now all I need is the thrust control modules and three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
0DI0001314	Now all I need is the thrust control modules.
0DI0001315	Good. I'll make it worth your while. And one more thing. We shouldn't speak again. Not until it's over.
0DI0001316	No one in town knows that I know what happened to my wife. Best they never know. Or the Legion will be after me next.
0DI0001317	I just know what I've heard. There's supposed to be some ghouls that went in a while back.
0DI0001318	Every so often there'll be a commotion from that direction - explosions and such.
0DI0001319	Indeed you did. And they seem to be in excellent condition.
0DI0001320	You already found the igniting agent, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
0DI0001322	I still need the igniting agent, of course. And three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
0DI0001325	All I need now is the igniting agent we discussed earlier.
0DI0001328	Sure thing. Have a look.
0DI0001329	Praise the creator! And bless you, wanderer! The way is clear. I will lead my flock through the basement to the sacred site!
0DI0001330	I hope you will come find us there, wanderer! There is much to be done.
0DI0001331	I understand. I know you will fulfill your promise.
0DI0001332	And they've been shooting them down like animals, haven't they?
0DI0001333	Those ghouls were members of my flock, even after the madness consumed their minds. We never let them wander free.
0DI0001334	We kept them safe on the first floor. We kept them contained. The demons must have let them out, somehow...
0DI0001335	And now they are lost forever, denied the salvation and healing glow of the Far Beyond...
0DI0001336	Please, wanderer, bear in mind that every feral ghoul you spare now is one that we can save later.
0DI0001337	Once the way is clear, our feral brothers and sisters will accompany us on the Great Journey. If there are any left...
0DI0001338	I am Jason Bright, the prophet of the Great Journey. All the ghouls you see here are members of my flock.
0DI0001339	An auspicious name, don't you think? It was mine before I became as I am now. Before the Great War, even.
0DI0001340	Truly does the creator author a destiny for each and every one of us...
0DI0001341	We wish to escape the barbarity of the wasteland, especially the violence and bigotry of its human inhabitants.
0DI0001342	The creator has promised to my flock a new land: a place of safety and healing... a paradise in the Far Beyond.
0DI0001343	Preparations for the Great Journey were nearly complete when the demons appeared.
0DI0001344	The means by which the Great Journey is to be accomplished are an article of faith, not to be discussed with outsiders.
0DI0001345	Yes. The rockets will convey us to our promised land in the Far Beyond. Vision upon vision has confirmed it.
0DI0001346	I understand your concerns, friend, and I thank you for voicing them. But the creator's will for us has been made manifest.
0DI0001348	We've been here for a few years, just looking for a place we can call our own.
0DI0001349	Life's harsh, but still, it beats the hell out of the desert. We've got numbers, we've got food, and we've got trade. That's progress, stranger.
0DI0001350	See that you do.
0DI0001351	I saved your life so I kinda feel responsible for you is all.
0DI0001352	Heh, well of course not. We just wouldn't want anything to happen to you is all.
0DI0001353	Keep your nose to the ground, stranger, that's what. Mind your own business and let us mind our own, are we clear?
0DI0001354	If you've got a mind to loot the old H&H Tools factory, don't even bother. That place is sealed tighter than a Radscorpion's bunghole.
0DI0001355	Every salvager who tries gets blown up, flattened, or gutted by traps. Then he starts to stink up the town and we're the ones to clean up the mess.
0DI0001356	That's right, the H&H Tools factory on the main drag. It's been sealed for ages, and it's lousy with traps. Still, might be something valuable to you.
0DI0001357	I wish I could say I was surprised. But that is what we've come to expect from your kind.
0DI0001358	Normally, it's what I'd expect from you. But it was the creator who brought you here today.
0DI0001359	Bzzzt... Law Enforcement Protocols reinstated, pardner. Initializing use of force authorization... authorization found. Yee-haw!
0DI0001360	Aw, shucks, SYSTEM RUNTIME ERROR! Unable to initialize Law Enforcement Protocols, pardner!
0DI0001361	Never been there since the NCR's got troops all over it. Must be pretty important.
0DI0001362	Really? Unbelievable, man! I knew that wasn't gonna be easy.
0DI0001363	But I had a good feeling about you. You look like you been through a lot.
0DI0001364	Coincidentally, I'm also looking for her. I've got a business offer she'd be interested in.
0DI0001365	I believe Cass frequents the Mojave Outpost, far south of here, near the California border.
0DI0001366	Everything you see is funded by the Followers of the Apocalypse. We rely a lot on charity to provide low-cost medical services to the less fortunate.
0DI0001367	We're part scout, part commando, part sheriff. The training is brutal, and I'd say eight out of ten recruits washes out before the end.
0DI0001368	Before you get your Ranger badge, you've got to prove you can be quieter than a shadow and more ferocious than a Deathclaw.
0DI0001369	Best of the best, that's all there is to it. Really nothing more to say than that.
0DI0001370	Well, when there's trouble regular NCR troops can't handle, they send in a Ranger. Problem solved.
0DI0001371	We're also responsible for keeping the borders of the NCR secure, scouting out threats, that sort of thing.
0DI0001373	You'll be meeting face-to-face with the mighty Caesar himself, founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
0DI0001374	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. Not even tribal chieftains receive this honor.
0DI0001376	To my knowledge, this is the first time Caesar has ever summoned one of the Dissolute to see him. That it'd be a woman is even more surprising.
0DI0001377	Same old shit that's been going on for years. The NCR and Legion are still fighting over Hoover Dam for some reason.
0DI0001378	I've run with some tough gangs, but I gotta admit they all got nothing on the Legion. I hear they stick you up on poles and it takes awhile to die.
0DI0001379	I ain't saying I'm afraid of them or nothing, but I'll be staying out of their way.
0DI0001380	"New" California Republic - nothing new about it. Just a bunch of people with money and power pushing everyone else around.
0DI0001381	They've got troops all over the Mojave, but it's a big desert so it's pretty easy to avoid them if you want.
0DI0001382	The fact that you're still on your feet is... surprising.
0DI0001383	Life can be pretty rough sometimes.
0DI0001384	I've seen worse.
0DI0001385	I'll answer if I can.
0DI0001386	Benny oversees the business, sure, but I run the Tops day to day. I'm his right-hand guy, you dig?
0DI0001387	Yeah, well, that's the way it used to be. Now that Benny's gone, it's just me in charge.
0DI0001388	Mr. House is out of the picture and you have the Platinum Chip? Wonderful! Let's go!
0DI0001389	We'll see about that.
0DI0001390	I'd be more than happy to have you. Heck, I'll hire anybody with a pair of legs and at least one good eye at this point.
0DI0001391	There'd be a lot of money in it for you if you can get him back to me safe.
0DI0001392	And if he ain't, you can bet I'll pay for the names of the sons of bitches responsible.
0DI0001393	[SUCCEEDED] I should've known that Mr. House wouldn't have sent just anybody. Anything I might I offer to, well, encourage discretion?
0DI0001394	[SUCCEEDED] You've made your point. What would it take to... convince you to keep silent until I manage to finish Mr. House's requests?
0DI0001395	Name's Crandon, stranger. I keep an eye out for trouble around here.
0DI0001396	Uh, you know, just filling up water and stuff.
0DI0001397	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that'll do.
0DI0001398	I swore not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
0DI0001399	According to him, the NCR's decided enough's enough and's going to send in a mess of troops to take back the prison any day now.
0DI0001400	[FAILED] Then I guess you won't be knowing more, eh? But you know where to find me, should you change your mind.
0DI0001401	[SUCCEEDED] Hold on there! With everything you already done for this town, I'd feel ungrateful as hell if I let you risk yourself for no good reason!
0DI0001402	He made me swear not to say a word to no one, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
0DI0001404	[SUCCEEDED] No need to get upset, youngster! We're all friends here!
0DI0001407	[FAILED] Sorry, youngster. I'm a trader, and if something's got value, I can't give it away for nothing.
0DI0001408	Every night around midnight Alice and I'll wake up to some crazy hollering and gun shots. You'd think the world was ending all over again.
0DI0001409	But it's just one animal each night. They don't take it or carve it up or nothing. Just leave it there, all full of holes.
0DI0001410	Well, it's the strangest thing. Last time it happened I could swear I heard someone cry out for help. Sounded like a big fella.
0DI0001411	But when we finally got up the gumption to go look outside all we found was our cattle. And I know what they sound like when they get upset.
0DI0001412	I can't imagine what went on. Dusty can probably tell you more about it.
0DI0001413	Believe me. When I heard the news, my first thought was, I owe somebody. Big. I figured Boone would come around after a while.
0DI0001414	But he hasn't. And I'm starting to think that if he doesn't find her that things will never go back to the way they were.
0DI0001415	Man, everybody. That girl didn't have one friend in this whole town. She didn't want any.
0DI0001416	She wanted to sit in her room all day and make herself miserable. And she went out of her way to be rude.
0DI0001417	She upset a lot of people. You wouldn't have liked her, either.
0DI0001418	Uh... no. No. They're gonna think I'm having trouble letting go. They're good soldiers. I don't give them enough credit.
0DI0001419	Right now? A whole lot of sitting on my keister and counting cracks in the ceiling. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
0DI0001420	On better days I help keep the peace. Boone and Vargas watch the road, I watch the town. Tell myself I'm doing some good.
0DI0001421	How should I put it? I guess you could say she was kinda like a cactus flower. Real pretty to look at, but there was just no getting close to her.
0DI0001422	She never did take to living here. She liked the big lights and fast living of New Vegas.
0DI0001423	I got the feeling she was trying to get Boone to leave with her, but I guess she got tired of waiting.
0DI0001424	Carla was a knockout. Whenever Boone walked around with her, he always had this funny grin on his face like he couldn't believe his luck.
0DI0001425	I know we couldn't.
0DI0001426	That wasn't the only reason she stuck out, though. That girl never minced words.
0DI0001427	If she'd had better food or hospitality, she'd let you hear it. Trouble was, she usually had.
0DI0001428	I don't think she meant it. She really was a sweet girl.
0DI0001429	I think she just wanted to remind herself that there are still nicer places in this world than Novac. Who could blame her for that?
0DI0001430	Boone. That's that sniper fella, works in the dinosaur, right? I only met them but once or twice.
0DI0001431	They seemed real happy together. I really oughtta to get to know them better. They're probably nice folk.
0DI0001432	Well, to be honest with you, I don't really know them two as well as I might.
0DI0001433	I remember she had an edge about her, like she'd rather be someplace else. This kind of life ain't for everyone, that's for darn sure.
0DI0001434	Can't say we spoke much. Boone did most of the buying for them. She was in the store once, but she didn't stay long.
0DI0001435	Had a look on her face like she'd smelled something sour. But far as I can remember, the gift shop smelled fine. Well... fine as it always does.
0DI0001436	If it's just the same to you, I think I'll stay in town. I feel safer that way.
0DI0001437	Hey, I'm sorry, but I've gotta turn around. Leg's giving me some trouble.
0DI0001438	Maybe some other time. I'm not really in the mood for a hike.
0DI0001439	Nothing that wouldn't be wrong with any man who loses a wife, I suppose. Poor dear.
0DI0001440	I know he thinks she was kidnapped, but I'm not so sure she didn't just run off on her own.
0DI0001441	You could tell she was thinking about it ever since they arrived.
0DI0001442	Had his wife taken. I don't think he'll ever be the same as he was. Damn shame.
0DI0001443	I told the Rangers up at the station to keep an eye out, but there's just too much ground out there for them to cover.
0DI0001444	I've got your back.
0DI0001445	Right behind you, boss.
0DI0001446	Lead the way.
0DI0001447	Aw, just when the standing around was getting exciting.
0DI0001450	Let's hit the road.
0DI0001451	Let's roll out, then.
0DI0001452	All right, dearie, let's go.
0DI0001453	Yeah, who am I kidding? It's funny, you get stuck in your room for a few weeks, you start to worry the world's gonna fall apart without you.
0DI0001454	Those guys are fine. They don't need me looking over their shoulders.
0DI0001455	I have glimpsed it only in visions, wanderer, but what I have seen is truly miraculous.
0DI0001456	It is a place of light and healing, and I know in my soul that my flock will be safe there.
0DI0001457	Your pranks won't work on me, smoothskin. They won't work on Jason, either.
0DI0001458	Stop wasting my time, smoothskin. Go waste Jason's.
0DI0001459	You're referring to Chris. I doubt you had much luck if you tried telling him that he's human.
0DI0001460	We had the same discussions when he first appeared, and the same lack of success. He believes he is one of us.
0DI0001461	Soon enough we realized that Chris was a gift from the creator. He is integral to the success of the Great Journey.
0DI0001462	After all that you have done for us, I suppose you deserve to know everything...
0DI0001463	When Chris came to us, we tried to convince him that he was human. But this only angered him. He seemed... lost.
0DI0001464	We decided to let him stay with us for a few days, over the course of which we learned that his technical skills far surpassed our own.
0DI0001465	It became clear that the creator had sent him to us, to ensure the success of the Great Journey.
0DI0001466	Equally clear was that Chris should labor in blessed ignorance of his humanity, and his inability to make the journey himself.
0DI0001467	It is no coincidence that two humans have been vital to the success of the Great Journey.
0DI0001468	It is my belief that the creator sent you and Chris to expiate the sins of your kind against mine. You are redeemers both.
0DI0001469	Such is the creator's will. Vision upon vision has shown me that, were Chris to accompany us, he would die in minutes.
0DI0001470	The radiation around the launch pad alone would kill Chris in minutes. The radioactivity of the Far Beyond is much stronger.
0DI0001471	Oh. Well, it's a big hotel. You should talk to Marjorie - she's in charge and she can probably help you find anyone you might need.
0DI0001472	She usually works at the front of the Gourmand. She likes to see how people respond to it.
0DI0001473	You can get to the Gourmand from the lobby here - it's a big set of double doors on the first floor on the eastern side. Can't miss it.
0DI0001474	A man? Well then this... well this can't be. Two disappearances in my hotel? What will people say?
0DI0001475	I'm going to have a word with my staff about security on the premises.
0DI0001476	Whether these people are found or not, our guests simply must feel safe in their own rooms.
0DI0001477	Jason is the prophet. The only reason you're up here is because he wants to talk to you.
0DI0001478	I guess he had visions that a smoothskin would stop by.
0DI0001480	Yes! This is going to be fun!
0DI0001481	I'm unlocking the East Power Plant. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
0DI0001482	Right, who wants a vast army of mechanical servants to savage your enemy? Why make it easy?
0DI0001483	I'm setting the generators to blow, just like you asked. Hit the manual switch, then go topside and deal with the Legion and NCR.
0DI0001484	Well, problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force - probably - but not enough to keep them from coming back!
0DI0001485	So what we do is take away the whole reason why they'd want to come back! Smart, huh?
0DI0001486	I feel really bad telling you this, but I kind of... can't die. I mean, go ahead and destroy this Securitron, get it out of your system!
0DI0001487	The problem is that a distributed image of my neuro-computational matrix is backed-up to the network several times a day, or when I'm threatened!
0DI0001488	I can't help it! There's a little bit of me in every Securitron out on the Strip, so if this instance gets destroyed, I just download to a new one.
0DI0001489	If I could stop it from happening, I would! I mean, your vengeance is going to feel so incomplete!
0DI0001490	That was my fault! But I've changed!
0DI0001491	Sorry if that was getting boring!
0DI0001492	I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
0DI0001493	Your memory is like a steel trap, boss. What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
0DI0001494	That Loyal guy. He's getting up there in years, but he still finds a way to make himself useful to his people.
0DI0001495	If you ask me, that's better than withering away all alone, or holding on to some faded piece of glory from your past.
0DI0001496	Meeting Corporal Sterling, well... it kind of got me thinking.
0DI0001497	Here's a guy that's been beat all to hell, right? I mean, he could have retired from the service, but instead he signs back on and does what he can.
0DI0001498	You think he did the right thing?
0DI0001499	No shit? Drink's on me, then.
0DI0001500	Still, not like I'm going anywhere. Caravan title's still keeping me here, even though it's dead and gone.
0DI0001501	I don't know, seems to be a lot of attention on Nipton. Word is, one of the snipers in the nest on the roof spotted smoke from the East.
0DI0001502	Guess that settles that, then.
0DI0001503	Don't matter much how we settle this, as long as it gets settled.
0DI0001506	Hey, where the hell do you think you're going? Primm is off limits.
0DI0001507	Some convicts from the prison up the road have taken over the town. Everyone inside is either dead or in hiding.
0DI0001508	What's more, there are two tribes of raiders causing trouble in this area as well. You'd be safer heading back up to Goodsprings.
0DI0001509	It's your ass. Don't say you weren't warned.
0DI0001510	Be careful. You may want to talk to Lieutenant Hayes.
0DI0001511	He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
0DI0001512	We'd love to, but they don't fall under NCR jurisdiction. Even if they did we're in no shape to protect them.
0DI0001513	We don't have the equipment to take out the convicts, and even if we did we need some extra hands for backup.
0DI0001514	You should talk to Lieutenant Hayes. He's in a tent down the road. Just stay on the west side of the overpass if you don't want to get shot.
0DI0001515	A courier dropped it off a couple months back. I got it working for a little while, but the darn thing pooped out.
0DI0001516	I haven't been able to get it up and running again. I was hoping to use it for some courier work, but that ain't gonna happen.
0DI0001517	Hell if I know. I don't think its serious, but my tinkering days are long gone.
0DI0001518	You're welcome to try. Its yours if you can get it working.
0DI0001519	If I had my way I'd dump it in the scrapyard in Novac and be done with the damn thing.
0DI0001520	That beat up old pile of bolts? What do you want to know?
0DI0001521	A courier dropped it off a little bit ago. I'd hoped to get it up and running for some courier work, but never could get it running.
0DI0001522	Can't say that I have, of course I never saw it running for long, so I never heard it do much of anything.
0DI0001523	Not a bit. I imagine there must be some people around curious about that kind of technology.
0DI0001524	Hey, Nipton! Eat me!
0DI0001525	Who's the winner? Oliver Swanick, that's who! Yeah!
0DI0001526	I won the fucking lottery, hear me! So fuck y'all! Whoohoo!
0DI0001527	Ain't gonna see me up on a cross or my head on no pole, uh uh! That's for loooooosers!
0DI0001528	I am a win-ner! I am a win-ner!
0DI0001529	When I command you to complete a mission, you will complete it, or you should die in the attempt.
0DI0001530	I will overlook this error, but only because I think you can still be useful.
0DI0001531	You got it! I won't say another word about them!
0DI0001532	Whatever you say!
0DI0001533	Say no more, say no more... if you say they're good, they're good!
0DI0001555	Fuck you man, I ain't going nowhere with you.
0DI0001556	Why don't you go cry to your wife, then - oh that's right! She left your worthless stinking ass!
0DI0001557	It's the least I could do. All I ask is that you put it to good use. This place has lived in the shadow of Caesar for long enough.
0DI0001558	I may not be the one to help stop him here, but you are. Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
0DI0001559	I have to admit, I did not expect that sort of response.
0DI0001560	This is one of the last surviving suits of original-issue Tesla armor from Navarro and it was worn by my father but... yeah I guess it's no big deal.
0DI0001561	Good luck at Hoover Dam. I'll uh... be going now, I guess.
0DI0001562	Back to Old Mormon Fort, where I can do some good. We Followers may be idealistic but even I know this is going to end in blood.
0DI0001563	Fortis fortuna adiuvat. Good luck, and good bye.
0DI0001564	War. War never changes.
0DI0001565	When atomic fire consumed the earth, those who survived did so in great underground vaults.
0DI0001566	When they opened, their inhabitants set out across the ruins of the Old World to build new societies, establishing villages, forming tribes.
0DI0001567	As decades passed, what had been the American southwest united
0DI0001568	beneath the flag of the New California Republic, dedicated to Old World values of democracy and the rule of law.
0DI0001569	As the Republic grew, so did its needs. Scouts spread east, seeking territory and wealth in the dry and merciless expanse of the Mojave desert.
0DI0001570	They returned with tales of a city untouched by the warheads that had scorched the rest of the world - and a great wall spanning the Colorado River.
0DI0001571	The NCR mobilized its army and sent it east, to occupy Hoover Dam and restore it to working condition.
0DI0001572	But across the Colorado, another society had arisen, under a different flag.
0DI0001573	A vast army of slaves forged from the conquest of 86 tribes - Caesar's Legion.
0DI0001574	Four years have passed since the Republic held the dam - just barely - against the Legion's onslaught. The Legion did not retreat.
0DI0001575	Across the river, it gathers strength. Camp fires burn, training drums beat.
0DI0001576	Through it all, the New Vegas Strip has stayed open for business, under the control of its mysterious overseer, Mr. House,
0DI0001577	and his army of rehabilitated tribals and police robots.
0DI0001578	You are a Courier, hired by the Mojave Express to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip.
0DI0001579	What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn for the worse.
0DI0001580	Wow. That thing is definitely carrying around a bunch of Enclave intel. Adams is on the eastern seaboard of the country.
0DI0001581	Which means this little "Duraframe" sucker somehow managed to survive for over two thousand miles. Certainly lives up to its model name.
0DI0001582	I don't want to be... alarmist or anything, but maybe you should ditch that Eyebot. Robot. Whatever that thing is.
0DI0001583	Who knows what it's programmed for? Maybe tomorrow you'll take out an iguana-on-a-stick and that'll activate its mini-nuke self-destruct sequence.
0DI0001584	I don't know if you care about my opinion, but I'd prefer that you turn ED-E over to the Followers. Surprised, right?
0DI0001585	Some of the old-timers like Moreno hold grudges against the Brotherhood and the NCR. I'd like to think I'm above that, but you may be right.
0DI0001586	I'm not going to pout and cry if you give him to the Brotherhood. I'd rather they have it than allow all that knowledge to disappear.
0DI0001587	I'd just prefer that it goes to an organization like the Followers, who are less likely to use it for... violent purposes.
0DI0001588	The Brotherhood hoards knowledge and is obviously a smidge more violent than the Followers.
0DI0001589	Don't get me wrong. I'd rather the Brotherhood get the intel than see it lost somewhere in the desert, but I'd prefer the Followers overall.
0DI0001590	Okay. Don't have to make a decision now. Just... sleep on it or something.
0DI0001591	Great. Then all is right with the world.
0DI0001592	This isn't the total we agreed upon. Don't waste my time, wastelander.
0DI0001662	Fine. Would you mind explaining why you killed Anderson?
0DI0001663	That's a grim deal to make. But when it came down to it, it's the same choice he made. Not all sacrifices are made by the willing.
0DI0001664	But where is the lamb for this burnt offering?
0DI0001665	That was his decision to make, not yours.
0DI0001666	There are other ways to punish people, other ways to condemn their actions.
0DI0001667	What the Followers always do. Whatever we can.
0DI0001668	No, really. Have you ever snorted a ground up Cazador venom sac? Neither have I, but I can guarantee you that a Freeside junkie has.
0DI0001669	Oh, all right. I'm thirty-ish. Well, late thirties. I was born... west of here. I was an only child and spent most of my time with my mother.
0DI0001670	My father died when I was young and I never got over it. Oh... and I like medicine and reading books about failed Pre-War socioeconomic policies.
0DI0001671	Right now, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "Why hasn't some lucky man scooped this bachelor off his feet?" Like I said, I'm boring.
0DI0001672	Some people do. I just... don't.
0DI0001673	Look, I appreciate that you're trying to be friendly, but I'd just rather not discuss it.
0DI0001674	Okay, okay, you don't have to agree with me that much.
0DI0001677	Great. Glad we're on the same page.
0DI0001678	I mean, I didn't expect that you'd want to... activate the super weapon or anything.
0DI0001679	Heh.
0DI0001680	NCR troops control Hoover Dam. Why do they need more power?
0DI0001681	O... kay.
0DI0001682	Hmm. That's a valid point. I'm not really behind the NCR in all of this, but the last thing I want is panic in the streets.
0DI0001683	Maybe if you're Mr. House you do. I bet the people in Freeside need it a lot more than he does.
0DI0001684	Yeah, exactly. They don't.
0DI0001685	Argh, you moron! You're going to kill all of the troopers down there!
0DI0001686	That's it. I'm out. Good luck getting out of this place without being shot to pieces by NCR soldiers, assuming they aren't going to fry to death.
0DI0001687	I'm thinking that I'm leaving because you are a sociopath. Good riddance.
0DI0001688	Oh, to hell with this!
0DI0001689	I figured you'd say that. Sometimes staying put is the best thing you can do.
0DI0001690	I'll leave the fighting to the old warhorses. It's what they were made for.
0DI0001691	I need to go take care of something before I set up at Freeside. I'll see you soon. And again, thanks for your help with the others.
0DI0001692	I honestly didn't expect you to say that. When I talked to you about Daisy and the others, you seemed to put a lot of value in loyalty to the past.
0DI0001693	What's changed since then?
0DI0001694	Good point. You've been encouraging the others to stand up and fight, maybe I should take the same advice. After all, I also lived in Navarro.
0DI0001695	There's something I need to go do, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks again for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
0DI0001696	I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you had a problem with people who hold on to the past.
0DI0001697	Suiting up to fight against Caesar with the Navarro veterans seems like... I don't know, like a kid playing dress up in his father's clothes.
0DI0001698	True enough, I suppose. Getting them back together must be worth more than me spraying plasma all over the dam.
0DI0001699	Back to Freeside it is. I need to make a stop before I settle in. I'll be back in a while. Thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
0DI0001700	I am, but they're still my family. I think you were right the first time. If there's something I can do to help hold the dam, I'll do it.
0DI0001701	Look, there's something I have to do, but I promise I'll be back in a while. Trust me. And thanks again for your help. It means a lot to me.
0DI0001702	True enough. Maybe I can't fill my father's shoes. I wouldn't even know how.
0DI0001703	But if following in his footsteps for a while means I can do some good out here, I will do my best.
0DI0001704	I need to go do something. I won't be gone long, but I'll catch up with you later. Thanks for your help with the others. It means a lot to me.
0DI0001705	No, I think it is the same for me. Maybe for a different reason, but... you can't hold on to a past you've never had.
0DI0001706	For better or worse, I am not my father. I never had a life with the Enclave, and it would be silly for me to try to start one now.
0DI0001707	I'll stay with you until the Legion moves on the dam, but once the attack starts, I'm going to have to go to back to Freeside. It's where I belong.
0DI0001708	I need to take care of something, but I'll see you soon enough. Thanks for all of the help. It means a lot to me.
0DI0001709	Of course, Caesar! You can hardly even hold his men responsible, given how they're practically raised to worship him as a living deity.
0DI0001710	What's the point of surviving the war? Why did the founders of the Followers crawl their way out of vaults to bring knowledge back to the wasteland?
0DI0001711	So we could act like the last two thousand years didn't happen? Play dress up so we can fight ancient wars all over again?
0DI0001712	No way is he getting away with this. I'm not letting it happen. You're not letting it happen.
0DI0001713	Being "smart" doesn't matter if you're insane. Everything makes sense to Caesar because he's twisted everything to his world view.
0DI0001714	He's Caesar reincarnated, the NCR is the corrupt Roman senate. I wouldn't be surprised if he thought the Colorado River were the new Rubicon.
0DI0001715	He abdicates responsibility to a myth of historical inevitability. But he's not Caesar. This isn't Rome. And he isn't going to get away with this.
0DI0001716	Well, yeah! Right. What did I expect? The man's a megalomaniac. He acts like this is some pre-ordained cycle we're returning to.
0DI0001717	Of all the people who could learn from our past mistakes, he goes and throws all of our knowledge off of a cliff.
0DI0001718	Instead of trying to learn from the past, he re-creates it, runs back over the same old barren ground.
0DI0001719	A fair point, but from the perspective of someone on the east side of Arizona, the man is clearly out of his mind.
0DI0001720	Maybe he didn't intend for things to wind up this way, but that doesn't mean he needs to perpetuate this bizarre anachronistic myth.
0DI0001721	And it doesn't mean that we should sit by and nod our heads at every absurd faux-Roman casus belli he can dream up.
0DI0001722	He's a tyrant. The bad kind. And there's no way we're letting him take Hoover Dam.
0DI0001723	You're platinum, pussycat! You know how to swing!
0DI0001724	Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya? Hello!
0DI0001725	That was a nice bit of hey-hey, girlie. You're a real ring-a-ding broad!
0DI0001726	Hold me, will ya? I swear you wore me out...
0DI0001727	Be seeing you.
0DI0001728	Your belongings will be returned to you when you leave.
0DI0001732	Why free me now? After what you done? I ain't saying thank you.
0DI0001735	<Sad stare>
0DI0001736	[SUCCEEDED] Alright. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps. If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
0DI0001737	[FAILED] Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Keep talking like that and your ass is going to be in the gutter. 25%. Take it or leave it.
0DI0001738	[SUCCEEDED] All right. 50/50 it is, but you better bring back all of the caps.
0DI0001739	If we hear you crossed us, the next bounty hunter will be coming for you.
0DI0001741	You're probably right. Here, take it.
0DI0001742	Aw shucks, pardner. I suppose it can't hurt to let you in on my little secret!
0DI0001743	Old Victor woudn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, I can move from one to another with the snap of a finger!
0DI0001744	Pretty nice trick, ain't it? Just don't ask me how I do it, because I don't know!
0DI0001745	[You hear static.]
0DI0001746	We were getting a little worried. Where's your partner? No, on second thought, don't tell me.
0DI0001747	Give your report to the Elder, then have the doc look your over. Oh, and welcome back.
0DI0001749	Stay where you are. I'm sending someone up to meet you.
0DI0001760	You're free to leave. The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission.
0DI0001762	The guard in the weather station will return the Chip to you when you're ready for Caesar's mission. Otherwise, we can return to Cottonwood Cove.
0DI0001764	Sorry, friend, but I just can't do it.
0DI0001765	Very well. I must confiscate your weapons.
0DI0001766	Vale.
0DI0001767	Speak to me when you are ready and I'll have your weapons returned.
0DI0001769	You waste time, then.
0DI0001772	Do I look destroyed, pardner? It's harder to put old Vic in Boot Hill than you might think!
0DI0001773	I wouldn't be much use stuck inside just one Securitron! No, if the one I'm in turns up a goner, I just find another, fine as cream gravy!
0DI0001774	Allow me to introduce myself! I'm the Securitron that dug you up in the bone orchard outside Goodsprings.
0DI0001775	I thought you'd gone up the flume, but that Doc Mitchell knows his trade. It's good to see you up and around, right as a trivet!
0DI0001776	The boss is waiting for ya.
0DI0001777	All aboard!
0DI0001778	Right away!
0DI0001779	Heading up!
0DI0001780	Heading down!
0DI0001781	Howdy, Pardner! Let's skedaddle! Got something to show ya!
0DI0001782	It's just at the top of the ridge here...
0DI0001783	There you have it - New Vegas, pretty as a diamond flush.
0DI0001784	Well, rambler, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
0DI0001785	Well, darling, it's a royal flush that beats all! So let's crown this hand!
0DI0001787	Yee-haw! Ain't that pretty?
0DI0001788	Don't take in the view for too long, though - word is, the Legion's on the move!
0DI0001789	Head on back and see the boss real soon, hear? Evening.
0DI0001800	What the hell are you talking about? What is this?
0DI0001801	"The Free Economic Zone of New Vegas..." What the hell does that mean?! Oh, wait, here we go.
0DI0001802	"Demands NCR's immediate withdrawal..." Withdrawal? Like fucking hell we're withdrawing... we just held the dam, we didn't do it to let it go!
0DI0001803	This paper of yours? Isn't fit to wipe my ass. If you think after all that's happened, I'm going to grab my ankles and take it like the Legion...
0DI0001806	We'll see.
0DI0001807	Fix it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
0DI0001808	Do it, then. You're not leaving until it's done and Caesar lives.
0DI0001809	Good. I'll have my men seize him immediately.
0DI0001810	Then you die.
0DI0001811	You had your chance. Now you die.
0DI0001812	So tell me, did you really think I'd be stupid enough to fall for this again? One of my men saw you go in and out of the Kings' place.
0DI0001813	As much as I hate to lose a customer, it's just unavoidable sometimes.
0DI0001814	Fuck, no. If I knew where this bitch was, do you think I'd be asking you?
0DI0001815	Still, there's someone who might - old Alice McLafferty, Crimson Caravan, might know something.
0DI0001816	She keeps tabs on caravan traffic in the Mojave, wouldn't put it past her to keep track of Cassidy Caravans and its owner.
0DI0001817	Yes, that's what he wants us to believe. And when we turn our attention to other threats, he'll begin moving against us.
0DI0001818	No, far safer to simply eliminate him and the risk he represents now. Besides, with him gone, New Vegas will truly be ours once the dust settles.
0DI0001819	Any other objections or questions?
0DI0001820	It will be done.
0DI0001821	Caesar's health worsens, and your indecision is unhelpful.
0DI0001822	Let me get to my chair.
0DI0001823	I said, let me get to my chair.
0DI0001824	I suppose you're right. When you're part of something for that long, maybe it's impossible to let go without losing part of yourself.
0DI0001825	Moreno may be a stubborn son of a bitch, but at least he's loyal.
0DI0001826	It's been decades, you know. By now, he's been out of the Enclave longer than he was in.
0DI0001827	Most people know when to hang it up and start over. But not Moreno.
0DI0001828	As screwed up as it sounds, at least she was part of something. Granted, it was something... admittedly, pretty bad, but it was something.
0DI0001829	If you spent the first half of your life flying Enclave troopers in a vertibird, I suppose picking over Pre-War rocket parts doesn't quite compare.
0DI0001830	Not much glory in the Enclave. Most of her old comrades are long gone.
0DI0001831	I know life as a salvager can't compare to being a vertibird pilot but... at least it's life. That has to count for something.
0DI0001832	I wonder if he would. It's pointless, I know, but sometimes I wonder what he wanted me to be.
0DI0001833	Maybe being a doctor in the middle of Nevada wasn't exactly what he had in mind for his little boy.
0DI0001834	I grew up without him. I'll always feel like something is missing from my life. But you're right.
0DI0001835	It's not like I'm the only kid in the wasteland who's grown up without a dad. Johnson always said my father was a good man.
0DI0001836	If that's the only thing about me that's like him, that's enough for me.
0DI0001837	Not everyone dreams of being a revolutionary, I suppose. Maybe we can't all change the world.
0DI0001838	Maybe it's enough just to do good for the short time that we're here. No one's going to sing Doc Henry's praises when he's gone.
0DI0001839	But he's probably saved more lives than I ever will.
0DI0001840	I'm sure Henry has goals. He was just more concerned with the "how" than the "why" of things. Being in the Enclave didn't really mean much to him.
0DI0001841	I guess I'm lucky that I'm part of the Followers. Helping people as a doctor is important, but with the Followers, it feels different.
0DI0001842	It feels like we're working toward something more important. That's more than the sum of good deeds that we do.
0DI0001843	Sometimes I wonder how much of my father they see in me. They went through a lot together, but my family went through it, too.
0DI0001844	I'm glad they've watched out for me all these years. Maybe someday I can return the favor.
0DI0001845	Oh, I know. I was only a boy when they went through hell together. I'm glad you're helping me reunite them.
0DI0001846	Even if I'm still just a spectator in all of this, I know they can still do some good.
0DI0001847	I've been wondering about Daisy and the others for so long, I still haven't figured out what I should do.
0DI0001848	I mean, I'm not like them. I was born at Navarro and my father served with them, but I wasn't really part of the Enclave.
0DI0001849	It seems presumptuous of me to think that I could join the fight, even if this is a cause worth fighting for.
0DI0001850	Because I know when fighting breaks out at the dam, all hell is going to break loose in Freeside. They're going to need every doctor they can get.
0DI0001851	Hold on a second. I need to talk to you about something else.
0DI0001852	It's called an Auto-Doc. As the name suggests, it's an automated physician - more or less.
0DI0001853	It can treat broken bones, cuts, punctures, scrapes. Sometimes I bestow its use upon someone I favor.
0DI0001854	Makes for a powerful gift, in a culture that forbids painkillers and is largely ignorant of medical science.
0DI0001858	Fuck this, I'm going to lie down!
0DI0001859	Come back later - tomorrow!
0DI0001862	[SUCCEEDED] Never this... bad before.
0DI0001863	[FAILED] What's it look like, you asshole?
0DI0001866	[SUCCEEDED] A week, maybe two... it doesn't matter!
0DI0001867	[FAILED] Fuck off.
0DI0001868	Disturb me again and I'll have you killed!
0DI0001869	I get headaches every once in a while. So what? Anyway, we have other matters to discuss.
0DI0001870	I was saying that I'd planned to ask you to forge an alliance with them, but you killed their leaders.
0DI0001871	By the time the White Gloves sort themselves out, the battle for Hoover Dam will have come and gone. So, on to the next matter at hand...
0DI0001872	[SUCCEEDED] I appreciate your concern, but I'm in excellent health. And we have other matters to discuss.
0DI0001873	[FAILED] Only when you're around.
0DI0001874	Hmm...
0DI0001875	Huh... Yeah. Yeah.
0DI0001876	Yeah, the Brotherhood. Them.
0DI0001877	[SUCCEEDED] I don't know... There have been a couple...
0DI0001878	[FAILED] I'm... I'm not sure. What was I saying? That's right, the Brotherhood...
0DI0001879	It's nothing. Just tired, that's all.
0DI0001880	Look for the Brotherhood's bunker around, uh... Hidden Valley. My scouts... saw some things.
0DI0001881	I'm going to bed. We'll talk later.
0DI0001882	[SUCCEEDED] Don't... just leave it alone. I'm fine. Now what was I saying...? Right.
0DI0001883	Take care of the Brotherhood. Maybe then we can have a conversation.
0DI0001884	I said, take care of the Brotherhood. Then we talk - maybe.
0DI0001885	It's never had a functional diagnostic scanning module. Without that, it's useless for surgery.
0DI0001886	[SUCCEEDED] I figured as much.
0DI0001887	Congratulations, you just became my personal physician. Do you have what you need to treat my condition?
0DI0001888	[FAILED] Yeah, it does. So if you can't help me, who can?
0DI0001889	[SUCCEEDED] I'm not familiar with that condition. Is it treatable?
0DI0001890	[FAILED] There's nothing "moderate" about the severity of this. And if you're going to make up names for diseases, come up with good ones.
0DI0001891	If you can't help me, who can?
0DI0001892	[SUCCEEDED] Then gather those items together and hurry back to perform the operation. I don't know how long I've got.
0DI0001893	[FAILED] Then gather the tools you need, and study up on your medical skills.
0DI0001894	When you're confident you can perform the operation, hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
0DI0001895	[SUCCEEDED] Then go find some proper Surgical Tools. The medications from a Doctor's Bag might come in handy, too.
0DI0001896	I'll make sure you're allowed to bring the necessary medications into the camp.  Hurry back. I don't know how long I've got.
0DI0001897	[FAILED] If you think this is funny, you should give crucifixion a try. Now that's hilarious.
0DI0001899	And where is this Arcade?
0DI0001900	I'll have my guards take him captive. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
0DI0001901	All right. Just leave him outside the tent when you return. If he cures my condition, I'll see to it that your reward is several times his value.
0DI0001902	Be on your way, then. And try not to take too long.
0DI0001903	It's been said that Auto-Docs were standard equipment in the underground Vaults where mankind survived when the bombs fell centuries ago.
0DI0001904	You can search the Vaults, but every Auto-Doc my Legion has run across has been stripped for parts long before we found it.
0DI0001905	Some of my scouts did report an abandoned Vault near Nellis Air Force Base. Overrun by ghouls, they said.
0DI0001906	Maybe the infestation has been there long enough to keep scavengers out. Why don't you go and see?
0DI0001908	And what would that be?
0DI0001909	Do that. And try not to take too long.
0DI0001911	For you? I'm not sure I want to be seen dealing with you... but if you're willing to pay a little extra...
0DI0001912	What, Caravan? All right, I'll give it a go. Haven't exactly got much of a line of folks to serve.
0DI0001913	All right, go on - let's put our cards down.
0DI0001914	Not too much, lot of caravans going nowhere. Lot of troopers going nowhere, too.
0DI0001915	Few prospectors here and there, but... they don't do more than stink up the place.
0DI0001916	Everybody's backed up here. You think it'd be good for business, but most of the traders are tight with the caps, even the larger caravan outfits.
0DI0001917	Work around here? Might check with Jackson in the main building. Or Ghost up on the roof above, but watch out, she's... well, she's kind of a bitch.
0DI0001918	Don't tell her I said that, though. Might take a bullet some night when I'm going to the latrine.
0DI0001919	Fine, then.
0DI0001920	Just need something for the log book, keeping tabs on traffic through the Outpost... although mostly just in, not out these days.
0DI0001921	If you're looking for the commanding officer, he's in the back. Although... he's got a lot on his plate, so if you speak with him... keep it short.
0DI0001922	Also, you need any gear checked, we can get you up and running again... once you fill out the work orders, and sign for the parts, of course.
0DI0001923	Reinforcements? About time we got some more hands around here.
0DI0001924	Oh - Knight. You must not be from around here. If so... it doesn't do to get too friendly.
0DI0001925	This isn't the Republic. Oddly enough, Legion's a little more forgiving about... friendships. Out here, it's not as accepted.
0DI0001926	Not that I mind being friends, it's just being open about it in the Outpost... well, I have to work here.
0DI0001927	Now wait a minute - Republic's a sight better than... other alternatives. Women are serving here, after all. The rest... well, might take some time.
0DI0001928	And they're more accepting back West, like I said. In the meantime...
0DI0001929	Wait... wait a minute. Look. Some things in the NCR are... aren't ideal. But I want to help.
0DI0001930	If you need something repaired... let me know, I can sign the work order. As long as caps change hands, I can put them back in yours.
0DI0001931	I... would, perhaps some other time. When my orders take me to Vegas, perhaps. Wish things were different, but might take some time.
0DI0001932	Let me sign off on the work order for you, then.
0DI0001933	Hey, look over there! It's those Mojave rats again, coming to take our water!
0DI0001934	You, over there! Go back where you came from, thieves! Don't try our patience!
0DI0001935	Screw it. Just shoot! They'll get the hint!
0DI0001936	Hurry! We've got to get some before they notice us!
0DI0001937	Oh shit! They saw us. Get out of here, quick!
0DI0001938	Fuck you, NCR thugs! This is our land, and you won't last here forever!
0DI0001939	Sure. Here's what I've got.
0DI0001940	Stay safe.
0DI0001941	Then I bid you "Vale" - until we meet again.
0DI0001942	Nipton was a wicked place, debased and corrupt. It served all comers, so long as they paid.
0DI0001943	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers - or men of the Legion. The people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
0DI0001944	For a pittance, the great Vulpes Inculta inveigled this town to lead those it had sheltered into a trap.
0DI0001945	Only when it was sprung did they realize they were caught inside it, too. I only wish Vulpes had lived to see the scheme come to fruition.
0DI0001946	Yes, and herded them to the center of town. I told them their sins, the foremost being disloyalty.
0DI0001947	I told them that when Legionaries are disloyal, some are punished, the others made to watch. And I announced the lottery.
0DI0001948	Each clutched his ticket, hoping it would set him free. Each did nothing, even when "loved ones" were dragged away to be killed.
0DI0001949	I think your eyes will see more than I could ever tell you. Take your time. Enjoy the sights.
0DI0001950	Why, then, do you keep asking?
0DI0001951	Innocent? Hardly.
0DI0001952	Cowardly, though. They outnumbered us, yet not once did they try to resist.
0DI0001953	They stood and watched as their fellows were butchered, crucified, and burned, one by one.
0DI0001954	They stood and hoped their turn would not come. Each cared only for himself.
0DI0001955	It has a stark beauty, doesn't it? I'm glad you can appreciate it.
0DI0001956	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
0DI0001957	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of you, in due time.
0DI0001958	Now go, and teach the Mojave Outpost what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
0DI0001959	You're unusually bright for a Profligate. Well done.
0DI0001960	Now go, and teach what you've learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
0DI0001962	Now go, and teach them what you learned here. There will be more lessons in the days ahead.
0DI0001963	You bear the Mark of Caesar. That makes you special.
0DI0001964	Do whatever Caesar tells you to do. And whenever the opportunity presents, strike at the Profligates. Pile body upon body.
0DI0001965	Tell everyone you meet of what you saw here. The Legion can handle the rest.
0DI0001966	That said, if you were to strike at the Profligates, butcher them, trouble their operations... this will not go unnoticed.
0DI0001967	Indeed, our hounds demonstrate greater loyalty to each other every day than the wretched inhabitants of this town.
0DI0001968	What can be said? He's a man of towering intellect, the founder of the Legion, conquerer of 86 tribes.
0DI0001969	Caesar is the salvation of mankind, his Legion the rebirth of civilization in a benighted age.
0DI0001970	Don't worry, you'll know him well when you serve him. Or you'll be dead.
0DI0001971	Legatus Lanius, Monster of the East! Quite a man, if man he be.
0DI0001972	Caesar prides himself on selecting the right tool to overcome each new obstacle. In Lanius, he found his hammer.
0DI0001973	He's never been defeated in battle. 14 tribes have laid down arms at his boots. Another five, rendered extinct.
0DI0001974	His latest campaign in the wilds of the Utah has concluded, and he is en route. When he arrives, your doom arrives with him.
0DI0001975	Hey... Look! Someone's coming out of the 38!
0DI0001976	What? are you serious? I've got to see that!
0DI0001977	I thought nobody has ever been inside that place.
0DI0001978	Wow... that's crazy.
0DI0001979	That one must be important around here!
0DI0001980	Check that out! He just left the Lucky 38!
0DI0001981	Check that out! She just left the Lucky 38!
0DI0001982	Damn! And he looks good to me, too.
0DI0001983	Damn! And she looks good to me, too.
0DI0001984	Nothing, man.
0DI0001985	Just hanging out. Same as usual.
0DI0001986	I was thinking of taking a walk a little later.
0DI0001987	I might be going scum-hunting later. You game?
0DI0001988	Nothing. Want to head to the Wrangler later?
0DI0001989	Yeah, sounds cool.
0DI0001990	Nah, I'm gonna be busy.
0DI0001991	Maybe, depends on how my girl's feeling.
0DI0001992	Veronica.
0DI0001993	I hope you've been practicing your drills, Veronica. It's dangerous outside.
0DI0001994	Hmm? Oh, it's you, Veronica.
0DI0001995	Yes, yes.
0DI0001996	Behave yourself this time, Veronica.
0DI0001997	Hey yourself, kiddo.
0DI0001998	Quite well. Thank you for asking, Veronica.
0DI0001999	Y-Yes. Well, it's, ah, nice to see you, too, Veronica.
0DI0002000	Hmph.
0DI0002001	Well, I have been working with some UV lights in the pods.
0DI0002002	Very funny, Veronica.
0DI0002003	Can't complain. Not like there's anywhere else to go, right?
0DI0002004	With everyone getting to go to the surface, I'm a little jealous, but I'll be fine.
0DI0002005	Still hiding that hair of yours, Veronica?
0DI0002006	I'm surprised you're not wearing that hood to hide your hair like you usually do, Veronica.
0DI0002008	Kind of you to say, but there are better people than me around here. I just hope the Followers can make a difference in the long run.
0DI0002009	It isn't enough to mean well if you don't do good. I'm sure Caesar meant well, too.
0DI0002010	If you lose your humanity, then I suppose that is all that's left.
0DI0002011	I know I shouldn't place one life below another, but in Caesar's case, I'll make an exception.
0DI0002012	The whole "slavery and cultural annihilation" stance he's adopted is bit repugnant to me.
0DI0002013	Though I guess what I think never really mattered much to you, did it?
0DI0002014	Victrix causa deis placuit sed victa Catoni.
0DI0002015	Goodbye, courier.
0DI0002016	In the words of Socrates, "Go fornicate yourself."
0DI0002017	At least the mess is ours to clean up.
0DI0002018	Wait a minute... am I going crazy or are you actually suggesting it might not be bad if the Legion takes over?
0DI0002019	It's a good thing to be, but you may want to close the floodgates once you see how Caesar runs things.
0DI0002020	Okay. I just wanted you to confirm that I'm traveling in the company of an insane fascist. Thanks.
0DI0002021	If the NCR is broken, it will fail on its own.
0DI0002022	The people who live here don't deserve to be victims of your misguided attempts at political engineering.
0DI0002023	Or are they just collateral damage?
0DI0002024	What?! Caesar is going to enslave or kill everyone in the Mojave.
0DI0002025	And when that's done, he'll try to destroy the NCR senate and install himself as its new military dictator.
0DI0002026	I can't comprehend how Caesar could so extensively scramble your sense of morality to make you think the Legion is a better alternative to anything.
0DI0002027	And you know what? I'm not going to stick around to try to figure it out. At least legionaries have the excuse of being born into it.
0DI0002028	Have a nice life.
0DI0002029	Great! You're either unimaginably cruel or profoundly insane!
0DI0002030	Either way, I'm not going to wait around for you to help the Legion roll across Hoover Dam. Bye.
0DI0002031	How noble of you.
0DI0002032	Sorry, but I won't be sticking around to see if you have the courtesy to lay flowers on the mass grave that the Legion's going to dig for them.
0DI0002033	Sure, if you're a sociopath.
0DI0002034	Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
0DI0002035	They sure don't, but I hope you get everything that's coming to you.
0DI0002037	If by "sometimes" you mean "a lot of times," I agree. Please, just... settle down, okay?
0DI0002038	That wasn't exactly the response I was hoping for, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
0DI0002039	Seriously, though, watch it.
0DI0002040	If you insist. Have a nice life.
0DI0002041	Because you're helping Caesar's Legion. They are bad. You are bad. I am going. Bye.
0DI0002042	Why are you crazy? That's a question for someone much wiser and more patient than myself.
0DI0002043	All I know is that you are a bad person and I don't want to be around you anymore. So if that was your goal, congratulations.
0DI0002044	If not, I'm sorry to inform you that you are, as the locals say, "nuttier than a Bighorner dropping."
0DI0002045	That was the plan. Bye.
0DI0002046	Good. "In hoc signo taurus vinces."
0DI0002047	Report to Legatus Lanius immediately - he'll brief you on the plan of battle. Come back victorious, or don't come back.
0DI0002048	Then be quick about it.
0DI0002049	It's a travesty, is what it is. Every second we sit on our hands down here is another second that we're not fulfilling our sworn duty.
0DI0002050	It's not that I dislike the Elder, but I strongly disapprove of his current style of leadership. We're safe, yes, but at what cost?
0DI0002051	After lifting the lockdown, the first thing I'd do is send scouts out to recon the area. We need to know what's going on out there.
0DI0002052	Next, I'd resume patrols in the near vicinity, and begin sending search teams out to the spots the scouts reported were relatively safe.
0DI0002053	It's standard procedure when a chapter relocates to an area, but standard procedure wasn't our last Elder's style, either.
0DI0002054	It's a protective measure that was enacted after our defeat at HELIOS. The NCR was hot on our heels, and we wouldn't have survived another encounter.
0DI0002055	It was decided that we would stay quiet for a time, heal the wounded, and try to come up with a new strategy.
0DI0002056	However, after we had fully recuperated, our first scouting measures showed that the NCR's presence in this region had only increased in our absence.
0DI0002057	There are now more than five times the number of NCR troops in the area as when we fought them, and we have half the number we did at HELIOS.
0DI0002058	And so the lockdown has been extended. To go outside would be the death of us all.
0DI0002059	We have some personnel that are allowed to travel on the surface. They trade for what we need, and occasionally drop off what they acquire.
0DI0002060	We make sure that they only enter or leave the bunker while the sandstorm is active, to avoid detection.
0DI0002061	All right. What did you wish to speak about?
0DI0002062	That is this base's defensive system. It serves as camouflage and masks all entry and exit from the bunker.
0DI0002063	We use it to hide our patrols and supply runners, though we still send such out at night to be extra safe.
0DI0002064	We were overrun, plain and simple. My Brothers fought with great courage, but in the end the enemy was just too many.
0DI0002065	When the tide of the battle turned for the worse, our Elder was nowhere to be found, and everything was chaos.
0DI0002066	Fully half of our forces had already fallen. I gathered up those I could find and we fought our way here.
0DI0002067	This place had been briefly discussed as a fallback point, though at the time none really believed that could possibly become necessary.
0DI0002068	That's it, really. There was nothing glorious about the battle, just a nightmare of screams, blood, and death.
0DI0002069	Oh yes, he's been trying for quite some time. Hardin has been strongly opposed to the lockdown from the first. It goes against his nature, you see.
0DI0002070	Hardin's the type to fight to the last, and die rather than surrender. It's a good trait to have in a soldier, and a bad one to have in a leader.
0DI0002071	Don't let his actions bother you. He's only doing what he thinks is best for the chapter.
0DI0002072	Yes, I've always known they were. Luckily, they don't know exactly where we are. And even if they did, our position here is fortified.
0DI0002073	And assuming they managed to breach the bunker, I would be forced to activate our failsafe system.
0DI0002074	Better we all die than allow the technology we have here to fall into such unworthy hands.
0DI0002075	I suppose it was only a matter of time. I wonder if, given the NCR's current situation, they would consider a truce of sorts?
0DI0002076	We've given up our claim to HELIOS, and we don't have any interest in claiming Hoover Dam, so our ambitions are not at crossed purposes.
0DI0002077	Perhaps it's time for a new strategy. Go to the NCR commander and tell her the Brotherhood is willing to put aside our enmity for the time being.
0DI0002078	Further, tell her that we are willing to send troops to aid in their coming defense of the Dam. My guess is they're in no position to refuse.
0DI0002079	Hungry? Thirsty? Horny? The Atomic Wrangler has you covered!
0DI0002080	Wanna get lucky? Head on down to the Atomic Wrangler!
0DI0002081	Make a brief stop at the Atomic Wrangler, where the booze is cheaper, the tables more friendly, and the women are just like the booze!
0DI0002082	Come to Mick and Ralph's for all your shopping needs!
0DI0002083	If it can be bought, it can be found at Mick and Ralph's!
0DI0002084	We've got stuff we're not even allowed to sell, people. Only at Mick and Ralph's!
0DI0002085	Come to the Silver Rush for all your energy weapon needs!
0DI0002086	Lasers, plasma, pistols, grenades - we've got it all at the Silver Rush!
0DI0002087	You want someone dead? Really dead? Stop by the Silver Rush and we'll give you the means!
0DI0002088	HELIOS was the worst goddamned action I've seen in a long, long career of fighting.
0DI0002089	Elijah was a strange one. His even becoming Elder was highly questionable, seeing as how he was a Scribe. Typically, only Paladins are eligible.
0DI0002090	But an exception was made in his case, on account of him being a genius. Unfortunately, whatever scientific acumen he had didn't extend to tactics.
0DI0002091	Trying to defend HELIOS was a blunder of the worst kind, and many brothers lost their lives because of it.
0DI0002092	Many of the senior paladins, myself included, advised him to fight a retreating action, but he refused to budge. Said he almost "had it working".
0DI0002093	We never did find out exactly what he was talking about. When the perimeter was finally overrun, the Elder had simply vanished.
0DI0002100	Outpost, Mojave Outpost. Watching a lot of nothing, feels like a big Brahmin pen for caravans.
0DI0002101	They've been stopped for a while, waiting for the roads North to clear - or their clearance papers to go through.
0DI0002102	Look like you've walked a ways, so if you need to shake the dust off, head to the Barracks, the bar's there. Not much, but better than nothing.
0DI0002103	Those two? Represents unification. Mostly good for shade. Won't do much else when the Legion reaches us.
0DI0002104	Nothing I know of, but if you've come from the North, means you can travel freer than most around here.
0DI0002105	Might check the Barracks, someone might need you to hoof it somewhere. Just be careful if you go up on the roof - got a sniper watching the road.
0DI0002106	If you're gear's in need of repair, HQ's also worth checking out - talk to Major Knight, he can help. Provided you got a pen and plenty of ink.
0DI0002108	You've certainly earned the right, but I'm afraid there's a slight matter of protocol that must be dealt with first.
0DI0002109	Exceptional individuals, like yourself, are sometimes allowed to join the Brotherhood if they perform a valuable service for it.
0DI0002110	While your actions up to this point have been commendable, I'm afraid they don't quite qualify as such a service.
0DI0002111	However, I do have another task that fits the bill rather nicely. Would you consider undertaking it?
0DI0002112	The task I had in mind is still available, if you're up for it.
0DI0002113	As one of our patrols discovered, the mutants just to the northeast have become strangely violent in the years we were secluded.
0DI0002114	However, this turn of events could also be an opportunity. We mostly left the equipment of the communications array there alone, out of respect.
0DI0002115	As the inhabitants have now proven themselves hostile, no more respect will accorded them. Making their equipment fair game.
0DI0002116	I want you to head up to the summit of Black Mountain and install this remote signal transmitter in one of their consoles.
0DI0002117	It will allow us to tap into the radar and other detection systems running there, assuming they're still operational.
0DI0002118	If we're going to operate on the surface again, it would be nice to do so with as much information at our fingertips as possible. Good luck.
0DI0002119	Do not hesitate, my friend. Learn from my mistake and go boldly, one way or the other.
0DI0002120	Regrettable, but understandable. Should you change your mind, return here. I will hold off on assigning the task to my brethren, for now.
0DI0002121	Yes, we've already started receiving telemetry from it. This will be a great help in our future efforts, and I thank you.
0DI0002122	Now then, it is my great honor to bestow upon you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for meritorious service above and beyond the call of duty.
0DI0002123	I'm afraid a formal ceremony was out of the question given our current state, but I hope this will make up for it.
0DI0002124	I had the knights refurbish a suit of our power armor for your use. It's one of the earlier models, but it should serve you well.
0DI0002125	Now, I suppose I'm going to have to show you how to use it, aren't I?
0DI0002126	Would you like to tell me where you learned such a thing?
0DI0002127	No, don't bother. A person as well-traveled as yourself is bound to pick up all kinds of skills, I suppose. Luckily, that's not all I have for you.
0DI0002128	First, let's go over how to put it on...
0DI0002129	If only it were that simple. Think of power armor as a machine to be operated rather than clothing you'd wear.
0DI0002130	With a little instruction, using it becomes as natural as simple movement, but to the ignorant, it's just so much heavy junk.
0DI0002131	So let's bring you up to speed, shall we?
0DI0002132	...There, I think you've got the knack of it now. You should now be able to wear any kind of power armor you come across.
0DI0002133	I've also given the order that all of our equipment be made available to you, not just the more mundane arms.
0DI0002134	You're a member of the Brotherhood now, and your gear should reflect that.
0DI0002135	Lastly, you will be allowed to come and go as you please. You've done so much for us that to do otherwise would be a crime.
0DI0002136	I just ask that you keep the Brotherhood's interests at heart in all your dealings. Remember that you will always have a home here.
0DI0002137	Stop thinking so much. Thanks.
0DI0002138	There are a number of people I'll need to talk to. The process won't be instantaneous, but with this evidence, my path is clear.
0DI0002139	It shouldn't take more than a few days, and then we can begin moving forward again.
0DI0002140	No, your role in this is done. The rest is up to us. There is much for me to do to make the transition as smooth as possible.
0DI0002141	Come back in a few days, and I should be firmly installed as Elder.
0DI0002142	While I can't dispute that you've earned our gratitude, I'm afraid you're going to have to be patient. Such a change takes time.
0DI0002143	Stop back in a few days, and we can speak of this again. Now, I must be off. There is much to do!
0DI0002144	Yes, I thought you might, given how much time you've spent here.
0DI0002145	That's not usually a request we agree to. Typically, we take in the young, so that they might be trained through adolescence.
0DI0002146	In special cases, we allow exceptional individuals to conditionally join. Luckily for you, you happen to be exceptional.
0DI0002147	The condition is that you must complete a task. This task must prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have what it takes to join the Brotherhood.
0DI0002148	I happen to have something perfectly suitable in mind, though I warn you - it won't be easy. Still interested?
0DI0002149	Had second thoughts, did you? We've made some progress since the lockdown was lifted, but the task I had in mind is still available if you want it.
0DI0002150	Back when we were stationed at HELIOS, our scouts reported that a group was establishing itself in the area as a distributor of Pre-War weapons.
0DI0002151	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, was too concerned with getting HELIOS running and fending off the NCR, so he ordered us to leave them alone.
0DI0002152	It's time that we correct that oversight, and show this region that the Brotherhood is still a force to be reckoned with.
0DI0002153	I want you to visit these weapons dealers, this Van Graff family, and make an example of them. Leave no one alive.
0DI0002154	When the job is done, report back and I'll arrange for a team to clean up the site and retrieve the weapons.
0DI0002155	Is that a waver of resolve I sense? The Brotherhood is not in the habit of taking on the timid.
0DI0002156	Hmph, I thought you were made of sterner stuff than that. The Brotherhood could use someone with your skills.
0DI0002157	In any case, was there something else you wanted?
0DI0002158	Now you're just wasting my time. When you make up your mind, let me know.
0DI0002159	Well done. This is a small step in the right direction, but it's damn good to move forward again. Now, I believe congratulations are in order.
0DI0002160	It is my honor to bestow up on you the title of Paladin of the Brotherhood, for your meritorious service in its name.
0DI0002161	Normally, there'd be a ceremony and such, but everyone is too busy at the moment for such frivolity.
0DI0002162	I can give you this, however. Your very own suit of power armor. We can't spare our best, but I had the knights assemble this one for your use.
0DI0002163	Which reminds me, you don't even know how to use these, do you?
0DI0002164	Predecessor's records indicate matching item purchased by nervous man wearing metal collar.
0DI0002165	Records indicate man requested free lodging and was directed to concrete building in Freeside. Transmitting coordinates.
0DI0002166	...There, I think you've got the hang of it now. You should be able to use any type of power armor you come across using what you just learned.
0DI0002167	Very well, then. In addition to the armor, I've given the order that all of our arms and equipment be made available for your purchase.
0DI0002168	Finally, while you are now a member of the Brotherhood, I cannot ask any more of you. I'm sure you have goals of your own outside these walls.
0DI0002169	You are free to come and go as you please, though I hope you'll return to us someday in a more permanent capacity.
0DI0002170	I wish you the best, outsid- Brother.
0DI0002171	Hmm... I'm starting to remember hearing some rumors about you and this crazy guy called "Caesar." Bad. Not a friend of the Followers.
0DI0002172	Maybe they're not all true. That's enough for me to stand here and talk to you, but I'm not about to leave Freeside as your comrade-in-arms.
0DI0002173	You've helped the Followers, so you can't be entirely bad. To be honest, I haven't heard anyone say a negative word about you.
0DI0002174	As long as you keep working to help people around here get a fair shake, sure, I'll lend a hand.
0DI0002175	You helped the Followers, but your reputation isn't exactly spotless. How do I know you're not going to lose it out there?
0DI0002176	Here's my proposition. If you want to work together to help the people around here, I'll lend a hand. If you start acting like a crazy waster...
0DI0002177	Look, the Followers have had enough of a role in the misery that this area has had to endure.
0DI0002178	If you want to go off half-cocked and leave a trail of corpses in your wake, that's your business. We'll do our best to clean up your mess.
0DI0002179	Just don't try to drag us into it personally, okay?
0DI0002181	The last time we discussed this, you didn't exactly wow me with your pitch. What have you got for me this time?
0DI0002182	That's one way to look at it.
0DI0002183	I thought my charm could win you over, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. Are you sure you want me to go?
0DI0002184	All right, I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
0DI0002185	Ugh. I guess that means I have to go back to that creepy mausoleum Mr. House calls the Lucky 38.
0DI0002186	I've been around a few unsettling places in my life, but that place takes the cake.
0DI0002187	Anyway, if you need me, you know where to find me.
0DI0002188	Back to the tomb, I suppose.
0DI0002189	If you need me, et cetera.
0DI0002190	It just seems a little twitchy. Some of these robots, you look at them the wrong way, don't screw in a vacuum tube right...
0DI0002191	The next thing you know you're a pile of ash on the floor and someone's stepping out of a vertibird to sweep your remains into a Nuka-Cola bottle.
0DI0002192	Fine, ignore me. Just don't ask me to re-attach your arm when your pet murder machine goes into "search and destroy" mode.
0DI0002193	It's... a thing. A science thing. It hurts robots. Don't worry about it. Silly Arcade's just telling magnetic field jokes for his own amusement.
0DI0002194	Ahem. Shall we?
0DI0002195	Does it? Does it?
0DI0002196	Safety first. That's all I'm saying.
0DI0002197	Only to obfuscate my past association with a fascist paramilitary organization.
0DI0002198	I'm joking, of course. I will deflect personal questions at any opportunity.
0DI0002199	Honestly, it isn't too difficult if you have half a brain and aren't a complete jerk. I wanted to help people and I enjoyed learning, so I signed up.
0DI0002200	New Vegas is in trouble, so I came out here. If someone doesn't step up and try to help the people here, it's going to end very badly.
0DI0002201	The Followers taught me everything I know about medicine. Despite our humble abode here in New Vegas, we have great facilities back in the NCR.
0DI0002202	We may have over extended ourselves by setting up camp in Freeside, but the people here need help from someone. If not us, who?
0DI0002203	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as King Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
0DI0002204	Don't mind if I do. Enjoy your reign as Queen Scumbag the First, Overlord of Westside.
0DI0002205	Any day now, Caesar's going to try to march across Hoover Dam and kick NCR out of the Mojave.
0DI0002206	We're getting caught up in something important out here. Hell, after how you handled Benny, you're practically right in the middle of all this.
0DI0002207	I know I'm just along for the ride, but it's made me think about the past, how I might be able to help out.
0DI0002208	Actually, I'm going to keep talking anyway. Sorry, but I really need to get this out.
0DI0002209	I wasn't always with the Followers, or with the NCR.
0DI0002210	My late father was an officer in a group called the Enclave, a remnant of America's Pre-War government.
0DI0002211	Memories being short around here, not a whole lot of people remember them. But they did bad things. Terrorized communities, kidnapped people.
0DI0002212	Eventually, someone stopped them. I was born a few years later at a military base on the coast, a place called Navarro.
0DI0002213	Are you sure? I didn't even get to the ostensibly "good" part.
0DI0002214	If you're sure, I won't bring it up again. We can just go on our merry way, fighting injustice in our typical fashion.
0DI0002215	Okay, I hear you. Forget I said anything. Consider it dropped.
0DI0002216	A lot of different places. I only know what I was told. Some of them were cut down by the NCR and the Brotherhood. Some of them went east.
0DI0002217	My mother never told me what happened to my father, but she and I went south with some others and integrated into the NCR.
0DI0002218	When the NCR learned that Enclave personnel had integrated, we kept moving to the fringes. It's one of the reasons why I wound up out here.
0DI0002219	After the Enclave's command structure fell apart, it was only a matter of time before Navarro was overrun by NCR forces.
0DI0002220	My mother and I left with some of the troopers from my father's old unit, the same people I've kept in contact with over the years.
0DI0002221	Anyone who didn't get out was killed by the NCR. Even some of the ones who escaped were eventually hunted down by the Brotherhood of Steel.
0DI0002222	The Enclave did a lot of bad things, but there were good people at Navarro. Good people with a lot of experience.
0DI0002223	Not many of them are alive anymore, but I think they could make a difference in the fight against Caesar.
0DI0002224	That's a hard question to answer. I know I don't want the Legion to take Hoover Dam.
0DI0002225	So militarily, yes, I want them to help NCR. If possible, I'd like to figure out a way to help the NCR win Hoover Dam without holding New Vegas.
0DI0002226	Great! I'd like you to talk to the old-timers, the Remnants. I don't think I can convince them by myself. To them, I'm still a kid.
0DI0002227	But you're a big part of what's happening out here. When you talk to them, they'll understand how important this all is.
0DI0002228	I've kept in contact with them over the years, so I know where you can find them, but I doubt they'll open up to you unless I come along.
0DI0002229	I know I'm not always the most serious guy around, but this means a lot to me. Thanks.
0DI0002230	Oh. After spilling my guts to you, I wasn't expecting that kind of a response but... I understand.
0DI0002231	If you change your mind, let me know. It would mean a lot to me.
0DI0002232	What did you have in mind?
0DI0002233	Do you now? If I didn't already owe you a great deal I'd be highly suspicious right now. You'll have to tell me about it sometime.
0DI0002234	Here, I'll show you. It's easy, once you get used to it. First, we'll start with putting it on...
0DI0002235	Not even close. Power armor isn't something you wear so much as use. It's a weapon in its own right, and takes skill to wield.
0DI0002236	If you don't know what you're doing, you won't even be able to walk with it on. So how about a bit of quick instruction?
0DI0002237	Standard practice. Rangers operate on our own most of the time. And that's how we like it.
0DI0002238	Usually we call in our positions to McCarran to be relayed to other rangers, but I can handle myself.
0DI0002239	I'm sure as hell not going to lose any sleep on account of a goddamn broken down radio. But it will shorten my stay if I can't fix it.
0DI0002240	Criminal scum that've infested this region, attacking caravans and regular folk just passing through.
0DI0002241	The dangerous ones are roamers, though there's another group that mostly stays put, over at the prison southwest of here.
0DI0002242	The NCR mounted an attack not long ago but they just used regular troops - no rangers - so that didn't amount to anything.
0DI0002245	So far the brass haven't mustered up enough men to take the prison back. Long overdue if you ask me. But I'm just one man.
0DI0002248	Or so they did, 'til NCR brass finally mustered up enough troops to take out the trash. Wish I could've been there.
0DI0002249	That is sad news, indeed, and I thank you for making your way here to convey it to us, but now the issue remains that an outsider knows our location.
0DI0002250	I'm afraid that's not a possibility at the moment. Let's just say that your eventual safe departure from here relies on how forthcoming you are.
0DI0002251	That said, I'd like you to tell me why you're here.
0DI0002252	I applaud your commitment to your own word, though it saddens me to hear of the fate of our comrades.
0DI0002253	Accident or no, we both now find ourselves in an uncomfortable situation.
0DI0002254	Hey, what are you doing to my radio?
0DI0002255	You just had to go messing with my radio again, didn't you?
0DI0002256	Where do you come from that you haven't heard of the NCR? Nevermind, it doesn't matter much.
0DI0002257	If you haven't heard of us, you must not be from the Legion. Put simply, the NCR is the greatest nation currently functioning.
0DI0002258	Sure can. The NCR was founded from the survivors of one of the great Vaults. We started as a small settlement called Shady Sands.
0DI0002259	We now consist of 5 states, that make up the greatest nation since the Great War.
0DI0002260	Caesar's Legion.
0DI0002261	A bunch of degenerate slavers, led by a madman who calls himself Caesar. Every one of them is a barbarian to the last.
0DI0002262	I've even heard one of their leaders, the Legate or something, goes around with a human skull on his head. Savages to the last.
0DI0002263	It is no secret. Our interest here is two fold.
0DI0002264	First, we want to remain in control of Hoover Dam. It supplies the Republic with power, and is a source of fresh water.
0DI0002265	Second, we want to prevent the Legion from advancing across the Colorado River and endangering the home states.
0DI0002266	Pulling bullets out of a vengeance-crazed drifter is truly a noble step up from tending to the downtrodden of Freeside, but I think I'll pass.
0DI0002267	The NCR had a chance to use the Followers' skills before, but being imperialists mattered more to them. No thanks.
0DI0002268	That's funny. Mr. House doesn't want to keep New Vegas independent. He just wants to keep the NCR and Caesar's Legion from pushing him around.
0DI0002269	He must be pretty convincing if he's roped you into helping him, but you can count me out.
0DI0002270	If that's really what you're trying to do, I'll go with you.
0DI0002271	Things are hectic around here, but it won't mean anything if NCR or the Legion take control. I'm sure the Followers can manage without me.
0DI0002272	Just don't try to help the Legion, and we shouldn't have any problems. Sound good?
0DI0002273	Only because everyone would be conscripted or enslaved. And the people who are unfit for military service or slavery would be put down. Swell plan.
0DI0002274	Yes, a veritable Pax Romana for post-nuclear America. My political beliefs are a bit more progressive than outright fascism, so I'll pass. Thanks.
0DI0002275	Hmm. That seems appropriately resolute and yet vague. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and go with you, but let me be clear about something.
0DI0002276	If you plan to help Caesar's Legion, this is going to be a brief relationship.
0DI0002277	I may not have all the answers for how to fix Freeside's problems, but Caesar taking control isn't part of the solution. Fair?
0DI0002278	Hmm. Wow. You sound like you really do need some help. Look, I can help you out, but you can't do anything stu-
0DI0002279	I mean, you can't... help bad people, who want to hurt the locals in Freeside. If you do, I'll leave. Does that make sense?
0DI0002280	Yes. The Followers do not like Caesar or Caesar's Legion. You should also not like them. If you do, you like hurting people and that is bad. Goodbye.
0DI0002281	Uh... probably not. Until things settle down around here, alleviating my boredom isn't a good motive to leave. Sorry.
0DI0002282	All right. Let's not waste any time. There are people out there to help, things to learn. Maybe not in that order, but let's get to it.
0DI0002283	I'm not sure why you thought a Follower would want to help Caesar after all of the misery he's visited on us and the people we try to help.
0DI0002284	Well, good luck to you in your future endeavors, assuming they don't involve Caesar.
0DI0002285	Overt flirtation will get you everywhere, you know.
0DI0002286	On a slightly more serious note, if you're interested in helping out with the troubles plaguing Freeside, I can come with you.
0DI0002287	Just don't do anything obnoxious, like trying to help Caesar's Legion, and we should be fine. Understood?
0DI0002288	Plasma rifles. They were intended to replace the P94 plasma caster.
0DI0002289	There was some corporate espionage going on between Poseidon Energy's Project SEMELE and whatever was going on here.
0DI0002290	REPCONN went through some rough times. When their rocket business was shaky, Mr. House purchased the company.
0DI0002291	It didn't take long for him to repurpose their plasma technology for a government weapon contract.
0DI0002292	Another one of Poseidon Energy's many secret weapons projects. Before the Great War. It didn't go anywhere.
0DI0002293	That's how REPCONN got their shot. So to speak.
0DI0002294	Me, specifically? No. I'm sure Julie Farkas does, though. Lab coat, pointy hair. Answers to the name "Julie Farkas," strangely enough.
0DI0002295	I'm sure she can find something for you to do. It might be kind of... depressing and terrible, though. Caveat Samaritanus.
0DI0002296	Personally, no. But thanks to you, Julie says we're a lot better off these days. I'll take her word for it. So, thanks.
0DI0002297	See you around.
0DI0002298	Well I don't. I'm sure there were a few people turning a blind eye, but can you blame them?
0DI0002299	NCR's sharecropper farms had all of the water. The nearest fresh source is the lake, and that's a bit of a hike.
0DI0002300	I do say so. The Followers aren't a military organization. If anyone knew what he was up to, they weren't talking.
0DI0002301	And if they knew he was stealing water, so what? Westside has more of a right to that water than the NCR.
0DI0002303	Neither did Anderson.
0DI0002304	I guess that means you don't have to apologize to all of the people in Westside you just screwed over.
0DI0002305	In case you weren't paying attention, you killed the only person who ever gave a damn about them.
0DI0002306	Fantastic. Now the only influential person who gave a damn about Westside is gone. Great job.
0DI0002307	In case I'm not laying down enough sarcasm, you just screwed up the lives of a bunch of struggling people.
0DI0002308	Huh. Good question. Must have been in a book.
0DI0002309	Uh, what does anyone know about them? Big... flying machines, right? Crazy helicopters. So weird.
0DI0002310	Yes, I know the loss of the patrols has weighed heavily on his mind for some time. He took it very personally when they first went missing.
0DI0002311	That was when I first began to seriously question his ability to lead us. A commander has to be able to deal with the potential loss of his men.
0DI0002312	It's strange that he would ask you to find mission discs on them, however. The missing paladins were all on standard patrols, which don't need them.
0DI0002313	Only Brothers sent on special assignments are given mission discs. If you should find any on the lost patrols, let me know.
0DI0002314	That's a sensible notion. Your familiarity with the nearby terrain makes you perfect as a liason.
0DI0002315	I've been trying to get the Elder to send out scouts for years, and he's always been resistant to the idea. Said they'd be a vulnerability.
0DI0002316	I wonder what changed his mind.
0DI0002317	The filtration system? He wouldn't have you looking if we didn't need those parts badly, which means that system's in real trouble.
0DI0002318	If the air filters go, it will become impossible to breathe down here. We'd be forced to evacuate the bunker!
0DI0002319	I can't believe he's kept something like this to himself! We should have every able-bodied person in the chapter working on this.
0DI0002320	All the more reason for you to find a way to get McNamara out of that chair, before he dooms us all.
0DI0002321	If you must.
0DI0002322	Just as I thought, McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me. The nerve of that man!
0DI0002323	This little stunt is probably what got them killed in the first place. Our normal patrol routes are known to be relatively safe.
0DI0002324	This is exactly what I've been looking for! McNamara gave my men new orders without telling me, thereby breaking the Chain That Binds!
0DI0002325	With this, I can finally have him removed as Elder, and end this ridiculous lockdown.
0DI0002326	This is exactly the kind of thing I'm trying to avoid by ousting McNamara.
0DI0002327	I could hardly call myself Head Paladin if I didn't. It's one of the first things every initiate learns when they start training. What about it?
0DI0002328	I could be wrong, but I think that's a dead end. McNamara's always followed orders, and we've been incommunicado since fleeing HELIOS.
0DI0002329	Second part? What are you talking about?
0DI0002330	Then that means I can cast McNamara down for giving those secret orders to my Paladins! Well done! That's exactly what I was looking for!
0DI0002331	That is the standard procedure, yes. For example, McNamara gives orders to Head Scribe Taggart, who then relays further orders to the scribes.
0DI0002332	I wasn't aware that failing to do so was punishable, however. Interesting...
0DI0002333	If we can just find an instance where McNamara went around someone and gave orders to their subordinates, we'll have him.
0DI0002334	...So now I'm going to have your death on my conscience, too. Great.
0DI0002335	You think you're the first person the Elder's trusted with this? He sent three of our patrols out looking for those components, and they're all dead.
0DI0002336	I was the one who supplied the Elder with the location of possible sites where we could find the components, so their deaths are my fault.
0DI0002337	And now it's your turn. Well, don't say you weren't warned. I won't take the blame when you die horribly. But I can tell you're getting impatient.
0DI0002338	No, I heard you quite clearly. You're being sent off to be killed like the others.
0DI0002339	The items I'll need to keep the system running are a differential pressure controller, a reverse pulse cleaner, and several  HEPA cartridge filters.
0DI0002340	At present, my best guess for finding the items would be to search any of the old vaults in the area.
0DI0002341	Those vaults were usually built much like these military bunkers, even using the same contractors in their constructions at times.
0DI0002342	I'll mark the vaults' locations on your map. Best of luck to you.
0DI0002343	Really? I mean, that's great! I knew you could do it all along. I'll get right to work installing these.
0DI0002344	Why don't you go tell the Elder the good news. I'm sure it'll be a huge load off of his shoulders.
0DI0002345	It's amazing that you've found any of them and not gotten gruesomely mangled. Keep up the good work!
0DI0002346	I don't want to rush you or anything, but time is of the essence. Please try to find those components as soon as you can.
0DI0002347	Sure, what about?
0DI0002348	You're a strange one, aren'tcha? Fine, what did you want to talk about?
0DI0002349	A Brotherhood base? Here? Are you shitting me? No one's seen them for years.
0DI0002350	I don't suppose you've got a scrap of evidence to support this wild-eyed claim of yours?
0DI0002351	I'll be. Let me take a look at that.
0DI0002352	All this is, is a slave collar. Seen plenty of these infernal contraptions in my day, and I know just how to spring 'em. Hold still.
0DI0002353	There, it's off. Now thing is, a slave collar seems a little too basic for the Brotherhood.
0DI0002354	That's not to say I don't believe you, bu- did you just hear something?
0DI0002358	That's not to say I don't believe you, just that maybe you got your facts mixed up a little. Let's head back to my camp and go over what you saw.
0DI0002359	I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you decided to just start tinkering with it? Let me see that.
0DI0002360	[SUCCEEDED] I've been trying to get that damn thing working for days, and you think you fixed it in a few minutes? Let me see that.
0DI0002361	[FAILED] The hell you did. I know enough about electronics to know that what you were doing wasn't fixing it.
0DI0002362	So I'll give you one more chance to tell me what you were doing.
0DI0002363	Okay, but if I find you messing with it again, there'll be hell to pay, you hear me?
0DI0002364	Didn't look like nothing to me. Draw!
0DI0002365	Just kidding. You weren't doing any harm that I could see. So what do you think? Can it be fixed?
0DI0002367	Well, at least you're man enough to admit it. Now get the hell out of here. If I see you again, it'll be through my rifle's sight.
0DI0002368	Oh? And in your expert opinion, why would that be?
0DI0002369	[SUCCEEDED] You've seen that with your own two eyes?
0DI0002370	Goddamn, I knew Cooke's gang passed through these parts 'bout that frequently, but I didn't know they holed up here.
0DI0002371	Be a rude awakening, to find fifteen of those merciless bastards looking down at me snoozing on my bedroll!
0DI0002372	Yep, I'd be better off setting up an ambush along one of their routes to catch stragglers. Thanks for the information. You may've saved my life.
0DI0002373	[FAILED] See now, thing is, I fancy myself a bit of a tracker. And I don't see much in the way of tracks 'round here.
0DI0002374	Could say that's on account of the dust storms. But if there were criminals using these bunkers as hideouts, I'd know.
0DI0002375	I see. Well, I'll take that under advisement.
0DI0002376	Now why would I do that? You see some powder gangers on the approach or something?
0DI0002377	The desert can play tricks on a man's mind. Don't let it bother you overmuch.
0DI0002378	What? Let me see that.
0DI0002379	What? That's great. I'll have to check it out when I head back tonight.
0DI0002380	Well, you'd have to get a senior-level member of the chapter to unlock a topic for you. I've given you access to what I can, but that's not much.
0DI0002381	The majority of topics fall under Ramos's aegis, since they'd constitute a security risk. Good luck getting anything out of him.
0DI0002382	You might have better luck with another member of the senior staff. Try talking to them about it.
0DI0002383	Yes, you exploited his fear of Powder Gangers very effectively. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
0DI0002384	He'll keep his distance, setting ambushes, never suspecting that these bunkers house something far more dangerous to him than criminals. Well-played.
0DI0002385	I see. And he's not particularly likely to come back, since he's learned that the bunkers here aren't secure enough to serve as safehouses.
0DI0002386	It's not a foolproof solution, but indirect methods rarely are. What matters is that you drove him off without alerting him to our presence.
0DI0002387	I would like you to find the components we need to fix this bunker's air filtration system. I cannot overstate the importance of this task.
0DI0002388	See Senior Knight Lorenzo for the details. He's the one who brought the matter to my attention, and the only other person who is aware of it.
0DI0002389	The device that creates the sandstorms above, that masks our comings and goings, was only intended to be used in case of emergencies.
0DI0002390	It was never meant to be used with any regularity, and the other systems here were not designed to accommodate such usage.
0DI0002391	In particular, the air filtration system simply cannot handle the quantity of sand and grit that it's been forced to cope with these last few years.
0DI0002392	As a result, the system is failing, albeit slowly. I'm told we have scant few months before it shuts down completely.
0DI0002393	Should that happen, it will quickly become impossible to breathe here in the bunker. Already the air quality begins to slightly worsen.
0DI0002394	That's an old, old principle that's been around since the Brotherhood was founded. It basically means that you have to obey a superior officer.
0DI0002395	It's pretty much common sense, but it gets invoked a lot when people get pissy about following orders.
0DI0002396	If you're curious, I'll give you access to the datastore entry on it. You'd probably be the first to read it in years, if not decades.
0DI0002397	That elevator is nowhere, baby. Step over to the mic.
0DI0002398	I don't know what they're up to and I don't want to know. I just hope no harm comes to Novac.
0DI0002399	Not much to live off of around here, except salvage from that factory. If they made off with anything expensive, we'd be hurting something fierce.
0DI0002400	But I will say this. If all of 'em turned up dead tomorrow, I couldn't see as to how they'd be missed.
0DI0002401	That might even be a desirable thing, knowing the town was safe from the likes of them. There'd be a reward in it if some brave soul made it happen.
0DI0002402	Whatever suits you.
0DI0002403	Yeah, go on.
0DI0002404	Wow, this is our first hot streak since we opened this place back up! Here's a little something, on the house.
0DI0002405	You're doing great! Keep on spending money, hopefully we'll get some extra action in here.
0DI0002406	You're the luckiest player I've ever seen. Keep up the good work in here.
0DI0002407	I'm sorry, you've done so much good stuff for us here in Primm, but we just can't afford to lose any more money to you.
0DI0002408	I can't let you play here anymore.
0DI0002409	This concludes our firing test of the ARCHIMEDES I and II laser systems. Thank you for observing Poseidon Energy safety protocol. Have a nice day.
0DI0002410	ARCHIMEDES II orbital laser bombardment will commence in T-minus 5... 4... 3... 2... 1.
0DI0002411	Warning. Retargeting sequence initiated for HELIOS One reflector banks.
0DI0002412	The ARCHIMEDES laser systems will automatically initiate test fire upon completion.
0DI0002413	Attention. ARCHIMEDES I Laser is now armed. Move all personnel to minimum safe distance before initiating test fire.
0DI0002414	He's here? Bless you, I thought he was a goner for sure.
0DI0002415	Listen, you do what you gotta do to find him. I'd send my men with you but I'm worried they'd kill Ted if we got close.
0DI0002416	Reckon you might need one of these. Take it. Just don't wave it around here where they might take it from you.
0DI0002417	Confound it. I knew I shoulda stayed with him. Ted, I'm so sorry, boy.
0DI0002418	I demand to know who did this!
0DI0002419	Well I reckon he could be a sheriff if you have the skills to reprogram him.
0DI0002420	Well I guess I never thought of that. I guess he could be sheriff, if you think he could be reprogrammed for it.
0DI0002421	Yeah, that sounds alright to me. I bet we can find someone to do his work for that much. Tell him to get going.
0DI0002422	Caesar's death is regrettable, but we can't let it stand in the way of the Legion's goals.
0DI0002423	Our scouts have reported that the NCR's President Kimball will be visiting the Dam. This is an excellent opportunity to assassinate him.
0DI0002424	You are to meet with Cato Hostilius - he'll have more information on ways to eliminate Kimball.
0DI0002425	Yes, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
0DI0002428	We'll see about that. In any case, we can't let Caesar's death get in the way of the Legion's goals.
0DI0002432	Hey, you're the one who's been going around helping people around here, right? The King says to keep up the good work, and said to give you this.
0DI0002433	You're starting to get quite the reputation around here, aren't you? Don't get me wrong, I'm not passing judgement or anything.
0DI0002434	The fine proprietors of Mick & Ralph's appreciate that kind of attitude, and would like to offer you a discount on their fine wares.
0DI0002435	Just as long as you keep making waves, that is. Be seeing you.
0DI0002436	Give me all of your ca- whoa, I'm sorry. I-I didn't know it was you. Please don't hurt me. I've got a wife! And kids! And pets and stuff!
0DI0002437	Smooth and easy, just the way I like it. Don't worry, they'll be as safe as kittens till you're ready to leave.
0DI0002438	Oh, and a friendly word of advice: if you happen to "stumble across" any weapons during your stay here, well... just don't wear them openly. You dig?
0DI0002439	Now that we got that little business out of the way, what can I do to make your Tops experience the tops?
0DI0002440	Pleasure doing business with you.
0DI0002441	The Courier, fair and even-handed in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
0DI0002442	She was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
0DI0002443	Though the Courier's agenda was a mystery to many, she was honored by NCR for her support of the military at Hoover Dam.
0DI0002445	With brutal methods that few in NCR would approve of, it was the Courier who secured NCR's victory at Hoover Dam.
0DI0002446	Despite her extreme actions, she was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
0DI0002447	Though the Courier herself was just and forthright in her dealings throughout the Wasteland, she helped the Legion achieve victory.
0DI0002448	Caesar honored her with a golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
0DI0002449	The Courier, a mercenary at heart, helped the Legion achieve victory at Hoover Dam.
0DI0002451	The Legion marched over the Hoover Dam with the help of one who was as brutal and merciless as the worst of them: The Courier.
0DI0002452	Caesar honored her with a  golden coin, minted in celebration of her contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
0DI0002453	The Courier, fair and kind-hearted to those in the Wasteland, ensured that Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable and secure for future generations.
0DI0002454	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, both out of gratitude and a quiet pride in his choice of lieutenants.
0DI0002455	The Courier, who had a mixed history in the Wasteland, kept the status quo at Hoover Dam.
0DI0002456	Mr. House kept New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations, and afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
0DI0002457	The Courier, cruel and merciless, had ensured that Mr. House would maintain complete control over New Vegas and everyone in it.
0DI0002458	Mr. House afforded her every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, mostly as a reward, but partly out of fear.
0DI0002459	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
0DI0002460	She ensured that Mr. House's tyranny was broken and that neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
0DI0002461	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
0DI0002462	She had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
0DI0002463	Supporting all of the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
0DI0002464	She ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
0DI0002465	The last person stupid enough to follow me down this alley. Get this fool, boys!
0DI0002466	Nah, just some idiot that wandered down the wrong alley. Sound familiar?
0DI0002467	What's your rush? The boys and I here want to get to know you better.
0DI0002468	Get him!
0DI0002469	Get her!
0DI0002470	Don't think everyone around here is going to tolerate your actions, outsider. A few of us have a mind to put you down like the animal you are.
0DI0002471	If I or one of the others hears that you're topside, we might just come out and have a little chat.
0DI0002472	You may have questionable methods, outsider, but some of us realize you get the job done.
0DI0002473	We've talked Torres into giving you access to gear for a little cheaper, to help out with your travels. Hope it helps!
0DI0002474	There you are! A few of us wanted to thank you for being such a good friend to the Brotherhood, so we've set aside some of our recycled energy cells.
0DI0002475	We'll leave a few of them in that footlocker in the corner every so often. The Paladins scoff at using recycled ammo, so no one should mind.
0DI0002476	Well, ain't we all, right? That was a long time ago. I don't pay it much mind anymore.
0DI0002477	Yep. He sure did. Wanted himself a hotel, and to make sure once he made the change there'd never be any going back.
0DI0002478	We didn't get a say. Don't know how you'd argue with a fella like that anyways, everywhere and nowhere all at once.
0DI0002479	So just like that, we was all homeless. Went our separate ways, and that was all she wrote.
0DI0002480	Eventually we made our way out here. But uh...
0DI0002481	Well, when folks spend their lives in isolation, sometimes that ain't the best of things for learning to fight off germs.
0DI0002482	We was going to California, but Goodsprings was as far as we got. After she passed, wasn't no reason to keep going.
0DI0002483	I stayed so I could keep close to her.
0DI0002484	What'd you have in mind?
0DI0002485	Waited too long to finish this, last loose end, all wrapped up.
0DI0002486	Really. We'll see about that.
0DI0002487	You know what, I think you mean that. All right... maybe...
0DI0002488	Dead? What... by you? Yeah, I can tell, you had something to do with it.
0DI0002489	Gloria was right about you. You take care of business before it's a problem.
0DI0002490	Really. NCR all around her.
0DI0002491	Well, tell you what. You find a way to bring her here. She'll want to hear what I have to say.
0DI0002492	What? You two on the outs? Ain't that a shame.
0DI0002493	Guess you misheard me - I wasn't asking you a question. Find a way to get her here.
0DI0002494	If you can't bring her here, then make sure she never leaves the Outpost, and that's fine with me.
0DI0002498	I had nothing to do with that, and neither did anyone here. Now where would you have gotten an idea like that?
0DI0002499	I got business here, need to watch the shop, make sure things are running - smoothly.
0DI0002500	Besides, if I came for the girl, I'm not all friendly and charming like you are. She might get the wrong idea.
0DI0002501	You don't want us chatting, trust me. As for the girl - I just want to talk to her.
0DI0002502	And if you can't bring her here, you're no use to me - or Gloria. So if you want to cause trouble in here over nothing, then go on - try.
0DI0002503	If your answer isn't "yes, I'll bring her here" or "no, I won't, cause Gloria had me pegged wrong," then we're done here.
0DI0002504	So, looks like we have us a thief. All right, guess I'm talking to you instead of the girl.
0DI0002505	And after all the trouble I went through to kill all those witnesses. Guess now I have one more than I thought.
0DI0002506	"Nowhere's" a strange place to get an idea like that.
0DI0002507	You know what, you're new. Gloria's not going to miss you. And I'm not going to risk you saying the same thing to that bitch I'm hunting for.
0DI0002508	Guess Gloria was wrong about you, then. Get out of here, you're no use to me.
0DI0002509	Good, getting tired of questions from you when I should be getting answers. Bring her here.
0DI0002510	Tabitha! You naughty, naughty girl! Leo remembers what you did!
0DI0002511	Tabitha was grandma's squad leader when we both worked for the Master. She wasn't very nice at all, but she was good at the chopping.
0DI0002512	Almost as good as Leo....
0DI0002513	Indeed I do good sir, and I would be thrilled to share that information with you as soon as I am released from captivity.
0DI0002514	My good lady, I believe I may have some information that would prove useful.
0DI0002515	If you would just untie my hands I'd be more than happy to share what information I have with you.
0DI0002516	I'm in quite a state here. If you help me with my bonds I'll be more than happy to tell you anything, and everything about those Khans.
0DI0002517	Ahh yes, my memory is much clearer now that I am free from my bondage.
0DI0002518	I was sku... er, performing recon, gathering information on some of the Powder Gangers, when some great Khans arrived with your friend in the suit.
0DI0002519	They were talking about some delivery they took from a courier, I assume that was you.
0DI0002520	They said they'd be heading through Nipton to Novac to meet a contact there.
0DI0002521	I overheard them saying that they are on their way to Novac. If you want to follow them I strongly suggest that you follow the road through Nipton.
0DI0002522	There are a lot of dangerous things out in the desert, and you won't have me with you to protect you, as I need to stay here and keep Primm safe.
0DI0002523	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you look to be the trustworthy sort. Okay, I'll tell you what I know.
0DI0002524	[FAILED] I'm sure you mean well, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait until I'm in a calmer emotional state before my memory is going to function.
0DI0002525	Oh, you know. Finding alternative treatments for common illnesses and injuries. Stimpaks out of barrel cacti and other fantastic improbabilities.
0DI0002526	As far as fruitless wastes of time go, it's quite noble in its aims.
0DI0002527	Not all Followers are "people persons." Besides, someone needs to do research. I have no problem with Julie sticking me back here.
0DI0002528	Out of sight, out of mind. There are worse things one can be, though I do admit, it is a bit boring.
0DI0002529	Though it has a noble goal, I don't think this research will yield much fruit. No pun intended.
0DI0002530	Like I said before, not all Followers are good with people.
0DI0002531	I'm fine doing research back here, even if it is a bit boring... and pointless... and a complete waste of time.
0DI0002532	Don't mind me. I'm just voicing my thoughts so they don't burrow out of my skull in a fit of abject despondency.
0DI0002533	I'm enthusiastic about helping people, but nihil novi sub sole.
0DI0002534	For the past hundred years or so, the Followers have managed to get by using salvaged medical supplies from the Old World.
0DI0002535	But the side effect of medical success is that more people live longer. Funny how that works.
0DI0002536	Eventually, we'll run out of hospitals to loot. We need new ways to produce those supplies. Or maybe old ways, if this research goes anywhere.
0DI0002537	Cuts, lacerations, broken bones. Infections resulting from all of the above. Common cold, influenza. Take your pick.
0DI0002538	There are plenty of ways to die out here, and most of them, surprisingly, don't have anything to do with war. Just common human fragility.
0DI0002539	Caesar can cite Cato to suit his purpose. Many people have spoken Latin. Some of them were quite pleasant.
0DI0002540	It's unfortunate that the language is now associated with the gentlemen across the river.
0DI0002541	Oh. Sorry. "There is nothing new under the sun."
0DI0002542	If agave and mesquite were that miraculous, the locals would have figured it out a few thousand years ago.
0DI0002543	Not from the Legion, if that's what you're getting at. Books. Sheet music. Gladiator movie holotapes. Bits and pieces here and there.
0DI0002544	The Followers have extensive libraries, but we all draw water from the same old well. Even Caesar.
0DI0002545	I don't know anything that the others couldn't tell you. Caesar was one of the Followers. Before my time, of course.
0DI0002546	He wanted to rebuild the new world in the image of the old. A sad story of good intentions gone bad. In that regard, he's hardly unique.
0DI0002547	If you set aside his leadership capabilities, extensive knowledge, and ruthless cunning, he's just another jerk who steps on people to get his way.
0DI0002548	I can't leave now. Caesar has gained too much ground. I need to be here in case the NCR fails to hold Hoover Dam.
0DI0002549	No offense intended, but why should I go anywhere with you?
0DI0002550	Energy weapons? Of course not.
0DI0002551	I mean... but, we study all sorts of science and technology so, you know, we... you just kind of get familiar with them. Yeah.
0DI0002552	Oh, uh... of hearing stories. About energy weapons. They're... pretty crazy. Yeah.
0DI0002553	Did I say something? Sorry. Don't pay any attention to me. Just babbling. Nonsense, really. Babbling nonsense.
0DI0002554	Very optimistic of you. You'll make a good Follower someday assuming Caesar doesn't have us both crucified.
0DI0002555	Short of canceling our imminent travel plans, that's the best thing you could have said.
0DI0002556	Just be careful. If we travel at Caesar's pleasure, he may not let us out as easily as he lets us in.
0DI0002557	Et tu, mi amice?
0DI0002558	Et tu, mi amica?
0DI0002559	I have to commend you on your sense of historical propriety, but have you given more than a passing thought to how we would escape?
0DI0002560	No disrespect intended, but you aren't the first person to dream up the idea.
0DI0002561	Just give me a sign when you're about to pull out the dagger so I know when to make a run for the cliffs.
0DI0002562	I can't say I understand your obsession, but for that I suppose I'd have to spend a night in your grave.
0DI0002563	Fine. I'll stick with you. Just remember this. If you want something from Caesar, sooner or later you'll have to give him his due.
0DI0002564	I can't see as how I'd charge you after the generous things you've done for the town. The room's on me.
0DI0002565	Well, I think that's a fine idea. I'll give you a good flat rate, and you can stay as long as you like. Least till the busy season comes. Sound good?
0DI0002566	I'm glad you can stay with us.
0DI0002567	Well that's nothing to be ashamed of. We all have money troubles from time to time.
0DI0002568	You just come on back when you can afford it, and that room's all yours.
0DI0002569	Oh. Well, all right.
0DI0002570	Your room will be the one upstairs, closest to the lobby side.
0DI0002571	Here's your key. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your stay better for you.
0DI0002572	Even if that were the case, we still need more incentive to help Vegas.
0DI0002573	I think I see now what you intend to set in motion.
0DI0002574	If this plan will bring us one step closer to revitalizing the region, you can count on our support.
0DI0002575	So long as you can keep us supplied, we will stay in the Mojave to provide care and education for those in need.
0DI0002576	See ya.
0DI0002577	Then'll we have to make you leave by force. Your own fault, you understand.
0DI0002578	This is most unusual! The Powder Gangers have visitors today. I guess there's a first for everything!
0DI0002579	Now those tough-looking fellows must be Great Khans. I recognize those funny helmets and leather vests from stories I've heard...
0DI0002580	So what are they doing with that dapper gentleman who wears a checked suit? I wouldn't mind a suit like that.
0DI0002581	They're talking about heading south toward Nipton, then west to Novac where they'll meet up with someone...
0DI0002582	I guess I could track them if I needed to, but the town of Primm needs me here, to serve and protect.
0DI0002583	Oh my. I think I've been spotted...
0DI0002584	Mr. House ran projections on how the NCR public will react to a defeat at Hoover Dam! Overwhelmingly, they'll blame Kimball!
0DI0002585	But if Kimball dies at Hoover Dam, there's no obvious scapegoat for them to blame! So they'll blame New Vegas instead!
0DI0002586	So that means reduced tourism for up to five years! The equations are pretty complicated! Mr. House sure liked numbers!
0DI0002587	Great! A Ranger named Grant has been placed in charge of security for the President's visit. You'll want to talk to him.
0DI0002588	Once the President is safe, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
0DI0002589	All right. A Ranger named Grant is in charge of security for the visit. He's the one you'll have to convince.
0DI0002590	After you've resolved the situation with the President, there's one more thing for you to take care of!
0DI0002591	You are so misunderstood! Well, it's their loss!
0DI0002592	Forget about the President! We've got something more important to take care of!
0DI0002593	Fine by me! We've got more important things to take care of!
0DI0002594	Great! When this is taken care of, we'll be all set for the Legion to make its move.
0DI0002595	I'll use the Substation to send a huge jolt of electricity to the Lucky 38! Turns out this casino has its own reactor! All it needs is a jumpstart!
0DI0002596	With the reactor running at full-tilt, I can boost the transmission strength of the Lucky 38's command and control network!
0DI0002597	Be careful out there! It won't be long before the Legion makes its move!
0DI0002598	What? Are you crazy?
0DI0002599	What the-? Don't touch me. I could get a better massage from a baby.
0DI0002600	Who are you, again?
0DI0002601	You're weird. Please stop that.
0DI0002602	Huh? Hey, I think you dropped your gun there. Here. Here you go. Just don't point it at me, okay?
0DI0002603	I'm paranoid now, and even though you clearly don't know how to hold that thing, it'd be one less thing for me to worry about. Thanks.
0DI0002604	Why it's splendid. Simply to die for.
0DI0002605	Mortimer told me about you, you know. What a pair of mischief makers you two are!
0DI0002606	But the new entrees are fresh and bold and I have the two of you to thank for it.
0DI0002607	Now that it's been accepted, it will become a regular course for us.
0DI0002608	It's a new and exciting frontier for our chef. I've never seen him so cheerful.
0DI0002609	Oh, I very much doubt that. What fun would it be if everyone could have it?
0DI0002610	Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if our chef used it here and there as a secret ingredient to make his dishes really come alive.
0DI0002611	I wonder if Marcus knows about this place....
0DI0002612	Ahh! Loud! Onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightninetenonetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineten!
0DI0002613	Nice puppies - do doggies want treats?
0DI0002614	Ooh, look, pumpkin! A dinosaur! Do you want to ride the dinosaur?
0DI0002615	My, aren't all these lights fancy?
0DI0002616	My, my, this reminds me of when I was a girl. Right over there would have been where your grandpa and I had our first kiss!
0DI0002617	Step closer to the demonstration area, please!
0DI0002618	Okay, so you're familiar with Securitrons by now, obviously! I mean, some of your best friends are Securitrons, right?
0DI0002619	Our titanium alloy housing does a good job of protecting our delicate electronic insides from small arms fire and shrapnel!
0DI0002620	Our left arm contains an X-25 gatling laser, quite deadly against soft targets at medium range. That looks like fun!
0DI0002621	And for close-range suppression and crowd control, we have this handy-dandy 9mm submachinegun! Nice!
0DI0002622	All of this is old hat, right?
0DI0002623	Here's where it gets interesting! Turns out those are our secondary weapons!
0DI0002624	All this time we've been running the Mark I operating system, which doesn't have drivers for our primary weapons! Imagine!
0DI0002625	Now watch this - I'm downloading the Mark II OS to all the Securitrons on the network. Makes quite a difference!
0DI0002626	With the M-235 Missile Launcher, we can engage ground and air targets at long range!
0DI0002627	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system makes us deadly in close-range engagements! Whoo, look at that!
0DI0002628	The OS upgrade also includes drivers for our onboard auto-repair systems! Just try to hurt us now!
0DI0002629	All together, this software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness - per unit!
0DI0002630	New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
0DI0002631	I hope you enjoyed this demonstration! You can come back up and see me or be on your way - I know you're a busy person!
0DI0002632	Okay, but I'd really like to take a look at him. Remember, I'll be able to give his armor some extra plating while I've got him here.
0DI0002633	I've heard through our channels that it has some research that may be related to Enclave and Poseidon Energy technology.
0DI0002634	I'd like to get what I can from it and use that data for the good of humanity... ALL of humanity, unlike the Brotherhood.
0DI0002635	First I'm going to pull off whatever log data I can. Then, I'll use some of the tech around here to upgrade its weapons systems.
0DI0002636	Shouldn't be more than a few days work.
0DI0002637	Thank you. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can with the upgraded weapons systems.
0DI0002638	The Brotherhood is all about keeping technology to themselves, and using what they find to protect themselves.
0DI0002639	They are isolationist and belligerent. I have no doubt that they plan to use the data for weapons research.
0DI0002640	Well, the Legion is going to attack Hoover Dam one of these days! And the NCR is going to defend it!
0DI0002641	One side will lose, and the other will win! But the side that wins will be weak, because a lot of its soldiers will be dead!
0DI0002642	That's when all our Securitrons will show up! We'll declare an Independent Vegas, and tell the side that won the dam - to scram!
0DI0002643	Or the Securitrons will kill all of them, too!
0DI0002644	Sure, no problem! So long as the Legion doesn't attack before you can get there! Which I'm sure they won't!
0DI0002645	Wonderful! I'll keep tabs on the situation at the dam! See you in a bit!
0DI0002646	Great! So I've been looking over Mr. House's force projections and running some calculations...
0DI0002647	It turns out there are two ways we can win this thing! Hear that? We have options!
0DI0002649	It turns out there's only one way for us to win this battle and make it stick! We have to render Hoover Dam inoperable!
0DI0002650	You could rout the dam's power output to the facility under Fortification Hill. That'll restart its reactor, just like you did with the Lucky 38!
0DI0002651	That'll wake up the Securitron army you left on standby and give us enough force to push the Legion and the NCR straight out of the Mojave!
0DI0002652	The other option is destroy the dam's generators. Without those, it's just a big bunch of concrete! The NCR won't have any reason to stick around!
0DI0002653	You don't have to decide yet! For now, all you have to do is take this override module and install it on the terminal in the power control room!
0DI0002654	Good luck! See you at the dam!
0DI0002655	I wish I could, but I'm neuro-computationally incapable of making decisions like this one! It's up to you!
0DI0002656	You remember how the Securitron army at the Fort got destroyed? For very, very good reasons, of course...
0DI0002657	Well, the problem is that's left us with enough Securitrons to drive off a weakened NCR force -  but not enough to keep them from coming back!
0DI0002659	That's exactly why this will work! Just hear me out...
0DI0002660	Not the whole thing, thank goodness! That'd be really hard!
0DI0002661	All you have to do is destroy the power generators! Without the generators, Hoover Dam's just a big bunch of concrete!
0DI0002662	Take this override module - it's just like the one you used at the El Dorado Substation.
0DI0002663	Install the override module on the terminal in the power control room! I'll disable the generator failsafes, and you can do the rest.
0DI0002665	Here, take a look at this print-out. It covers all the details!
0DI0002666	This print-out describes the situation in more detail!
0DI0002667	Take this print-out. It'll tell you what to do!
0DI0002668	Here's another one of my print-outs! Read up!
0DI0002669	This print-out covers everything you need to know!
0DI0002670	Take a look at this print-out. I may have said things wrong a moment ago.
0DI0002671	Here's a print-out with some additional information.
0DI0002672	Who am I to argue with a solution like that?
0DI0002673	If you say so, that's good enough for me!
0DI0002674	All right, I'll cross them off the list!
0DI0002675	So this is what the rest of the world looks like!
0DI0002676	Everything looks bigger than I imagined!
0DI0002677	Isn't this exciting? I know I'm excited!
0DI0002678	I have a good feeling about this! It's going to be great!
0DI0002679	I bet I'm going to like it in that mainframe!
0DI0002680	For a while, you were the toast of the Ultra-Luxe, but you're simply not en vogue any longer. Your act has gotten stale.
0DI0002681	You're still welcome to dine with us, of course. We've just had quite enough of paying you to play our games.
0DI0002682	Sure. Pearl gave the green light. Take a look at the manifest.
0DI0002683	Not without Pearl's permission, and she hasn't given permission.
0DI0002685	My deepest apologies for the slightest inconvenience. You have my assurance that everything will be returned upon your departure.
0DI0002686	But we simply can't have anyone waving their weapons around in the hotel.  It's not the atmosphere we wish to cultivate.
0DI0002687	Please, enjoy your stay.
0DI0002691	I'm afraid those are the rules. If you don't like it you can take your business elsewhere.
0DI0002692	How frightfully uncouth. I'm afraid I must insist you relinquish your weapons.
0DI0002693	Well, I never.
0DI0002694	They'll be handled with the utmost security in our bank.
0DI0002695	Here is what we have available.
0DI0002696	I bet you would, but Pearl didn't give me permission to sell to outsiders.
0DI0002698	Sometimes it makes grandma forget things she doesn't want to forget, pumpkin.
0DI0002699	Are you sure, dearie? Taking my medicine all the time makes me feel woozy, but it does make it easier for me to ignore Leo.
0DI0002700	That's sweet of you, dearie. I'll try to be better about controlling myself if I see you try to sneak away.
0DI0002701	Oh my stars! Are you sure? If I don't take any medicine at all, Leo gets especially cranky. I can't stop him when he's like that.
0DI0002702	Whenever you're ready, dear.
0DI0002703	Well, all right, then, dearie. I suppose I'll have my holotapes to remind me of Becky and Jimmy....
0DI0002704	Yes, dearie?
0DI0002705	All right, pumpkin.
0DI0002706	All right, dear. If you're really sure.
0DI0002707	You think I'm handsome? Wow, I wonder if she does, too!
0DI0002708	No. Those aren't for outsiders to use. Leave them alone.
0DI0002709	Anything else you need? I've got work to do.
0DI0002710	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you genuinely care so much, they're flight simulators. If you don't know our history yet, you should see Pete and get the tour.
0DI0002711	We dream to one day rule the skies.
0DI0002712	[FAILED] Talk to Pete if you're so curious.
0DI0002713	I just told you, the robots are going to handle it. They'll break the plane down into pieces and move it up from Callville Bay in one shot.
0DI0002714	Hey, I better get rolling. Jack and I have a lot of work ahead of us!
0DI0002715	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly. We'll be shelling an unoccupied location in Outer Vegas to get their attention elsewhere.
0DI0002716	By the time they realize they aren't under attack, the plane and the bots will be long gone.
0DI0002717	The kids wish we were shelling a real target, but Pearl thinks it wise to not start up a war just as the lady has risen.
0DI0002718	[FAILED] We've got that covered. They won't be a problem.
0DI0002719	Let's just say they'll be a little distracted for a while.
0DI0002721	Well he might've been wearing a fancy outfit, but he wasn't any kind of a gentleman to me.
0DI0002722	Had his nose stuck so high in the air, you couldn't see it above the clouds. City folk, they always think they deserve better than what they got.
0DI0002723	Those hoodlums he was with seemed to know Manny for some reason. He's our daytime sniper, up in the dinosaur's mouth.
0DI0002724	Can't say as I have, but we usually keep to ourselves down here. You might have more luck up by the motel.
0DI0002725	Maybe ask Jeannie May. Nothing happens in this town that she don't know about. She'll be up in the lobby, most days.
0DI0002726	Sure have. Camouflage, that coat was, trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers.
0DI0002727	But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put the checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart.
0DI0002728	They stayed here a night, and was up by the dinosaur talking to the sniper fella with the moustache a couple of times.
0DI0002729	Sure, but he didn't buy any souvenirs, if that's what you're wondering. Sounded like he didn't have his money with him.
0DI0002730	His friends seemed disappointed about it. Heck, I would be, too, if I found such a fine store and left my money elsewhere.
0DI0002731	Manny might know more about them. Thought he might've been friends with one or two of 'em. He's up in the dino mouth during the day.
0DI0002732	No, but I've been laid up for a while now. Haven't been able to keep an eye on things like usual.
0DI0002733	It's a small town, though. I'm sure someone would've noticed somebody like that if they came this way.
0DI0002734	Oh, that old thing? That's a holotape from the last time I visited my grandkids. Such sweet little children, you know. Little angels.
0DI0002735	Sometimes it's hard to remember them, so I take that old tape out from time to time and listen.
0DI0002736	It's my medicine, dearie. It keeps me calm, but it makes my memory go all fuzzy. That's why I only take my dosage every other time.
0DI0002737	That way at least I remember their faces.
0DI0002738	Ohh... that was a bad one, wasn't it, Leo?
0DI0002739	Grandma's feeling calmer now, dearie.
0DI0002740	Oh my stars, did I do all of this?
0DI0002741	Gracious me, I lost control a bit there!
0DI0002742	I would. I'm the senior-most paladin in the Chapter, and have more combat experience than any two others here put together.
0DI0002743	I'd gladly support another candidate, but no one has the courage to step forward and make the attempt, so it falls to me.
0DI0002744	I would put this chapter back on the right path, if I could just assume leadership.
0DI0002745	That'll have to do. I'd recommend going to see Ramos first. As head of security, he's more familiar with our protocols than anyone else here.
0DI0002746	You could also try to find something relevant in our datastore, though last I heard, Scribe Ibsen has having a bit of a problem accessing it.
0DI0002747	And if McNamara should give you any tasks, I'd ask that you kept me abreast of them.
0DI0002748	Report anything you find to me, and we'll move from there.
0DI0002749	If I become Elder, the lockdown will be lifted, and we'll once again be able to send patrols out into the wastes. We'll become powerful again.
0DI0002750	And when that happens, it will be good to have the Brotherhood as an ally. Good enough?
0DI0002751	You speak truly, for it is unlikely that an outsider would know both the Elder's name and that passphrase.
0DI0002752	Very well. I've been observing the penal facility there in the distance for some time now, after having followed some rather disturbing rumors.
0DI0002753	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and now use the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
0DI0002754	What puzzles me is why these men have been allowed to run wild for so long unchecked. Why has the NCR not retaken this place?
0DI0002755	Give this to the Elder. My observations are all within. Perhaps he will have a better idea of what this situation portends.
0DI0002756	The facility was run by the NCR for a time, but the prisoners overcame their guards and used the prison as a base from which to conduct raids.
0DI0002757	Eventually, the NCR got around to putting the prisoners down, but not until they had wreaked havoc on nearby trade routes.
0DI0002760	Eventually, the NCR tried to put the prisoners down, but they were overwhelmed by them, and haven't sent troops to the area since.
0DI0002762	My purpose here is none of your concern. Now leave me be or I'll be forced to defend myself.
0DI0002763	See that you do. I'd advise you to avoid the prison over there. It's overrun by barbarians and the whole place may become a battlefield at any time.
0DI0002764	Strange that the Elder should send an outsider, but I suppose he has his reasons.
0DI0002765	My observations have mostly focused on the small town to the south of here. It was cruelly attacked, its inhabitants slain nearly to the last.
0DI0002766	That such an act could occur so far west is nearly unthinkable. The NCR has forces in all directions, and an outpost scant miles west from here.
0DI0002767	That they have not responded to this violence shows either an unwillingness or inability to properly defend their borders, which is telling.
0DI0002768	I've collected such musings in this report. Please take it to the Elder.
0DI0002769	That's none of your business. I suggest you head back the way you came.
0DI0002770	If so, you may wish to go around that town to the south. It's been taken by slavers, and they seem to be waiting for something, or someone.
0DI0002771	Then I am sworn to report. I've been dividing my time between the camps to the north and south of here.
0DI0002772	One belongs to the NCR, the other to a band of slavers known as Caesar's Legion. I was sure the NCR would quickly win, but that has not happened.
0DI0002773	Instead, the two sides have reached a stalemate, and only occasionally send skirmishers against one another.
0DI0002774	If I didn't know better, I'd say neither side is confident enough to push for a full victory. Which seems strange given the NCR's technological edge.
0DI0002775	In any event, I've recorded my findings in this report. Please deliver it to the Elder. I am sure he will find the contents most interesting.
0DI0002776	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and only after an extended duration did the NCR finally destroy its opponent.
0DI0002777	When they did, it appeared they did so with the help of fresh reinforcements. I do not believe they could have managed the feat without them.
0DI0002778	That savages such as these could last so long against the NCR is troubling. Please, take my findings to the Elder. He'll know what to make of this.
0DI0002779	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after an extended time the slavers rose up and slaughtered the NCR to the man.
0DI0002780	That barbarians with such crude weapons could crush a foe that defeated us is food for much thought.
0DI0002781	Here, take my report to the Elder. He must be made aware of what happened here.
0DI0002782	Instead, the two sides maintained a long stalemate, and after some time fighting broke out and both sides were mysteriously wiped out.
0DI0002783	Things were rather chaotic, so I wasn't able to see exactly what happened, or who did the deed, but seeing the NCR suffer such a loss was a shock.
0DI0002784	The Elder must know of what happened here. Take this report to him. It contains my notes on these events. Maybe he'll make some sense of it all.
0DI0002785	I've no reason to disclose the purpose of my actions to a stranger. Please leave.
0DI0002786	Do that. And take care to avoid the valley to the east, if you know what's good for you.
0DI0002787	The less who are aware of this situation, the better. My brothers and sisters were deeply traumatized by the losses we incurred several years ago.
0DI0002788	It would be imprudent to worry them unduly without first discovering the facts of the situation.
0DI0002789	I can spare a little time. What did you want to talk about?
0DI0002790	Let's just say that people around here talk about you. They say things, not nice things. We only like to hear nice things, get it?
0DI0002791	Yeah, that's right. Now, get the fuck out of our sight, before we change our minds.
0DI0002793	That's not going to cut it anymore. You've become a pain in the ass around here. Double that or we're going to box your ears.
0DI0002795	You cheap bastard, like all Mojave people. I'd beat you senseless right now, if we didn't have more important things to do.
0DI0002796	But this is not over, get it? We'll see each other again, when you least expect it.
0DI0002797	Think you can get away with this? Guys, time to rough this one up!
0DI0002799	This shit is not going to come off, I'm telling you.
0DI0002800	I can deal with them dancing in the fountain, I can deal with them running a Brahmin down The Strip.
0DI0002801	Hell, I can even deal with the puke in the latrines. But I can't stand the smell of turpentine, fuck that!
0DI0002802	You know what? It's all yours, then. Fuck this shit! I'm done.
0DI0002803	Shut up, and get to it. You rather be elsewhere? I can arrange a trip to the sewers - you'll love the smell.
0DI0002804	Hey, talk to Pappas if you've got complaints. I'm just want to be done with this shit.
0DI0002805	Hey... Hey! Where the hell are you going?Well, fuck you, then!
0DI0002806	Don't rightly know - I just got the notion to make my way to New Vegas. Reckon I'll find out when I get there.
0DI0002807	Likewise, friend - likewise. Is there anything old Vic can do you for?
0DI0002808	No, don't believe I did, but you might ask around - the Novac folk usually see anyone traveling this way.
0DI0002809	I'll let that slide seeing how you gotta mind full of vengeance for that no-good polecat and all.
0DI0002811	Novac? Nice enough place I suppose... but between you and me - when I rolled into town my skin started to itch. Watch yourself.
0DI0002812	Seeing how this is the only road around, I'd be a sight more surprised if we didn't run into each other from time to time.
0DI0002813	Now don't go getting paranoid, pardner - that bullet to your brain-pan probably just bucked your Brahmin a little. We're all friends here.
0DI0002814	Well, this ain't New Vegas, but I reckon you can find what you need here. Try the office out front.
0DI0002815	That's a mighty fine offer, but I'm gonna need to conserve my strength if I'm to make it all the way to New Vegas.
0DI0002816	I'm sure you'll do just fine without old Vic slowing you down.
0DI0002817	Just rolling along on my spurs. Looks like I just might make it to New Vegas after all.
0DI0002818	Yup, but this is getting a might embarrassing - people are going to start to talk. <laughs>
0DI0002819	'Benny'? Fancy-pant's name is Benny? No, but I reckon that 'Bunny' hopped his way back to New Vegas.
0DI0002820	Fancy-pants? No, I ain't seen hide-nor-hair of him since the tussle in Goodsprings. I'm sure he ran back to the soft-living of New Vegas, 'though.
0DI0002821	Look me up when you get to New Vegas - I'll buy the first round.
0DI0002822	Yup. Guess it's just down to you and fancy-pants. I wouldn't worry about him - he looked all hat and no cattle if you ask me.
0DI0002823	Now-now, it ain't my fault that Dorothy and the Tin Man happened to be on the same yellow-striped road, is it?
0DI0002824	Right here... where did you come from?
0DI0002825	Tumble-whats?
0DI0002826	Doggies!
0DI0002827	There in the corral.
0DI0002828	Crazy with low prices on Wind-Brahmin. You buy one.
0DI0002829	Yes - the herd.
0DI0002830	Good doing business - enjoy Wind-Brahmin.
0DI0002831	You not buy?! Then you die!
0DI0002832	All.
0DI0002833	They are very good Wind-Brahmin - all caps.
0DI0002834	Ha-ha! Stupid human!
0DI0002835	Okay! You know where to go. See you soon!
0DI0002836	Go all the way down to the Vault's main game room, take the hallway to your left and then the first room on the left-hand side. Enjoy your stay!
0DI0002837	Uh... Hello? Hi. Are you there? Oh, right. You can't respond. Listen, I'm using your robot as a relay to get this message to you.
0DI0002838	I've picked up some unusual chatter regarding your robot. It seems that it has some information that we could use. Oh wait, where are my manners?
0DI0002839	This is Lorenzo, a Knight with the Brotherhood of Steel. We'd be very interested in examining your tech.
0DI0002840	Could you bring your robot to one of our patrols so they can examine it? I'll have the robot mark the location on your map.
0DI0002841	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I monitored a communication earlier between you and someone with the Brotherhood of Steel.
0DI0002842	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are much more liberal about the sharing of technology than those Brotherhood... People.
0DI0002843	Bring your robot to us, we'll see that whatever information it may have on it is used for the greater good.
0DI0002844	Hi there, my name is April Martimer. I've heard through various channels that you have some... curious robot with you.
0DI0002845	I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse, we'd love to have the opportunity to examine the technology on that machine.
0DI0002846	We'll make sure whatever information we find is used for the greater good - and who knows, I may be able to give it some kind of upgrade for you.
0DI0002847	There's usually a bar in every stop along the road. Helps me sleep. Well, not really, but I tell myself that.
0DI0002848	Sometimes I have to brew it myself if I'm too far from a bar. Not quality, but I'm for anything that takes the edge off the day.
0DI0002849	Yeah, what else you going to do with an empty bottle? Wait for it to refill itself?
0DI0002850	Get me some ingredients out of the Mojave, an empty bottle, a little time, and I'll keep us stocked.
0DI0002851	Look, no guarantee on the quality, only the results. And don't drink too much of this stuff or you might go blind.
0DI0002852	All right, I'll start brewing.
0DI0002853	Here you go. Go easy on it until you train yourself to choke back the urge to gag. After a few bottles and the vomiting, it ain't so bad.
0DI0002854	Don't have all the ingredients you need - come back when you have 'em, and I'd be happy to get something cooking.
0DI0002855	As you may have already heard, this entire base is under a state of lockdown. No one goes out except small patrols at night.
0DI0002856	Most of the chapter has been sealed in here for years, and those few who were outside when the lockdown was initiated are forbidden from returning.
0DI0002857	Morale has plummeted as time has gone by, and many of our current paladins haven't even seen combat outside of training simulations.
0DI0002858	And all because of the Elder's explicit order that no one be allowed in or out. The only way things will change is if a new Elder is installed.
0DI0002859	If you change your mind, though, come find me, and we'll talk more.
0DI0002860	Why should you trust the Elder? I'd recommend listening to both of us, and choosing whom to trust for yourself.
0DI0002861	So are you willing to listen?
0DI0002862	Veronica's a special case. She handles the procurement of supplies. If we didn't let her and those like her back in, we'd all starve.
0DI0002863	If the Elder could manage it, he'd shut them out as well, and all in the name of security. Which is why we need to replace him.
0DI0002864	Of course I have. Many times, in fact. The Elder has an open door policy, and will listen to advice on any subject, save this one.
0DI0002865	He refuses to see that our isolation is slowly weakening us. Aside from being our duty, going out on missions is what kept us strong.
0DI0002866	And because he fails to see that, he must be replaced.
0DI0002867	You got yourself a bad reputation with us - that's what.
0DI0002868	You've got three days to improve your reputation with the NCR or we come for you... without all of this pleasant conversation.
0DI0002869	Have a nice day now, you hear?
0DI0002870	You're asking for leniency from us? Are you crazy?! We show up when the talking's over, get it?
0DI0002871	Crap, you don't even want to live a few more days? Go. Get laid one more time or something - we're walking away. Three days.
0DI0002872	Three days.
0DI0002873	Slavers, killers, and all other kinds of trouble. They dress up like Roman soldiers, so there's no mistaking it when you see them.
0DI0002874	The rumor is that the Legion is far larger than the NCR lets on, and that it's been due to luck that the Legion hasn't overrun the territory.
0DI0002875	I'm pretty sure the NCR wants to hold onto the Dam because it's one of the few places around that can make electricity.
0DI0002876	The Legion are a bunch of savages, though. No idea why they'd want the Dam. Probably plan on destroying it or something.
0DI0002877	I knew he was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for him!
0DI0002878	I knew she was carrying the Platinum Chip! And I knew right where Benny should wait for her!
0DI0002879	That's why Benny put me here! To monitor Mr. House's data transmissions. They're all encrypted, of course - but I'm quite a decrypter!
0DI0002880	Did you know that Mr. House spent 812,545 caps hiring salvage teams to find the Platinum Chip- just in the last year alone? Of course you didn't!
0DI0002881	Or that there were seven couriers, but six of them were carrying junk? How about their exact routes, and the mercenary teams that screened them?
0DI0002882	I knew all that. Pretty smart, huh?
0DI0002883	Hahaha! I know that's not true, because you still have a head!
0DI0002884	Hahaha! That's not funny, you getting shot in the head.
0DI0002885	I really shouldn't have taken so much pride in how I set that up, huh? I feel really bad right now.
0DI0002890	Hahaha! I knew there was a positive in it somewhere!
0DI0002891	Hi there! Come with me!
0DI0002892	Just to the top of the ridge up here...
0DI0002893	See that? Vegas, right? Same as always - but not tonight!
0DI0002895	Pretty nice, huh? But that's not all!
0DI0002896	Now that the Lucky 38's reactor is fired up, Vegas doesn't need the dam to have power! Vegas is energy-independent! Whoo-hoo!
0DI0002897	If we keep the dam running, we can sell all its electricity to the NCR for a nice profit. Vegas doesn't need it!
0DI0002898	Hope to see you soon!
0DI0002899	Nolan, we'll resume this discussion later. I can see you have company.
0DI0002900	I don't know. I've gone through our records dozens of times looking for a precedent regarding the dismissal of an Elder and come up with nothing.
0DI0002901	The people who are most likely to know how it could be done are also some of McNamara's strongest supporters, so they refuse to help me.
0DI0002902	Which is why we're having this conversation. An outsider such as yourself would arouse less suspicion asking questions about such matters.
0DI0002903	The fact that the Elder has some tasks for you means his faithful won't suspect you, and you have a line open to the man himself.
0DI0002904	In short, you're in a perfect position to help me. Will you at least think about it?
0DI0002905	I half expected you to say that. In which case, I'll continue to pursue the matter on my own.
0DI0002906	Should you continue dealing with the Elder and find yourself beginning to see my point of view, I'll be around.
0DI0002907	What were you doing looking at my terminal? No, never mind that. You can't tell anyone about what you found!
0DI0002908	There'd be widespread panic. The Elder has the situation under control.
0DI0002909	...Yes. When I first discovered how much the systems had deteriorated, I reported it to the Elder right away.
0DI0002910	He told me he'd take action right away, and sent out several patrols to search for parts.
0DI0002911	No! Please don't! Everyone would blame me! Look, I'll do whatever you want, just name it!
0DI0002912	Thank you. There's no telling what would happen if everyone were to suddenly find out, but I trust it wouldn't be good.
0DI0002913	Fine, but you're making a big mistake. Hardin isn't half the leader that McNamara is.
0DI0002914	I don't have time to think about silly things like politics right now. My main concern right now is getting this blasted datastore up and running.
0DI0002915	I can understand how the man might be frustrated by the current situation. He's a take-charge sort of fellow. Standing around's not his strong suit.
0DI0002916	I myself often wish we could end this interminable stasis and begin moving forward again.
0DI0002917	I suppose I could take a small break, but I can only spare a little time. Ask away.
0DI0002918	Oh, all kinds of things! There was already information regarding the layout and systems of this bunker, but we've since added our own data as well.
0DI0002919	Prior to the lockdown, we had extensively scouted the surrounding area, and compiled dossiers on nearby points of interest.
0DI0002920	Yes, did you have an idea that might help us?
0DI0002921	I do that all the time myself. One moment I'll think I've solved the conundrum, and the next I'm back to square one. Don't let it bother you.
0DI0002922	Was there something else you wanted?
0DI0002923	Our patrols are always bringing more stuff in. Take a look.
0DI0002924	If you happen to find it, bring it here right away. I might be able to throw a few supplies your way if you do.
0DI0002925	If you must know, my inventory check this week shows that our weapon count is one short. Somehow we're missing a laser pistol.
0DI0002926	Hardin will have my head if I don't find that weapon soon. I can't delay my report to him any longer.
0DI0002927	Yes, I handle all medical needs in the bunker. If you're ever wounded, I can treat you, for a fee.
0DI0002928	Normally I'd just be the base's medical officer, but my other duties say otherwise.
0DI0002929	We have equipment here to treat most physical injuries - lacerations, broken bones, that sort of thing. We also carry a full supply of antitoxins.
0DI0002930	You may have noticed the Bark scorpions up above. Though tiny, their venom packs quite a punch. Treating scorpion stings is my most common procedure.
0DI0002931	I can also treat any form of radiation sickness you pick up out in the waste, no matter what stage, save the last.
0DI0002932	I'm this bunker's Head Scribe in everything but name. I supervise the research teams. I collate the reports. I attend the meetings.
0DI0002933	But for reasons beyond me, that buffoon Taggart still gets the title. And don't get me started on that little pet of his.
0DI0002934	Everyone around here knows what's going on there but her.
0DI0002935	If you wish.
0DI0002936	Oh, I tried. The elder listened patiently to my carefully constructed argument regarding why that buffoon should lose his position.
0DI0002937	Then he just as patiently explained to me that Taggart's work was vital to our cause, and that he wasn't to be trifled with "lesser matters."
0DI0002938	But vital to our cause? Hardly.
0DI0002939	She's cute, isn't she? Like a puppy, almost. Unfortunately, our Head Scribe's intentions toward her aren't quite so innocent.
0DI0002940	I don't appreciate how much harder I have to work to cover for his tendency to focus on his personal projects.
0DI0002941	I try not to think too much about his personal proclivities.
0DI0002942	It's our virtual reality training hall. We don't really go out all that often anymore, so this is how we stay sharp.
0DI0002943	Head Scribe Taggart quickly realized my extraordinary talent when I took the mandatory VR combat testing.
0DI0002944	Soon after that, he requested that I get transferred to VR specialist training, serving as his assistant.
0DI0002945	I miss hanging out with the other students all the time, but at least I get to skip all those boring lectures.
0DI0002946	Yeah, a lot more. Back when we were at the HELIOS station. Er, crap.
0DI0002947	I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about that, especially with outsiders, so forget you just heard that, okay?
0DI0002948	Well, like just about everyone else here, I grew up in the Brotherhood. My father was a Scribe and my mother a Paladin.
0DI0002949	They both died at HELIOS One. The others were always like a family to me before that, but afterward they became my family in truth.
0DI0002950	I don't know, I'm a little like both of them I guess. If I had to choose, I really don't know which I'd pick.
0DI0002951	That's a question I've been asked a lot lately, since it's something I have to decide for myself soon.
0DI0002952	That was so much fun! The wind whipping through our hair, not knowing what was going to jump out at us at any moment.
0DI0002953	And when those scorpions came out! It was just like the sims! All I had to do was line then up and squeeze the trigger.
0DI0002954	I doubt I'll be able to get Stanton to go with me again, though. I thought he'd enjoy it as much as I did, but he was just scared the whole time.
0DI0002955	Don't tell him I told you this, but when those scorpions surrounded us, I'd bet a week's rations he pissed himself!
0DI0002956	I'm currently an Apprentice in the Brotherhood, and recently became eligible for Journeyman status.
0DI0002957	But first, I have to decide which Order I want to join - the Knights or the Scribes.
0DI0002959	Knights are in charge of all of our equipment. Power armor, gatling lasers, you name it. All of it built and maintained by Knights.
0DI0002960	Knights also get to go out on patrols, scouting assignments, and support the Paladins in offensive operations.
0DI0002961	Being a Knight would mean getting to see more of the world, fight the Brotherhood's enemies, and possibly someday become a Paladin like my mother.
0DI0002962	The Scribes are responsible for discovering how all the old tech we recover actually works and sometimes even work on inventing new things.
0DI0002963	Without them, the Brotherhood could never fulfill its mission. Or at least, that's what my dad always used to say.
0DI0002964	While that is disheartening news, there remains hope that the other two patrols may still be found alive.
0DI0002965	T-That is unfortunate. As long as there is a chance to find the remaining patrol, however, I must still ask you to try.
0DI0002966	I suppose I am not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
0DI0002967	Keep looking for them. The information they have is vital.
0DI0002968	Then allow me to explain our situation. This bunker is currently locked down, allowing no entry or exit, with you being one of the few exceptions.
0DI0002969	In exceptional cases, teams are sent out to investigate sites or retrieve materials deemed too important to ignore.
0DI0002970	Three such teams have gone missing recently, and the news of their disappearance has not yet been widely spread to avoid undue concern.
0DI0002971	In order to maintain the peace, and adhere to the strictures of the lockdown, I need to send someone else to discover what happened to them.
0DI0002972	Then that is your choice. If you should change your mind, please return.
0DI0002973	I'm sure someone's told you all this before. Several years back, we were running our chapter out the HELIOS One solar power station.
0DI0002974	Our Elder at the time, Elijah, had some kind of obsession with the place. Which is the only reason we stayed as long as we did.
0DI0002975	That place was hardly defensible, and we knew the NCR was moving in on us, but the Elder refused to budge, insisting that he just needed "more time".
0DI0002976	We never found out what he needed the time for. Wave upon wave of NCR troopers hit us from all directions.
0DI0002977	We held out for a time, but we were grossly outnumbered, and they had more men than we had ammo. Eventually our positions collapsed.
0DI0002978	Elder Elijah was nowhere to be found, so McNamara took charge and led what remained of us on a counter-offensive west.
0DI0002979	We lost a lot of men and women, but we broke through and made it here. Make no mistake, McNamara saved this chapter that day.
0DI0002980	That's right. Nothing gets in or out of here without me knowing it.
0DI0002981	Normally, that would have fallen under my jurisdiction, but the Elder thought it'd provide a good test for you, so I backed off.
0DI0002982	Yeah, I knew about it. They're still young, and they weren't going to go very far.
0DI0002983	I had them on my monitors the whole time. I almost headed out there when they got surrounded by those scorpions, but Watkins is a hell of a shot.
0DI0002984	Under the lockdown, only essential personnel are permitted to enter or leave. That includes supply runners and high security patrols.
0DI0002985	All other personnel are forbidden to leave, and any personnel that were out there when the lockdown was enacted are forbidden from returning.
0DI0002987	So you've been talking to Hardin, eh? He's been looking for a way to usurp McNamara ever since the lockdown started.
0DI0002988	Don't get me wrong, he's a good man, but Elder McNamara's done all right by us. If it weren't for him, none of us would have survived at HELIOS.
0DI0002989	I'll tell you what I told Hardin. There have only been a few cases of Elders being dismissed from their posts in the Brotherhood's history.
0DI0002990	And those involved crimes that someone like Elder McNamara is just not capable of. You can look it up for yourself, if you want.
0DI0002991	I'll grant you access to that portion of the history section of our datastore. See Senior Scribe Ibsen about accessing it.
0DI0002992	Who was Elijah, more like. He was our Elder before McNamara. Bright guy, but just between you and me he was a little off.
0DI0002993	Our mission is to recover and preserve the technology of the past, but Elijah wanted more. He sought ways to improve upon technology, make it better.
0DI0002994	When we found HELIOS One, he was like a kid in a candy store. He kept talking about the potential, and a "grand design, never realized."
0DI0002995	He even insisted we set up our base there, against the objection of nearly every paladin. What followed is a whole other story.
0DI0002996	Yeah, got this look when he saw you next down on the Courier list. His expression turned right around, asked me if your name was for real.
0DI0002997	I said, sure as lack of rain, you were still kicking. Then he turned down the job, just like that. I asked if he was sure, it was good money.
0DI0002998	No, let "Courier Six" carry the package, that's what he said - like the Mojave'd sort you out or something. Then he just up and walked out.
0DI0002999	No idea. Sounds like you two had a history for him to act like that. And turn down the money, too.
0DI0003000	Hope he didn't see any trouble in that package of yours. Maybe he thought your name was bad luck. Not for me to say.
0DI0003004	Whenever you get a chance, can you bring your robot back to Hidden Valley so I can take a look at it?
0DI0003005	Hi, sorry to break in, he sounded truly riveting. I don't want to keep you much longer, but I'd like to make a counter suggestion.
0DI0003009	Doesn't surprise me. Guy seemed like he'd do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Probably makes a lot of enemies.
0DI0003010	Well listen, I can definitely help you find him, but I've got problems of my own.
0DI0003011	Maybe we can do a trade. You need my help. There's something I need, too.
0DI0003012	You talking about that chip? Man, I don't think he's giving it up.
0DI0003013	Must be something pretty important to be chasing a guy like that.
0DI0003014	Hey, doesn't matter to me. I was just curious.
0DI0003015	A piece of the action, huh? I don't think he's the sharing type, but okay.
0DI0003016	Oh yeah? A good friend? If you say so, man.
0DI0003017	Hey, do what you want. I'm just trying to make it easier on you.
0DI0003018	Novac, it's home for me now. I want that to be for good. I like it here, and I've left too many homes behind.
0DI0003019	But the only resource we got here is junk. Without that, people wouldn't have anything to trade. They'd all have to leave.
0DI0003020	We get most of it up the road from the old rocket test site. But a bunch of ghouls showed up one day and took it over. We can't get in there now.
0DI0003021	Yeah, I... everybody depends on you, you know? But they don't ask you about how you feel. What you worry about.
0DI0003022	There's something I like about you. You just seem really understanding. I was gonna ask you for a favor, but I'll just tell you what you wanna know.
0DI0003023	No clue. I know Benny hadn't paid up yet. Maybe that was where they were supposed to get square.
0DI0003024	It's straight up Route 93 from here. Just keep following the road north.
0DI0003026	Hey, I know you got no reason to help me now, but you seem really nice. Could I at least tell you about the problem we've got here?
0DI0003027	Hope that helps. I owed you.
0DI0003028	See? I was right about you.
0DI0003029	Say no more. I hope things work out for you.
0DI0003030	I would. But I've gotta watch the road. Caesar's Legion has been taking territory just east of here. They took Nelson.
0DI0003031	If we let our guard down, they might attack. All it takes for the Legion is for them to sense weakness.
0DI0003032	Well they gotta go, or this'll be a ghost town before long.
0DI0003033	Doesn't matter to me what you do. As long as the ghouls are out of there, that's good enough for me.
0DI0003034	It'd mean a lot to me.
0DI0003035	The guy you're looking for, Benny, he was traveling with some members from my old gang. They were going to Boulder City.
0DI0003036	Sure could use a drink.
0DI0003037	All this traveling's making me thirsty.
0DI0003038	Careful if we go off the road.
0DI0003039	Don't mind trailblazing as long as we got the ammo. And whiskey.
0DI0003040	Feels good not to have to drag a Brahmin train across the Mojave.
0DI0003041	Glad I left the Outpost behind.
0DI0003042	Caravan of two now.
0DI0003043	Leo is a very bad man, pumpkin! Yes you are, Leo, don't try to deny it!
0DI0003044	He tells me to do things, terrible things, and sometimes the medicine isn't enough to keep him quiet!
0DI0003045	Doctor Henry calls them "anti-psychotics." I don't know what they're supposed to do, they just make my memory fuzzy.
0DI0003046	This old thing? Oh, I scavenged it off a wreck in Klamath. Leo showed me how to make it all ready for chopping, didn't you, Leo?
0DI0003047	Well of course there is, dearie. How else could I hear him tell me who to chop?
0DI0003048	You shouldn't say things like that where Leo can hear you, dearie. He doesn't like it.
0DI0003049	Okay, I'll tell you everything I know, like I promised.
0DI0003050	Just head over to the REPCONN test site west of here. See if you can get the ghouls out of there.
0DI0003051	If we need something obliterated, Raquel and the howitzer crews are more than qualified.
0DI0003052	No, we have more specialized issues we need help with right now.
0DI0003054	Be sure to stop on back and let me know when the arrays are fixed.
0DI0003055	Oh, pumpkin, grandma's sorry about that. Sometimes she gets mad and listens to Leo when she really shouldn't.
0DI0003056	The medicine is supposed to help with that, but sometimes grandma doesn't take it.
0DI0003057	Okay. Well... good luck to you. I'm heading back to the Prospector. I could use a drink about now.
0DI0003058	Hey, do me a favor. Trudy - she's the bartender up at the Prospector, kind of the town mom - she likes to meet newcomers.
0DI0003059	She'd be cross with me if I didn't ask you to poke your head in and say hi.
0DI0003060	Just keep an eye out for them while you travel. I've found cards in old boxes or forgotten on shelves. Can find some for sale, too.
0DI0003063	You've done right by us, so I suppose I could spare some supplies.
0DI0003064	We've recently started making our own stimpaks, but we just don't have the materials to make other meds. Sorry about the lack of selection.
0DI0003065	Just let me know what you need.
0DI0003066	Sorry friend, we really don't have a need for wasteland currency around here. We produce most of what we need.
0DI0003067	Sure, I know him. What do you want with him?
0DI0003068	This again? You gonna help me out with what I need, or not?
0DI0003069	Heard NCR recon fucked up here once, with the Khans.
0DI0003070	Heard NCR drove the Khans out of here, to Red Rock.
0DI0003071	Place stinks of sand, piss, and vomit.
0DI0003072	Refugees.
0DI0003073	Watch out - easy to get sick around here.
0DI0003074	Crazy ass radio signals around here, couldn't make sense of them.
0DI0003075	Place sets geiger counters ticking.
0DI0003076	No idea why the highest point in the Mojave is so rad-lit.
0DI0003077	Just goes to show you, no matter where you go, there's NCR trying to hold onto every corner of the world.
0DI0003078	Guess they chose this spot to spy on Caesar.
0DI0003079	Poor bastards.
0DI0003080	Guess NCR's fish food.
0DI0003081	Nice sign.
0DI0003082	Should kill all these slavers.
0DI0003083	Damn slavers.
0DI0003084	Those dogs look like they could savage a Securitron.
0DI0003085	We go across that launch, we may not come back.
0DI0003086	This is the only place to cross the Colorado safely.
0DI0003087	I hope we're not planning to cross the river.
0DI0003088	Only merchants, slaves and Legion come here.
0DI0003089	Another proud NCR camp.
0DI0003090	Probably chose this place because of the water supply.
0DI0003091	Morale looks low.
0DI0003092	I smell Hydra in the air, just a whiff.
0DI0003093	Be damn careful here.
0DI0003094	Don't like the way the men are looking at me.
0DI0003095	Keep your eyes to yourself, Legion asshole.
0DI0003096	Can't believe you want to talk to this guy.
0DI0003097	Love how he's decorated the place.
0DI0003098	Women might as well be dirt... not anxious to join them.
0DI0003099	Wish these women would take knives to Caesar's troops in their beds.
0DI0003100	Can't belive we're fucking back here.
0DI0003101	Testing our luck coming back here.
0DI0003103	They try and put one of those Brahmin packs on me, they're asking for a gelding. Going to get gelded.
0DI0003104	Can't say I've seen a smile on anyone's face since we arrived.
0DI0003105	Hope NCR wipes Caesar off the map.
0DI0003106	Guess the tent belongs to the big man.
0DI0003107	Not much future in the Legion if you don't have a dick.
0DI0003108	I'm heading back West if Caesar moves on the Dam.
0DI0003109	Not looking forward to being a Legion wife.
0DI0003110	What's that hum?
0DI0003111	Watch for scorpions.
0DI0003112	Doesn't fell like the rest of the Mojave here.
0DI0003113	Storms pick up quick around here.
0DI0003114	Check out those guns - rumor had it they used to shoot planes down before the war.
0DI0003115	Place looks like how my bladder feels.
0DI0003116	Place always wants me to take a piss.
0DI0003117	Ever look down the Dam? Sends your head spinning.
0DI0003118	Place is fucking cold.
0DI0003119	Pine trees?
0DI0003120	Can't believe we're in a refuge for crazy super mutants.
0DI0003121	Wish I'd packed a jacket.
0DI0003122	Only seen snow, not walked through it. Crazy - frozen water? Should package this shit.
0DI0003123	Heard they could make "ice" in the Old World and carry it around.
0DI0003124	Dad used to say that in the Old World, people would put boards on their feet and soar down the mountains.
0DI0003125	Back here again?
0DI0003126	What, didn't see enough of the sites here the first time?
0DI0003127	Once here, most just stall out, can't go deeper into territory.
0DI0003128	Fucking monument.
0DI0003129	From here, it's Nipton to the east or Primm to the north.
0DI0003130	And here's the slice of the world where NCR's hands start slipping.
0DI0003131	Guess the miners got fucked.
0DI0003132	Where's the mine from here?
0DI0003133	If this place got hit, Novac's next.
0DI0003134	I think I'm going to be sick.
0DI0003135	Nipton wasn't the best towns, but...
0DI0003136	Mayor Steyn got what was coming to him, looks like.
0DI0003137	Mayor here used to shelter gangers, hear tell. Guess it didn't save him.
0DI0003138	Should we cut the people down...
0DI0003139	Who the hell was that?
0DI0003140	I... hope they don't hit the Mojave Outpost.
0DI0003141	Smells like deathclaw.
0DI0003142	Looks like this place got wrecked.
0DI0003143	Looks like this place go mined - in the wrong ways.
0DI0003144	These boys and girls can really down the bottles.
0DI0003145	Whiskey and liquor don't last long around here, by the sight of it.
0DI0003146	Wonder if any of these folks would be up for shots of courage - and a wager.
0DI0003147	Be *really* careful what you say here.
0DI0003148	Should have heard stories of the Khans years ago - they were one tough bunch, now...
0DI0003149	Khans lost their strength after Bitter Springs, came here to lick their wounds.
0DI0003150	Let's not split up here, all right?
0DI0003151	Don't take any chems here - hell knows what they're laced with.
0DI0003152	Won't trade with Khans - they've poisoned most of the villages west of Vegas with chems.
0DI0003153	Fiends would suffer withdrawal and die without the Khans.
0DI0003154	Place would be beautiful... without the chem addicts and dealers.
0DI0003155	|Annihilation| Guess someone had to put them down.
0DI0003156	Have a Vegas-style boxing ring in the center there.
0DI0003157	Really wish we could go to some civilized places.
0DI0003158	Even the flies here are chemed.
0DI0003159	God, you can smell the Brahmin shit from the jet all over this place.
0DI0003160	"The Street" - Vegas Boulevard.
0DI0003161	Fancy town... let's hit some bars.
0DI0003162	Don't draw any guns and start shooting here - I heard the robots settle that trouble quick.
0DI0003163	3 casinos here - Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and the Tops. and, the Lucky 38.
0DI0003164	Heard Crocker's running the Embassy - guy's funny, and not in a hee-haw way. More like a see-saw with his politics.
0DI0003165	Captain Pappas keeps the law here. Watch out for her, she's no Crocker.
0DI0003167	Goddamn Legion.
0DI0003168	Oh, Jimmy, don't you go being silly now! Come over here and give your grandma some sugar!
0DI0003169	I... Oh, of course I have, dearie. How silly of me. I didn't take my medicine yet today. How can I help you?
0DI0003170	Of course, Jimmy.
0DI0003171	Time for medicine!
0DI0003172	Grandma has to take her pills now, dearie!
0DI0003173	Medicine time!
0DI0003174	There's my alarm - time to take my pills.
0DI0003175	Hush, Leo, it's medicine time now!
0DI0003176	Such a curious little munchkin, aren't you? What do you want to know?
0DI0003177	Oh, don't you worry your silly little head about that, pumpkin. Grandma knows what she's doing.
0DI0003178	Aww, someone wants to hear grandma's stories! What would you like to hear, pumpkin?
0DI0003179	Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good boy. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
0DI0003180	I don't mind fighting - especially to protect you, dearie - but I don't like guns. Give me a good chopper, and Leo and I will go right to work!
0DI0003181	Isn't that sweet of you to fret about me? Such a good girl. I can always help you stay hidden from the bad people so you won't get in trouble.
0DI0003183	What do you need, sugar?
0DI0003184	I grew up in Vault 17. I never even saw the sun until I was 75 years old - that was when Super mutants raided the Vault and carried a lot of us off.
0DI0003185	Yes, Leo, I'm getting to that part! They made me one of them, and they put me to work in an army that was going to conquer California.
0DI0003186	A spy. Sometimes an assassin. I killed a lot of folks for the Master. Yes, Leo, you helped, too.
0DI0003187	Oh, he was a nasty man, dearie. You don't want to know about him. He was the one who made that Super mutant army I told you about.
0DI0003188	That wicked old Master got what was coming to him, that's what! After his cathedral blew up, I decided it was high time to go home.
0DI0003189	I'd really like my beret back, please.
0DI0003190	Easy, boy.
0DI0003191	Shh...
0DI0003192	You think that did it? Maybe we should test the rangefinder outside.
0DI0003193	Uh... yeah. I guess it works.
0DI0003194	Yeah, I guess me and the guys could push this place over pretty easily.
0DI0003195	First things first, though. You go settle things with Ringo and put a bullet between his eyes while I round up my crew and let them in on the plan.
0DI0003196	Well for that your best bet is going to be talking to Deputy Beagle.
0DI0003197	Since they came to town he was keeping a good bit of notes on them, and he was slinking around Bison Steve when your pretty-boy friend came through.
0DI0003198	He may have heard where they were going.
0DI0003199	Deputy Beagle would have been your best bet, before he met that tragic end.
0DI0003201	Maybe you can track down whatever notes he was keeping and find some thing to help you there.
0DI0003202	Nope. Different fella. Bigger. Had himself a face on a screen, and he talked more like you or me.
0DI0003204	I'm sure it was very inspiring.
0DI0003205	I go to grab him out of there and I notice he's holding something in his hand. Something metal.
0DI0003206	He shuts himself back inside the closet and that's when I see the grenade he's left by my feet.
0DI0003207	They do it a lot, the Legion. Using kids. They know we'll hesitate.
0DI0003208	Anyway, that was the first time. Second time I fell down those stairs in front of the motel. Just in case I got to thinking I'd put it all behind me.
0DI0003209	In Ranger school, they teach you how to spot a liar. I don't know why you're lying, but have it your way. We'll protect this town or die trying.
0DI0003210	Well, thanks for telling me. I know that knowledge didn't come without risk.
0DI0003211	Here. Take this, courtesy of the Ranger veterans fund.
0DI0003212	Tell you what. I'll pay you for what you did, but I'll do you one better, too.
0DI0003213	There's a move we have in the Rangers for knocking an opponent off his feet. Saved my butt a bunch of times, maybe it will for you too.
0DI0003214	Let me show you how it's done.
0DI0003215	They're the NCR's finest. A one-man platoon, each of 'em.
0DI0003216	You got a job where even thinking about it would scare a man senseless, that's when you bring in the Rangers.
0DI0003217	And if you see a squad of the veterans - guys who earned their black armor... well... you won't find a more beautiful sight.
0DI0003218	[FAILED] Are you kidding me? I can't ship these things fast enough. People love them!
0DI0003219	What the hell is this shit?
0DI0003220	What the hell was that all about?
0DI0003221	Should hit the Big Horn saloon here.
0DI0003222	Heard there's still mines in the city - and maybe drunk NCR soldiers spoiling for a fight.
0DI0003223	Rubble city, more like it.
0DI0003224	There's a bar in the intact section, careful if you go wandering around the ruined section.
0DI0003225	Not much reason to ship water here, but liquor... hard to meet demand.
0DI0003226	If NCR didn't grate me so, I'd come here for water resupply.
0DI0003227	Used to ship a lot of liquor here, soldiers here have too much free time.
0DI0003228	If there's a reason to attack NCR, Camp Golf's a reason.
0DI0003229	Watch out for the Misfits here - 9th Platoon, word of their fuck-ups is legendary.
0DI0003230	Golf was a president, I think. Maybe for NCR.
0DI0003231	Heard this used to be a mine field from some of the troopers here.
0DI0003232	Each spot for a land mine is numbered, hear tell.
0DI0003233	If you're looking for NCR's spine, ain't going to find it here.
0DI0003234	Well, Hanlon sure let this place go to shit.
0DI0003235	Lot of sites to this guy Golf all over the West.
0DI0003236	Shit. Fiends.
0DI0003237	Smells like Fiends.
0DI0003238	Can smell the chem labs and Jet from here.
0DI0003239	Make sure you have a backup weapon, Fiends don't go down easy.
0DI0003240	Watch for dogs.
0DI0003241	Heard tell there was a Vault somewhere around here.
0DI0003242	Hometown of the Van Graffs, don't care for this place too much.
0DI0003243	We shouldn't be in here.
0DI0003244	Water's scarce, but between things like this and Lake Mead, ain't too bad in the West as in other places.
0DI0003245	Watch out for the Kings, they're unpredictable.
0DI0003246	Kings dress like strutting girls, all fancy like.
0DI0003247	Once had a King following me like I was following you - had to chase him off with a shotgun finally.
0DI0003248	Kings told me I couldn't deal water here, fuckers. They like having mono. As in monopoly.
0DI0003249	Ralph might be able to forge a pass into the Strip for you, you need one.
0DI0003250	Looking for weapons, check out Mick and Ralphs... Mick's probably a sight better than Ralph, always trying to talk me out of my pants.
0DI0003251	Kings are led by the King. Has some kind of robot dog. Guess it hunts robot rats.
0DI0003252	Kings hold control over the water pump 'round here.
0DI0003253	Looks like prisoners are in charge now.
0DI0003254	No guards in the towers, not a good sign.
0DI0003255	Guess NCR fucked this place, too.
0DI0003256	Folks here have access to Lake Mead, fresh drinking water.
0DI0003257	Careful, Boomer territory. They ain't hostile, but they're a bit trigger happy.
0DI0003258	Boomers are a might twitchy.
0DI0003259	Folks here aren't friendly to anyone.
0DI0003260	Don't be shooting wild in here - might set something off.
0DI0003261	First time I seen a fence made out of artillery.
0DI0003262	Some of these weapons look like they came from Hawthorne Army Depot, place has a lot of history.
0DI0003263	Can hear the screaming of rockets and explosions in this place at night.
0DI0003264	Got nests for planes here.
0DI0003265	An assault on this place would be suicide.
0DI0003266	This place reminds me the Old World had too much time on its hands.
0DI0003267	Named this place after the hotel.
0DI0003268	NoVac's the hotel, not the lizard.
0DI0003269	Smells like junk.
0DI0003270	Can see Dinky for miles, good landmark.
0DI0003271	First saw this place, thought the giant gecko was real.
0DI0003272	Read a book that giant lizards walked the earth like this one - might be a gecko this size.
0DI0003273	Said there's a courier office here?
0DI0003274	Sign of the buffalo.
0DI0003275	Ah, Bison Steve, you old shithole.
0DI0003276	Those post office boxes in these old towns still work.
0DI0003277	Good contact, Nash, used to be here. Had a son that went West.
0DI0003278	Old World had cars that ran on roads like these above the ground, 'cept they didn't go anywhere.
0DI0003279	The sheriff here ain't worth a damn.
0DI0003280	Crazy ass shit.
0DI0003281	Rest stop.
0DI0003282	NCR's friendly, might be able to resupply.
0DI0003283	A little safe ground.
0DI0003284	NCR flag - not safe, close to it, though.
0DI0003285	Chairmen, Omertas... a whole bunch of families rule Vegas, don't step out a line as long as money's to be made.
0DI0003286	Welcome to sin. Watch where you step.
0DI0003287	Watch for NCR vomit.
0DI0003288	Hope you're not here to chase your losses.
0DI0003289	Now to find a bar.
0DI0003290	Don't understand how the missiles could have missed a target like this.
0DI0003291	Beats Freeside.
0DI0003292	Can't believe we got in here.
0DI0003293	Dad used to say this place was what Reno tried to be. Fucking Reno.
0DI0003294	Place feels like the Sorcerer of Oz sometimes.
0DI0003295	Heard stories about the Lucky 38, how nobody's ever gone inside - 'cept you, that is.
0DI0003296	That hit the spot.
0DI0003297	All right, now for some ass-kicking.
0DI0003298	Pass the bottle.
0DI0003299	Now all I need is some shame to wash it down with.
0DI0003300	Bottoms up.
0DI0003301	Oh, now, there goes the pain.
0DI0003302	"Jean-Baptiste?" Sounds like someone got knocked out of the good book so hard his name broke.
0DI0003303	Either that or it's Canadarian or some such shit. So who is this... "Baptiste" and what does he want?
0DI0003304	Not much, and I haven't had occasion to look for anything more than that.
0DI0003305	I've heard what most people know... he's said to run New Vegas, he runs the robots, but... well, no one's really seen him.
0DI0003306	Well, except you, that is.
0DI0003307	Of course, no one really will now that he's dead. Good thing, too, no idea what that contraption was on his pecker.
0DI0003308	So if he wants to see you... well, that's a rare thing I wouldn't turn down. I'd ask him some hard questions if I were you.
0DI0003309	The only Van Graffs I know are the ones out West - well, except for Gloria Van Graff, and I don't know her all that well, nor do I want to.
0DI0003310	Don't have any objections speaking with him, though if he's with the Van Graffs, he should know I'm not looking to buy weapons.
0DI0003312	No... still eating at me, though. Wouldn't mind taking another look. Something's off.
0DI0003313	I think we should explore the next one, see what's up. Got my curiosity riled.
0DI0003314	Nothing yet, but... something's there. Just got to look around and find it.
0DI0003315	Not sure yet, something's definitely wrong. They were massacred, we should look around, find out why.
0DI0003316	I'm already shadowing you, aren't I? Lead on, I'll follow.
0DI0003317	Ask me to come with you, I'll think about it on the way.
0DI0003318	Not leaving here until my caravan papers clear, or my title goes away.
0DI0003319	If you were looking for someone to caravan with, I'd try the Crimson Caravan up north. They pretty much run the roads now.
0DI0003320	Don't know, not sure where to head to next.
0DI0003321	Well, they unloaded what they had left on the Dino Bite as a tax write-off. But that was before my time.
0DI0003322	Plenty of demand for them, seeing as they're one-of-a-kind collectors items. But I might still have some in back.
0DI0003323	That's a great idea.
0DI0003324	We've accomplished a great deal, you and I. One last task, and our work is complete. I'll see you in the control room.
0DI0003325	Then handle them with dispatch. The Legion's assault is imminent.
0DI0003326	Oh god. He... I guess he was lost a long time ago. Even at the end...
0DI0003327	Still... thanks for bringing word. At least, now I know.
0DI0003328	Hmm. Unlikely. He was a little too focused on gears and diodes... tech was the cure-all.
0DI0003329	Would you mind if I looked at the message?
0DI0003330	Would you mind if I listened to the message?
0DI0003331	Would you mind if I looked at the message you found?
0DI0003332	Would you mind if I listened to the message you found?
0DI0003333	Fine. I guess it doesn't matter anyway, keep it. I won't ask again.
0DI0003334	What was on it? What did he say?
0DI0003335	Yeah. Yeah. Thought as much. He'd been fading away for a long time.
0DI0003336	You did? Where? Oh my God, I mean... I thought... I don't even know what I thought might have happened to him.
0DI0003337	But... you don't have a "this is good news" expression on your face.
0DI0003338	...it doesn't matter. He died when we all retreated to Hidden Valley. I didn't expect to see him again, no one did.
0DI0003339	You killed him? But...
0DI0003340	Did he say anything when you met him? Anything...anything at all?
0DI0003341	Where did you get this?
0DI0003342	Guess I was right about the bad news, huh? Same look Elder McNamara always gave me when I was up for promotion.
0DI0003343	All right, I'll listen to it.
0DI0003344	All right, I'll watch it.
0DI0003345	That was... that was hard to watch.
0DI0003346	The parts I understood? Didn't matter. Past all the garbage, all it amounted to was goodbye.
0DI0003347	Sorry... feel a little out of it. Head's spinning a bit...
0DI0003348	Oh. Oh!
0DI0003349	I think he left me a gift. Maybe I can use it better than he did.
0DI0003350	Trapped him? Where?
0DI0003351	And I don't like saying this, but the Mojave's safer with him... there.
0DI0003352	You? Did you re-direct the power stream back to our section?
0DI0003353	We thought nobody would ever manage to get past the radiation, and the ghouls!
0DI0003354	We owe you our freedom, outlander. Please, if there's anything we can do for you...
0DI0003355	Yes, I believe that, outlander. We owe you our freedom.
0DI0003356	Kindly! The leaders of this fine community have accepted us among them. They give us food and protection from the outside.
0DI0003357	Some people here seem extremely unhappy. They keep talking about getting "shafted," "swindled," and "fucked."
0DI0003358	Apparently somebody did them ill, all the way inside the surface-city with lights - the Strip, and Freeside, they call it.
0DI0003359	We're lucky to be here, alive and well. The land's a mystery to us, but we'll find our place in it.
0DI0003360	Until soon, I hope, outlander.
0DI0003361	It fills me with hope to see that people from the surface world are kind, and brave. Again, thank you.
0DI0003362	Of course, please, take this! We carried as much useful technology as we could, before our journey into the surface world.
0DI0003363	Are you sure? What kind of injuries are we talking about?
0DI0003364	Has this person's condition worsened? What are the symptoms?
0DI0003365	Must not be that serious, then.
0DI0003366	[SUCCEEDED] All right, that does sound bad. Here, take these - it should be enough. Good luck!
0DI0003367	[FAILED] That does sound messy, but not too bad. I can't spare supplies for cuts and bruises.
0DI0003368	[SUCCEEDED] All right, all right. I've got some extra leather armor and spare ammo for you. Don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
0DI0003369	[FAILED] "Maybe" doesn't do much to convince me. No, just leave me out of this, all right?
0DI0003370	[SUCCEEDED] All right! I can give you some of my extra leather armor and spare ammo. Just don't hurt anybody if you don't have to, all right?
0DI0003371	[FAILED] Look, just leave me out of this, all right?
0DI0003372	Yeah, quit it with the crazy talk.
0DI0003373	Shit, yeah. Mayor Cobb - I like the sound of that. Running my own town will give me more pull with the guys at the prison, too.
0DI0003375	Having all the food we want ain't a bad idea, actually. Getting sick of eating prison rations.
0DI0003377	Make up your damn mind.
0DI0003378	No shit? I guess the next thing we need to do is hang out and wait for the rest of my gang to show up so we can talk about the plan.
0DI0003379	Did you want something else?
0DI0003380	Sorry about the gun. You just caught me off guard, that's all.
0DI0003381	We got off to a bad start. What say we start over with a friendly game of Caravan? You know how to play?
0DI0003382	Well, the wildlife for one thing. Rowdy locals for another.
0DI0003383	They're protecting their own. Just happens to help us.
0DI0003384	They've been holding off this other group from the East, too.
0DI0003385	Got a funny name. Call themselves Caesar's Legion. Never seen 'em in these parts, so I couldn't tell you much.
0DI0003386	I hear rumors, that's about it. Supposedly they keep slaves and they got some real nasty ways of killing folks.
0DI0003387	But maybe that's just something folks in the NCR cooked up to make themselves seem more useful here. Less uninvited.
0DI0003388	Ha! If we had spare parts, do you think I'd be asking you to fix the damn things? That's rich.
0DI0003389	No, we ran out of spares a while back, and Jack and I have been doing our best to patch the arrays up as best we can. Sadly, we're at our wit's end.
0DI0003390	There have to be spare parts somewhere around the wasteland, but I just don't know where to direct you. You may have noticed we don't get out much.
0DI0003391	Hey, that's great! You shouldn't have much trouble getting those fixed up, then. Just stop back when you're done.
0DI0003392	Are you talking about that damn bright light we've seen blast off to the south occasionally? I was wondering what the hell that was.
0DI0003393	If they've got the parts, bring them on back. We need to get the array back up and charging.
0DI0003394	As long as you don't become an outright enemy of the Legion, payment will continue.
0DI0003395	Stay an ally of the Legion and we will share our loot with you. If you start working against us - or become an enemy - our deal ends.
0DI0003396	I think there's trouble in Nipton - no traffic from there on the roads, and while I can explain that away, the smoke from the town I can't.
0DI0003397	I'm sure it's been hit - what I need to know is if they survived it. Might be Powder Gangers with all that smoke in the air.
0DI0003398	If there's anybody left, they'd be in the Nipton Town Hall. Go there, check it out, let me know what you find.
0DI0003399	The pay? The pay is a good goddamn thanks from the heart of the Republic!
0DI0003400	Just shitting you with the NCR line, done wonders for morale around here. President Kimball keeps saying getting shot at is its own damn reward.
0DI0003401	Do this job for me, though, I'll do what I can. People know I hate most everyone, so if I put in a word for you... that's gold.
0DI0003402	Mind yourself on the plank going down.
0DI0003403	Not much to tell, one of the worst posts in the NCR if you're looking to be anything more than a babysitter.
0DI0003404	Full up here, but just enough so we can't send out patrols. Got to maintain a "standing force," Jackson's orders... NCR's orders.
0DI0003405	Can't spare men for patrols or escorts, so caravans are backing up here like a Brahmin with a bottle in its ass. Typical NCR bullshit.
0DI0003406	Hnh. Maybe Jackson got some additional soldiers after all. Didn't take you for a trooper at first, you seem a little... livelier than most.
0DI0003407	All right, if you're here to assist, good, that's what I want to hear.
0DI0003408	All right. Look at you, all fired up and ready to go. Wish the others around here had that kind of attitude.
0DI0003409	Listen - I don't want you getting killed for this, so if you head there and run into trouble, I'm asking for eyes and ears, not your life. All right?
0DI0003410	Legion this far West? You're fucking kidding me.
0DI0003411	That's not outside the border, they're moving in - and fast. Nipton wasn't the most friendly town, but...
0DI0003412	All right - thanks for checking on that, wish it set my mind at ease, now I'm more on edge than ever.
0DI0003413	Got my post. Don't think I wouldn't go, too - if trouble's hit Nipton, town's got enough camping spots to rack up some easy kills.
0DI0003414	Not about to have Jackson bust my ass again, though, even if I came back with Caesar's head - rather be sitting here than in a cell.
0DI0003415	Kimball's Kimball, not sure which end is his ass or his head. Caravan families are causing trouble, Big Circle getting tense - the usual.
0DI0003416	Look, you want gossip, go to the bar downstairs and listen to a whole lot of nothing. Me, I got to keep watch, then fill out the daily log.
0DI0003417	Had to try. Smoke trail's getting thicker by the hour - wish Jackson could spare some men.
0DI0003418	Better than nothing. But close to it.
0DI0003419	Well, if you didn't see anyone, they might be gone - be just like Powder Gangers to hit and run.
0DI0003420	See what you can find in the Town Hall, there might be survivors.
0DI0003421	In Nipton? Hell no. Town was a shithole, asking to be burned. Just not by Legion. Nobody deserves that.
0DI0003422	Unless you burned the town, don't take blame that's not due. Things are going to get uglier before the year's out.
0DI0003423	Well, thanks for hoofing it there and back, even if it was bad news. Wish we could spare the troops to go hunting, but... orders are to stay put.
0DI0003424	Fucking Mojave's going to hell, and all I can do is sit here and watch.
0DI0003425	Interested now? All right.
0DI0003426	Good news for a change. Your efforts have humbled me, outsider. You have done more than I could expect, even from my Brothers.
0DI0003427	Moreover, I've been going over the scouts' reports and keep coming up with the same conclusion. The NCR is not the threat I've believed it to be.
0DI0003428	We should not have had to rely on your help in this crisis. I believed my actions were guided by caution and prudence, but I now see the truth.
0DI0003429	People called me a hero after what happened at HELIOS, but I left that battle scarred by fear, and have allowed that weakness to govern my actions.
0DI0003430	That ends now. I will undo the wrong I have done my brethren, and lift the lockdown. With luck, we will once again flourish.
0DI0003431	Please, take this. It is a small token of my thanks, and scarcely begins to repay the debt owed you, but is all I am allowed to give an outsider.
0DI0003432	This key will allow you to use our safehouse to the northeast. I hope it will prove useful in your travels.
0DI0003433	Please make all haste in your search. It is imperative that I know the results of his mission.
0DI0003434	So, you're the outsider that's been given leave to wander around freely. Desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.
0DI0003435	Name's Hardin. I'm the Head Paladin of this chapter, and I think we might be able to help each other out.
0DI0003436	I don't know what the Elder talked to you about, but I can tell you this chapter is in trouble, and he's at the center of it.
0DI0003437	Are you willing to listen to what I have to say?
0DI0003438	Good, let's take a look... Hmmm, if I'm reading this right, it appears that the NCR's grip on this region is nowhere near as firm as I thought.
0DI0003439	I'll have to review these in detail, but these reports have given me much to think about. Thank you, outsider.
0DI0003440	You've become someone I can count on, so I believe I can share something rather confidential with you.
0DI0003441	Well, return when you have.
0DI0003442	Not on my watch you won't. You either go with me to the Elder or I put you in the ground right here. Choose.
0DI0003443	Your call.
0DI0003444	Yeah? Maybe you can introduce them to me if we find them, because I've never met one.
0DI0003445	Don't worry - I'm not that good of a player.
0DI0003447	It's like looking into a mirror. A tacky, cowboy-festooned mirror.
0DI0003448	Eesh. These soldiers look how I feel, boss.
0DI0003449	See, that's why you should retire before your brain goes. Oh. Sorry, boss. Bad choice of words.
0DI0003450	I can't believe I'm about to do this, boss. If I buy it out there, I want twelve mariachi bands playing at my funeral. A medal might be nice, too.
0DI0003451	Just putting this out there, boss: if these Super mutants kidnap us and force us to fix toasters for them, it's on you.
0DI0003452	Cheer up, kid. It's not that bad. Sure, your skin rots off and you start to stink like a public toilet after Cinco de Mayo, but... umm....
0DI0003453	What? How is that not bad? In fact, how could it get worse?
0DI0003454	Well, assuming you survive the radiation sickness, the lynch mobs, and the possibility of going feral, one day you'll get old and decrepit, like me.
0DI0003455	Oh god!
0DI0003456	What? Was it something I said?
0DI0003457	Ah, he's young, boss. He'll bounce back. Unlike some of us.
0DI0003458	Hey, I'm one of you! Don't eat me, eat the smoothskin! Oh, uh, sorry boss.
0DI0003459	I guess hunting down ghouls like wild animals is okay. I mean, they're probably going to die anyways, right boss?
0DI0003460	That wig is going to haunt my nightmares. Seriously.
0DI0003461	Well, up north a ways you'll see a big tower. That's HELIOS One. Used to be a power plant in its day.
0DI0003462	And there's a town just east of here called Nelson. Used to be such a quaint little place until those slavers took it over.
0DI0003463	But we got our wonderful snipers keeping an eye in that direction, and so far the slavers have left us alone.
0DI0003464	Please don't hurt us no more. I'm begging you.
0DI0003465	We'll... we'll pay you. Whatever we got, you can have it. We'll put together a collection every couple of days.
0DI0003466	We'll leave it under a rock beneath the old windmill. Think of it as a... as a sign of respect.
0DI0003467	Shit. You sound like the LT. I should've w-woken up. I shouldn't have gotten knocked out in the f-first place.
0DI0003468	That shit was my fault. I don't want to talk about it anymore, all right?
0DI0003469	She's my g-g-goddamn partner. See, we work in pairs. We spot for each other. W-watch each other's backs.
0DI0003470	Nobody wanted to w-work with me. They said I was too green. But Betsy volunteered. Shit, you don't even know how big a d-d-deal that is.
0DI0003471	She trusts her life to the newbie, and I sit there and let her get raped by that... p-p-piece of shit.
0DI0003472	N-no problem.
0DI0003473	Oh, y-yeah. My s-stuttering was w-w-way worse before.
0DI0003474	He got better? If he says so. Anyway, 10 of Spades is a good kid - maybe I ought to listen to him for once.
0DI0003475	I'm guessing the other two had similar things to say. All right, consider me convinced. I'll go see Usanagi.
0DI0003476	You can tell the Lieutenant that I caved. And... thanks.
0DI0003477	Bitter-Root actually said that? I can't see him talking about his problems to anybody, much less admitting that someone else actually helped him.
0DI0003478	I always wondered about that. First Recon is elite, but the rangers... I can't imagine what it'd be like to lose that kind of status.
0DI0003479	[SUCCEEDED] I like the way you think. Oratory may indeed be a useful tool in our arsenal if wielded effectively.
0DI0003480	I'll put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
0DI0003481	[FAILED] Talking? Seriously? Sorry pal, but nothing is more persuasive than bullets and bombs, and we're the experts!
0DI0003482	I could probably put together a debate curriculum and pull out some of those old philosophy books.
0DI0003483	[SUCCEEDED] That sounds good for teaching the kids how to negotiate prices. I keep saying we need to open trade with the outside, but no one listens.
0DI0003484	[FAILED] It doesn't look like we're going to be trading with anyone outside of Nellis anytime soon, so I'd rather not bother.
0DI0003485	[SUCCEEDED] Wow, our stockpiles mostly included full metal jacket. I should start a reloading class for the children to learn how to make ammunition!
0DI0003486	[FAILED] Look around Nellis. We've got a stockpile of weapons, and we've all spent plenty of time at the range.
0DI0003487	I appreciate the sentiment, but there isn't much you could teach us when it comes to firearms.
0DI0003488	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, that's a great idea! This information might help with our training manuals, and maybe create a few new apprentices for Loyal.
0DI0003489	[FAILED] Right... when we repair stuff, we tend to use welding torches and plasma cutters. I think I still with Loyal and Jack for repair knowledge.
0DI0003491	Okay children, it's time to read another chapter from The Patriot's Cookbook.
0DI0003492	Today, children, we are going to read another chapter from True Police Stories.
0DI0003493	Children, today we're going to read more from the Milsurp Review.
0DI0003494	For today's studies, please read the next chapter in Programmer's Digest.
0DI0003495	Okay children, today we are going to be reading Lad's Life.
0DI0003496	Looking to step on your own grave?
0DI0003497	Not every day you come back to your gravesite.
0DI0003498	Heard the Doc here is a good guy.
0DI0003499	Crimson Caravan had some trouble here.
0DI0003500	Hill where you got shot?
0DI0003501	Think that was a mistake.
0DI0003502	No call for that.
0DI0003503	Could have handled that better.
0DI0003504	What I would have done.
0DI0003505	You handled that well.
0DI0003506	Good job.
0DI0003507	That was fucked up.
0DI0003508	Can't believe you did that.
0DI0003509	Just when I think I'd seen it all.
0DI0003510	That was lower than low.
0DI0003511	Set an example, others will follow.
0DI0003512	Proud of you.
0DI0003513	Color me impressed.
0DI0003514	That night, Cass kicked in the door of his room to celebrate, only to find the man on the bed was an NCR soldier whose barracks had been destroyed.
0DI0003515	He was cute, though, so after having her way with him, she got the hell out, leaving an empty whiskey bottle as a note.
0DI0003516	As she walked along the Dam in the night, she felt drunk, content, and happy to be alive. Which to her, was the whole point of it all.
0DI0003517	She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of himself, then she figured he knew that already.
0DI0003518	She was about to tell the Courier not to get too proud of herself, then she figured she knew that already.
0DI0003519	So she laughed, said fuck it all, and raised a bottle to the Dam and the ones who had fought for it.
0DI0003520	As far as she was concerned, the whole thing was proof that playing out a bad hand can pay off in the end...
0DI0003521	...as long as someone like the Courier was holding the cards.
0DI0003522	...as long as a woman like the Courier was holding the cards.
0DI0003523	Bad guys won't see us coming.
0DI0003524	Shhhh... we're hunting shitheads.
0DI0003525	Holding my breath.
0DI0003526	Keeping quiet.
0DI0003527	O... kay. I'll do my best.
0DI0003528	Just as a warning, my covert bandaging skills are a little rusty.
0DI0003529	Staying low.
0DI0003530	Keeping quiet... unless my creaking knees give us away.
0DI0003531	Sure, boss. The old man will crawl around in the dirt to keep hidden.
0DI0003532	This crouch-walking is hell on my back, boss.
0DI0003533	Right, because a ghoul in a vaquero outfit is really going to blend in with the scenery.
0DI0003534	Oh, don't you worry about me, dearie, your grandma knows how to stay quiet.
0DI0003535	Knight, he's at Mojave outpost.
0DI0003536	Roger.
0DI0003537	Roger, I'll radio them over now.
0DI0003538	It's your choice, but those rangers are only coming if we get our support.
0DI0003539	Don't mention it. It's what I'm here for.
0DI0003540	Didn't have much choice, I'm afraid. But I understand the sentiment.
0DI0003541	Started? Took to it like a fish to water... well, if you know what a fish is.
0DI0003542	It's this... slimy, scaled thing, like a Lakelurk, except no legs. Well, most times. They're like birds, except they stay underwater.
0DI0003543	Anyway, I've seen pictures. One guy even had one above his bar in Redding, except it was made of Pre-War plastic.
0DI0003544	Used to say it could sing, but I figured he was on a Jet rush.
0DI0003545	Well... of course I do.
0DI0003546	Actually, it sort of fell on me. My feet get antsy if I stay in one place, like the Mojave Outpost.
0DI0003547	Was driving me crazy, that feeling of being trapped there, so thanks for that.
0DI0003548	Yeah. West, East - and passed through places enough times people would sometimes pay me some caps to take something to the next town.
0DI0003549	Well, not as glamorous, I guess - roads back West were safer in most places. Most.
0DI0003550	Anyway, occurred to me I could scratch the traveling itch and get paid for it. Cassidy Caravans formed around me, rest is history.
0DI0003551	Well, I'm not one for soft living... or soft men, let me tell you. I'm guessing neither are you.
0DI0003552	Well, I'm not one for soft living or soft men, let me tell you. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking to you right now - on both counts.
0DI0003553	What? Oh. Damn, no offense meant. Sometimes I get so drunk, I don't care who I share a bed with, so that's fine with me.
0DI0003554	My point before? Is that you know the Mojave, and it's a hard place.
0DI0003555	Well, don't let the soldiers drink too much, and I'd agree with you most time. Fucking whiskey dicks.
0DI0003556	What? Oh. All right. Guess you've got a Legion outlook on things. No problems here, there's a lot more of that in the Mojave than you see.
0DI0003557	Don't take that as anything more than my words. I bet you're a real sweetheart the way you leave that trail of broken-hearts behind you.
0DI0003558	I know your look, you probably say all the right things... so we're clear, nothing's going to happen between us. You'd best respect that.
0DI0003559	Much as anyone else. Cazador trap - you fly in, the city sucks a pint out of you, then you're out on the street.
0DI0003560	NCR makes a habit of going there and dumping cash, only the Strip gets fat off it.
0DI0003561	Couldn't tell you much more than that. Not really one for New Vegas when there's enough dumpwater bars in the Mojave to last me.
0DI0003562	The Caravan fighting here in the Mojave... it's been downright brutal. The amount of caravan space you reserve for ammo alone...
0DI0003563	And if it's not raiders, Powder Gangers, it's NCR tolls. They need to get the money from somewhere, even if it's Vegas-bound.
0DI0003564	Anyone wise does. Vegas families pay on time, from what I've heard - even the Omertas. The White Gloves pay on time, but they're... creepy.
0DI0003565	Deal with anyone else, though, you're taking a big risk.
0DI0003566	Well, no idea why your friend Mr. House wants it, but I'm guessing it's not for the caps.
0DI0003567	Must've been one huge metal Bighorner that crapped that chip out.
0DI0003568	My guess? Leads to a big cashout at some casino - and if the "38" on it is any indication... well... Lucky 38 it is.
0DI0003569	The Legion? What about them?
0DI0003570	I don't trade caps or supply anyone who keeps slaves, and treats women like Brahmin in those... "camps" of theirs.
0DI0003571	Look, not meaning to fly off the handle like that.
0DI0003572	There's some caravans that deal with the Legion, yes. And as much as it pains me to say it, any caravan marked by the Legion is safe as houses.
0DI0003573	They guard their roads, their supply lines - even Fiends would hesitate before going after any trader dealing with Legion.
0DI0003574	I am. If NCR took the same stand and committed patrols to the roads, then I think that'd solve a lot of their problems right there.
0DI0003575	But they don't. Caravans get butchered in the Mojave all the time, like mine. And so fucking close to Vegas, you could see it from the wall.
0DI0003576	NCR tries. It's just that trying doesn't mean a whole lot when you're paying your respects to the dead.
0DI0003577	And Legion, from what I've heard, they don't do the "stop tolls" on the roads or in the outposts like some NCR quartermasters do.
0DI0003578	You're lucky if you turn a profit sometimes if some new officer gets assigned a route, the fees just get worse.
0DI0003579	Much as I hate the Legion, caravan life would be a hell of a lot easier if they ran the roads.
0DI0003580	Well, as long as those companies were run by men. And that's the biggest issue I see.
0DI0003581	And it's a shame, but I think there's people on the NCR side who feel more strongly than I do.
0DI0003582	NCR's my country, and I support it. Anyone who says otherwise, I'll feed them my knee.
0DI0003583	I know which side of the firing line I'm on in the Mojave, just so you know.
0DI0003584	Yeah, there is.
0DI0003585	I'm not some blind, flag-saluting do-as-they-will NCR lover. They're family, but let me tell you what family means.
0DI0003586	You ever had a brother? Some dumbass younger brother, say, who knocked up the pastor's daughter, can't hold a job, and his home-away is a jail cell?
0DI0003587	That's NCR. Their compass is spinning, all the time.
0DI0003588	They try to put their stake in everything they see.
0DI0003589	Nobody's dick's that long, not even Long Dick Johnson, and he had a fucking long dick. Thus, the name.
0DI0003590	So NCR, tries to hold on to everything. They can't, because it's too big for them to get their arms around.
0DI0003591	They can't guard the roads, they can't put a line of troops around the Mojave... it's just greed that makes the heads back West even try.
0DI0003592	Aside from the people in the towns, it's the soldiers that suffer for it most.
0DI0003593	Ever seen NCR troops asked to go after gangs at three-to-one odds? That bear flag doesn't make them bulletproof.
0DI0003594	And  when those gangs were caused by NCR in the first place, like the Powder Gangers? Caesar on a crutch, don't get me started there.
0DI0003595	Look, don't get me wrong.
0DI0003596	I wouldn't want the Brotherhood or the Followers or the Vegas families running the Mojave, all of them are a different kind of fuck-up.
0DI0003597	NCR just has some shaping up to do. Maybe Caesar kicking them in the nuts is a nice wake-up call, is all I'm saying.
0DI0003598	I just wish Caesar would kick the heads of NCR, not the feet. I've fucked a soldier in my time - they don't need to get fucked by their orders.
0DI0003599	Look... and what I'm about to say, I don't mean as any offense to you, I know where your sympathies lie.
0DI0003600	Some caravans deal with the Legion now because the security. If towns could get the same protection? A lot more tempting than you'd think.
0DI0003601	A bunch of people would be willing to side with the Legion to not have to worry about Fiends and Boomers and Powder Ganger attacks.
0DI0003602	It's not hard for some folks to sell freedom when the alternative is worse. Especially if being with NCR is going to get you on a Legion cross.
0DI0003603	Oh, I'm sure. Killing never felt so good, could almost hear the dead behind me guiding my hand.
0DI0003604	Now that that bitch is in hell, they'll have a shot at her, too. So what are we waiting for? We've got more work to do.
0DI0003606	Yeah... yeah, I am. Never realized had all that anger in me. Makes me wonder how much more I can settle with bullets.
0DI0003607	You know, when I first heard about them, I was so mad, but there was this little part of me that said, "you can't do to them what they did to you."
0DI0003608	I say fuck that part. I feel purified, and I love the fact that there's no more loose ends.
0DI0003609	That's it. Except for one thing... thanks.
0DI0003610	Not many people in my company would have done what you did for me without some hesitation or asking me to cool down.
0DI0003611	But you backed me, even when the odds were against us. Words aren't enough, but - thanks.
0DI0003612	Feels... I don't know. I guess I feel relieved. I don't know what I feel.
0DI0003613	Wait, that's not true. I think the NCR back West, when riled, is going to be the worst enemy the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan ever had.
0DI0003614	They're all so mired in procedure and paper out there, the kind of evidence we gave is going to be worse than shooting them.
0DI0003615	I think that settles accounts with me - and my men. That was some tricky political maneuvering, but worth it, even if it takes a few years.
0DI0003616	No... no, I know. Just hard to say how I feel right now.
0DI0003617	Don't care much for which one we kill first, whether settling accounts with McLafferty or making that bitch Gloria eat her hair.
0DI0003618	The Van Graffs are going to be tougher, so we'll likely get killed there. If we go to the Crimson Caravan camp, we'll just need a lot of bullets.
0DI0003619	Still, we give the Van Graffs the what-for, that means all those guns they used on my caravan - we can take and use on the Crimson Caravan.
0DI0003620	NCR? Are you out of your fucking mind?
0DI0003621	That'd take years... and with the war with the Legion, no way they're going to waste time running up the Crimson Caravan or the Van Graffs!
0DI0003622	And what makes you think any evidence can be found?
0DI0003623	All right, if you poke around the Van Graffs and Alice, fine.
0DI0003624	But if I see either one, go into their camp? I'm going to start shooting, no matter what you find.
0DI0003625	So there's just one more safe to crack? Hope you can get to it.
0DI0003626	Say what you will about the two leading ladies, they watch their lockers like crows. Still... you got one, so the other might not be impossible.
0DI0003627	If you get both, then let's talk. And... I appreciate you putting yourself at risk like this. Thanks.
0DI0003628	No shit. There it is, the blood, the motive, as clear as day. They must have penned these with snake venom.
0DI0003629	But... we got it, now what? Sure, this damns them, but only if someone listens.
0DI0003630	I held off on filling them full of holes, so unless you give me a good reason to cool my heels soon, I'm not waiting much longer.
0DI0003631	You're saying... they might need to do the same thing to each other some day. And evidence is easier than bullets.
0DI0003632	No... No, I'd agree with that. And Alice and Gloria are two crows that'd keep something like that in their nest.
0DI0003633	Well... Jackson in the Mojave Outpost could get it to folks in the West. I wouldn't trust anyone closer to the Colorado.
0DI0003634	And the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs have their heart back West. Not sure it'll do any good, though.
0DI0003635	All right, let's do it, listen to what he has to say.
0DI0003636	Up side of Vegas, hear tell. Trapped at the Mojave Outpost, so I wasn't able to run there when I heard.
0DI0003637	Been weeks since it was hit, so the site's probably a Cazador nest by now.
0DI0003638	Got word back on what happened from Rangers, guess they found enough in the wreckage to identify it.
0DI0003639	Only wishful thinking on my part, most likely. At the least, I'd like to pay my respects.
0DI0003640	I got them into this mess, I owe them that much.
0DI0003641	Well, I still wouldn't mind going there and crossing my heart a few times, if only to make me feel a bit better.
0DI0003643	Thanks, I appreciate it.
0DI0003644	Some of the caravan might be ash, but we were expecting raiders and over-inquisitive NCR border guards. There might be something left.
0DI0003645	If I'm there with you, shouldn't be hard to spot. And I'd prefer to see the bodies with my own eyes.
0DI0003646	Well, you have to know what to look for.
0DI0003647	No idea. Maybe catch the sun in their eyes? Maybe they wanted the caravan to come to them, walk into an ambush?
0DI0003648	We should check the wagon, they may not have got everything.
0DI0003649	Whatever we find, it's yours - least I can do for hoofing it all this way with me.
0DI0003650	Not sure, let's look around.
0DI0003651	Yeah, it's a ways, though, hell of a detour. You sure?
0DI0003652	Yeah, something's wrong, I can feel it.
0DI0003653	It's not any closer than the first, so if you'd rather let be, let me know.
0DI0003654	All right then, let's move out.
0DI0003655	Don't have to tell me twice, feel more alive than I ever have.
0DI0003657	Soldiers, no, recruits, yes. And the Mojave Outpost has been ordered to have a standing force at the NCR perimeter at all times.
0DI0003658	So sending anyone out reduces the Outpost's numbers and would be in direct violation of my orders from back West.
0DI0003659	Sending more troops, yes, to reinforce the Outpost, no. Troops head through here on their way to McCarran or to the frontlines at Forlorn Hope.
0DI0003660	Or they're on leave, on their way to New Vegas to piss away their pay. All of them, passing through.
0DI0003661	Frustrated? No. I have my orders - signed, and approved all the way up the chain from Kimball. And I understand the reasons.
0DI0003662	The Outpost isn't a Legion target, yet, not like Vegas or the Dam - but if the caravans get choked here, that's going to bite NCR hard.
0DI0003663	Anyway, didn't mean to talk your ear off. Some days... just feel like more requisition forms and daily reports come across my desk than results.
0DI0003664	What is it? Let me see.
0DI0003665	All right. This is... this explains a lot of the lost caravans. I thought it was Legion work, but...
0DI0003666	No. No, I can't. Because this evidence might be true... but it doesn't just implicate them.
0DI0003667	It's a motive for what happened up North, someone went cruising through both compounds, killed them all.
0DI0003668	I'm guessing that was you. If so, you're not leaving this outpost except in chains.
0DI0003669	I can, if you make me a promise.
0DI0003670	I need you to swear you won't take revenge on Gloria or Alice. If you do, then your case is over, and we can't see that justice is done.
0DI0003671	I know some things are hard to let go, but you and Miss Cassidy need to understand that, hear me?
0DI0003672	That'll have to do. God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
0DI0003673	If the Republics sinkhole-progress doesn't kill us, greed will. Thanks for bringing me this, I know revenge must have been tempting.
0DI0003674	For what it's worth, I appreciate you didn't shed any more blood. We need to save our strength for the Legion.
0DI0003675	God, what a mess. People turning against each other when the Mojave's at risk of falling?
0DI0003678	Hmmm. All right - you change your mind and start shooting, then I can't help you. Show up here after, I'll put you in chains.
0DI0003679	Get on now, I'll make sure this gets West and let the wheels of law start turning in the courts.
0DI0003680	I can promise that, what happens after... not even God himself could move the Congress in or out of session. And this... this is a tricky matter.
0DI0003681	I'll do what I can - and those folks that got killed need to be answered for.
0DI0003682	No, I mentioned you might accidentally get supplied, and I meant it. Not allowed to contract mercenaries at the Outpost.
0DI0003683	Still, a requisition form or two can get lost, and they're not going to come check... so here you go, just between us.
0DI0003684	Well, about time we got a soldier... and not a recruit, you look like you've seen some action.
0DI0003685	Come back when you've made some progress.
0DI0003686	All right, then. We'll need a couple ingredients to get started. Gonna want some Xander Root and a Broc Flower.
0DI0003687	Lemme think now... I know I've seen Broc Flowers growing up at the graveyard. And I seem to remember there being Xander Root over by the schoolhouse.
0DI0003688	Bring those on back to me, and we'll get cooking.
0DI0003689	Okay, say no more.
0DI0003690	One more thing I wanted to show you.
0DI0003691	Thought I might teach you about living off the land, and making useful things for yourself. Interested?
0DI0003692	Oh, I see. Well, I guess I'm off to see my admirer now.
0DI0003693	They were all dead, then. I suppose I'm not surprised. We have few friends in the world above, and many enemies.
0DI0003694	But we must turn our minds to other matters. When I sent out those patrols, I also sent three Knights out on scouting missions.
0DI0003695	When the patrols failed to return, we assumed the worst and sent a single communication to the scouts to hold position and maintain radio silence.
0DI0003696	I want you to contact those scouts and gather their reports. Like the patrols, they have devices on them that will enable you to track them.
0DI0003697	When you find them, tell them you're my representative and ask them if the bears are still hunting. That should get them to talk to you.
0DI0003698	Return when you've gathered all of their reports.
0DI0003700	See me as soon as you've found them.
0DI0003702	Return when you have found them.
0DI0003703	Remain diligent, outsider. If those patrols are in trouble, every second you delay lessens their chances of rescue.
0DI0003704	Sorry. I assumed the only reason you'd fight past a horde of Super mutants and pick the lock on my cell is if you heard my cry for help on the radio.
0DI0003705	But maybe you're just sightseeing. So, since the door's open and all, can I go now?
0DI0003706	Name's Raul. Raul Alfonso Tejada. I'm the mechanic around here.
0DI0003707	You forget about me already, boss? You sure you didn't take a blow to the head or something?
0DI0003708	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada. Can I leave now, or did you want to ask me again in five minutes?
0DI0003709	<Sigh.> No. No, boss, I'm, a prisoner of the crazy Super Mutant with the wig and the glasses. I was kind of hoping you were here to set me free.
0DI0003710	But maybe I'm not a pretty enough damsel for that, huh?
0DI0003711	Probably because it used to be Miguel's. Whoever he was. How about if you let me go, huh boss?
0DI0003712	Talk to me at my shack, I've at least got tools there.
0DI0003713	Oh, sure thing. I haven't even remotely grown sick of staring at this place.
0DI0003714	What?! No! I mean, I haven't seen her around for a while, but I thought she was just busy working.
0DI0003715	She was so beautiful... Now I'll never get to know her.
0DI0003717	I thought you weren't interested.
0DI0003718	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
0DI0003719	[FAILED] I don't know. I play all over. I'll never find him!
0DI0003720	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. All right. If his sentence was closing up I can see about getting him pardoned.
0DI0003721	Primm is important to our trade up from California, so having someone there who owes us a favor... that couldn't hurt.
0DI0003722	[FAILED] I don't think so. I'm not going to put my word on the line for some random convict.
0DI0003723	Well, having a sheriff who was a convict is better than no sheriff at all... and if he has the qualifications... all right, hand it over.
0DI0003724	If you had 200 caps, we could talk business - until then, we don't have anything to talk about.
0DI0003727	It has. It was a promising trade town - before the escape at the correctional facility. Lost a good bit of money at the Vikki and Vance.
0DI0003728	There is a NCR camp down on the southern border of Nevada. Camp Mojave I think, try to find someone of authority there.
0DI0003729	Okay, hurry back. I don't want anyone to start shooting at me.
0DI0003730	Alright, ask away.
0DI0003733	I have some free time, ask away.
0DI0003735	What we need, more than anything, is bodies.
0DI0003736	If we had just one more squad, we could easily install a sheriff and still handle our primary objective of protecting the interstate south of here.
0DI0003737	If you'd like to see the NCR include protection of Primm in its duties, then you'll have to get some more troops up here.
0DI0003738	Knight, at Mojave outpost, may be able to help.
0DI0003739	Okay, well let me know what she says.
0DI0003740	I'm glad I can count on you. Oh, and one other thing. The patrols each had a holotape detailing their missions that you can use to track them.
0DI0003741	The shielding of the bunker prevents us from actively tracking them, but their positions should show up on your map once you get to the surface.
0DI0003742	Should our worst fears become realized, please bring back all three of the holotapes from the patrols. Otherwise, bring our brothers home.
0DI0003743	I've given the order that you be given access to some of the equipment our scouts and patrols have scavenged over the years.
0DI0003744	You won't be allowed to purchase any prohibited equipment, but hopefully some of what's available will prove useful to you.
0DI0003745	I don't think it was as hard hit as DC or Bakersfield, but it was bad enough. By the time we got there, the city was a radioactive ruin.
0DI0003746	Still, the city was full of looters, already forming into the beginnings of raider tribes. Crime was bad before the War, but now it was a nightmare.
0DI0003747	We were living like scavengers, scraping by on what little food we could find, always looking for medicine for my burns.
0DI0003748	And then, of course, the radiation started to kick in, turning me into this handsome devil you see before you.
0DI0003749	Oh, sure, boss. I was always good at fixing things. Some I fixed for the town, some I fixed for other people, some I fixed just for the hell of it.
0DI0003750	It's a better way to use your hands than killing, and even then I wasn't getting any younger or faster.
0DI0003751	I lived there for a long time. Kept to myself, didn't get into any fights - hell, the only reason I even kept my guns oiled was professional pride.
0DI0003752	Getting there, boss. I'd been in Tuscon - the locals can call it Two-Sun all they want, but it's Tuscon, dammit - about 75 years when she showed up.
0DI0003753	Prettiest thing you ever saw, boss. Maybe it was just a trick of my senile brain, but I swear she looked just like my Rafaela. Her name was Claudia.
0DI0003754	She ended up taking work at one of the brothels in town. I never went to her, of course - how could I? But I looked after her in my own way.
0DI0003755	This was a long time ago. Before Caesar's Legion pacified Arizona and brought the raider tribes to heel.
0DI0003756	A tribe came into Tuscon one day - more a gang, really. Dirty Dave and his six brothers. They were looking for bullets, and I sold some to them.
0DI0003757	I figured if I did that, they'd leave town before they tore it up too much.
0DI0003758	No, boss. No they didn't.
0DI0003759	As I was saying, I hoped they'd leave the town in peace. Instead, they decided to stop at Claudia's brothel to take the edge off.
0DI0003760	I don't know which one of them got rowdy first, but by the time I heard the screams and got my guns, it was too late.
0DI0003761	They'd shot up the brothel, killed four girls, and taken Claudia for their sport.
0DI0003762	I went after Dave and his brothers. They had a head start, but they slept nights. I didn't. Took me three days to catch up to them.
0DI0003763	Claudia was dead when I got there. They'd put a bullet in each of her eyes. I couldn't do anything except avenge her, just like Rafaela.
0DI0003764	I charged into the middle of their camp and started firing - two of them were dead before they knew I was there. The other five, though....
0DI0003765	They shot the shit out of me. I would have died, I think, if I wasn't so full of rage.
0DI0003766	By being a meaner old cuss than the rest of them, boss. I wanted to keep living until they weren't, so I just kept shooting until they were all dead.
0DI0003767	I was in pretty bad shape in the end, though. I don't know how long I laid there with the sun baking me and the buzzards chomping at me.
0DI0003768	Eventually I got the strength to start moving. Some long time after that, I managed to drag my carcass back to town.
0DI0003769	When I recovered - more or less, anyways - I left Tuscon and headed west. I ran into Tabitha at Black Mountain and, well, the rest you know.
0DI0003770	I swore I was done with the gunslinging life - I was too old, too slow, and too beat up to protect anyone anymore.
0DI0003771	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize I've always had my doubts.
0DI0003774	After seeing what you go through, I think I made the right choice. So thanks for that, boss.
0DI0003777	I thought I was done forever... but after traveling with you, I realize that was the wrong decision. So thanks for that, boss.
0DI0003778	About whether I still had what it took to carry my pistols proudly, to use them to do what's right.
0DI0003779	And now that I've been traveling with you for a while, you've made me realize that I can still do that.
0DI0003780	Maybe I'm not as tough as I used to be, but my brains can make up for that, and my hands are still quick enough. It's time to put the guns back on.
0DI0003781	About whether I'm really too old to keep living the life of a gunslinger after all. And after seeing what you go through, boss, I think I am.
0DI0003782	From now on, I'll let you deal with the fighting and stick to keeping your gear working. I don't want to slow you down more than I already do.
0DI0003783	You can bet on that, boss.
0DI0003784	Thanks, boss. I'd hate to think I was disappointing you with my life-altering decision.
0DI0003785	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you're right, boss. These bones are too old for that kind of action.
0DI0003786	[FAILED] I'm sure you've got a lot of ideas, boss, but how about if you let me make this decision?
0DI0003787	Tell you what, I'll at least think about it for a while. Ask me about it again another time.
0DI0003788	[SUCCEEDED] You think so? Well... you're the boss. Okay, I'll give it a try.
0DI0003789	But if I get killed, and if there's an afterlife, I'll haunt your ass.
0DI0003790	[SUCCEEDED] Not at all! I'm never sure how much is normally charged for this sort of thing. Here's some additional caps - that should be enough.
0DI0003791	Now, how about spending some of those caps in the saloon?
0DI0003792	[FAILED] I could get another working radio with the caps I already gave you. Now, how about spending some of those caps right now?
0DI0003793	Well well, this is welcome news. Who is she?
0DI0003794	She's with those traders? They've tried to contact us before, but I'm not interested in trading with greedy savages.
0DI0003795	This presents a bit of a problem. Jack isn't allowed to leave Nellis, and I doubt she would make it through the artillery alive.
0DI0003797	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm, I suppose Jack deserves a chance at love. You can tell Jack she has a free pass to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
0DI0003798	Do not make me regret this decision, outsider.
0DI0003799	[FAILED] Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
0DI0003800	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I'd be wrong to deny Jack such joy in his life.
0DI0003801	He's done right by the tribe many times over. Tell Jack this girl is free to enter, but he is responsible for her actions.
0DI0003803	Very well, I'll take your word when you say she isn't a threat to the tribe. I will allow her entry if Jack will take responsibility for her.
0DI0003805	Sorry, but I can't risk exposing the tribe to more savage outsiders.
0DI0003807	I'd rather not allow more outsiders in, but I'll hear you out.
0DI0003808	Thanks. Watch your back out there. Never know when those Legion bastards might show up.
0DI0003809	What is it, Veronica?
0DI0003810	Hardin. Er, Elder. I know why we're failing.
0DI0003811	Do you?
0DI0003812	As long as we hide in here, ignoring the outside, our days are numbered.
0DI0003813	For once, I agree.
0DI0003814	You do?
0DI0003815	We can't let people go on believing the Brotherhood has lost its teeth.
0DI0003816	We must strike while our enemies are distracted with each other.
0DI0003817	Strike? That's how we got into this problem in the first place. We can't beat these armies.
0DI0003818	Our entire two hundred years of history say that a handful of troops with the best equipment and training can stand up to any army.
0DI0003819	And the loss of HELIOS One says things are different now.
0DI0003820	That was a failure of strategy, not philosophy. If Father El- the Elder in charge were a Paladin and not a Scribe-
0DI0003821	Our arrogance would still have been our downfall.
0DI0003822	History says otherwise.
0DI0003823	Maybe it's time you start looking forward.
0DI0003824	Let's go. We're wasting our time.
0DI0003825	Yeah, boss?
0DI0003828	Really? Thanks for the reminder, boss, I'd almost forgotten.
0DI0003829	You're a poet of understatement, boss. But there were moments it was almost worth it. I still remember finding that novelty costume shop.
0DI0003830	I was just looking for something I could slice up to wrap my burns when I saw the vaquero outfit hanging on the rack, like it hadn't been touched.
0DI0003831	I took it - not like anybody else needed it, you know? - and wore it back to our camp. Rafaela laughed for the first time since the bombs had fallen.
0DI0003832	It was. I started to build up a legend. Sometimes it headed off trouble, but most of the time it just started more.
0DI0003833	Young punks looking to prove themselves would come looking for me, but my eyes were sharp and my guns were quick.
0DI0003834	For a whle it seemed like we might even survive there, until... until Rafaela.
0DI0003835	She went out to find some food one day. I was sick, so I stayed at our camp. I guess it must have been the beginnings of radiation poisoning.
0DI0003836	Anyway, it was supposed to be safe, but some raiders happened to pass through where she was scavenging. I won't speak of what they did to her.
0DI0003837	When I found her body, the only way to recognize her was this funny little scar on her knee from when she was a little girl.
0DI0003838	Terrible doesn't begin to cover it, boss. I'd let my whole family down - first the ranch, now Rafaela. I was the last Tejada.
0DI0003839	I guess maybe I went a little crazy then. I took my guns, and I went back to that market. I didn't have many bullets, but I had enough.
0DI0003840	After the raiders were dead, I salvaged what I could from the store. I was tired... I just wanted to be alone forever.
0DI0003841	I left Mexico City behind. I made my way out to the Gulf Coast, eventually I found an old Petro-Chico refinery nobody had claimed.
0DI0003842	I stayed there for a little while, and I thought a lot about my life. I thought about the guns I'd lived by and what they'd gotten me.
0DI0003843	I decided my guns hadn't gotten me anything, and it was time to give it up. I took off that old vaquero outfit, and put on a Petro-Chico jumpsuit.
0DI0003844	The name tag said "Miguel," so I started using the name myself. Eventually I made it to Arizona... but that's another story, boss.
0DI0003845	Yup.
0DI0003846	[SUCCEEDED] Robbed some people, burned some things, killed a few guys.
0DI0003847	[FAILED] Like I said, mind your own damn business.
0DI0003848	Yeah, forget about it.
0DI0003850	Sure do. I run the courier office out of my shop. Leastaways I did before things went to hell around here.
0DI0003851	Primm? Hayes' unit is stationed up there, were having problems with some of the NCRCF convicts. What can I help you with?
0DI0003852	I'd like to help - but we can't spare any more units. We have to maintain a minimum headcount at the Outpost, orders from the West.
0DI0003853	One of the Powder Gangers? They've been nothing but trouble for us - why would we want one of them anywhere in an official capacity?
0DI0003854	[SUCCEEDED] I see the wisdom in that. I'll radio for a unit to head up to Primm and offer some additional support.
0DI0003855	[FAILED] NCR is not in the habit of buying and selling towns... unless that was some sort of joke on your part.
0DI0003856	Fine, I will, jackass.
0DI0003857	You can have your shit back, I don't need it or want it. You go your way, I'm going mine.
0DI0003858	And don't try looking for me - it was a mistake to show up in the Mojave in the first place, and I'm not about to repeat that mistake twice.
0DI0003859	You son of a bitch. You know, I was just going to give you a piece of my mind and now? Now I'm going to put you down.
0DI0003860	Who you are comes from the choices you make when life gets tough.
0DI0003861	So if you're saying that life is dragging you down, I don't buy it. You better start changing your attitude, or I'm heading back West, you hear?
0DI0003862	You're seriously going to draw on me? Fine, do it, see what happens.
0DI0003863	[SUCCEEDED] Well... all right. I'll stick around for a little while longer, but if you get out of line again...
0DI0003864	[FAILED] That's your excuse?
0DI0003867	[SUCCEEDED] I'll hold you to that promise, then. I'm not known for my patience, though.
0DI0003868	[FAILED] Inside? Yeah, must be deep inside, all right.
0DI0003869	[SUCCEEDED] All right... maybe I was a little harsh. I can be that way.
0DI0003870	[FAILED] Trying's the same thing as giving up, the way you're saying it.
0DI0003871	You need to be tougher. If you let the Mojave get you down, then you've given up on life.
0DI0003872	So straighten out, stop being so shifty and... downright mean, and see if that doesn't change your outlook.
0DI0003873	Fuck that. You can walk the road to hell on your own.
0DI0003875	No. This is something for me to deal with. But I'm glad you're here.
0DI0003876	NCR border guard duty mostly. It's our job to make sure the caravans can move safely along I-15 and Highway 95.
0DI0003877	Not the best posting or assignment, but it beats being sent East, or patrolling the Colorado. Legion's pretty thick there.
0DI0003878	Me, I'm Knight - Major Knight. I've been stuck here dealing with these caravans for ages now, but somebody's gotta do it.
0DI0003879	It ain't so bad. If Caesar's Legion decides to push West through Nipton ol' Mojave Outpost here will be the front line.
0DI0003880	A man who shot you.
0DI0003881	Fine, then, not trying to pry. Just wondering what would make a Courier run around the desert without a contract is all. Forget I asked.
0DI0003882	And you got better.
0DI0003883	Two shots in the head without an Auto-Doc is a lot of patching. Hope you thanked him properly.
0DI0003884	Who's this snake that put bullets in your head? Did he have cause, or...?
0DI0003885	So he robbed you? Robbing a courier's low, and any family or group he's with is going to get a black eye for it.
0DI0003886	Caravan code of the wastes is you don't fuck with the one who brings you your mail, and you don't fuck with your supply line.
0DI0003887	Hope this shithead knows what he's in for. From both of us... what's his name?
0DI0003888	Well if it wasn't before, it is now.
0DI0003889	Did he bother to introduce himself, or did he not take you for somebody who'd get up again when killed?
0DI0003890	Can't say I've heard the name. Or heard about any man dressed like a seat cover.
0DI0003891	Bad suit, huh? Well, if assholes had taste, we'd all be feasting on shit.
0DI0003892	Still... suit means money, and suits stand out, especially here in the Mojave. One of the larger towns, or Vegas, might be the place to go.
0DI0003893	Don't you worry, though, we'll sort this asshole out, rattle his cage a little.
0DI0003894	Does it come with its own Deathclaw? Trust me, if you can't see it, something just as nasty's waiting.
0DI0003895	Whole Lucky 38... the idea that there's this casino in the middle of a town of people, and only you're ever let inside?
0DI0003896	Feels like other places I've been. Something that isolated from everyday folks starts to take on a bad shine.
0DI0003897	No, of course not. I... don't know what I'm going to do now with Rhonda back...
0DI0003898	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is he a friend of yours?
0DI0003899	It is, Mistress Tabitha. How I've missed you so. This stranger here fixed me up right as rain. Is she a friend of yours?
0DI0003900	R-Rhonda? Is that you?
0DI0003901	It's just... such a shock to see Rhonda up and about again. I'm not sure what to do now.
0DI0003902	Mistress Tabitha, we should be heading off. Our journey has been much delayed, but we can catch up if we hurry.  Come along, now.
0DI0003903	Yes, Rhonda.
0DI0003904	Where? Like Vegas? Chewed and spit enough friends out. East? Get put in one of Caesar's little "camps?" No thanks.
0DI0003905	Head back West? I already know the Big Circle and everyone in it - 'cept now I go back there, ruined.
0DI0003906	Never really realized how small the Mojave's getting nowadays, hard to find a place to go to that's worthwhile.
0DI0003907	Hnh. Maybe you're right. Brimmed hats always throw me off.
0DI0003908	Well, fine, whatever, they can be shaking each other's dicks, wouldn't change the Mojave now.
0DI0003909	I'm fair with chucking dynamite and not bad with a pistol, if I do say so myself. Carry a knife, too, but that's more for practical reasons.
0DI0003910	Prefer settling things with my fists, though. Made more friends than corpses in bar fights - plan on keeping it that way.
0DI0003911	Don't think I'm some kind of Vault City pacifist, though - if things get heated, I'll start shooting, trust me.
0DI0003912	Short of caps is what taught me, mostly. Ammo's expensive... so I learned to make every shot count.
0DI0003913	And hear tell, my Dad was a crack shot, so I don't want to dirty the family name. Not out of pride - respect.
0DI0003914	Dynamite's for when you don't have enough bullets, want to clear a pass, or scare off Geckos from a caravan.
0DI0003915	Some of the twisters out of the Divide can block off a pass in no time, so you learn how to handle powder so you don't get trapped somewhere.
0DI0003916	Any event, I prefer shooting if it comes down to an argument. Don't worry, I'll carry my weight if a disagreement arises.
0DI0003917	"It's the company?" That has got to be the biggest load of Brahmin shit I've ever heard.
0DI0003918	Still, if you got more like that...
0DI0003919	Jackson might have something for you, if you haven't already spoken to that old buzzard.
0DI0003920	He was looking to try and get troops to clear the north road. You can find him over in the other building - the one without a bar.
0DI0003921	So you're looking for someone to help, not just tag along? Hnh.
0DI0003922	Oh, that's got just the right bite of judgment to it, stings a little, too. Did you hear that from a Followers preacher?
0DI0003923	I bet you could preach all day, who knows what other little bits of wisdom might spill out.
0DI0003924	Didn't ask Mom to elaborate. Never heard her complain about his bedroom behavior, only complain he wasn't around to do it no more.
0DI0003925	Hnh. The Outpost lost its charm about three bottles ago, and that was just this morning.
0DI0003926	So fighting boredom is your argument, huh?
0DI0003927	Aside from the TV-faced robots, the dust, and the old man smell in every room? Nothing, it's a paradise.
0DI0003928	This place has the Old World Blues about it. Everything in here feels like it should have passed on a long time ago.
0DI0003929	Hell, it's hard to believe Vegas is right outside. So, yeah, I'm looking to leave whenever you're ready.
0DI0003930	Thank god, the sooner the better.
0DI0003931	Not sure if I chose it or it chose me. Dad ran a bar a long time ago, and it was a labor of love, Mom said. Didn't sound like it made her happy.
0DI0003932	Still, I'm guessing I got some of Dad's love of whiskey in me, because the burn suits me fine.
0DI0003933	Used to call me "Whiskey Rose" back West, before I punched enough people, so now they say it, but quiet and when I'm not around.
0DI0003934	Yeah, on account of my name... and the blossoms on my cheeks when I drink too much.
0DI0003935	Won most of those fights, too. Can take a hell of a punch and give it right back when I've got a bottle in me.
0DI0003936	It's all in how you drink it, though - there's a trick to it. When we pass the bottle, I'll show you how it's done.
0DI0003937	Yeah, he's been with NCR so long all he can see is the worst outcome of everything - so he doesn't do anything.
0DI0003938	All right? No, I'm not all right.
0DI0003939	Drinking to forget, and it's only getting me mad instead. Whiskey always gets my temper up - now more than ever.
0DI0003940	Drinking used to cause all sorts of trouble back West - before I punched enough people, that is, and they learned to lay low when the whiskey hit.
0DI0003941	Lost my caravan heading north, the driver burned to ash - and they didn't even take the cargo, they just burned that, too.
0DI0003942	Yeah, if you couldn't tell, I'm not from around here and I'm not NCR. I run a caravan... or did.
0DI0003943	Don't worry, not looking to throw punches just yet. And something tells me hitting you would be a mistake I wouldn't want to repeat.
0DI0003944	My guess is Legion, they're trying to cut NCR's supply line... and the Mojave Outpost is proof. Got us locked up tighter than a New Vegas virgin.
0DI0003945	No caravans in, out, and just try arguing with Jackson about it. "Roads aren't safe," he says.
0DI0003946	No shit, you washed-out old fuckup, I didn't need a Brotherhood Scribe to tell me that.
0DI0003947	NCR officer, trooper, whatever - runs the place. He's over in the main building, the one without a bar.
0DI0003948	Jackson won't let me head north, it's not safe... and even though my caravan's gone, my caravan papers are keeping me here.
0DI0003949	So if you came here for work, my advice? Go find the Crimson Caravan branch, south of Vegas. They can help you out.
0DI0003950	Drink. Got a lot of memories to drown. If I die while doing it, so be it. Got nowhere else to go.
0DI0003951	Sure am. Burned for the last time, and this time, it's for good. Worse, it's not done kicking me - I'm still trapped here.
0DI0003952	Yeah, well, you aren't me, so good-for-fucking-you.
0DI0003953	Trouble's already come and went, so anything you bring will make my next drink go down easier.
0DI0003956	You're looking at it. It's a watering hole without much to brag about.
0DI0003957	It's like a Brahmin drive gone wrong - supposed to be a gate north, but you come here, you get caught in the pen. Better to head back home.
0DI0003958	If you don't have a gun and a will, don't matter much what you do when you reach here, except stare at that fucking monument outside.
0DI0003959	Don't even tell me you missed it coming in. It's like NCR showing its dick to all the East.
0DI0003960	If the Republic put as much effort into protecting the East as they put into those two asinine giants outside, then they'd be worth that monument.
0DI0003961	Statues of two men shaking hands covered in blood don't seem to be nothing to brag about.
0DI0003962	I'm speaking figurative, isn't any blood on their damn hands. Course, when Caesar comes walking through here, there'll be blood for real.
0DI0003963	And after the blood dries in the sun, he'll melt that piece of Jet-induced sculpture down, and reshape it into a bull.
0DI0003964	Which by my reckoning is making up for a deficiency of his. But no matter what the state of his pecker, he's sure giving the West a good fucking.
0DI0003965	One's a ranger, one's an NCR trooper, supposed to represent unification of West and East... or some such shit.
0DI0003966	As far as those two iron lovebirds go, they've got more spine than you'll see in a year from the NCR government.
0DI0003967	Whiskey and me are old friends, keeps me going when times get rough. Like now.
0DI0003968	Got me into the caravan business, you know - had to start transporting water instead of liquor, though.
0DI0003969	If I hadn't switched over, I'd end my trip with nothing but glass bottles rattling on the back of the Brahmin.
0DI0003970	If you're looking to sign on with a caravan, no - traders are bottled up tight here.
0DI0003971	Caravan work's up north, check with the Crimson Caravan, maybe. Gun Runners might have work, wouldn't know for sure, though.
0DI0003972	Still, if you got a gun, guts, and feeling like going on patrol, might be some of the soldiers around here have work for you.
0DI0003974	Yeah, her name's... Ghost or something... fucking scary, ooooooh. Guess it's cause you'll never see her 'til your dead.
0DI0003975	NCR and their goddamn nicknames, as if Caesar himself's gonna piss and run if he hears them.
0DI0003976	Anyway, go on and head up top, ask her what's going on, if you haven't already. I don't much give a shit.
0DI0003977	Whatever you say, boss. I'll just stay back here and be quiet in case you have a sudden flash of brilliance you need to share.
0DI0003978	Yeah. That's what I thought, too.
0DI0003979	Old history, boss.
0DI0003980	Yeah, it beats dying alone in the Wasteland because you were too slow.
0DI0003981	That fear has always been a part of my life.
0DI0003982	Maybe... but what if you miss the old days, sometimes?
0DI0003983	A memory from a long time ago.
0DI0003984	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you.
0DI0003985	Just a few days after Mexico City was vaporized, refugees started pouring down the road to our ranch. We helped who we could, but there were so many.
0DI0003986	Eventually, my father started turning people away before we ran out of food. Things got violent. My father and I got our guns, and we drove them off.
0DI0003987	About two dozen men came back in the night, after we'd gone to sleep. They set fire to the ranch house and barred the doors from the outside.
0DI0003988	My whole family was trapped inside. I smelled the smoke and got myself and my little sister, Rafaela, out though a window, but everyone else....
0DI0003989	My parents, my grandmother, my two brothers and two of my sisters all died.
0DI0003990	Rafaela and I ran. We were pursued by some of the men who attacked our home, but I was always a good shot.
0DI0003991	The ones who came after us, I killed. The rest, I left be. I had to take care of Rafaela, not throw my life away on revenge.
0DI0003992	Maybe. I don't know. All I know is that for all my skill with a pistol, I couldn't help them.
0DI0003993	Anyway, that was weighing on my mind. Thanks for letting me get it out in the open, boss.
0DI0003994	I know that, boss. That's not what I'm getting at. I'm just getting sentimental in my old age. Anyways, forget it. Just wanted that off my chest.
0DI0003995	Maybe we made a mistake. It was early on, we didn't know just how serious it was out there.
0DI0003996	But to say they deserved it? What kind of devil are you, boss?
0DI0003997	After Hoover Dam, the leaderless Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility vanished into the wastes, leaving the prison empty.
0DI0003998	The Correctional Facility became another abandoned ruin in the wasteland, its carcass occasionally picked over by enterprising prospectors.
0DI0003999	With the Dam firmly in their grasp, the NCR turned its attention towards wresting the Correctional Facility from Powder Ganger hands.
0DI0004000	The Powder Gangers are no match for the battle-hardened troops of the NCR, and summary execution awaited the Powder Gangers who managed to survive.
0DI0004001	Most Powder Gangers at the Correctional Facility fled into the wasteland rather than face the advancing forces of the Legion.
0DI0004002	Those brave or foolish to remain were killed or crucified by the merciless Legionaries.
0DI0004003	The NCR, battered by the loss of the Dam, were unable to devote any troops to retaking the Correctional Facility from the Powder Gangers.
0DI0004004	As a result, Powder Ganger raids on caravans became an unfortunate fact of life in the Mojave for years to come.
0DI0004005	And I suppose you're taking credit for the deed, fiend! I will avenge her!
0DI0004006	I'll just wait here for Mistress Tabitha.
0DI0004007	Ethel, darling! I'll... I'll join you soon again! Someone's gonna pay first, though.
0DI0004008	Sounds good to me.
0DI0004009	What, you mean like spears? No, none of that. Mom was a tribal, but she didn't teach me anything like that.
0DI0004010	You know, like one of the tribes from the East - we got 'em out West, too. NCR's herding 'em up, though, domesticating them.
0DI0004011	Mom was from East of the Colorado, though, not sure what tribe. Was before the time Caesar rounded them up, made them Legion.
0DI0004012	She walked a hell of a way until she crossed paths with my Dad and he convinced her to stop walking. And lucky for me, he was a horny old bastard.
0DI0004013	Not much to tell. He ended up walking East one day when I was young and never came back. Not a family deserter like some, though.
0DI0004014	Mom died waiting for him, and she had me to raise. She was sick but she held off dying until I was old enough to be getting into trouble with boys.
0DI0004015	As for Dad, I figure he just got himself lost or dead. Happens... and I'm not all boo-hoo about it, so save your glass for someone who's crying.
0DI0004016	Not a clue. When he left, I was too in my crib to understand why, and around the time Mom passed, I was too into my teens to listen.
0DI0004017	Got his name, got this pendant, and that's about it.
0DI0004018	Gift from my Dad, along with my name. Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
0DI0004019	Mom said he got the name out of some Old World book about dirt pilgrims. Name sure sounds sweet, though.
0DI0004020	Anyway, pendant's a little rose. Originally thought it was one of Mom's tribal necklaces, but no, came from Dad.
0DI0004021	Well, keep it away from me, won't have anything to do with it.
0DI0004022	My father had heart problems, and it ran down the family tree to me.
0DI0004023	Not looking to have my heart skip its last beat, even if I considered putting that junk in my system, which I don't.
0DI0004024	Go with you? And why the hell would I do that.
0DI0004025	You got one too many by my count.
0DI0004029	Okay, boss. When you feel like availing yourself of my centuries of experience, you know where I'll be.
0DI0004030	Sure, boss. I know you've got a lot on your mind, what with all that wandering the empty desert wastes.
0DI0004031	You think so, boss? Because I remember a time when a lot of people stuck to their duty no matter what.
0DI0004032	It ended with nuclear bombs falling on my hometown.
0DI0004033	Even if he can't use them any more? Isn't that like asking you to come up with one of your brilliant schemes after suffering a crippling head wound?
0DI0004034	Err, another one, I mean?
0DI0004035	That's what I love about you, boss; the pity you show for the less fortunate than you.
0DI0004036	You're preaching to the choir here, boss. Once a man's prime is behind him, he should let it go.
0DI0004037	I guess it reminds me of my own life.
0DI0004038	It's a question I've asked myself often enough.
0DI0004039	He reminds me of me in some ways.
0DI0004040	Not really, boss, no.
0DI0004041	Would it surprise you to know I used to be a gunslinging adventurer?
0DI0004044	Sure, boss. Whenever's good for you - I've probably got three, maybe four months before I keel over.
0DI0004045	What do you have in mind?
0DI0004046	Hey, who doesn't enjoy a little pinch and squeal every once in a while?
0DI0004047	Few children are, especially when they are born during a relatively safe time in our history.
0DI0004048	Our children are protected from the outside world, but they are not ignorant of the dangers it holds.
0DI0004049	Really, Outsider? I'm open to ideas.
0DI0004050	I agree. That is why we do everything we can to teach the children from birth to defend themselves and serve the tribe.
0DI0004051	All of us are trained in combat and farming from a very early age. When we reach adulthood, we serve in whatever capacity we are best suited.
0DI0004055	That's too bad. I was hoping to melt some more down for machining.
0DI0004056	Great, that's all I need to get the rebreather to work right. I don't think you'd want to start breathing water halfway down.
0DI0004057	If there were any survivors, they're going to be in the Town Hall. If you can get inside, let me know if you find anyone.
0DI0004058	Well, if you can help, I'd appreciate it. Need to get these caravans moving.
0DI0004059	Oh my fucking god... get away from me, all three... four of you, don't need your...
0DI0004060	Oh god, I think I'm going to be sick, and you... you look fine.
0DI0004061	Well, guess you're a little tougher than I thought... still, looks like you're feeling it, eh, slick?
0DI0004062	You... you all right? You took a little spill there, one moment you're smiling, then...
0DI0004063	Still, Jackson's not letting me out of his sight as long as there's still trouble up North.
0DI0004064	You settle things with him, help the others around here, too, I'll sign the paper if it means getting out of here.
0DI0004065	Walking the Mojave with you can't be any worse than here, that's for sure. All right, I'm in.
0DI0004066	Now, onto settle accounts with Gloria Van Graff. Putting her down would suit me just fine.
0DI0004067	Might be a little tougher than the Crimson Caravan - Van Graffs are like a nest of rattlers, and the guns they've got are Brotherhood-caliber.
0DI0004068	Now, onto settle accounts with Alice McLafferty. Putting her down - that would suit me just fine.
0DI0004069	Can't wait to see the look on her face when I show up. She'll know why.
0DI0004070	Payback's a bitch, ladies, and between Gloria and Alice, that settles accounts, as far as I'm concerned.
0DI0004071	Hope they're in hell right now, blinking, trying to figure out where they fucked up.
0DI0004073	They want to buy Cassidy Caravans? Don't they know it's burned to ash?
0DI0004074	No... even times being what they are, not sure I'm looking to sell, even for all the whiskey in Reno.
0DI0004075	Mojave happened - hit by raiders packing some heavy firepower. Can't believe the Crimson Caravan haven't heard.
0DI0004076	So if you want to buy all of Cassidy Caravans, you're looking at it - and what I got in my pockets. Still, as little as that is, not looking to sell.
0DI0004077	If someone came up to you and offered you a thousand caps for your name, would you take it?
0DI0004078	Actually, you know what, fuck it, I don't want to hear your answer anyway.
0DI0004079	Point is, I made the caravan what it is, it's mine.
0DI0004080	Alice McLafferty, eh? No, I see the zeroes... and I know she's good for them.
0DI0004081	Still, it's not about the money. Dad'd spin like a twister if he ever heard I sold our name for anything.
0DI0004082	[SUCCEEDED] You're obviously putting your money where your mouth is - on top of that offer letter, that is a lot of caps.
0DI0004083	Still... what makes you think that's enough. What, you think I'm cheap?
0DI0004084	[FAILED] "Just a name?" You obviously don't know me at all to sweet talk me like that.
0DI0004085	You take your letter, pay my respects to Alice, then kindly go fuck yourself.
0DI0004086	[SUCCEEDED] You challenging me? Serious now.
0DI0004087	All right, you come here, armed with whiskey, we'll make a sport of it.
0DI0004088	And none of that radioactive shit, I'm talking whiskey, not Dixon Whiskey - whiskey.
0DI0004089	[FAILED] You are definitely barking up the wrong bar stool. Whatever you're suggesting, not interested.
0DI0004090	Old name? What old name?
0DI0004091	All right, it's a deal, hand over that paper. Hnh. Can't believe I'm parting with it.
0DI0004092	All right... there you go, caravan's yours. Feel kind of relieved, actually. Guess I didn't realize how much I was carrying around with just the name.
0DI0004093	So you're telling me, I could take this money you're offering, give them nothing, and then go on to strike up another caravan, same as before?
0DI0004094	What kind of fucking negotiator are you? Hope Alice knows the kind of snake she's got working for her.
0DI0004095	[SUCCEEDED] What did you just say to me? Cause you sure as hell got my attention now.
0DI0004096	[FAILED] Yeah, yeah I will, and you sure as hell aren't taking it. Can't believe I was even listening to you.
0DI0004097	Another?!
0DI0004098	No... no, I... you got me beat. I'm done, caravan's yours. Give me that paper, I'll... phew... put my name to it.
0DI0004099	You want... want to drink more?
0DI0004100	<Laughs> All right, all right, you just hang on to the bar here... that's it.
0DI0004101	Didn't take you for the toughest courier in the West when you walked in, but you walked all the way to the Outpost, so at least you have guts.
0DI0004102	You know you put up a good fight. I'm impressed.
0DI0004103	Thing is, I really just wanted an excuse to drink - should last me for a while.
0DI0004104	Might just be the whiskey talking, but I think I might feel a whole lot better leaving the caravan business behind me...
0DI0004105	Makes me a little teary-eyed, but now I've got a bottle to put 'em in. Hand over that paper, I'll put my name to it.
0DI0004106	Awwww. Now ain't that sweet.
0DI0004107	Was reminded why I left this place soon as I walked in. Let's go.
0DI0004108	Deep? Ain't deep by half. Closed down the bar yesterday, going to close it again today - rinse and repeat.
0DI0004109	A sober woman might take insult at that. Me, I might just bust you one.
0DI0004110	If you ain't drinking, then leave. If you're making to see if I'm an easy lay, I got a caravan shotgun that'll cure that desire right quick.
0DI0004111	"How about a drink?" How about a couple, is what you mean.
0DI0004112	Well, let me know when it is.
0DI0004113	Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste, and you're about to stop being a pain in my ass.
0DI0004114	That's just fucking great. I knew you didn't have what it takes from the start, but would Glory listen to me? No.
0DI0004115	Still, my sister has plans for you, so I'll cut you a break. You bring the girl here, and I'll take care of the fun part. That's fair, eh?
0DI0004116	Yeah, if you brought her back here. Is she behind you or something? 'Cause I don't see her.
0DI0004117	Now stop stalling, get out there, and do your fucking job already. Sheesh.
0DI0004118	You take care now.
0DI0004119	Look, I know you came all this way, and that takes some drive, especially these days.
0DI0004120	Just doesn't feel right, trading history for a slip of paper.
0DI0004121	[SUCCEEDED] That... that's a good point, it's the caravan clearance that's got me stuck here. I'm sure this bar's getting tired of propping me up.
0DI0004122	[FAILED] I got a bar, men who don't say a word, and plenty of whiskey, I'm fine.
0DI0004123	Me, that's who. I'm not going to let it go just yet. There... there might be some survivors... or...
0DI0004124	Who am I kidding. There's nothing left, and I wouldn't be here, drinking in some shitty bar in the ass end of nowhere if it wasn't true.
0DI0004125	That's fair. But there's been that voice inside me saying the same thing, and whiskey wasn't killing it.
0DI0004126	Give me that paper, I'll put my name to it. No sense trying to hold the past between your fingers when it's nothing but dirt.
0DI0004128	That's the question I been asking myself.
0DI0004129	Take care now.
0DI0004130	No idea. Maybe... head back West? Though the idea of heading back there with my tail between my legs isn't appealing.
0DI0004131	I'll be waiting, then. And training.
0DI0004132	All right then, I already got a head start, but I'll go first anyway.
0DI0004134	Oh, God, I don't know if I can do this.
0DI0004135	Hey, the gang's all here! Let's give the Mojave something to remember us by.
0DI0004136	I never thought I'd see you again. I'm glad you're here.
0DI0004137	Hey, the gang's all here!
0DI0004138	Sorry about that. Just because I love them doesn't mean some of them aren't assholes.
0DI0004139	Step into my office.
0DI0004140	Hey, a dress! Thank you! I'm totally trying this on later.
0DI0004141	Aw, you shouldn't have! It's just my taste. Thank you.
0DI0004142	See? Just because it doesn't shoot lasers doesn't mean it's not worth looking into. We could do amazing things with this data.
0DI0004143	Hey. I, uh, I can't go in with you. I'll wait here, okay?
0DI0004144	Huh. Figured it'd have more buttons and dials and stuff, you know? Oh, well. It's still the electronic equivalent of a disease from Gomorrah.
0DI0004145	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
0DI0004146	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Look what they're wearing! I've only seen dresses like those in my dreams. And even then I couldn't afford them.
0DI0004147	<Gasps> For me? Do you mean it? No, no, it's too much! Well, okay. But it's too much! It's perfect. Thank you. Thank you.
0DI0004148	I... wish I had something to give you. I- wait! What about punching? That's the gift that keeps on giving.
0DI0004149	I could work on your punching with you, if you like. Show you how to counter like a Scribe.
0DI0004150	All right, put 'em up. Let's see what you got.
0DI0004151	You sure? Some other time, then.
0DI0004152	Yeah. I've been taking things apart and putting them back together since before I said my first word.
0DI0004153	You want to build something, talk to me, and we can do it right there on the spot. Workbenches are for novices.
0DI0004154	Who knows, I might even be able to show you a Brotherhood trick or two.
0DI0004155	Nowhere specific. I just know there are a lot of groups who're actually doing well for themselves out here.
0DI0004156	I want to understand how and why. See them at work.
0DI0004157	Don't take too long, all right?
0DI0004158	Thanks. Wasn't wild about sticking around here on my own.
0DI0004159	I'll send some guys to check out your story, but that's some good news for a change.
0DI0004160	Word will probably spread about this, and quickly. The NCR'll know not to come around these parts if they know what's good for 'em.
0DI0004161	You've helped us plenty, so I'll tell you what. Just this once, name whatever you want, and if I can make it happen, it's done.
0DI0004162	Don't rush it, though. Toss it around in your head a little. You only get one favor from The King.
0DI0004163	Sorry about that, friend.
0DI0004164	There's a human down the path. Tabitha's orders are to kill all human intruders. Go!
0DI0004165	Well, a deputy isn't much good without a sheriff. So I figured I'd come in here and protect these good people until someone finds us a new one.
0DI0004166	You must be the courier folks have been talking about. Word on the radio is that someone wronged you back in Goodsprings.
0DI0004167	The Mojave has a way of burning decent people up, but it sounds like you've done right by the NCR. It's appreciated. Now what can I do for you?
0DI0004168	I know a bit about you, courier. Heard someone messed you up pretty bad over in Goodsprings. I heard a few other things too. Some good, but not all.
0DI0004169	If you're going to be associating with rangers, you'd best stay on their friendly side. With that out of the way, what can I do for you?
0DI0004170	I'm surprised to see you here. Folks with your kind of reputation, I expect to see them cooking in the sand with some .44 slugs to keep them company.
0DI0004171	If the rangers haven't caught up to you yet, they will. Myself excluded, of course. The only thing I catch up on now is chair time.
0DI0004172	I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting before. What can I do for you?
0DI0004173	Be seeing you. Maybe.
0DI0004174	Good. That'll save us some time.
0DI0004175	The training might take several hours, so keep that in mind.
0DI0004176	Not sure what my parents would think of me fighting for the NCR.
0DI0004177	But for New Vegas it seemed like this was the best chance at stability. I don't regret it.
0DI0004178	Never sided with a group of marauders before. But I think the Brotherhood stands a better chance against them than they did against the NCR.
0DI0004179	That gives me some hope.
0DI0004180	For some reason, it warms my heart that we fought for the kooky old geezer. Guess he reminds me of someone.
0DI0004181	Independent New Vegas. If that isn't redundant, I don't know what is.
0DI0004182	But I like its chances.
0DI0004183	If you take trying to keep me as far away from Hidden Valley as possible because I ask too many difficult questions as a sign of respect, oh yeah.
0DI0004184	That's not to say I don't get along with them. I just think they don't know what to do with me sometimes.
0DI0004185	It was the Dam, really. We'd heard rumors it was working. Figured we could claim it, put it to use.
0DI0004186	And... it may also have been partly that our Elder at the time had worn out his welcome.
0DI0004187	Didn't end up mattering. We got sidetracked at HELIOS One and the NCR took the Dam in the meantime. We're still after it, though. In theory.
0DI0004188	Ever been nosy?
0DI0004189	I was, once. We were pretty young, but I like to think it was love.
0DI0004190	She left the Brotherhood. Wanted to put some distance between herself and her parents.
0DI0004191	Since our membership isn't open to outsiders, some members think that obligates all of us to procreate.
0DI0004192	You can guess which camp her parents belonged to.
0DI0004193	No. Couldn't bring myself to leave everyone else behind. Couldn't convince her to stay, either.
0DI0004194	I'd hoped love would be enough to influence her decision, but it wasn't. We were both too stubborn.
0DI0004195	I don't know where she is now, but I'm sure she's moved on. I still think about her, though. Once in a while.
0DI0004196	Ooo. Got any juicy gossip?
0DI0004198	Who knows? It might stay abandoned, get used as a base for raiders, or even become another colony for mutants.
0DI0004199	The future is not written, human, and it is foolish to squint at what cannot be seen.
0DI0004200	Be safe, human. And thanks again for everything.
0DI0004201	What? No! I thought you were supposed to be here to help, and here you are making accusations.
0DI0004202	Yeah, if he vouches for you, I guess I can trust you.
0DI0004203	You were just curious. No harm in that. I'm just worried sick about my friend here.
0DI0004204	Yeah, the docs say he's going to be laid up for a while, assuming he doesn't get any worse.
0DI0004205	[SUCCEEDED] O-Of course not! We're here to serve the good citizens of the NCR. Please, head on through.
0DI0004206	[SUCCEEDED] If you're here to see the Major, then I suppose it's all right. Head on through.
0DI0004207	[FAILED] Since you put it like that, no. Not unless you know the password. Do you know the password?
0DI0004208	That's... that's terrible. I hope the poor little guy gave as good as he got. He always was a fighter.
0DI0004209	Why I remember one time when he... do you mind if we talk about something else?
0DI0004210	I expect you to treat my Rexie with a little more care. I'm expecting him back now, you hear?
0DI0004211	Now, was there something you wanted to talk about?
0DI0004212	You're a man of your word, no doubt about it. I can't thank you enough.
0DI0004213	If you want, hold onto Rex for a little while longer. I'm sure he'd enjoy that. Was there anything else you wanted?
0DI0004214	No no, you can hold onto him for a little while longer, I think. You deserve that much at least, for what you've done.
0DI0004215	But aside from the good news about my Rex, was there something you wanted?
0DI0004216	Naw, I'm just happy to see my pup back on his feet and happy. I can't thank you enough for this.
0DI0004217	Hopefully, he's been making himself useful as a way of paying you back. But where are my manners, did you need something?
0DI0004218	What precisely about them did you wish to discuss?
0DI0004219	He probably said "lieutenant", Wayne.
0DI0004220	The boy means well, but he's dumb as a mutant sometimes.
0DI0004222	Unfortunately for you, I'm not authorized to trade with you. It's against regulations.
0DI0004223	I guess I can spare a minute or two for you. Things are a little slow at the moment anyway.
0DI0004224	Me? I've been in the military my entire life. It's a family sort of thing. My father served, my brothers serve, and I serve.
0DI0004225	I've had the honor of serving all over the NCR and now I get to be out on the front lines as the NCR comes out east to help these folks here.
0DI0004226	Once we get rid of the Legion, this will be a better place for everyone, and I'm proud to be a part of that.
0DI0004227	I'm on duty here. I don't have time to chit-chat.
0DI0004228	I guess I can trust you. What would you like to know?
0DI0004229	Sure, what would you like to know?
0DI0004230	I'm not required to answer questions from a civilian and I don't trust you enough.
0DI0004231	Go bug someone else with your questions.
0DI0004232	Well, that is great and all, but it's really against regulations.
0DI0004233	I'm not here to make money, I'm here to watch the NCR supplies for the dam and that means no supplies for you.
0DI0004234	I guess I can make an exception, just for you.
0DI0004235	It's still against regulations, I can't help you.
0DI0004237	The NCR is out here to make the world a better place. For those out here and for all those back home. I'm glad I can be a part of that.
0DI0004238	They're a bunch of evil savages if you ask me. We're out here trying to save these good people from being enslaved by those bastards.
0DI0004239	I hope we kill 'em all.
0DI0004240	Well, the dam here is the key to helping the NCR make the world a better place.
0DI0004241	With the power from the dam we can help the people here and back home have a better quality of life.
0DI0004242	We can't trust the Legion or Mr. House to do the same. The NCR is the only one looking out for the people. And we need the dam to do that.
0DI0004243	And I pity the people that try to take it from us.
0DI0004244	Like I'd hang around to find out!
0DI0004245	Hey, I can't really move, now. But I'll follow you in spirit.
0DI0004246	Gonna be hard covering you when I can't move my legs.
0DI0004247	I'm not exactly in Power Armor over here, so why don't you help lighten my load a bit?
0DI0004248	[Rex is overburdened and is having difficulty keeping up with you.]
0DI0004249	Carrying too much shit to move.
0DI0004250	Pinned down here carrying your bags.
0DI0004251	I'm not standing here because I'm overburdened with emotion. Take some of this stuff off of me so I can move a little more easily.
0DI0004252	Need to lighten my load.
0DI0004253	What did you give me, bricks?
0DI0004254	Hey, don't worry about it, boss. The decrepit old man can easily carry all your stuff for you. Really.
0DI0004255	Didn't your mother ever tell you it's polite to help an old lady carry her bags?
0DI0004256	I'm getting... woozy.
0DI0004257	Argh. Poison.
0DI0004258	Hmm. Might need some antidote here.
0DI0004259	Yep. That's poison.
0DI0004260	Feel... weak all of a sudden.
0DI0004261	Head's spinning - must've got stung.
0DI0004262	I need a snakebite kit, fast.
0DI0004263	Well. This isn't good. Think I've been poisoned, boss.
0DI0004264	That one... had a little kick to it. The poisonous kind of kick.
0DI0004265	Boss, I got a poison situation here!
0DI0004266	Grandma's feeling woozy - be a dear and fetch her a poison antidote?
0DI0004267	Either grandma needs to cut back on grandpa's special moonshine, or she's been poisoned.
0DI0004270	MMmmahh. <Smacks lips>
0DI0004271	That helps.
0DI0004272	Much better.
0DI0004273	Sweet as roses.
0DI0004274	Getting my second wind here.
0DI0004275	Mmm, now that feels good.
0DI0004276	Whew.
0DI0004277	Ooh, that eases the aches. Not all of them, but some.
0DI0004278	Ahh, that feels better. I might not die for a while yet.
0DI0004280	Oh, grandma feels much better now.
0DI0004281	That's much better, isn't it, Leo?
0DI0004282	Ahh....
0DI0004288	I'm gonna need some new limbs.
0DI0004289	I could use a Doctor's Bag if you have any handy.
0DI0004290	Need a medic.
0DI0004291	Can't feel all my limbs.
0DI0004292	Tagged me, need a doctor bag.
0DI0004293	Not firing on all pistons here.
0DI0004294	A doctor's bag and some whiskey, if you don't mind.
0DI0004295	Gonna lose a limb if I don't get some meds.
0DI0004296	If I get gangrene before we find a doctor...
0DI0004297	Grandma's limbs aren't doing too well, pumpkin.
0DI0004298	Yes it hurts, Leo, but the doctors can fix me right up!
0DI0004299	That's better. Maybe I should've been a surgeon.
0DI0004300	I'm fine now.
0DI0004301	Will the medical wonders of the post-apocalyptic world never cease?
0DI0004302	Good as new.
0DI0004303	Patched up. Let's get back to the fight.
0DI0004304	Didn't even leave a scar.
0DI0004305	All stitched up.
0DI0004306	Prefer a shot of whiskey, but...
0DI0004307	That makes me feel young again. No, wait, that's just the Med-X talking.
0DI0004308	There. Now my limbs should stay attached a while longer.
0DI0004309	That should fix the damage.
0DI0004310	Grandma's feeling much better now.
0DI0004311	Oh, that's much nicer.
0DI0004312	Better than a long hot soak in an oatmeal bath!
0DI0004313	Spare some ammo?
0DI0004314	All out of ammunition.
0DI0004315	If you could spare any ammunition, that would be really terrific.
0DI0004316	That's the last of the ammo.
0DI0004317	Empty.
0DI0004318	Reloading! Wait, no, I'm out!
0DI0004319	Trigger's willing, chamber's empty.
0DI0004320	No more ammo.
0DI0004321	Firing dry here.
0DI0004322	I'm out.
0DI0004323	I'm all out, boss!
0DI0004324	I can throw the gun at 'em if you want, boss.
0DI0004325	Could I trouble you for some bullets, boss?
0DI0004326	You know those little lead things that fly really fast and hurt people? I need some.
0DI0004327	Sweetie, grandma needs some more ammunition!
0DI0004328	If I don't get some ammunition soon, Leo's going to start chopping!
0DI0004329	Didn't grandma tell you it's good to share, sweetheart? Especially ammo?
0DI0004330	Weapon's busted.
0DI0004331	Can't use this anymore.
0DI0004332	This weapon's done for.
0DI0004333	I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to.
0DI0004334	Need a new weapon.
0DI0004335	This weapon's done.
0DI0004336	I'm no good without my weapon.
0DI0004337	I need a new rifle.
0DI0004338	Gotta spare gun handy?
0DI0004339	Weapon's done for.
0DI0004340	Piece. Of. Shit.
0DI0004341	What a piece of junk!
0DI0004342	My weapon broke. Probably my fault.
0DI0004343	You got a spare piece, boss, or do I have to break out the tubing?
0DI0004344	Leo broke another weapon! I told you you hit too hard, Leo!
0DI0004345	Grandma needs another weapon, pumpkin!
0DI0004346	Grandma's weapon broke, and there are still backsides that need paddling!
0DI0004347	Need a bigger caliber.
0DI0004348	Can't punch through.
0DI0004349	This is useless.
0DI0004350	Might as well be throwing rocks.
0DI0004351	Might be time for a weapon upgrade.
0DI0004352	Uh... I think I need some more firepower.
0DI0004353	You got a bigger gun I can borrow?
0DI0004354	I'm not even making a dent with this.
0DI0004355	This weapon's on its last legs.
0DI0004356	Might as well be shooting blanks!
0DI0004357	Maybe I should switch to a squirt gun.
0DI0004358	Need something with more kick.
0DI0004359	Not even slowing it down!
0DI0004360	All I'm doing is pissing him off.
0DI0004361	Well, this isn't doing much of anything.
0DI0004362	Not sure I'm having any impact here, boss.
0DI0004363	Boss, I'm having some... inadequacy issues here. Got a bigger gun I can borrow?
0DI0004364	This weapon isn't working! And Leo doesn't like that very much!
0DI0004365	Grandma needs a bigger paddle for this behind!
0DI0004366	Chop them harder, Leo! Harder! Don't blame the weapon!
0DI0004367	Got any armor with less holes in it for me?
0DI0004368	I don't have much protection here. Mind helping me out?
0DI0004369	What am I wearing? Cardboard?
0DI0004370	This armor's gonna get me killed.
0DI0004371	Look, I'm dead unless you can get me some real armor.
0DI0004372	Shoulda fought naked, it'd hurt less.
0DI0004373	Armor's for shit.
0DI0004374	They're cutting me up!
0DI0004375	Could use sheet metal, not a sheet.
0DI0004376	This armor's probably fine. The holes are cosmetic.
0DI0004377	This armor's beat up worse than me, boss.
0DI0004378	Oof.
0DI0004379	Hmm?
0DI0004381	It is my medical opinion that that could have gone better.
0DI0004382	Thursday! Wait... ugh. Dammit.
0DI0004383	What'd I miss?
0DI0004384	Huh. Alive after all.
0DI0004385	<Sighs> Figures.
0DI0004386	Feels like a Brahmin kicked me.
0DI0004387	Guess that didn't go so well.
0DI0004388	Head's ringing like an alarm clock.
0DI0004389	Need a drink.
0DI0004390	Better than waking up in jail, I guess.
0DI0004391	Am I dead? Is this Heaven? Oh. Hi boss. Guess not.
0DI0004392	Oof. Boss, take a look around and see if any of my parts are lying around, huh?
0DI0004393	I've woken up worse places. Not many, though.
0DI0004394	Gah! Petro-Chico Boy! Petro-Chico Boy is here for my chitlins! Oh. Just a dream. Just a dream....
0DI0004395	Is grandma's nap over already?
0DI0004396	Grandma's head hurts....
0DI0004398	Ouch.
0DI0004400	Physician, heal thyself. Guess it's a good thing they invented stims.
0DI0004401	Might need to rest soon.
0DI0004402	Shot of whiskey might kill the pain.
0DI0004403	Wouldn't say no to a Stimpak.
0DI0004404	Boss, the pain from my wounds is starting to outweigh the pain from my arthritis.
0DI0004405	Little help here, boss?
0DI0004406	Wouldn't say no to something to ease the pain. Granted that's usually the case, but right now especially.
0DI0004407	Hey boss, is my jaw still attached? Good. Can I get some help to keep it that way?
0DI0004408	Oh dear, grandma's not feeling too good!
0DI0004409	One two three four five six seven eight nine ten! One two three four five six seven eight nine ten!
0DI0004410	Grandma needs her medicine!
0DI0004412	Grandma needs to have a little lie down!
0DI0004413	<Coughing Fit>
0DI0004414	Do me a favor. Make sure they bury me in a nice dress.
0DI0004415	I knew I should've been an actress.
0DI0004416	Ugh. Maybe I should have stayed back in NCR after all.
0DI0004417	I could use a syringe of Med-X or two. Or eight.
0DI0004418	So this is how it ends.
0DI0004419	Maybe it's my time.
0DI0004420	Heh... I knew you'd be the death of me.
0DI0004421	Think I might've killed my last legionary.
0DI0004422	If I die... take care of my salvage.
0DI0004423	It's getting... dark.
0DI0004424	I'm not doing so well here.
0DI0004425	Too stupid to die... but getting there.
0DI0004426	On my last legs here.
0DI0004427	If I'm going to die, at least pass me some whiskey.
0DI0004428	Got more pain in me than blood.
0DI0004429	Ain't beat yet.
0DI0004430	Don't let them bury me in Vault City.
0DI0004431	Feeling a little worse for wear.
0DI0004432	These bones are about to give up the ghost, boss.
0DI0004433	Ahh, Rafaela... I'll see you soon.
0DI0004434	Never thought I'd go out like this....
0DI0004436	No! Grandma won't leave her babies!
0DI0004437	Leo, I think we're in very big trouble!
0DI0004438	The mission isn't a problem. The problem is with supplies. The convicts are better armed and organized than our intel initially suggested.
0DI0004439	I'm trying to get some reinforcements here, maybe some guns with some firepower, but... shit... things are just going slow.
0DI0004440	Most people just call it NCRCF. That's NCR Correctional Facility.
0DI0004441	A little bit ago the convicts there staged a coup, killed the guards that weren't able to escape, and have been ransacking the area since then.
0DI0004442	Not much. They've taken to calling themselves Powder Gangers. Mostly because they've taken to using the explosives meant to clear boulders as weapons.
0DI0004443	They got organized faster than I would have thought, most of them at least.
0DI0004444	Thankfully the small group in town here seem to have split off from the main force, so they aren't getting anything in the way of support.
0DI0004445	Caesar has put a lot of trust in you. Be worth it.
0DI0004446	That cowboy robot had us hire six couriers. Each was carrying something a little different. A pair of dice, a chess piece, that kind of stuff.
0DI0004447	Last word I had from the office, it looked like payment had been received for the other five jobs. Guess it was just your chip that didn't make it.
0DI0004448	First deadbeat we hired to do the job canceled. Hope a storm from the Divide skins him alive. Well, that's where you came in.
0DI0004449	To start with, it was a robot that set it up! Came rolling in with a picture of a cowboy on a screen where its face should be.
0DI0004450	Had me send a request to the Express office in Hub, for seven couriers to be hired. Each one to carry bric-a-brac, seemed to me!
0DI0004451	Playing cards, dice, chess pieces, trinkets like that. Then, next thing I know, he turns around and says he wants six couriers, not seven!
0DI0004452	Has me send on the "corrected" order for six couriers along with a bunch of letters and numbers, like some kind of code or something!
0DI0004453	Don't ask me what that was about, because I never seen anything like it. Anyways, you must've been Courier 6, then? The Poker Chip?
0DI0004454	Well, now that you mention it, a few nights back one of the townies was out scavenging for supplies.
0DI0004455	He said he saw a fella with a daisy suit come through with some of them Great Khan misfits. They was talking about a chip.
0DI0004458	My name is Raul Alfonso Tejada.
0DI0004459	I'm starting to think you haven't been paying attention, boss.
0DI0004460	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger and sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, at your service.
0DI0004461	Always happy to repeat myself for you, boss.
0DI0004462	Raul Alfonso Tejada, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
0DI0004464	Raul Alfonso Tejada, aka Old Miguel, former gunslinger, sole survivor of Hidalgo Ranch, and ghost of Mexico City at your service.
0DI0004465	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there.
0DI0004466	I was born just outside Mexico City. My family had a little ranch there. After they died, I took my little sister, my Rafaela, to Mexico City.
0DI0004467	We lived there a while, then I moved on and ended up here. I'd rather not talk about it any more.
0DI0004469	She died there, so I moved on. I came across an old Petro-Chico refinery, found "Miguel's" jumpsuit, and decided to hang up the guns for good.
0DI0004472	I headed up into Tuscon and lived there as Old Miguel for a while. Things were okay, then they got bad, and I headed west to the Mojave.
0DI0004473	And that, boss, is all she wrote.
0DI0004474	Old enough to know better, boss. Old enough to know better.
0DI0004475	I was born in 2047, boss. If you do the math on that, I'm sure you'll get within a decade or so.
0DI0004476	You never heard of Petro-Chico, un Amigo de Poseidon Energy? Ah, of course not. They were an oil company in Mexico, back before the War.
0DI0004477	I found it in a costume shop. It was sort of my calling card, you know? "Raul the Ghoul, the zombie vaquero of Mexico City."
0DI0004478	Well, boss, when a giant, insane Super mutant asks you to stay put, you do what you're told. Well, maybe you don't, but I'm just a broke down old man.
0DI0004479	Probably because it used to be Miguel's.
0DI0004480	Boss, usually when somebody gives you a name and nothing else, it's because that's all they want to give you.
0DI0004481	Ah, it's stupid, boss. I used to listen to the radio broadcasts, just to pass the time.
0DI0004482	Well, one day the signal stops, so I figured I'd try to find transmitter. I'm a pretty good repairman, or I was before the eyes started to go.
0DI0004483	Anyway, I found Black Mountain and offered my services, but Tabitha decided I was useful enough to keep around. Permanently.
0DI0004484	I'm not much use besides being a portable encyclopedia, really. I guess you could use me as a pack brahmin, but my knees aren't so good any more.
0DI0004485	I'm still half-decent with a pistol. Not fantastic, but good enough. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
0DI0004486	I can keep your gear in good working order, too. If you notice your stuff takes a lot longer to break, well, you can thank me with a sarsaparilla.
0DI0004487	Felt good to put the old vaquero outfit on again. I feel a lot sharper with a pistol now. Still wouldn't put these old bones on the front lines.
0DI0004488	I can also do maintenance work on your stuff - I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can keep your gear working longer.
0DI0004489	That's nice of you to say, boss, but I'm an old man. Not much use to anybody any more.
0DI0004490	Time was, I was a pretty good shot with a pistol. I guess I'm still half-decent. These old bones aren't much use in hand-to-hand fighting, though.
0DI0004492	I sort of figured you had your own reasons for keeping me around, boss.
0DI0004493	I don't have the supplies for a real repair job, but I can do some routine maintenance to keep your gear working longer.
0DI0004494	It won't exactly get better, but it'll get worse slower.
0DI0004495	I'm an open book, boss. Granted, the book's in Spanish and some of the pages have fallen out, but I'm an open book.
0DI0004496	Though Arcade's intentions were pure and his goals were noble, he ultimately succumbed to the harsh brutality of the Mojave like so many before him.
0DI0004497	Tricked by the Courier and imprisoned by the Legion, Arcade remained Caesar's personal physician for several years.
0DI0004498	Caesar grew fond of speaking with such an educated man on philosophical matters. Arcade became his unwilling intellectual sparring partner.
0DI0004499	After years of such servitude, during an unguarded moment, Arcade used a surgical scalpel and his bare hands to disembowel himself.
0DI0004500	Lacking any other skilled medical personnel, the Legion was unable to prevent his death. Caesar mourned his loss for months.
0DI0004501	Though the Legion was victorious at Hoover Dam, the Legate did not have the same medical needs as Caesar.
0DI0004502	Lanius quickly tired of Arcade's acerbic wit and had the doctor crucified.
0DI0004503	During the retreat of Caesar's Legion from the Mojave Wasteland, Arcade was a sad casualty, one of many.
0DI0004504	His body was heaped with those of many others in a nameless ravine on the Legion's long march home.
0DI0004505	Though Arcade had not hoped for an NCR victory, he was proud of his role in the defense of Hoover Dam against the forces of Caesar's Legion.
0DI0004506	Unfortunately, when word spread that Arcade was once a member of the Enclave, he was forced out of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0004507	Pursued by bounty hunters, NCR rangers, and the Brotherhood of Steel, Arcade pushed deep into the eastern plains and was never heard from again.
0DI0004508	Arcade had hoped that Freeside would be able to remain independent of NCR rule, but he was glad that Caesar's Legion had been stopped at Hoover Dam.
0DI0004509	He tended to the sick in Freeside for a while longer, then returned to NCR territory to become a teacher with the Followers there.
0DI0004510	Though Arcade was crushed by the Legion's victory at Hoover Dam, he was not among NCR's casualties.
0DI0004511	During the NCR's retreat from the Mojave Wasteland, he helped defend NCR citizens and refugees on their way to Mojave Outpost.
0DI0004512	Unfortunately, NCR rangers identified his father's armor as Enclave property. He was arrested, tried as a war criminal, and imprisoned indefinitely.
0DI0004513	When news reached Freeside that Legion forces were approaching New Vegas, Arcade did his best to help people escape with adequate supplies.
0DI0004514	A Legion explorer saw Arcade helping locals escape and pointed him out to a Centurion.
0DI0004515	Arcade's group was run down somewhere near Westside. There were no survivors.
0DI0004516	Arcade was outraged by Mr. House's power play following the defeat of Caesar's Legion at Hoover Dam.
0DI0004517	Though he remained in Freeside for a short time after the Securitrons established widespread control, he eventually traveled back into NCR territory.
0DI0004518	Disillusioned with the Followers of the Apocalypse, he settled down in the outskirts of the Boneyard, where he worked happily as a family doctor.
0DI0004519	Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who helped repel the Legion from Hoover Dam.
0DI0004520	He was prouder still to see the area freed from the shackles of the NCR and Mr. House.
0DI0004521	Though independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it could be, Arcade used his Enclave knowledge and technology to keep order wherever he could.
0DI0004522	Arcade was tending to the locals of Freeside when he learned that Caesar's Legion had been defeated and NCR was being pushed out of New Vegas.
0DI0004523	Though he found that independence for New Vegas was not all he hoped it would be, Arcade did his best to help the locals govern themselves.
0DI0004524	Though Arcade was proud to have been one of the defenders who turned back the Legion at Hoover Dam, he was crushed by Mr. House's ascent to power.
0DI0004525	Saddened by the loss of life and liberty in the area, Arcade left the Mojave Wasteland for parts unknown. He was never heard from again.
0DI0004526	Though some Super Mutants and Nightkin continued to journey to the legendary Utobitha, they found little trace of its existence.
0DI0004527	Some eventually found their way to Jacobstown, but many wandered off into the wastes, confused and disheartened.
0DI0004528	Tabitha and Rhonda went east, through Caesar's land. Occasionally tales of their exploits found their way back west, though few believed them.
0DI0004529	Eventually the stories concerning the duo were collected and published, and proved to be quite popular with children.
0DI0004530	Black Mountain Radio continued to broadcast its peculiar form of propaganda. Raul Tejada faced his execution each day, though pardoned in the end.
0DI0004531	Travelers venturing too near Black Mountain continue to be harassed by Tabitha's followers.
0DI0004532	Tabitha, enraged by Raul's escape, took the remaining Nightkin of Black Mountain with her and vanished without a trace.
0DI0004533	Travelers in the region soon learned to avoid the roads at night, as caravans were repeatedly attacked by unseen assailants.
0DI0004534	Without organized leadership, the remaining Boomers slowly drifted away, leaving Nellis Air Force Base to be flooded by prospectors and scavengers.
0DI0004535	All of the Boomers' accumulated knowledge quickly scattered, and their existence slowly faded from memory.
0DI0004536	After the battle of Hoover Dam, the NCR mounted several campaigns against the Boomers, but all were quickly ended by the Boomers' artillery.
0DI0004537	Over time, as the Boomers found a need for gun powder, they developed a relationship with the Gun Runners, trading their surplus crops for munitions.
0DI0004538	Mr. House showed little interest in the Boomers and left them to themselves in Nellis.
0DI0004539	The tribe remained fortified in Nellis with their backs to the world.
0DI0004540	The Boomers defended themselves against many attacks from the Legion, but they eventually fell to the Legion's superior numbers.
0DI0004541	The Legion enslaved the Boomers and erased any memory of their existence from the wasteland.
0DI0004542	With little law left in the wasteland, the Boomers continued to defend themselves against the prospectors and scavengers invading their territory.
0DI0004543	With the help of the Gun Runners, the Boomers developed a healthy trading relationship with the NCR.
0DI0004544	Eventually the Boomers began wandering out into the wasteland, while still preventing outsiders from entering Nellis.
0DI0004545	Mr. House showed little interest on the Boomers, who eventually began venturing out of Nellis to meet and trade with travelers.
0DI0004546	Cautious after the Boomers' display of power at Hoover Dam, Caesar chose to leave the Boomers alone.
0DI0004547	The Boomers remained isolated but have been seen flying over the Mojave Desert from time to time.
0DI0004548	Though the Wasteland became anarchic after Hoover Dam, the Boomers' display of power dissuaded fortune seekers from attempting to penetrate Nellis.
0DI0004549	Tired of waiting for the world to be done with him, Boone ventured into the wastes to make his own way out.
0DI0004550	Unable to clear his mind of the past, he was at last granted the death he'd awaited, bringing final rest to a life that had ended long ago.
0DI0004551	As the Battle of Hoover Dam ended, Boone confirmed what he had always suspected - that revenge would never quiet his troubled mind.
0DI0004552	Side arm in hand, he journeyed back to California in search of the NCR officer who had led the attack on Bitter Springs.
0DI0004553	There, with only two bullets loaded, Boone did the only thing he believed would put an end to his suffering.
0DI0004554	Looking for a place where he could be of some use, Boone found himself re-enlisting with his old unit.
0DI0004555	Though his regrets remained in his thoughts, they coalesced into a purpose, and Boone embraced it.
0DI0004556	He spent his leave time hunting down slavers in the desert, his First Recon beret the last thing they never saw.
0DI0004557	Though NCR was withdrawing from the region, Boone remained in New Vegas, finding work as a security guard and caravan scout along the highways.
0DI0004558	While he might've preferred rejoining his old unit, Boone couldn't bring himself to abandon the city where he'd met his wife.
0DI0004559	Boone refused to take the Legion's victory lying down.
0DI0004560	Heading to the hills with his rifle, he began a deadly campaign against high-ranking Legion officers.
0DI0004561	And though the price on his head rose to levels unheard of, few pursued it, fearing it would be the last thing they'd never see.
0DI0004562	No longer held in check by his conscience, Boone found lucrative work as a mercenary and assassin.
0DI0004563	No job was too violent, no target too innocent. As long as the caps were good, Boone would take the job.
0DI0004564	Driven mad by Caesar's victory at Hoover Dam, and unable to escape his memories, Boone staged a suicide mission against the Legate.
0DI0004565	Fighting as he wished he would've fought on the day of his wife's death, he brought down scores of Legionaries before being caught.
0DI0004566	Before his crucifixion, he was brought before the Legate, who expressed his admiration for Boone's reckless abandon.
0DI0004567	Boone spat tobacco in his eye, for all of Caesar's armies to see.
0DI0004568	Buried beneath tons of rubble, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was no more.
0DI0004569	Those few who were outside the Hidden Valley bunker when it was destroyed settled into new lives, or headed west to find a new chapter to join.
0DI0004570	During the fight for Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood took HELIOS One, inflicting heavy damage on retreating NCR forces, but it was a pyrrhic victory.
0DI0004571	Once The Strip was secured, Caesar's forces overwhelmed and eventually routed the Brotherhood from HELIOS One and Hidden Valley.
0DI0004572	The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley.
0DI0004573	With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along I-15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.
0DI0004574	The Brotherhood and the NCR in the Mojave Wasteland declared an official truce, despite continued hostilities between the two in the west.
0DI0004575	As per their agreement, the NCR handed over all suits of salvaged power armor and in return the Brotherhood helped patrol I-15 and Highway 95.
0DI0004576	Due to their temporary truce, the Brotherhood allowed the NCR to retreat from the Mojave Wasteland without incident.
0DI0004577	In the relative peace that followed, Brotherhood patrols appeared along major roads, harassing travelers over any bits of technology they had.
0DI0004578	Rose of Sharon Cassidy died as her caravan died - in an unmarked grave, another victim of the Mojave.
0DI0004579	Despite the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, Cass lived for 30 more years.
0DI0004580	She made her way back West and passed away in a small shack outside of Vault City, the rose pendant still around her neck.
0DI0004581	The slaughter of the Van Graffs and the Crimson Caravan caused no end of trouble for NCR back West.
0DI0004582	Already struggling, NCR's supply lines suffered further as the two caravans withdrew support until the "massacre in the East" was resolved.
0DI0004583	In the years following the destruction of Cassidy Caravans, NCR used evidence of the plot to blackmail the Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs.
0DI0004584	NCR enacted strict trade laws with little resistance, strengthening their supply lines and their position in the Mojave.
0DI0004585	Cass survived to see the NCR flag flying proud over Hoover Dam, and thought for a moment... this is what a hero must feel like.
0DI0004586	Cass lived to see Hoover Dam in its Old World glory, humming with power the likes of which the Mojave had never seen.
0DI0004587	Vegas burned brighter than ever, Securitrons filled the streets, and Cass's heart skipped... just a little.
0DI0004588	Her last words were to the Dam - and to herself. "We were going full speed ahead... but facing backwards the whole time."
0DI0004589	Cass lived to see the Courier bring down three armies and by her count, that was three more than she'd expected. She'd kept quiet about that, though.
0DI0004590	Cass lived to see the mark of the Legion on Hoover Dam. Uncertain of what lay next for the West, she remained silent.
0DI0004591	As the Legion marched West, she found it difficult to see the Dam as anything more than a gravestone for the Mojave - and everyone in it.
0DI0004592	Caesar entered The Strip as though it was his Triumph. The Legion pushed the NCR out of New Vegas entirely, driving them back to the Mojave Outpost.
0DI0004593	The Legion occupied all major locations, enslaving much of the population and peacefully lording over the rest.
0DI0004594	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - unforgiving as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
0DI0004595	The Legate is crowned as the new Caesar. He entered The Strip as though it was a military target, destroying anyone who resisted him.
0DI0004596	The Legion brutally occupied all major locations, killing and enslaving a large amount of the population.
0DI0004597	Under the Legion's banner, civilization - savage as it was - finally came to the Mojave wasteland.
0DI0004598	And so the Courier's road came to an end... for now.
0DI0004599	In the new world of the Mojave wasteland, fighting continued, blood was spilled, and many lived and died - just as they had in the Old World.
0DI0004600	Because war... war never changes.
0DI0004601	The Courier, fair and even-handed in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, was honored by the NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
0DI0004602	He was presented with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the republic.
0DI0004603	Though the Courier's agenda was debated by many, he was honored by NCR for his support of the military at Hoover Dam.
0DI0004606	Despite his extreme actions, he was awarded with the Golden Branch, the highest civilian decoration given by the Republic.
0DI0004607	Though the Courier himself was just and forthright in his dealings throughout the Wasteland, he helped the Legion achieve victory.
0DI0004608	Caesar honored him with a golden coin, minted in celebration of his contributions and distributed throughout the wasteland.
0DI0004614	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, out of gratitude - and a quiet sense of pride for his choice in lieutenants.
0DI0004616	Mr. House would keep New Vegas stable, if not free, for generations. Mr. House afforded the Courier every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38.
0DI0004618	Mr. House afforded him every luxury at his disposal in the Lucky 38, partly out of gratitude, and party out of fear.
0DI0004619	Supporting the ideals of independence, the Courier was recognized as the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
0DI0004620	He ensured Mr. House's tyranny was broken and neither Caesar's Legion nor NCR would ever gain control over New Vegas.
0DI0004621	Preferring neither the best of the NCR nor the worst of the Legion, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly independent New Vegas.
0DI0004622	He had removed Mr. House from power over the Strip and broken the influence of the NCR and Caesar's Legion in the Mojave Wasteland.
0DI0004623	Supporting all the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the man responsible for a truly free New Vegas.
0DI0004624	He ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.
0DI0004625	After a long and fantastic journey, ED-E finally met its end with the dangers of the Mojave.
0DI0004626	It lay destroyed and gathering dust, waiting for scavengers to pick through its remains for salvage.
0DI0004627	ED-E remained forgotten in the shop of Johnson Nash, until it was repaired by another courier who let it continue on its journey to Navarro.
0DI0004628	ED-E was eventually discovered by the Followers of the Apocalypse who managed to recover vast databanks of scientific knowledge.
0DI0004629	ED-E traveled with the Courier until one of its memory banks was triggered causing it to continue its travels on to Navarro.
0DI0004630	Upon reaching Navarro ED-E vanished and was not see in the wastes again.
0DI0004631	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E  remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier.
0DI0004632	The Followers of the Apocalypse used the information recovered from ED-E on Poseidon Energy, to develop new methods to harness the energy of the sun.
0DI0004634	The Brotherhood used the information recovered from ED-E to create a small army of Duraframe Eyebots.
0DI0004635	With its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ED-E is discovered by a traveling caravan, who take him on as a protector as they wander the wastes.
0DI0004639	Their leaders destroyed by the Courier, the Fiends scattered throughout the wasteland.
0DI0004640	Without the organization of Motor-Runner, Cook-Cook, Violet, and Driver Nephi, they were easy prey.
0DI0004641	Never weakened by NCR, the Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004642	Though NCR repulsed the Fiends, they suffered heavy losses in the process.
0DI0004643	The Fiends staged an attack against Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004644	During the NCR's retreat, the Fiends overwhelmed many of the troopers before Mr. House's Securitrons could deal with them.
0DI0004645	The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004646	In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.
0DI0004647	Though weakened, the Fiends attacked McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004648	NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses and, in the following days, destroyed the remaining Fiend leaders, breaking their power forever.
0DI0004649	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and suffered heavy losses.
0DI0004650	Caesar, unimpressed with their performance and their dependence on chems, had them exterminated.
0DI0004651	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, but the NCR repulsed the attack with minimal losses.
0DI0004652	When Mr. House asserted control over Outer Vegas, his Securitrons eradicated the remaining Fiends entirely.
0DI0004653	The Fiends attacked Camp McCarran during the second Battle of Hoover Dam and, despite suffering heavy losses, overran it.
0DI0004654	They continued to be a nuisance throughout Outer Vegas, but never established full control over the area.
0DI0004655	With no clear leader to guide efforts in Freeside, the Followers of the Apocalypse lost control of Old Mormon Fort to local thugs and junkies.
0DI0004656	Eventually, using the Followers' remaining supplies to manufacture drugs, the Old Mormon Fort quickly devolved into little more than a junkie den.
0DI0004657	After the NCR's victory at the dam, the Followers of the Apocalypse were pushed out of Old Mormon Fort during its occupation by NCR forces.
0DI0004658	NCR further "encouraged" them to leave Outer Vegas entirely, and the Followers had no choice but to comply.
0DI0004659	After the NCR's victory at the dam, in part thanks to Follower medical support, NCR allowed the Followers to care for refugees as they see fit.
0DI0004660	Old Mormon Fort expanded its services and was able to aid more people, becoming a refuge for the less fortunate citizens of New Vegas.
0DI0004661	After the Legion's victory, the new Caesar learned the Followers had "defamed" the original Caesar's noble origins.
0DI0004662	The Followers of the Apocalypse were hunted down and exterminated, and Old Mormon Fort was turned into a pile of rubble.
0DI0004663	After the Legion's victory, Caesar, out of a strange respect for his old fellows, allowed the Followers safe passage out of the wasteland.
0DI0004664	Reluctantly, the Followers accepted the offer and abandoned Old Mormon Fort to the Legion.
0DI0004665	After the Courier ensured New Vegas remain free, the Followers found that independent Vegas was even more unstable and violent than before.
0DI0004666	Old Mormon Fort became excessively burdened by the influx of patients, struggling to provide even the most basic of services.
0DI0004667	Travelers continued to stop by Goodsprings Source for water on the Long 15, but rarely would anyone venture into the ruins of Goodsprings itself.
0DI0004668	Those who did were almost always tourists, come to visit the graveyard where the Courier "rose from the dead."
0DI0004669	Goodsprings saw more trade along I-15 after NCR gained control of the Mojave Wasteland, but with that came a heavy burden of the Republic's taxes.
0DI0004670	Some old-timers, unable to handle the cost, were forced to move on, grumbling all the while.
0DI0004671	The Legion, preoccupied with its acquisition of New Vegas, scarcely took notice of the town of Goodsprings.
0DI0004672	Many locals moved on, fearful of Caesar's long shadow. Only the old and the stubborn remained.
0DI0004673	After Mr. House gained control of New Vegas, he sent a Securitron to Goodsprings as a token of appreciation for helping the Courier.
0DI0004674	Victor was a mixed blessing, however, as he continually monitored the town for Mr. House.
0DI0004675	With New Vegas' independence formally declared, Goodsprings thrived.
0DI0004676	More travelers stopped by Goodsprings on their way to and from the Strip, and the locals grew prosperous from the traffic.
0DI0004677	After generations of being beaten down, the Great Khans were finally broken by the Courier.
0DI0004678	Those few who avoided the Courier's wrath moved north, into the wilderness of Idaho, where they tried once more to rebuild.
0DI0004679	After the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans returned for a time to Red Rock Canyon.
0DI0004680	The NCR's pressing need to expand proved greater than its promise of amnesty, and before long the government decided the Khans had to go.
0DI0004681	The surviving Great Khans were relocated to an isolated, barren reservation, well north of NCR trade routes.
0DI0004682	For supporting the NCR, the Great Khans were ruthlessly hunted down by the victorious Legion.
0DI0004683	Caesar destroyed all evidence of their existence at Red Rock Canyon, and forbade mention of their name in any history.
0DI0004684	The Great Khans' legacy was swiftly forgotten.
0DI0004685	As reward for their loyal service, Caesar forcibly integrated the Great Khans into the Legion.
0DI0004686	The sick and elderly were killed, the women sold as wives to ranking officers, and the tribe's identity was annihilated.
0DI0004687	Though many Great Khans mourned the death of their tribe, many more were ultimately satisfied with their revenge against NCR.
0DI0004688	After driving the Legion out of the Mojave Wasteland, the victorious NCR turned its attention to those who had allied themselves with Caesar.
0DI0004689	The Great Khans were among the first tribes to suffer this fate, and the few who survived Hoover Dam were driven north, into the wilderness of Idaho.
0DI0004690	During the Battle of Hoover Dam, the Great Khans quickly evacuated Red Rock Canyon and headed north and east into the plains of Wyoming.
0DI0004691	There, they reconnected with the Followers of the Apocalypse and rebuilt their strength.
0DI0004692	Bolstered by ancient knowledge of governance, economics, and transportation, they carved a mighty empire out of the ruins of the Northwest.
0DI0004693	After their suicidal last stand at Hoover Dam, the Great Khans ceased to exist as a tribe.
0DI0004694	The few surviving members dispersed, joining up with other tribes and gangs across the Mojave, and quickly forgot their heritage.
0DI0004695	The Courier, with the aid of Yes Man, drove both the Legion and the NCR from Hoover Dam, securing New Vegas' independence from both factions.
0DI0004696	With Mr. House out of the picture, the remaining Securitrons on The Strip were hard-pressed to keep order. Anarchy ruled the streets.
0DI0004697	When the fires died, New Vegas remained, assuming its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
0DI0004699	With Mr. House out of the picture, part of the Securitron army was diverted to the Strip to keep order. Any chaos on the streets was ended, quickly.
0DI0004700	Chaos became uncertainty, then acceptance, with minimal loss of life. New Vegas assumed its position as an independent power in the Mojave.
0DI0004701	And so the Courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings cheated death once again, and the Mojave wasteland was forever changed.
0DI0004702	With Jacobstown's leadership destroyed, the remaining Super Mutants and Nightkin of the west scattered across the wasteland.
0DI0004703	Jacobstown withered away, its death going unnoticed by the rest of the Mojave.
0DI0004704	Thanks to the Courier and Lily, a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was found shortly after Doctor Henry's experiment concluded.
0DI0004705	Nightkin and other Super Mutants in the wasteland flocked to Jacobstown, and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace.
0DI0004706	Though a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia was eventually found, it became a case of too little, too late for Jacobstown.
0DI0004707	Disgruntled by the death of their leader, Keene, most of the Nightkin scattered into the wasteland, their insanity worsening with each day.
0DI0004708	Jacobstown, constantly on guard for anti-mutant reprisals, never truly prospered.
0DI0004710	Most Nightkin at Jacobstown followed their leader Keene out into the wasteland, terrorizing the Mojave for years to come.
0DI0004712	It took more time than anticipated for a cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia to be found, but in the end it was beneficial to Jacobstown.
0DI0004713	The presence of the Nightkin leader, Keene, persuaded Nightkin from across the wasteland to make the journey to the town.
0DI0004714	Jacobstown prospered, becoming known as a fair - if somewhat intimidating - place for a trader to do business.
0DI0004715	With no cure for the Nightkin schizophrenia in sight, the disgruntled Nightkin left Jacobstown. Without a treatment, their insanity grew.
0DI0004716	The crazed Nightkin terrorized the wasteland, and Jacobstown suffered repeated reprisals from mutant-hating humans.
0DI0004717	In the end, the surviving mutants abandoned Jacobstown entirely, its existence quickly forgotten by the rest of the wasteland.
0DI0004718	With the King dead and most of their gang slain by the Courier, the remaining Kings fled the area, never to be heard from again.
0DI0004719	After the NCR victory at Hoover Dam, the temporary truce between them and the Kings blossomed into a full-scale relief effort for the people.
0DI0004720	While the NCR made repeated entreaties that Freeside join the Republic, the Kings steadfastly maintained their independence.
0DI0004721	Accusing the Kings of lying with a foreign invader for their newfound ties to the NCR, Mr. House punished them by ordering their forced removal.
0DI0004722	The Kings, defiant to the end, were destroyed to the last man by House's Securitrons.
0DI0004723	Following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, Freeside came to be known as one of the more stable areas in the region.
0DI0004724	Ironically, NCR refugees found Freeside safer than most of the rest of New Vegas, where resentment still lingers.
0DI0004725	After their victory at Hoover Dam, the Legion quickly set about destroying all remaining resistance, including any groups with ties to the NCR.
0DI0004726	Upon discovering the Kings' newfound relationship with the NCR, Legionaires flooded the streets of Freeside, and the Kings were quickly destroyed.
0DI0004727	While the NCR was busy fighting the Legion at Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to attack NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
0DI0004728	When the NCR moved to secure the region, they cracked down the hardest on Freeside, sending a full platoon to sweep the neighborhood.
0DI0004729	Most of the Kings were killed, with the few survivors driven out into the wastes.
0DI0004730	During the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, some Kings took it upon themselves to launch several attacks on NCR citizens and soldiers around Freeside.
0DI0004731	Mr. House looked on these actions favorably, seeing them as proof of the Kings' loyalty to New Vegas, and decided to leave them alone.
0DI0004732	In the aftermath of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, the Kings took the opportunity to viciously force all NCR citizens out of Freeside.
0DI0004733	Travelers from the Republic quickly learned to avoid Freeside if they valued their safety.
0DI0004734	Impressed with the Kings' continued attacks upon NCR citizens and soldiers, the Legion offered them the option of being assimilated into the Legion.
0DI0004735	The Kings refused, and briefly became slaves in the Legion, but after failed escape attempt, they were all put to death.
0DI0004736	As the NCR moved to secure the region, the occupation of Freeside proved especially problematic.
0DI0004737	Things remained tense due to numerous incidents, though the Kings were still in nominal control of the area.
0DI0004738	Flush with his victory, Mr. House sent Securitrons into Freeside, thinking to increase his control over the area.
0DI0004739	When fighting broke out, the Kings fought valiantly, but were no match for the armored killing machines, and were wiped out to the last man.
0DI0004740	The Kings retained their control of Freeside, and while they continued to favor the needs of locals, they tolerated the citizens of the defeated NCR.
0DI0004741	After their victory at Hoover Dam, Legion troops rolled through Freeside.
0DI0004742	The Kings tried to fight back, but most were killed, and the rest fled into the wasteland.
0DI0004743	Lily's long life finally came to a close in the Mojave Wasteland. As the life faded from her, her last thoughts were of her grandchildren.
0DI0004744	Encouraged by the Courier to take her medication regularly, Lily's mind eventually attained a semblance of clarity.
0DI0004745	Her memories dulled by the pills, she cast aside the recording of her grandchildren, no longer remembering its significance.
0DI0004746	Lily continued to take her medicine at half-doses, and although she remembered her grandchildren, her mind remained muddled and confused.
0DI0004747	Eventually, she parted ways with the Courier and traveled west, seeking the remnants of her past.
0DI0004748	Encouraged by the Courier to stop taking her medication altogether, Lily's instabilities grew worse with each passing day.
0DI0004749	Eventually she became little more than a ravening beast, the kindly old grandmother subsumed beneath the rage.
0DI0004750	Slain to the last man by the Courier, the Misfits were at least spared the humiliation of dying during Caesar's attack on Camp Golf.
0DI0004751	Few mourned their absence.
0DI0004752	Shaped up by the Courier's advice, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack on Camp Golf.
0DI0004753	Mags was finally promoted to Sergeant, and the rest of the Misfits received an official commendation.
0DI0004754	They continued to serve with distinction for many years.
0DI0004755	Though Camp Golf fell to Caesar, the Misfits distinguished themselves during the Legion's attack.
0DI0004756	Mags and her soldiers were posthumously recognized for their valor by NCR.
0DI0004757	The Misfits' laziness caught up with them when the Legion attacked Camp Golf.
0DI0004758	Those who weren't killed in the attack attempted to flee, but were caught at Mojave Outpost, court-martialed, and hanged from the ranger monument.
0DI0004759	Driven into a frenzy by their use of Psycho, the Misfits inflicted heavy casualties on the Legion during the defense of Camp Golf.
0DI0004760	At first they were commended for their valor, but eventually, desperate for more of the chem, they turned on travelers in Outer Vegas.
0DI0004761	For their dishonorable conduct, the NCR court-martialed and executed them by firing squad.
0DI0004762	Mr. House's Securitron army took control of Hoover Dam and The Strip, pushing both the Legion and the exhausted NCR out of New Vegas.
0DI0004763	Mr. House continued to run New Vegas his way, a despotic vision of Pre-War glory. The streets were orderly, efficient, cold.
0DI0004764	New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.
0DI0004765	The New California Republic celebrated its second victory at Hoover Dam, establishing definitive control over the entire Mojave Wasteland.
0DI0004766	Soon after, they negotiated terms to annex The Strip, Freeside, and many surrounding communities.
0DI0004767	The Mojave wasteland, at long last, had entirely fallen under the NCR's banner.
0DI0004768	Despite their vigilance against potential attacks by the Legion, the citizens of Novac were no match for the Courier.
0DI0004769	The motel and Dinky the Dinosaur were left vacant, a rare stop at best for travelers along Highway 95.
0DI0004770	Though Novac was a low-priority target for the Legion, many of Novac's citizens died in its defense.
0DI0004771	In the weeks that followed, feral ghouls, overflowing from the REPCONN Test Site, ravaged the weakened town.
0DI0004773	With no other communities coming to its defense, Novac would eventually fall to the Legion's persistent attacks.
0DI0004775	In the weeks that followed, several Bright Followers returned to Novac to help restore its defenses, allowing it to remain independent of NCR.
0DI0004776	During the Legion's attack on Novac, Bright Followers, returning from their long pilgrimage, assisted in its evacuation.
0DI0004777	Though Novac eventually fell to the Legion, many citizens of Novac were able to escape, alive and intact.
0DI0004778	While the destruction of the REPCONN rockets appeared to be a boon to the salvagers of Novac, the benefit would never be realized.
0DI0004779	Radioactive fuel from the wrecked ships seeped out and contaminated the area. Salvagers were forced to move on, and the town was abandoned.
0DI0004780	With Cooke dead, the Powder Gangers at Vault 19 fell apart.
0DI0004781	Those who weren't destroyed by the Courier fled into the hills or attempted to work their way back through the Mojave Wasteland. Few survived.
0DI0004782	Armed with a wide array of improvised explosives and stolen weapons, the Vault 19 Powder Gang tormented the Mojave Wasteland for years.
0DI0004783	Citizens of the NCR were favorite targets, and they always suffered the worst fates.
0DI0004784	After the Vault 19 Powder Gang surrendered to the NCR, they were re-incorporated into the correctional system.
0DI0004785	The NCR did increase their sentences, as they aren't about to take off time for good behavior.
0DI0004786	After the majority of the Vault 19 Powder Gangers joined the Great Khans, the weaker members scattered throughout the Mojave Wasteland.
0DI0004787	Though a few managed to erase their pasts, most never survived the journey.
0DI0004788	Primm, already torn apart by Powder Gangers, was dealt a killing blow by the Courier.
0DI0004789	Though prospectors pick through the remains of the town from time to time, no one re-establishes it as a settlement.
0DI0004790	After Hoover Dam, NCR helps rebuild Primm as a major stopping point on the Long 15.
0DI0004791	Though Primm's citizens chafe under NCR's taxes, they benefit greatly from the increased protection and merchant traffic.
0DI0004792	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Mr. House.
0DI0004793	As repayment for their NCR loyalty, Mr. House sends Securitrons to Primm to "protect" it and collect heavy taxes from its citizens.
0DI0004794	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to Caesar.
0DI0004795	Though Caesar keeps Primm open for business, its citizens live under the constant watch of Legion soldiers.
0DI0004796	Despite NCR's pledge to support Primm, they abandon the town after their loss to the Courier.
0DI0004797	Independent again, Primm operates much as it had before the Powder Gangs arrived: full of ups and downs.
0DI0004798	After Hoover Dam, Sheriff Meyers runs Primm with his own style of frontier justice.
0DI0004799	He deals with most folks fairly, but now and then someone winds up dead with little to no evidence against them.
0DI0004800	Hot-headed to the end, Sheriff Meyers choose to oppose Caesar's takeover of Primm with a standoff.
0DI0004801	Though the citizens take out a few Legionaries, the town quickly falls to Caesar, its citizens utterly wiped out.
0DI0004802	Primm Slim proves to be an able-minded, if not able-bodied, sheriff for Primm.
0DI0004803	Due to his slow speed, some crooks get away without a scratch, but Primm continues to prosper under his watchful robotic eye.
0DI0004804	Not understanding the gravity of the Legion's imminent takeover of Primm, Sheriff Primm Slim valiantly attempts to resist Caesar's will.
0DI0004805	After the death of Chief Hanlon, the power of NCR's Rangers was broken for years.
0DI0004806	Their organization, so reliant on the wisdom and guidance of its elder members, became a shadow of what it once was to people across the wasteland.
0DI0004807	Defying Chief Hanlon's worst fears, NCR's rangers persevered and distinguished themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004808	The rangers, along with NCR's many troopers, shared the glory of victory.
0DI0004809	Hanlon wisely stayed out of the spotlight, crediting General Oliver's leadership for NCR's success.
0DI0004810	After a brief fanfare, Hanlon stepped down as chief and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch outside of Redding.
0DI0004811	During the attack on Hoover Dam, Chief Hanlon and his rangers threw themselves into the path of the Legion assault, dying to the last man and woman.
0DI0004812	In the aftermath that followed in the NCR, bitter citizens and opportunistic senators were quick to denounce President Kimball and General Oliver.
0DI0004813	Hanlon and his fallen rangers were revered for their bravery and sacrifice.
0DI0004814	Despite distinguishing themselves during the second Battle of Hoover Dam, the rangers' victory was short-lived due to the Courier's interference.
0DI0004815	Chief Hanlon personally directed the evacuation of the rangers to Mojave Outpost as they fell back into NCR territory.
0DI0004816	Bitter over the waste of life in the Mojave, Hanlon stepped down from his post.
0DI0004817	After a campaign in which he denounced Oliver's and Kimball's hawkish, imperialist ways, Hanlon was elected as the senator of Redding.
0DI0004818	Although they performed admirably during NCR's defense of Hoover Dam, the rangers fell into decline soon after.
0DI0004819	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver hailed as NCR's new war hero, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
0DI0004820	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the organization quickly dwindled.
0DI0004821	With Caesar's victory came a small measure of vindication for the rangers' late Chief Hanlon.
0DI0004822	Upon the military's return, debate raged within NCR's senate about who was to blame for the loss of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004823	Though some in NCR regarded Hanlon as a traitor, many believed he was the only military commander who saw the futility in defending New Vegas.
0DI0004825	With Hanlon's plot against the occupation exposed and Oliver denounced for losing Hoover Dam, many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home.
0DI0004826	Few openly blamed the rangers for Hanlon's treachery, but public and political support for the military as a whole quickly dwindled.
0DI0004827	Due to the Courier's intervention, Chief Hanlon abandoned his plan to sabotage the defense of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004828	The rangers assisted the troopers admirably during the Legion's ill-fated attack.
0DI0004829	Though General Oliver and Chief Hanlon were both praised for their leadership, the chief quietly stepped out of the spotlight.
0DI0004830	After a brief fanfare for a life full of accomplishments, Chief Hanlon retired and returned to the peace and quiet of his ranch in Redding.
0DI0004832	The rangers heroically assisted NCR's troopers in their ill-fated defense against the overwhelming power of Caesar's Legion.
0DI0004833	Though many NCR military officers fled the territory soon after the dam was lost, Chief Hanlon remained at Camp Golf to surrender to the Legion.
0DI0004834	Out of respect for Hanlon's composure and worth as an adversary, Caesar had him beheaded.
0DI0004838	Despite the late Caesar's respect for Chief Hanlon as an adversary, Legate Lanius had Hanlon crucified along with all of the other rangers.
0DI0004841	Though the Courier snatched victory from NCR, only General Oliver was blamed for the loss of Hoover Dam.
0DI0004842	Hanlon, exhausted after a lifetime of service to the NCR, stepped down from his position in the rangers and retired to his ranch in Redding.
0DI0004843	After a long and eventful life, Raul's luck finally ran out during his time with the Courier.
0DI0004844	Still grappling with self-doubt over his usefulness in the face of old age, Raul was never able to find peace with himself.
0DI0004845	Eventually, he left the Mojave and assumed a new name, as he had done so many times before.
0DI0004846	Invigorated by his travels with the Courier, Raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost Rafaela.
0DI0004847	Soon after, the Mojave was filled with tales of the ghost-vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak.
0DI0004848	Convinced that his time as a gunslinger was past, Raul made peace with the idea of growing old.
0DI0004849	After traveling with the Courier for a time, he retired and settled down in Outer Vegas, where he would spend his days fixing ancient machinery.
0DI0004850	Despite surviving the destruction of the oil rig and the loss of their comrades at Navarro, the venerable Remnants were no match for the Courier.
0DI0004851	They carried the secrets of their old lives to their graves.
0DI0004852	After their bold arrival at Hoover Dam, the Remnants disappeared as quickly as they came.
0DI0004853	Legends of their power spread throughout the southwest, a reminder of why people once feared the sight of vertibirds in the sky.
0DI0004854	Merciless in their assault on the NCR, the Remnants struck fear into the hearts of even the Centurions at Hoover Dam.
0DI0004855	Well aware of the full extent of their power, Caesar commanded his troops to not pursue them.
0DI0004857	Caesar's heirs aggressively pursued the Remnants into Arizona, losing hundreds of Legionaries in the process and gaining nothing in return.
0DI0004858	He had survived police service in Colorado, the Great War, combat duty with the Legion, and being the companion of The King.
0DI0004859	But, in the end, Rex finally succumbed to the horrors of the wasteland.
0DI0004860	Having never received a replacement brain, Rex finally succumbed to old age, abruptly shutting down forever one quiet morning.
0DI0004861	After two centuries of life and decades of service to humanity, Rex collapses and dies.
0DI0004862	Revitalized by Violetta's brain, Rex eventually learned to balance the memories of his old life with Violetta's experiences among the brutal Fiends.
0DI0004863	His mind had difficulty adjusting, but Rex eventually found peace with his new, more vicious self.
0DI0004864	With the transplant of Lupa's brain, Rex gained all of the donor's experiences traveling with the Legion.
0DI0004865	These melded well with his own memories of the Legion, and his new mind quickly adjusted to the myriad memories.
0DI0004866	After Rey's brain was transplanted into Rex's cybernetic body, it took Rex some time to adjust to the old scrap yard dog's memories.
0DI0004867	Eventually, Rex's mind settled peacefully, melding his own memories with that of long travels with Old Lady Gibson.
0DI0004868	At odds with leadership over the Brotherhood's future, Veronica looked to the Mojave Wasteland for an answer both she and they could live with.
0DI0004869	But the answer would never come, and the dangers of the world that had left the Brotherhood of Steel behind would eventually claim her life.
0DI0004870	Hoping to lead the Mojave Brotherhood down a new path, Veronica sought to learn from the thriving cultures of the desert.
0DI0004871	Absent a firm solution, Veronica's expression of frustration with Brotherhood leadership would lead to her banishment.
0DI0004872	She ended her days a wandering tinker.
0DI0004873	Despite her departure from the group, the Brotherhood's peace treaty with NCR came as some relief to Veronica.
0DI0004874	Though she remained friendly with surface patrols, she was never again permitted to enter the bunker she once called home.
0DI0004875	Fearing for the safety of anyone she associated with, she continued her solitary life as a scavenger.
0DI0004876	But reports would emerge from Mojave scientists and social workers of old equipment miraculously repaired and research notes mysteriously completed.
0DI0004877	Though she'd seen the writing on the wall, the destruction of the Mojave Brotherhood came far more suddenly than Veronica had expected.
0DI0004878	The news devastated her. Despite her best efforts to leave her past behind, she found herself compelled to make one final journey to Hidden Valley.
0DI0004879	There, she paid her last respects to the only family she had ever known.
0DI0004880	The Brotherhood's open aggression along the New Vegas highways troubled Veronica greatly.
0DI0004881	Nevertheless, it removed all doubt from her mind that in leaving them she had made the right choice.
0DI0004882	Eventually she would take to the road, less in hopes of finding a new home than of leaving memories of the old one behind her.
0DI0004883	The peace with NCR served to ease Veronica's worries about the Brotherhood's immediate future.
0DI0004884	Still, a distance had arisen between her and her fellow members that would never be bridged.
0DI0004885	She began secluding herself in crumbling libraries of the Old World, learning of promising technologies she knew the Brotherhood would never adopt.
0DI0004886	The death of the Mojave Brotherhood came much too soon for Veronica, and in their absence, she felt truly lost.
0DI0004887	Yet in its wake, she took small comfort in her decision to remain by their side through their few remaining days.
0DI0004888	Veronica put her moral sensibilities aside and supported the Brotherhood's new campaign of aggression as best she could.
0DI0004889	Yet deep down, she understood that it meant their end would surely be soon to follow.
0DI0004890	If you say so. I already got paid, after all.
0DI0004891	I'm glad that you understand. After you.
0DI0004892	You're either brave or crazy. Either way, I don't care.
0DI0004893	You'll probably be able to think of a few more before you leave, trust me.
0DI0004894	If you're sure, then I guess I'll take my leave. You know where to find me.
0DI0004896	Now you're talking. Here's how it works, I'll keep nearby for the duration of your stay here, and no one messes with you.
0DI0004897	As soon as you split Freeside, I'm off. Nothin' too complicated. That said, lead the way, chief.
0DI0004898	That's a shame. Well, come back when you do.
0DI0004899	Freeside's a rough and tumble place, but it also belongs to the Kings. You have one of us with you, and everyone else'll give you a wide berth.
0DI0004900	Makes the stroll a bit more leisurely.
0DI0004901	That's what they all say. At first.
0DI0004902	Cocky, aren't you? Oh well, your call.
0DI0004903	Nothing while I'm on the clock. You wanna know about us, head on over to our place. It's the one with the big sign that says "The Kings".
0DI0004904	You need anything else?
0DI0004905	Lead, and I shall follow.
0DI0004906	Great. As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be hanging out by side. It'll be a blast.
0DI0004907	But I'm only sticking around as long as you're in Freeside. You leave, and you'll find me gone as well.
0DI0004908	So where to?
0DI0004909	Then I guess you're on your own.
0DI0004910	Freeside's a little dangerous for people traveling alone or in small groups. You go without a guard, you're rolling the dice, you know?
0DI0004911	You must be new. Your tune'll change, trust me.
0DI0004913	Whatever you say.
0DI0004914	Nothing. I'm working right now. You want to know more, head over to our hangout at the center of town. It's kinda hard to miss.
0DI0004916	You want the best, you have to be prepared to pay for it.
0DI0004917	I can give you something to bite down on if you want. This'll hurt.
0DI0004918	Can't help you, then. Medical supplies aren't cheap, you know.
0DI0004920	This shouldn't be too much work. Try to sit still.
0DI0004922	Not a problem. Just some scrapes here and there.
0DI0004924	Ordinarily I'd take your word on that, but lately I've had several people lie and claim to be citizens just to take advantage of our program.
0DI0004925	But I've come up with a fairly simple way to tell who's lying. You up to taking a little test?
0DI0004926	In that case, I'm sorry. Our program is only for citizens of the NCR.
0DI0004927	[SUCCEEDED] You don't look like you're from around here, so I guess I can believe that.
0DI0004928	Just head to the northwest part of town, by the old train station. We start handing out supplies at six every night.
0DI0004929	There'll be some guards by the door, but just remember that the password is "Hope," and they'll let you by right quick.
0DI0004930	[FAILED] I'd like to believe you, but I can't take the risk under current circumstances.
0DI0004931	Please, don't let me keep you if you have somewhere else to be.
0DI0004932	This'll just take a few moments, and it's all stuff that any real citizen of the NCR knows.
0DI0004933	Okay, first question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
0DI0004934	Sorry to have bothered you, then.
0DI0004935	Interesting. Okay, next question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - The Boneyard, Shady Sands, Aradesh, or Vault 13?
0DI0004937	Fair enough. All right, last question - What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
0DI0004939	Very good! I'm happy to say you've proven you're definitely an NCR citizen, which means you qualify for our program.
0DI0004942	I'm sorry, but you didn't get all of the questions right, which proves you're not a citizen of the NCR. Sorry.
0DI0004944	I probably shouldn't let you, but I suppose everyone has an bad day now and then. Did you want to take it now?
0DI0004945	They should. I guess it's possible that some don't, but this stuff is pretty common knowledge.
0DI0004946	Tell you what, come back later and you can take the test again, okay?
0DI0004947	Okay, here we go again. Who was the most popular president in NCR history, Kimball, Tibbett, Tandi, or Peterson?
0DI0004948	That's fine. I'll let you take the test again whenever you choose to come back.
0DI0004949	Hey, wait up a moment. I can tell you're really upset that you didn't pass the test, so I'll let you take it again any time you want to come back.
0DI0004950	It'll be my good deed for the day. Take care now.
0DI0004951	Now, it's not that I don't believe you, but I'm going to have to give you a little quiz to verify your citizenship status. That okay with you?
0DI0004952	Then I'm afraid I have nothing to offer you, sorry.
0DI0004953	That's a good attitude! I'm sure you'll do fine. These are just a few questions that just about anyone in the NCR would know.
0DI0004954	All right, here we go. First question. Who was the most popular president in NCR history - Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
0DI0004955	You can always take it later. Stop back anytime.
0DI0004956	Uh huh. Okay, second question - what was the original name of the NCR capital - Aradesh, Shady Sands, The Boneyard, or Vault 13?
0DI0004958	Right. Fine then, last question -  What animal is on the NCR's flag - a two-headed bear, an eagle, a two-headed snake, or a two-tailed lion?
0DI0004960	Good. You passed with flying colors. I told you it'd be fine. I expect you're wanting to know about that meal then, huh?
0DI0004961	We're located up by the old train station, in the northwest part of town. Just tell the guards "Hope" and they'll let you through.
0DI0004962	Best of luck to you.
0DI0004963	Ooh, I'm sorry. It looks like you've got some of your facts mixed up. I'm afraid I can't help you.
0DI0004965	I'm not really supposed to administer the test more than once, but what the hell? You're the only new face I've seen today.
0DI0004966	Did you want to take it again right away?
0DI0004967	All right, here we go. First question - who was the most popular president in NCR history, Peterson, Tibbett, Kimball, or Tandi?
0DI0004968	Just stop by and we'll go over it again.
0DI0004969	I'm sure some don't, but the loyal ones do. And that's who we're aiming to help - the loyal ones.
0DI0004970	Still, you've got a fire in you that tells me you're one of us and just screwed up, so I'll let you take the test again if you'd like.
0DI0004971	[SUCCEEDED] Now I know you're from the NCR! None of the vagrants around here would even think of giving their money away.
0DI0004974	[FAILED] Look, we're trying to help people here. Put away your money.
0DI0004975	No need to get angry about this. Look, I'll let you take the test again if you want. Go and clear your mind and come back, and we'll try again.
0DI0004976	In that case, don't mind me. Carry on.
0DI0004977	Wha-? Oh, shit. I heard of you. Look, we didn't mean nothing by this. Just following orders. You want us gone, we're gone - no problem.
0DI0004978	Eesh, boss, are you trying to destroy my knees even faster than nature?
0DI0004979	Oh, wearing this is not going to be good to me.
0DI0004980	How'd you know I had a sweet tooth, boss?
0DI0004981	Ahh, sarsaparilla. That's just what this dry old throat needs.
0DI0004982	You're going to rot my teeth, boss. What's left of them, anyways.
0DI0004983	What do you think of guys like Ranger Andy?
0DI0004984	Sure, boss. I'm sure you've got a lot to think about.
0DI0004985	Yeah, okay, boss. Take your time. Not like I'm a decrepit old man who might keel over dead any minute.
0DI0004986	I mean guys who have a world of experience doing what they do, but have to give it up because they're getting old and slow, or too injured.
0DI0004987	That wasn't what I meant, really.
0DI0004988	Maybe... yeah. I guess you've got a point there.
0DI0004989	Yeah, I suppose you're right. Guys like us can't compete any more.
0DI0004990	Did I say us? I meant "him." Guess my eyesight isn't the only thing that's going.
0DI0004991	Yeah, I suppose he could still teach, take a less-active role in the world. That's not so bad.
0DI0004992	Maybe, but what if he really doesn't have it?
0DI0004993	A little of both, I guess.
0DI0004999	<pant! pant!>
0DI0005002	<aroo!>
0DI0005011	<pant pant pant>
0DI0005012	[The paint, though weathered and fading, is still a recent addition to Rex's bodywork.]
0DI0005014	[Rex's new brain looks fresh and healthy.]
0DI0005015	[Rex's brain looks sickly, and the gel in which it's contained doesn't look much better.]
0DI0005016	[Rex's bodywork is battered, scorched, and scratched. It's remarkable that the biological part of him survived at all.]
0DI0005017	I don't know. Last time anyone saw him was in the battle at HELIOS One. I wasn't there.
0DI0005018	He gave orders to hold the plant until it could be reactivated. But he ran out of time. The NCR overran it. Everyone thought he was dead.
0DI0005019	But I got a note from him at a comm station. That's... how he liked to talk, even to me. He wasn't good at face-to-face.
0DI0005020	Yeah. I miss him.
0DI0005021	Elijah could look at an old device and immediately understand what made it work. And he could see its potential. Where it fit with other technology.
0DI0005022	It's not something you can teach, but he tried with me. Some of it stuck.
0DI0005023	But that's what he taught me. You asked what I learned from him.
0DI0005025	I learned what I don't want to become.
0DI0005026	In the end, there was just him and his vision. Nothing and no one else.
0DI0005027	It was... strange. Even for Father Elijah. He's always been unstable, but this was... something else.
0DI0005028	I don't want to say delusional, but I don't know what else to call it. The only thing familiar about it was the signature.
0DI0005029	He said the Brotherhood was doomed, but that he'd return, save us. But the way he said it... I don't know...
0DI0005030	Said he'd return with one of the greatest treasures of the Old World, make the Mojave like it was meant to be... wipe the slate clean.
0DI0005031	It was by his request, actually. He cleared it with the other Elders. Somehow.
0DI0005032	They sent him to look into the Dam. There was a time when I'd have begged to follow. Watch him at work.
0DI0005033	He did. For years, he fought with the Council. Taught me to question our direction. Meanwhile he'd become more out-of-touch than all of them.
0DI0005034	On our way East he demanded we stop at HELIOS One to examine it. While we were there, we received word that the NCR had taken the Dam.
0DI0005035	He was furious. Called it "children playing with a bomb." But he was mad because we'd lost its power. What we'd use it for... he didn't even care.
0DI0005036	Yeah, I did. I couldn't help him.
0DI0005037	He just didn't listen. And the idea that people talked back to him...
0DI0005038	If he could have made the Brotherhood act like machines, ordering them around with a push of a button, he would have.
0DI0005039	They're cautious. When they discover something, they respect it, learn its limits, consider how to preserve it. Used to drive Father Elijah crazy.
0DI0005040	He liked to learn limits, too, but only so he could push them.
0DI0005041	That's not to excuse the other Elders, though. They all covet technology for its own sake. Some are just more fanatical than others.
0DI0005042	You take care of our problems here and I'll give you the information that you need.
0DI0005043	Them Powder Gangsters got our deputy locked up in the Bison Steve. Be nice to get him out of there... but this town's gonna need some real law.
0DI0005044	One of the first things them punks did when they came in was to kill our sheriff. You find us a new one and we can talk.
0DI0005045	I'll be there, but it won't mean squat if the rest of the group isn't there, too.
0DI0005046	I hope you weren't thinking we were going to take the lead. That's no job for a bunch of graybeards. Or grayheads, in Whitman's case.
0DI0005047	I'll be there at the reunion. Let's hope the others show up, too, or this plan isn't going to work.
0DI0005048	Yeah, well, don't count on us sticking around if things get too hot. We're not a suicide squad. I'll go to this reunion.
0DI0005049	You haven't decided - well, this is just getting better every second, isn't it?
0DI0005050	I wouldn't mind cutting down a few platoons of NCR troopers with my old gatling laser.
0DI0005051	Yeah, it does. There's not a chance you'll find me helping the NCR in any way. They've caused me too much grief.
0DI0005052	Oh, I'll come, but depending on the plan, I might not be staying. Keep that in mind.
0DI0005053	All right, then - I'll show up at this gathering of yours. It might be good to see the others - Johnson excluded.
0DI0005054	Arcade might've mentioned there's a pass phrase needed to get into the bunker - my part is "Remember."
0DI0005055	Little escapes the notice of Caesar's Legion. We know a great deal about the Vegas Strip, and the comings and goings of those who frequent it.
0DI0005056	Unlike most of my brothers and sisters, Mama didn't get sick of my father and get rid of him. He died right before I was born.
0DI0005057	Mama had liked him so much, she made me use his last name. Said he deserved that much at least, since he never got to meet me or nothin'.
0DI0005058	Got a second to talk, boss?
0DI0005059	That's a good thing to see, huh boss?
0DI0005060	Questions, boss? You mean you don't know everything there is to know already?
0DI0005061	Hey boss, can I ask you something?
0DI0005062	Sure, boss. What do you want to know?
0DI0005063	That's what I love about you, boss, your firm belief that one day you'll actually remember things people tell you. What do you want to hear about?
0DI0005064	I grew up in a place called Hidalgo Ranch just outside Mexico City. It wasn't much, just a bit of farm with a house for three generations of Tejadas.
0DI0005065	I wasn't the best-behaved kid. I was quick with my hands, with a pistol or a wrench, and I wasn't afraid to get into fights over it.
0DI0005066	I never killed anybody, but I had my share of run-ins with the police. Mostly my family kept me in line.
0DI0005067	This was before the war. We were far enough away from Mexico City when the bombs fell that we missed the worst of it - but things got bad quick.
0DI0005068	After the fire, I knew my sister and I couldn't stay at Hidalgo Ranch anymore. The refugees still wanted me dead - they even put a bounty on me.
0DI0005069	I remember how scared Rafaela was. I told her if she came with me, we'd see the vaqueros - she used to love the rodeo, especially the trick riders.
0DI0005070	We figured maybe we could find help in Mexico City - we were young, we didn't know what had happened, really. We didn't understand about the bombs.
0DI0005071	I left everything when I left Mexico: my home, my family, my name - even my face. I know it's surprising, boss, but I wasn't always this handsome.
0DI0005072	As far as the world knew, I was Miguel, and I was okay with that. I headed north for a while, and ended up in Tuscon - not Two-Sun, by the way.
0DI0005073	Things were good there. Well, maybe not good, but better than Mexico City, anyways. I found myself a little shack and started fixing things.
0DI0005074	Just how old do you think I am, boss? Because I can pretty much guarantee I'm older than that. Let me tell you a story from before the Great War:
0DI0005075	Everybody knew Robert House. He was a genius. A superstar. Founded RobCo at 22, dated Hollywood starlets, the works. They say he saved Las Vegas.
0DI0005076	I was in Mexico City when the bombs dropped. Even from there, we could see House's defensive rockets shooting down the incoming missiles.
0DI0005077	Everybody assumed he died in the War. Maybe he did. But his robots are still out there, roaming the Wastes. And now, a Mr. House rules New Vegas.
0DI0005078	Sure, boss. I saw lots of guys like that while I was held prisoner by an insane supermutant in an isolated mountain fortress. Can you narrow it down?
0DI0005079	Benny, huh? Sorry boss, doesn't ring a bell. Then again, my brain isn't as sharp as it used to be.
0DI0005080	They're all right, I suppose. Had a bit of tough going there at the beginning - you know their first town was nearly wiped out by raiders?
0DI0005081	Anyway, they've got their good points and their bad, just like a lot of the old governments from before the War.
0DI0005082	I don't really have a problem with them. People around here tend to see them as invading marauders planning to burn and pillage the countryside.
0DI0005083	But I've been to Arizona, boss. Before the Legion, it was a nasty place, so thick with raiders you couldn't trade with a town two miles up the road.
0DI0005084	Caesar's laws aren't nice, and their actions aren't always pretty. But then, neither am I, but you keep me around.
0DI0005085	It's big, it's bright, and it's one of the biggest cities still left from before the War. Well, mostly, anyway.
0DI0005086	Used to be just a curiosity. The buildings were pre-War, but it was just as full of raiders and barbarian tribes as anyplace else.
0DI0005087	Then Mr. House took over, got the power turned back on, and got the tribes reformed into something civilized. Now they run his casinos for him.
0DI0005088	You're a veritable guyser of curiosity, boss.
0DI0005089	Anything to hold your attention, boss.
0DI0005090	Anything you say, boss.
0DI0005091	Just a little bit, boss. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
0DI0005092	You know what, boss, that's my fault for using sarcasm. No, I haven't seen him. Sounds like a city slicker, though. Might try looking on the Strip.
0DI0005093	Maybe not. Maybe the new guy is just a clever raider chief with a knowledge of history.
0DI0005094	Maybe he just left instructions for his robots to carry out in his name.
0DI0005095	Or maybe Robert House uploaded his brain pattern into a computer and rules to this day, a godless, soulless machine-god!
0DI0005096	Or maybe the whole thing's a crazy coincidence. Who knows?
0DI0005097	I remember there were some weird stories about him, especially near the end.
0DI0005098	There was a tell-all in El Periodico de las Aburridas by a starlet House dated. She said they never, um... don't make me spell it out, boss.
0DI0005099	Anyway, she said all he wanted to do was scan her brain and make her dress up in different outfits.
0DI0005100	It was quite the scandal, at least in the Latin-American tabloid journalism market.
0DI0005101	Since Johnson won't be needing his Power Armor, I've decided to let you have it. You'll need training in how to use it, so talk to Moreno about it.
0DI0005102	I've known them far longer than you have. They'll get over it.
0DI0005103	I'd like a large Atomic Shake and a double Brahmin burger. And easy on the agave sauce this time.
0DI0005104	We gave you a password, Veronica. It's for your safety.
0DI0005105	I know where you live Ramos. Open up.
0DI0005106	<Sighs> For Pete's sake. Opening up. Welcome back, Veronica.
0DI0005107	Hold on, I've got this.
0DI0005108	Not much to tell. Benny had one of Mr. House's Securitrons, deactivated, and wanted it switched back on.
0DI0005109	He had heard I was interested in Mr. House's technology so he hit me up... so to speak.
0DI0005110	I take it you're speaking from experience.
0DI0005111	You're right though. He's gone now, so I'm not going to let it bother me anymore. Thanks.
0DI0005112	That's sweet of you to say, even if it isn't true.
0DI0005113	Good point.
0DI0005114	And maybe you should go jump off Hoover Dam, jackass.
0DI0005115	Not exactly sure... radio's been on the fritz, and since I haven't heard any shooting, I don't think it's urgent. Can't hurt to go ask her.
0DI0005116	I disagree. You're the one who wanted our help in the first place. You want us to succeed, you go talk to Moreno.
0DI0005117	You've got only one chance at this. I know Moreno - once he's made up his mind about something, there's no changing it.
0DI0005118	You guys are actually going to help the Legion? No thanks - count me out of this one.
0DI0005119	Well, anyway, Judah's given Orion's armor to you now. It'll take a few hours for me to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
0DI0005120	Yeah, he did.
0DI0005121	Right. Moving on, then.
0DI0005122	No, I'm done talking.
0DI0005124	Sign says you go south... just look for the rollercoaster. Oh and don't go north, a caravan just got sacked up the road.
0DI0005125	Just a hunter, out here killing things and hoping their hides fetch more than the bullets cost to kill 'em.
0DI0005126	Watch your back out there.
0DI0005128	Keep your guns loaded and ready.
0DI0005129	I could use some Stimpaks... how 'bout some nice Bloatfly Steaks in trade?
0DI0005130	That's a dangerous question... asked the way a bandit might ask... but since we're close to town I'll trust your good intentions.
0DI0005131	It just gets worse the further north you go... Deathclaws... death in general. But it's your ass, I suppose.
0DI0005133	Just let me know if you decide you want something.
0DI0005134	Okay, so take the Brotherhood. Replace their knowledge of superweapons with half as much knowledge of medicine and farming.
0DI0005135	Sprinkle in a little compassion for people outside their group and healthy disrespect for authority, and voila. Followers.
0DI0005136	I never really considered joining before. But now that I think about it, it really sounds like it could be a good fit, doesn't it?
0DI0005137	I want... a dress.
0DI0005138	I would say he was my tutor, but that doesn't cover it.
0DI0005139	After my parents passed, he looked after me. The whole Brotherhood brought me up, really, but he made sure of it.
0DI0005140	I never had a grandfather - not that I knew, anyway - but Elijah was in some ways what I'd imagine a grandfather to be.
0DI0005141	Just my parents, but they haven't been around for a long time. Dad was a Paladin, Mom was a Scribe.
0DI0005142	They died in the same battle trying to hold off the NCR from... something. I don't remember what it was. Guess it seemed important at the time.
0DI0005143	Yeah! A good one. Something elegant and classy, you know? But still stylish.
0DI0005144	Something that's eye-catching and sexy, but also says "don't fuck with me."
0DI0005145	I keep hoping I'll come across some Old World designer gown when I'm scavenging, but it never happens. Maybe I should move back to California.
0DI0005146	Can I make it up?
0DI0005147	Like what?
0DI0005148	Hey, you try getting a date wearing Scribe robes. Might as well be wearing sweatpants.
0DI0005149	I just like 'em, you know? They make you feel like a woman. Those ladies before the War, they knew what they were doing.
0DI0005150	You can find him in the main embassy building inside the gate and to your left.
0DI0005151	Uh... I'm afraid Ambassador Crocker is no longer here. You might want to talk to the receptionist for more information.
0DI0005152	This is the NCR Embassy. Our little slice of heaven on the Strip.
0DI0005153	The main building houses administration while the other building is the MP headquarters on the Strip.
0DI0005154	The usual. Troopers getting drunk and causing problems. Like that's a surprise to anyone.
0DI0005155	Hell, I plan on getting drunk once I'm done with my shift. Maybe even head over to Gomorrah for a good time.
0DI0005156	You hear about the girls dancing in the fountain? What I wouldn't give to see that show.
0DI0005157	Not much other than the Brahmin being chased down the street. That's a little unusual even for the Strip.
0DI0005158	I heard some of the Troopers are sneaking up on the rooftops and lounging around and drinking beers instead of working.
0DI0005159	They'll be in a world of trouble if Captain Pappas catches them.
0DI0005160	Someone thought it would be fun to put graffiti up everywhere. At least I don't have to clean it up.
0DI0005161	More of the same. People gambling, getting drunk, and having a good time.
0DI0005162	Well, there's the Lucky 38, Ultra-Luxe, Gomorrah, and The Tops. Which one do you want to know about?
0DI0005163	Well, there's Vault 21 and the NCR Embassy. Both places are located on the south side of the Strip.
0DI0005164	Vault 21 is a small hotel and gift shop. It's not as nice as the casinos, but it's a whole hell of a lot cheaper.
0DI0005165	The NCR Embassy is the headquarters for the NCR on the Strip. The Ambassador and his offices are there as well as the MP headquarters.
0DI0005166	Well it's time to pop your Vegas cherry, friend! I'm sure you'll have a blast and be drunk and capless in no time.
0DI0005167	I can give you a bit more information about the various casinos if you're not sure on where to get started.
0DI0005168	Okay then. You should know the rules. Just stay out of trouble, and have fun.
0DI0005169	You're not getting started off on the right foot here. The NCR still has a strong presence here and can make your stay unpleasant.
0DI0005170	You better watch yourself out there. A loose cannon like yourself can sometimes run out of luck at just the wrong time.
0DI0005171	Don't know much about it to tell the truth.
0DI0005172	That's where Mr. House and his Securitrons are set up, but no one's been in there as long as people can remember.
0DI0005173	Probably best that you just ignore it.
0DI0005174	The Ultra-Luxe is the nicest casino on the Strip. Real high-end, extravagant, and expensive. Best you have a lot of caps if you want to go there.
0DI0005175	Gomorrah is the favorite of the NCR troops on the Strip. If you like girls, alcohol, gambling, and drugs then Gomorrah is just the place for you.
0DI0005176	The Tops is the cool place to be right now. Lots of entertainment and shows going on there as well as the gambling.
0DI0005177	If you want to catch a show and have a few drinks, you should definitely hit up the Aces Theater in The Tops.
0DI0005178	Ask away.
0DI0005179	A crude question, crudely asked.
0DI0005180	I'll be happy to satisfy your rambunctious curiosity at a more appropriate moment. But now, I'll repeat my question...
0DI0005181	What do you make of what you've seen?
0DI0005182	Take it.
0DI0005184	This is what I have right now.
0DI0005185	Let me know when you've decided.
0DI0005189	Stake a claim somewhere else, pretty boy.
0DI0005190	Looking for target practice, you keep talking.
0DI0005191	Wanted to be with someone who knew how to please a woman, that's what.
0DI0005192	No, and ain't looking to be a babysitter, neither.
0DI0005193	Somebody's asking for a boot in their fusebox.
0DI0005194	| Wild Wasteland |Ain't nothing but a hound dog.
0DI0005195	I'm not the man you need, pretty boy.
0DI0005196	Show me one, and I'll do him proud.
0DI0005197	Got enough on my shoulders without adding more dead weight to 'em.
0DI0005198	A drink wouldn't make you any prettier, slick.
0DI0005199	As long as you leave right after you put your caps down, you're on.
0DI0005200	Looking for love or to put me to sleep, kid?
0DI0005201	If you're looking for action, grab some grease from your hair and give your gun a few pulls.
0DI0005202	Not interested in any weapon that shoots blanks.
0DI0005203	Not for all the whiskey in Reno.
0DI0005204	Barking up the wrong bar stool, kid.
0DI0005205	If you're looking for action, jam your dick in a locker and slam it a few times.
0DI0005206	An interesting story. It may even be true.
0DI0005207	Under normal circumstances, your story wouldn't make any difference. You'd be dead already.
0DI0005208	Lucky for you - probably - Elder McNamara wants to meet you. So follow me. Closely. Or you'll be killed.
0DI0005209	The password you gave is valid, but old. The only way you could have gotten it is from one of our lost patrols.
0DI0005210	I'm the one asking the questions right now, and you still haven't answered me. I suggest you start doing so.
0DI0005211	That's no longer an option, on account of you having one of our passwords. Now if you'd stop stalling, I'd really like to know where you learned it.
0DI0005212	I'm here to make sure the bunker stays in one piece.
0DI0005213	I'm a master at repairing things, so I check in every so often to make sure all the equipment here is in top working condition.
0DI0005214	If you ever have any gear you need fixed, don't hesitate to ask.
0DI0005215	I like to check up on things from time to time. I can't let this place fall apart, now can I?
0DI0005216	Since you're here, I can offer you some medical supplies. I can't give you everything I have but I can give you a few things.
0DI0005219	Okay, I'll have them here for you if you want them.
0DI0005220	I'm here to keep everything in order. As a friend of the Legion, I can offer you some supplies while you're here.
0DI0005221	I'm here to dust off the cobwebs, make sure everything is working, that sort of thing.
0DI0005222	Sometimes it can be a while between visits by rangers so it's good to have someone around to keep the lights on for them.
0DI0005223	I also bring ammo supplies with me for any rangers who may be running low. If you need any feel free to ask.
0DI0005224	Well, I shouldn't have come within a mile of here. I know that. These poor people.
0DI0005225	Seems like either way, there's not much I can do to help anyone.
0DI0005226	I think maybe it's safer if I don't try.
0DI0005227	No... I don't, do I? If I did, none of this would've happened.
0DI0005228	I should've left a long time ago. Cut my losses before it came to this.
0DI0005229	I never stood a chance.
0DI0005230	Isn't that what I just said? I know I'm responsible.
0DI0005231	I was just trying to put it all behind me. Find someplace where what I do would actually have some influence.
0DI0005232	I should've expected this, though. Different story, same ending.
0DI0005233	No. Not a chance in hell. I'm not risking this happening again.
0DI0005234	I'm gonna have to keep to myself. Better that way. For everyone.
0DI0005235	I'll still finish what I started with you, though. If you're not afraid, that is. I'll just try not to get too caught up in it all.
0DI0005236	Good, I've got more work than time to do it.
0DI0005237	An alliance? That's an interesting proposition - any plan where I can throw packs of raiders at the enemy instead of my own soldiers is a good one.
0DI0005239	Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit.
0DI0005240	We don't have time for diplomacy. This battle is coming any time now; if the leader won't be budged, he'll have to be replaced.
0DI0005241	I want you to go back to Red Rock Canyon and assassinate this Papa Khan. You'll have to be stealthy - if they see you do it, they'll kill you.
0DI0005242	Here, take this lockpicking gear. Your best bet is to wait until late at night find a back door, or catch him by surprise when he's alone.
0DI0005243	Good luck, soldier.
0DI0005244	Dismissed.
0DI0005245	Then why are you wasting my time?
0DI0005246	Dismissed!
0DI0005247	Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
0DI0005248	I'm afraid I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm a research scientist.
0DI0005249	You may want to try Old Mormon Fort in Freeside. They should have a doctor on duty.
0DI0005250	Possibly, but I'd be the wrong person to ask. You'll need to speak to Dr. Schiller, who's on an errand at one of our other stations.
0DI0005251	He should be back tomorrow.
0DI0005253	This is just a site for local Followers to pick up assignments and check in.
0DI0005254	So most of the time we're just taking care of logistics and coordinating with other checkpoints over the radio.
0DI0005255	No. We don't expect him back until tomorrow.
0DI0005256	That doesn't matter in the slightest. You are an accessory to treason simply by association.
0DI0005257	In the name of the Elder, I hereby sentence you to death.
0DI0005258	She has made her intentions plain. We will not risk any further damage.
0DI0005259	Did you just-? How dare you belch in the face of a Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel?!
0DI0005260	No, I don't wear it on- Enough.
0DI0005261	Well, I'll answer what I can.
0DI0005263	I guess I don't have anywhere better to be.
0DI0005264	Don't go getting yourself shot.
0DI0005265	Swooping in on a vertibird, guns blazing? Haven't done that in years, but all right, I'm in.
0DI0005266	None of this means a thing if the rest of the group doesn't show up, though.
0DI0005267	Oh, and you'll need my part of the pass phrase to get into the bunker - "Navarro."
0DI0005268	It really must be bad out there if he's sending you to us. Is the idea that we swoop in by vertibird, guns blazing?
0DI0005269	Well, assuming our equipment cache is intact, my squad would have the edge in armor and firepower.
0DI0005270	There's only a handful of us, though, so the best tactic would be for us to swoop in where the target isn't expecting us. How am I doing?
0DI0005271	Moreno, Johnson, Henry, and I will be the boots on the ground. Whitman will stay with the vertibird.
0DI0005272	This was a minor refueling station for vertibirds. It seemed an appropriate place to stash our equipment if we ever needed.
0DI0005273	I'm surprised this place hasn't fallen apart. When I put it into standby mode, I expected to return to it within a few years, not decades.
0DI0005274	You still need time to think?
0DI0005275	We'll be there when you need us.
0DI0005276	Then that's the plan. We're going to have a problem with Moreno, though. He won't like that we're helping the NCR - you'll have to talk to him.
0DI0005277	Well, now. An opportunity for payback after all these years. Johnson won't go along with it, though - he actually likes the NCR.
0DI0005278	I stopped being Moreno's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
0DI0005279	He won't turn on us, but he's a good shot and I'd hate to do this without him.
0DI0005280	They won, we didn't. It's as simple as that. The rest of us moved on while Moreno... didn't.
0DI0005281	Still, I'm not convinced Moreno hates the NCR as much as he thinks he does. You still might be able to talk him out of leaving.
0DI0005282	I stopped being Johnson's officer a long time ago. Everyone here respects me, but they don't need to follow my orders. Not anymore.
0DI0005284	No, I'm afraid. Johnson truly hates the Legion.
0DI0005285	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe you've actually talked me into this. Fine, I'm in, but don't expect me to hold my fire if any NCR troops get in the way.
0DI0005286	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no glory in helping out the NCR.
0DI0005287	So you help them at the Dam only to screw them over big time later? All right, I'll go along with this, then. I hope I don't regret it.
0DI0005288	Change of plan - you'll find that I've sealed the doors to this hangar - I don't want my friends getting involved in our little disagreement.
0DI0005289	Once I'm done with you, I'll talk them out of this stupid plan. You've opened some old wounds - it's only fair I return the favor.
0DI0005290	Getting my gear, what does it look like? What, you think I'm going to leave this here for someone like you? I don't think so.
0DI0005291	No amount of caps will ever repay what the NCR robbed from me.
0DI0005292	Good man. He's one of the Followers of the Apocalypse. He's the one who taught people around here how to start growing crops.
0DI0005293	Westside wouldn't be what it is without Anderson helping us out, so I cut him a deal on his rent.
0DI0005294	Anything else I can help you with?
0DI0005295	[SUCCEEDED] True. All right. The first try was a little less "professional". Someone important on the Strip had access to some of House's technology.
0DI0005296	Specifically, a Securitron. And more specifically, the "someone" was Benny. I know, I know... he shot you in the head and everything.
0DI0005297	But this was a while ago. I knew he was sleazy, but I didn't realize he was so cold-blooded.
0DI0005298	[FAILED] Just drop it, okay?
0DI0005300	See you when I see you.
0DI0005301	He sure didn't. Benny was pretty tight-lipped and cryptic about the thing, but he did let me poke around in it for a while.
0DI0005302	I wound up helping Benny a lot more than he helped me. Once he had access to the Securiton's memory banks, he kicked me out of the Tops.
0DI0005303	Big surprise, right? I should have seen that coming.
0DI0005304	The Securitron was disabled somehow. Might have been an EMP, given some of the damage I saw.
0DI0005305	Anyway, he wanted it re-enabled and connected to Mr. House's data network. The trick was getting it to be invisible on the network.
0DI0005306	If Mr. House detects a "rogue" Securitron in his system, he remotely fries it. Getting around that security feature was a bit tricky.
0DI0005307	Ugh. So gross. It was bad enough that I didn't get any data out of the Securitron. This is why I didn't want to talk about it.
0DI0005308	It only happened once. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and one atomic cocktail too many.
0DI0005309	Yes, strange as it sounds, I figured that bad mouthing one of the Strip's most powerful people wasn't a good idea.
0DI0005310	The only reason I'm telling you any of this is because he's gone now.
0DI0005311	Be careful they don't charge us any tolls.
0DI0005312	Don't tell them where we're from - or headed.
0DI0005313	Okay, just let me know when you want to talk numbers.
0DI0005314	Ah, it's nothing. You just looked like the health inspector who stopped through for the yearly inspection a couple weeks back.
0DI0005315	I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait another 11 months to see his crooked ass to get my caps back. Ah well, anything I can get you?
0DI0005316	Please... leave us alone.
0DI0005318	The Brotherhood? Well, this is unusual, I must say. But very welcome.
0DI0005319	There's certainly a lot we could learn from your technological expertise.
0DI0005320	Doctor Schiller usually handles placement, and he won't be back until tomorrow. If you could come back then, we can see about your assignment.
0DI0005321	That's it! We got it! The virus has been purged!
0DI0005322	Great! When you find it, just turn it into Torres and I'll be in the clear.
0DI0005323	Oh, I sort of altered the records after we got back. That was Watkins' idea, too. That girl is nothing but trouble.
0DI0005324	Still, I haven't been exiled yet, or worse, assigned to latrine-cleaning duty. But I will, if you don't help me find that gun.
0DI0005325	Oh man, I am so screwed! Look, if you change your mind, I'd really appreciate it.
0DI0005326	No, no idea. Sorry.
0DI0005327	Okay, see you around.
0DI0005328	Hey, no pressure. I'm just grateful you're willing to help me out.
0DI0005329	I'm pretty sure I dropped in when we made our escape. We had been surrounded and had climbed up on this big rock to hold them off.
0DI0005330	Oh, and I remember seeing a corpse near the rock, too. We never got a chance to check it out since we were too busy fighting for our lives.
0DI0005331	Guess we had better luck than whoever that was, huh?
0DI0005333	No, weapon check-in protocol includes verifying the serial number of the weapon, so a different gun would be noticed.
0DI0005334	Plus, having a new gun suddenly show up would immediately point to you, being the only outsider around here and all.
0DI0005335	No, the only way I have out of this is if you help me find that gun. You'll help me, right?
0DI0005336	This is excellent news. I'll send him back to you soon.
0DI0005337	Yeah, I'm in charge of keeping this data system up and running, but accessing it is a little, ah, touch and go at the moment.
0DI0005338	One of our exploratory patrols - back when we had exploratory patrols - found a data disc in some ruins out in the waste.
0DI0005339	Well, we finally got around to cataloging the damn thing and got shut out of our own datastore the second it loaded. Turns out it had a virus on it.
0DI0005340	Oh, there are patrols. Just not exploratory ones. We've been in a state of lockdown for... well, let's just say it's been a while.
0DI0005341	The only time anyone gets to go topside is guard duty. Or to gather provisions. Other than that, it's steel walls and fluorescent lights for us.
0DI0005342	Nah, it's not so bad. The world outside isn't exactly a paradise, you know? Still, you can only breathe recirculated air for so long.
0DI0005343	We've got more than a few people in here who are going a little stir crazy.
0DI0005344	Yeah, some Pre-War jackass with too much time on his hands apparently decided to inflict his misery on those around him.
0DI0005345	It's scrambling all the terminals here at the moment. Luckily, we only use this section for storing historical data.
0DI0005346	I suppose it couldn't hurt to get another pair of eyes on this. Maybe you'll be able to come up with something coming at it fresh.
0DI0005347	While the entire system is infected, the virus itself is spread across three terminals. The problem is that it keeps moving periodically.
0DI0005348	We'll have it nailed down in a terminal or two, only to have it jump to another set of terminals before we locate the third.
0DI0005349	You'll need to locate it on three different terminals in this area in one minute. Any longer and it'll jump, and you'll have to start all over.
0DI0005350	Locating the virus would probably be nearly impossible, but the pompous little bastard that wrote it made things a little easier for us.
0DI0005351	Normally, terminals infected by the virus just display gibberish, but we found that terminals the virus moved to had some real data passed to them.
0DI0005352	We were able to decrypt the data and discovered that it was just messages from the virus's writer, taunting his victims.
0DI0005353	When you find terminals with those messages, lock them down and move on. Find three of them before the virus jumps, and we'll wipe the damn thing.
0DI0005354	That's... not really for me to say. It's a bit of a touchy subject. You should probably forget I mentioned it.
0DI0005355	Please, don't let me stop you. I know what it's like to have a lot on your mind.
0DI0005356	You and me both. The Elder wants this data store operational pronto, but it doesn't look like the damn thing will be working anytime soon.
0DI0005357	I could use some assistance, sure, but I highly doubt you have the technical background to help us deal with this virus.
0DI0005358	Best of luck to you. I'll tell the others to take a break so they don't get in your way. Oh, and I'll keep track of when it jumps for you.
0DI0005359	To maximize your chances, wait for my signal before you begin.
0DI0005360	We'll get it eventually, but it's frustrating that it's taking so long.
0DI0005361	[SUCCEEDED] What? No, that... that's brilliant! It would let us seal a portion of the virus to a particular terminal, even when the other parts move.
0DI0005362	[FAILED] Along with all of the crucial data contained within. That'd be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
0DI0005363	I'm almost out of ideas, so you'd be more than welcome to.
0DI0005364	Watch your six out there.
0DI0005366	Is that right? The million dollar question is who exactly are we "settling?"
0DI0005367	You can thank the NCR for that one. Wait - this isn't on behalf of the NCR, is it?
0DI0005368	You're doing a fine job of convincing me to go along with this. Really. I'll ask again - why us?
0DI0005370	I think that'd be best. There's a Followers outpost up near one of my old scavenging grounds. Used to do some trading with a doctor there.
0DI0005371	If I work out of there, I'll still be able to keep tabs on Hidden Valley if I needed to. I know that route like the back of my hand.
0DI0005372	If it's all right, I'd like to head that way. Meet some people, see if I can be of any use.
0DI0005373	Yeah. I think if I stayed I'd end up causing trouble. Sometimes I just can't help myself.
0DI0005374	This way is better for me and for them.
0DI0005375	Well, crops aren't doing so well. I'm thinking it might be something in the water.
0DI0005376	The pump station is pretty run down, you could go take a look around the place, see if you find anything strange going on. What do you say?
0DI0005378	Thanks, that's great!
0DI0005379	I should get back to work now, see you around.
0DI0005380	Ten seconds!
0DI0005381	Thirty seconds left!
0DI0005382	The virus just jumped! Find which terminals it went to!
0DI0005383	All right. I'll monitor when it jumps. When I give the signal, start checking terminals.
0DI0005384	We'll continue our own efforts in the meantime.
0DI0005385	Damn, it's jumped! I thought we might have had it that time.
0DI0005386	Yeah, but only if you've got bodies to fill the suits. We don't take on new members. We're all descendents from the original Brotherhood.
0DI0005387	Something's going to have to change, or the empty suits are gonna be all that's left of us.
0DI0005388	I think you're right. We're getting desperate. Hardly enough people to sustain ourselves as a chapter. They'll see the light, sooner or later.
0DI0005389	But I get the feeling if I don't take matters into my own hands, the change won't come in time to make a difference.
0DI0005390	Wow, you sound like Elder McNamara. I know I should. Hell, it's what I signed up for when I chose to stay into adulthood.
0DI0005391	I know there's something worth saving in there. But we're in decline. Our membership is... decimated. There's got to be something we can do.
0DI0005392	I know the odds aren't good, but I've gotta try. I can't lose them.
0DI0005393	I don't know. I'm still thinking about what kind of role we could take on that would give us the best chance of survival.
0DI0005394	But I think things are starting to come together.
0DI0005395	Sure, but how long before the NCR or Caesar's Legion track us down and take it by force anyway?
0DI0005396	But if we recruited Knights from outside the group, maybe we could actually defend it.
0DI0005397	Yeah. I've got the rest of my life to help them out. I can spare a little while to see things through with you.
0DI0005398	Sure. I want to establish a connection with the Followers first, but as far as I know, drifting is part of the job description.
0DI0005399	No, I think it is. I have to be resolved about this. If I waver, it'll just make things harder.
0DI0005400	They need me and I'm not going to abandon them.
0DI0005401	I think so. Two things the Brotherhood has a lot of - hardheads and lasers. Wouldn't be the first time a disagreement ended like this.
0DI0005402	Plus... we killed all the witnesses.
0DI0005403	No, wait... please. Mr. House has access to technology that could help save a lot of lives, lives of people who suffer a great deal.
0DI0005404	Unlike Mr. House, refugees in New Vegas don't have the luxury of constant medical care. Some of them don't even have regular access to clean water.
0DI0005405	I guess we can thank NCR for that. Anyway, just a bit of information about Mr. House's technology could go a long way.
0DI0005406	We were connected for half a minute and received enough data to fill five holodiscs. It looked like nonsense at first, but we decoded it.
0DI0005407	It was all biometric data, life signs from Mr. House. The technology he's using is so advanced that it samples data hundreds of times per second.
0DI0005408	It's fascinating, but depressing. Whatever technology he has can't possibly be practical for the people out here.
0DI0005409	About five years now. I have family back in Arroyo, but this is where all of the good work is being done, so to speak.
0DI0005410	NCR taxes and inflation have been hard for a lot of people to deal with, and most of the money is going to the war effort.
0DI0005411	There's not much funding for medical research with OSI or any other group - not unless it has a military application, anyway.
0DI0005412	I'm interested in medicine, but it's not my strong suit. I try to help out with any computer issues the Followers have.
0DI0005413	That's why I was helping out with the research into Mr. House's technology. Trying to, anyway.
0DI0005414	After two tries, I think I've learned enough. I'm sure there's something more promising I could be helping the other Followers with.
0DI0005415	Uh... oh yeah, I didn't tell you about the first time. I'd rather not talk about it, if you don't mind.
0DI0005416	I already told you, I don't want to talk about it.
0DI0005417	Greetings, General Oliver. The disappointment you are about to experience delights me.
0DI0005418	Greetings, General.
0DI0005419	Hello, General.
0DI0005420	General, we like your hat.
0DI0005421	General, you look well. Perhaps for not much longer.
0DI0005422	Point guns at us, and we will destroy you.
0DI0005423	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. I will release you presently.
0DI0005424	Please do not struggle, General Oliver, you might hurt yourself. You can relax presently.
0DI0005425	Hold up there, that looks like Enclave tech. Take that over to Knight Lorenzo if you get a moment, he may be able to get some information out of it.
0DI0005426	Really? What kind of logs? What kind of data does he have on it?
0DI0005427	Great, I'd love to take a look at that log data.
0DI0005428	Did... did you say Poseidon Energy? I've been researching some Poseidon projects here.
0DI0005429	Do you think you could leave your robot with me for a few days? I have some materials that I can use to upgrade his armor while he's here.
0DI0005430	Oh, well if you change your mind let me know. I have some parts here I can use to upgrade his armor if you leave it with me for a bit.
0DI0005431	Yes, I know. It was detected immediately and deactivated... let's see... 39.735 seconds after you planted it.
0DI0005432	You thought I wouldn't notice?
0DI0005433	One of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I'm sure. They're curious about me.
0DI0005434	Good luck planting a surveillance device here in the Lucky 38 without my knowing about it.
0DI0005435	Run! Beasts got free!
0DI0005436	Deathclaws are loose! Get out of here!
0DI0005437	It can't be! How the hell...
0DI0005438	Holy shit! Run for your lives!
0DI0005439	You've cleaned that vermin's nest? Gotta say, we don't see that kind of attitude around here. Good work!
0DI0005441	That's unfortunate, but it's not like we're losing any existing business over it. Thanks for looking.
0DI0005448	[SUCCEEDED] Oh all right. You did the legwork, so I suppose you deserve a tip. Here.
0DI0005449	[FAILED] Here's a tip, kid. If you want to get paid, get the job done to completion.
0DI0005450	Yep, thanks for the help.
0DI0005451	Well, the Van Graffs for one. We had a slight difference of opinion when they first showed up.
0DI0005452	Changed our minds pretty quick after a brief demonstration of how much firepower they're packing.
0DI0005453	We could probably take them, but we'd lose a lotta guys doing it.
0DI0005454	People can do whatever they want, they just have to keep in mind what'll happen afterward.
0DI0005455	I guess you could say we don't have law so much as consequences.
0DI0005456	Aside from this place, there's the Atomic Wrangler just up the street. Women, gambling, booze, you name it, they got you covered.
0DI0005457	If you're more of a prude, the Followers run a mission out of the Old Mormon Fort up toward the north gate. Great place if you're hurt, I guess.
0DI0005458	If you like things dangerous, just past the Wrangler is the Silver Rush, where the Van Graff family peddles their weapons.
0DI0005459	Their stuff is outrageously priced, but if you want to shoot something hi-tech, they're the best game in town.
0DI0005460	Look, I already told you that was bullshit. Probably just an excuse those lying soldier scum made up to not share their grub with us.
0DI0005461	So don't ask me about it again, you hear me?
0DI0005462	Wonderful. Then let's begin making a whole new you!
0DI0005463	You wound me! You simply must let me have a go at that hair sometime! Anything you can imagine, I can style!
0DI0005464	We've tried to pass our philosophy on to the people of Freeside, but not everyone is ready to be a King.
0DI0005465	The kids love us, but the old-timers tend to shy away and keep to themselves. They probably couldn't pull off the look, anyway.
0DI0005466	As for the others, some people just plain don't respect others, and that's a no-no. If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's lack of respect.
0DI0005467	Pace? He and I grew up together around here. We've been through a lot together, and there's no man I'd rather have at my side in a pinch.
0DI0005468	Don't judge him too harshly for trying to get some caps out of you. He probably took you for a squatter, looking for a place to settle down.
0DI0005469	There've been a lot of people moving into the area lately, and it's got some people riled. Can't blame 'em myself. There's only so much to go around.
0DI0005470	There's me, but I don't really like talking about myself. There's Julie Farkas and the other Followers down at the ol' Mormon Fort.
0DI0005471	The Garret Twins up at the Wrangler deserve mention. Wouldn't be right not mentioning the Van Graffs, I suppose.
0DI0005472	And while they're not important in the overall scheme of things, there's Mick and Ralph, too. Just don't tell them I said that.
0DI0005473	Who all did you want to know about?
0DI0005474	Julie represents the Followers of the Apocalypse. They're a group that tries to help people out whenever they can, so we get along just fine.
0DI0005475	If you ever need to get patched up, one of their docs'll have you right as rain in no time flat. They sell supplies, too. Or used to.
0DI0005476	Heard they were having trouble bringing stuff in, or keeping up with the demand, or something, lately.
0DI0005477	Did you want to know about anyone else?
0DI0005478	Them twins run the Atomic Wrangler, the only working casino here in Freeside. It's become pretty much the place to go around these parts.
0DI0005479	Give it a whirl when you've got some time.  Now, was there anyone else you wanted to know about?
0DI0005480	They're a family-run business from out west that deal in weapons mostly. A word of caution, though. They're not a friendly bunch. Not at all.
0DI0005481	Their store is just past the Wrangler, and sells all kinds of fancy weapons that most people around here can't afford.
0DI0005482	Anyone else you wanted to know about?
0DI0005483	Mick and Ralph sell all sorts of things at a small store over by the east gate. They've done all right by us, and they'll do all right by you.
0DI0005484	You want to know about anyone else?
0DI0005485	Well, at least I can talk to you unlike that bastard Caesar and that plate-faced general. It'll do.
0DI0005486	Guess sometimes you get the bull, other times you get the horns. Still, at least some lives got saved this day.
0DI0005487	I'm not going to throw away the lives of my men just to make a point. And there'll be other days.
0DI0005488	Lot of PreWar factories and tech lying around the Mojave, our engineers'll get it running again, no matter how much damage you've done down there.
0DI0005489	Right now, they're all that's standing here - well, except for the corpses. So that's your plan, hold the Dam here all by your lonesome?
0DI0005490	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... but I wasn't expecting a fight when I came up here. And now that we're talking, I don't like the sound of things.
0DI0005491	[FAILED] That so, well, if all you brought is words, then this is going to be one short conversation.
0DI0005492	Even if we're running at one percent for a year, it's still worth holding this place.
0DI0005493	[SUCCEEDED] Of all the goddamn luck...
0DI0005494	[FAILED] Oh, "last you looked," huh? Yeah, we'll take another look... after you haul ass outta here.
0DI0005495	[SUCCEEDED] Fucking PreWar RobCo pieces of shit...
0DI0005496	[FAILED] Yeah, now where would we find an experienced computer specialist in the NCR? We'll find one, don't you worry.
0DI0005497	[SUCCEEDED] No... I can tell it'd just be a wasted trip.
0DI0005498	[FAILED] Considering how long we've been here, we know it well. We've patched this place up plenty - we'll get it running again.
0DI0005499	They wouldn't.
0DI0005500	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, you're here in the Legate's camp first, I think that says enough.
0DI0005501	[FAILED] And maybe you fed him a line of Brahmin shit, too, enough to make his dumb ass think twice... I ain't Legion, and I need more than words.
0DI0005502	The Brotherhood? On the attack? I think we would have heard something from them by now.
0DI0005503	[SUCCEEDED] This has been a fuck of a day.
0DI0005504	[FAILED] No, I think they blew their load here today with their fireworks... they'll prefer targets closer to home.
0DI0005505	I think you're cashed out enough that my chances are pretty good. And like I said, I'm not leaving the Dam now the Legion's been broken.
0DI0005506	[SUCCEEDED] Godammit.
0DI0005507	[FAILED] If that's the best you can muster, then it's you who should be backing up slow, and your buddies with you.
0DI0005508	And we're glad to have you - and whether you're a soldier of the Republic or not, you're it in my eyes.
0DI0005509	Sometimes the Republic gets lost along the way while it's trying to follow its instincts... but when soldiers like you come along...
0DI0005510	It helps get them back on track, and does it by example. And what you've done here today, that's going to keep us going for a while.
0DI0005511	[SUCCEEDED] The Brotherhood? Last thing we fucking need now.
0DI0005512	[FAILED] Yeah, and we'll kick their ass again like we did at HELIOS One - tell them to come, we got a whole mess of armor-piercing rounds.
0DI0005513	Least we could do. And seeing those shits of Caesar kicking dirt as they ran - did my heart good, let me tell you.
0DI0005514	Might see some recruitment numbers rise, build some morale out in the Mojave long enough for NCR to find its feet again.
0DI0005515	All due to you - again, you have my thanks. And all the West, too, once they pass it over the radio... after signing the right release forms.
0DI0005516	[SUCCEEDED] First the Legion, then the Brotherhood hitting us is about the last thing the Republic needs right now.
0DI0005519	[FAILED] You go on and do that. Me? I think they shot their last wad today... from now on, they'll prefer targets closer to home.
0DI0005520	Look. The NCR isn't everyone here, and it definitely ain't you.
0DI0005521	It's filled with people that take action and don't wait for someone to say what's right and what's wrong and make sure the proper form's filled out.
0DI0005522	When there's an example of that kind of success... that can shake things up enough so the good that came with the intention shines through.
0DI0005523	Figured as much. Come on, you sons of bitches, we're ready.
0DI0005525	[SUCCEEDED] True, guess I'm a little too used to seeing Securitrons in Vegas to think they'd turn and be bad news - and I know how bad they can get.
0DI0005526	[FAILED] If that's your idea of diplomacy, then things are looking miles better on my side of the fence.
0DI0005527	Looking to make a deal, then? All right... let's hear it.
0DI0005528	You sure got its heart beating in new ways... but that just makes me want all of it, not handouts.
0DI0005529	[SUCCEEDED] If you're buying our ear for the moment, Hoover Dam's more than a fistful of caps to my superiors. Vegas is interesting... the East...
0DI0005530	That'll take too long to build up to generate capital - 'course, since you'd have to guard it during that time... don't know, could go either way.
0DI0005531	[FAILED] What, loot we'd get anyway once we kicked your ass and more? No, I don't think so.
0DI0005532	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Willing to tackle the caravan families? Keeping that bunch in line... well, that's no easy job.
0DI0005533	In fact, that's such a shitty job, those caravan families will be the one bottlecapping you to death inch by inch - and that sounds good to me.
0DI0005534	Be a nice turnabout from your friend, House, and all the bottlecapping he's been doing to NCR for years. Sounds sweet to me.
0DI0005535	[FAILED] With your wheeled buddies as merchants? No, the East is going to be a hard nut to crack, and I don't think you know what you're in for.
0DI0005536	[SUCCEEDED] So you're saying without you, Hoover Dam just beats slower and dies. I believe it, I saw it myself this day, you woke it up, true enough.
0DI0005537	Still, even power from the Dam - that's not enough to wash the salt out of the wound here, and it only benefits NCR in the Mojave, not the West.
0DI0005538	[FAILED] Well, that kind of fence-sitting is exactly what makes me think we can make use of the... improvements here. Without you.
0DI0005539	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm. Well... Vegas burns brighter than most cities West of the Divide, and that glitter has its appeal.
0DI0005540	Not sure that's going to mend fences with the folks back West, though. But...
0DI0005541	[FAILED] No, you tricked us once, and taking more gifts from you deeper into NCR's just asking for trouble by my book.
0DI0005542	No, no, no... you've given me enough ammo for the Republic... but what one head may like, the other bear head may not.
0DI0005543	Still, I'm not about to add blood to the mix since you could've done us like the Legion now if you wanted.
0DI0005544	We clean up, take prisoners, watch the East for any more trouble from the Legion... though I think they're still running, according to our scouts.
0DI0005545	After that, we'll see what happens when the dust settles and how the Mojave looks now without Caesar coming for its throat.
0DI0005546	Something tells me we better enjoy this breather while we can... and if that means Vegas, then you and the troops have earned it.
0DI0005547	Course not. You earned it - rest up, let us carry things for a while.
0DI0005548	Kind of curious how this is going to pan out in the long run... but I'll guess history'll tell us in its own sweet time.
0DI0005549	Can't keep the courier spirit down, eh? Fair enough. We'll clean up here.
0DI0005550	You know, I've had thousands of employees in my time. Few met my expectations, fewer still surpassed them.
0DI0005551	Your performance has been nothing short of spectacular. If I have need for a "specialist" of your stripe again, I'll know just where to turn.
0DI0005552	Back to Vegas, shall we? I really should do something about that monorail - with all the new resources at hand...
0DI0005553	I can make sure it not only runs, but runs on time. Always bothered me, the imprecision.
0DI0005554	No need to worry about the General, by the way. He'll be held responsible, publicly disgraced... 36.5% probability of suicide, by my estimate...
0DI0005555	Kimball won't be able to save him - he'll be too busy getting thrown out of office. But less than a 3% chance of suicide, mind you.
0DI0005556	No need to worry about the General's "accident," by the way. A mercy, really, sparing him the disgrace of surviving his nation's defeat...
0DI0005557	President Kimball may long to avenge his friend's death, but he won't be President long enough to do anything about it.
0DI0005558	The General's "accident" was unfortunate... with Kimball dead, the angry Californian public could've used an alternate scapegoat to pillory...
0DI0005559	General Oliver will try to make good on his threats, and he'll find support among citizens outraged by Kimball's assassination...
0DI0005560	The odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion, however, are slight. My Securitrons could beat them, anyway.
0DI0005561	Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a few months, half a year - but soon enough the tourists - and their money - will be pouring in.
0DI0005562	In any case, Vegas might see a dip in revenue for a year or two, but eventually the tourists will come flooding back, and their money with them.
0DI0005563	Vegas will be a shining jewel in the middle of the desert, an oasis of light, a beacon to show mankind the way to the stars.
0DI0005564	This is just the start, you see. This is where it all begins.
0DI0005565	Actually, I've got a better idea. Make the new hire tell her. You'll do that for me, won't you?
0DI0005566	Hey, I've seen you before around our place. You've really fallen on hard times if you're working for these clowns.
0DI0005567	Hey, you're the one who helped us out with those NCR chumps. You really get around, don't you?
0DI0005568	Hey, Simon. How's it hanging? Looks like you've got a little helper today.
0DI0005569	What can I say? Business has been good lately. We can afford the help.
0DI0005570	Good to hear, buddy. So is the boss lady in?
0DI0005571	You know she is. Why don't you go in and say hi?
0DI0005572	Nah, I've got some rounds to run. But do pass along that I'm always thinking of her.
0DI0005573	See? Told you so.
0DI0005574	Now what in the hell do you suppose that was about?
0DI0005575	Looks like that guy's headed this way. Don't screw it up.
0DI0005576	Help me clean this up. No one's going to want to shop here with a corpse out front.
0DI0005577	You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
0DI0005578	Stop him!
0DI0005579	I could use some help out here!
0DI0005580	Heads up. Looks like we've got another customer.
0DI0005581	He's clean.
0DI0005582	You just going to let everyone in without checking them? Bad move, rookie. That's going in my report.
0DI0005583	You keep losing us business like that, and you can forget about being paid.
0DI0005584	You don't listen too well, do you? We're supposed to pat everyone down. That's going in my report.
0DI0005585	Wow, you're a real people person, aren't you?
0DI0005586	Another one coming. You're on.
0DI0005587	You know, guarding the door's not that complicated. Maybe you'd be better off in another line of work.
0DI0005588	It's almost like I never said anything at all.
0DI0005590	See? Not so hard is it?
0DI0005591	Crap. This I do not need today. Keep your head straight, rookie. Things are about to get interesting.
0DI0005592	Come on, help me clean this up.
0DI0005593	Oh man, Gloria's going to be pissed when she hears about this. Still, he started it, so we probably won't go to war with the Kings.
0DI0005594	Way to keep your head, rookie. There's hope for you yet.
0DI0005595	What the hell are you doing?
0DI0005596	We're supposed to pat everyone down. Didn't you hear that part of my instructions?
0DI0005597	Were you even listening when I said what you're supposed to do?
0DI0005599	You're doing it on purpose, aren't you?
0DI0005600	What did I tell you about trying to make off with that gear?
0DI0005601	I'm afraid I'm going to have to search you before letting you in. The only weapons allowed on the premises are the ones we're selling.
0DI0005602	There, I've stowed all of your weapons. You're clear to enter. When you leave, I'll hand them all back to you.
0DI0005603	Ah, General Oliver. I expected you would survive.
0DI0005604	I see you've met my star employee. A real performer, obviously - and a lot more reliable than the other candidate I considered for the position.
0DI0005605	I'd pay very close attention to what she has to say, as well as any official papers she hands over for your perusal.
0DI0005606	I'd pay very close attention to what he has to say, as well as any official papers he hands over for your perusal.
0DI0005607	Let's get on with it, shall we? Hmm?
0DI0005608	Ah, the "rulers" of Freeside. The Kings are a bunch of boys who refuse to grow up, and this is their playground.
0DI0005609	Their leader seems different, though. The few times I've dealt with him I've been impressed despite myself.
0DI0005610	Unfortunately, he rarely acts. The Kings believe that everyone in Freeside can do whatever they want, provided they can back it up with force.
0DI0005611	Which suits us just fine. When we first arrived in Freeside, the Kings protested when we kicked out the original occupant of this establishment.
0DI0005612	When we reduced several of their members to glowing puddles of goo, their objections vanished. Since then, we've left each other alone.
0DI0005613	I don't really have much to do with them. They seem to have an aversion to weapons technology, and those who possess a great deal of it.
0DI0005614	Their loss, really.
0DI0005615	Well, you probably noticed the Atomic Wrangler across the street. That's pretty much the place to go around here.
0DI0005616	They make it a little loud around here at night, but the business their proximity brings more than makes up for it.
0DI0005617	Other than them, you're better off skipping Freeside entirely and just heading to the Strip.
0DI0005618	Suits me. What did you have in mind?
0DI0005619	It's just a rumor. Even so, I trust you will refrain from bringing up this subject again.
0DI0005620	You must not know a lot about my family or you wouldn't have asked that. The Van Graffs and the NCR have been enemies for decades.
0DI0005621	They've tried to block our expansion for years, but we've managed to grow regardless. The problem is they have, too.
0DI0005622	The NCR is huge, now. We're talking on a scale that's difficult to imagine. Time was, we could fight them and hold our own. Not so anymore.
0DI0005623	My family has enough men and guns to field a small army, but the NCR can field a really, really big army. Fighting them is out of the question now.
0DI0005624	I've only heard rumors, since this is the furthest east our operations go. But the rumors are pretty scary.
0DI0005625	They're said to be a huge slaver nation, with all the soldiers obeying their lord with unquestioning obedience.
0DI0005626	Sounds like a man I'd like to meet.
0DI0005627	Very little, same as everyone else. We attempted to deal with him when we first moved into the area, but had no luck.
0DI0005628	He must have his own weapons supplies to keep as many laser-armed robots operational as he does. Makes me wonder where they are...
0DI0005629	They're our chief competitors in this region, and many others. That makes them our enemies.
0DI0005630	While I respect their business acumen, I'm obligated to try to destroy them however I can. That's business, after all.
0DI0005631	That's a good dog. Well, I'm out of here. Later, Simon.
0DI0005632	I would, but I tend to distract the boss lady a little too much. She can't help herself.
0DI0005633	Anyway, I've got things to do. Later, Simon.
0DI0005634	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call him off, or he'll get put down.
0DI0005635	Ouch, this one's got a bite, Simon! Call her off, or she'll get put down.
0DI0005636	Let's take this chump, guys!
0DI0005637	I'm sure it's the highlight of your day. Anyway, I've gotta bounce. Things to do, and all that.
0DI0005638	Who do you think you're talking to? Just because the King happens to like you, doesn't mean you can run your mouth any way you damn like.
0DI0005639	No, nothing wrong at all. By all means, carry on.
0DI0005640	You asked for it, punk!
0DI0005641	Yeah, that's what I thought.
0DI0005642	Yeah, right before I beat somebody down. Let's take this fool, boys.
0DI0005643	Ha, you've got yourself a live one here, Simon. Anyway, I've got things to do. Later.
0DI0005644	Spoken like a chump. A King doesn't have to grovel before others to get paid. Anyway, I've got better things to do than shoot the shit with you.
0DI0005645	Thanks, I've come a long way.
0DI0005646	That's not really necessary, is it? I already told you I got this here revolver, right?
0DI0005648	Damn, I knew this wasn't going to work!
0DI0005649	You gonna ask me questions all day, or are you going to let me in?
0DI0005650	Now hold on there, I'm not packing any heat. Ain't my word good enough for you?
0DI0005651	Thank you kindly.
0DI0005652	What? Why the hell not?
0DI0005653	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's all right, if there's no other choice.
0DI0005654	[FAILED] I just don't see why it's necessary. Now, are you going to let me in or not?
0DI0005655	If that's the case, then I guess I'll go spend my money elsewhere.
0DI0005656	I haven't had a drink all day! Screw this place, I'll go spend my money elsewhere!
0DI0005657	Hmph. That's better.
0DI0005658	Thanks a bunch.
0DI0005660	No... Should I be?
0DI0005661	Because I'm not! Can't you just tell? Oh, forget it. I'll just head over to that pawn shop by the east gate.
0DI0005662	This should only take a moment.
0DI0005663	Then you're not going to shop here.
0DI0005664	I can't believe this shit. Time to die, punk!
0DI0005665	What did I tell you about breaking the rules? You're gonna learn the hard way, now.
0DI0005666	You dared go against The Thorn, and now you'll pay for that!
0DI0005667	You've just fucked up, big time!
0DI0005668	You've broken the rules of The Thorn, you've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
0DI0005669	I admire your bravery, but coming down here after what you've done is just foolish. So be it, Legion dog!
0DI0005670	[Rhonda] We're back with Best Friend Tabitha, who was telling us why humans should STAY THE HELL AWAY, ier, keep their distance from the State of Utobitha.
0DI0005671	[Tabitha] Thank you, Rhonda. As you know, one of the many benefits of living in Utobitha is the ready availability of pet centaurs.
0DI0005672	[Rhonda] Ooh, I love the centaurs. They're just so cute!
0DI0005673	[Tabitha] Exactly, Rhonda, who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have.
0DI0005674	[Tabitha] But humans must be so caught up with their pleasant features that they forget the most important thing about centaurs.
0DI0005675	[Rhonda] And what might that be, Best Friend Tabitha?
0DI0005676	[Tabitha] Centaurs eat humans, Rhonda! You see, humans are a lot smaller, and much more tender than you or I, so centaurs naturally see them as food.
0DI0005677	[Rhonda] Ah, that *would* make it hard for them to get along, wouldn't it?
0DI0005678	[Tabitha] Indeed. Given the situation, I had to make a hard choice when I created Utobitha - do we invite weak, greedy humans who would just die anyway?
0DI0005679	[Tabitha] Or cute, loveable centaurs, who fight and die for us and ask nothing in return? After much deliberation, I went with the centaurs.
0DI0005680	[Rhonda] And there you have it, Utobitha. The next time you play with a huggable, loveable centaur, remember that Best Friend Tabitha made it all possible.
0DI0005681	[Rhonda] We're here once again with our beloved leader. Best Friend Tabitha, why don't you tell our listeners what you just told me?
0DI0005682	[Tabitha] I was just saying that I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about the mutants here in the State of Utobitha.
0DI0005683	[Rhonda] And what would *that* be?
0DI0005684	[Tabitha] I believe that the mutants here are generally considered to dislike humans. And nothing could be further from the truth.
0DI0005685	[Tabitha] During their stay here, mutants are taught to tolerate, and even accept, the existence of inferior, frail creatures, humans included.
0DI0005686	[Rhonda] Ooh, how insightful! So then how do you think this misunderstanding came about?
0DI0005687	[Tabitha] My guess is that it has something to do with the fact that every mutant in the State of Utobitha  has been give explicit orders regarding security.
0DI0005688	[Tabitha] Those orders naturally include shooting humans on sight. Or pounding them with whatever happens to be handy. Guns being in short supply, you see.
0DI0005689	[Tabitha] As I've explained, there are numerous dangers to humans here, and we have a duty to drive them away. It's for their own good, really.
0DI0005690	[Rhonda] Makes sense to me! And the silly humans think we don't care. For shame. Stick around, Utobitha, for more after this!
0DI0005691	[Tabitha] Do you remember the good old days where the Master ruled over us all?
0DI0005692	[Rhonda] When his gentle, compelling, and yet oddly insistent voice crawled through your mind and told you exactly what to do?
0DI0005693	[Tabitha] Do you miss a time when you didn't have to think for yourself, and enjoyed lazy days of following the bellowed commands of others?
0DI0005694	[Rhonda] Those days can be yours again, for Best Friend Tabitha, the esteemed leader of the State of Utobitha, is here to tell you what to do!
0DI0005695	[Tabitha] That's right! I, Tabitha, will take on the burden of your obedience!
0DI0005696	[Rhonda]  Acceptance into Utobitha pending Best Friend Tabitha's approval.
0DI0005697	[Rhonda] Best Friend Tabitha reserves the right to turn down applicants for any reason, including whimsy or boredom.
0DI0005698	[Rhonda]  Acceptance into Utobitha open to mutants only. Former human servants of the Master conditionally accepted for purposes of centaur feeding duties.
0DI0005699	[Tabitha] Utobitha! Come, take a load off your mind!
0DI0005700	[Rhonda] Welcome to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
0DI0005701	[Rhonda] Special guest star Best Friend Tabitha is with us in the studio to share her insights on this topic that affects us all.
0DI0005702	[Tabitha] Thank you, Rhonda. Today I'd like to talk about a subject near and dear to my heart, the nightkin.
0DI0005703	[Rhonda] Ooooh, you must know a lot about the nightkin, Best Friend Tabitha, seeing as how you are one!
0DI0005704	[Tabitha] That's true, Rhonda. I am in a unique position to speak to the natural superiority of my kind.
0DI0005705	[Tabitha] Our story begins, as most stories do, with the Master. Our glorious leader had created the Super Mutants, but something nagged at him.
0DI0005706	[Tabitha] "I can do better", he must have said to himself. And boy did he ever!
0DI0005707	[Tabitha] A new type of mutant was created - stronger, faster, smarter, more dangerous in every way.
0DI0005708	[Tabitha] We were to normal super mutants what they were to humans, and they were told to defer to us in all things.
0DI0005709	[Rhonda] And you're the leader of all the nightkin, correct?
0DI0005710	[Tabitha] Yes, as the highest ranking nightkin alive, my voice speaks for all nightkin everywhere, ever.
0DI0005711	[Rhonda] Which is why all super mutants should do what you say, right?
0DI0005712	[Tabitha] That's right! My position of supreme authority must never be questioned!
0DI0005713	[Rhonda] One last thing. Is there any truth to the rumor that all Nightkin are slightly crazy from their overuse of psychologically damaging pre-war tech?
0DI0005714	[Tabitha] None at all, Rhonda.
0DI0005715	[Rhonda] There you have it, Utobitha! Nightkin, your benevolent overlords, who are most certainly *not* crazy. We'll be back after this!
0DI0005716	[Rhonda] Welcome, Utobitha, to another episode of Know - Your - Mutants!
0DI0005717	[Rhonda] Today we're proud to have Best Friend Tabitha with us. Welcome to the show!
0DI0005718	[Tabitha] Good to be here, Rhonda.
0DI0005719	[Rhonda] So what type of mutant did you want to talk about this time, Best Friend Tabitha?
0DI0005720	[Tabitha] I thought I'd briefly talk about first generation Super Mutants, Rhonda.
0DI0005721	[Rhonda] Oooh, what can you tell us about them?
0DI0005722	[Tabitha] What we call the first generation of Super Mutants, Rhonda, were actually created by the Master himself.
0DI0005723	[Tabitha] Like everything the Master took a direct hand in, they were better than the ones who came later, the ones made by accident.
0DI0005724	[Tabitha] They were smarter, almost as smart as Nightkin, and were able to think and act for themselves.
0DI0005725	[Tabitha] However, the first generation seems to have some kind of suicidal urge that they can't control.
0DI0005726	[Rhonda] How terrible! What makes you say that, Best Friend Tabitha?
0DI0005727	[Tabitha] So far, all first generation Super Mutants that have come to Utobitha have left not soon after.
0DI0005728	[Rhonda] How strange! Why would anyone leave the safety and comfort that Utobitha provides?
0DI0005729	[Tabitha] Why, indeed. But now there's not a single first generation Super Mutant in Utobitha.
0DI0005730	[Rhonda] Except Neil.
0DI0005731	[Tabitha] Except Neil.
0DI0005732	[Rhonda] Well! I think we've all learned something today. Let's go to music!
0DI0005733	[Rhonda] You're listening to another edition of Know - Your - Mutants, with Best Friend Tabitha!
0DI0005734	[Rhonda] So, Best Friend Tabitha, who will we learn about today?
0DI0005735	[Tabitha]  I guess it's time we talked the dumb-dumbs.
0DI0005736	[Rhonda] Oh, you mean the second generation Super Mutants who aren't so bright?
0DI0005737	[Tabitha]  That's them. Dumb-dumbs... ah... that is... they...
0DI0005738	[Rhonda]  They're very big. And strong.
0DI0005739	[Tabitha]  Yes! They're just as big as other mutants, and as strong as they look. Beyond that, uh...
0DI0005740	[Rhonda]  And there's a lot of them.
0DI0005741	[Tabitha] Oh yeah, dumb-dumbs are the most common type of mutant that most travelers will encounter, and make up more than half the mutants here in Utobitha.
0DI0005742	[Rhonda] Best Friend Tabitha, some of our listeners may wonder how you can call them dumb-dumbs on the air like this.
0DI0005743	[Tabitha] That's a good question, Rhonda. The truth is, they're so dumb they don't even know that I'm talking about them right now.
0DI0005744	[Rhonda] And that's another revealing look at mutantkind. Second generation Super Mutants. Big. Numerous. Dumb. More after this!
0DI0005745	[Rhonda]  What do you think we should play next?
0DI0005746	[Tabitha]  It doesn't matter, just grab something. And check on Raul while you're at it.
0DI0005747	[Sounds of movement and something brushing against the mike, then a click as the feed gets switched to the mike in Raul's room]
0DI0005748	[Raul singing in Spanish to himself for an extended time]
0DI0005749	[Tabitha]  Raul! Why are you on the radio?
0DI0005750	[Raul] Uh, I don't know. Did you hit that switch I, ah, keep telling you not to press?
0DI0005751	[Click as feed switches back to Tabitha's room, some fumbling done near mike]
0DI0005752	[Rhonda] Sorry about that, Utobitha! Here's some music!
0DI0005753	[Rhonda] Utobitha, I'm here with Best Friend Tabitha, who has a message for all the dumb-dumbs out there.
0DI0005754	[Tabitha] It has come to my attention that some of you dumb-dumbs took me a little too seriously in the past when I warned you about the battle cattle.
0DI0005755	[Tabitha] While battle cattle are indeed a dangerous foe, they are one that should be fought ferociously.
0DI0005756	[Tabitha] Recently I've heard about several incidents where some of you have been seen running away from a fight where battle cattle were involved.
0DI0005757	[Tabitha] This is not acceptable. No self-respecting soldier of Utobitha should ever be seen running like a scared little human.
0DI0005758	[Tabitha] Bah, I don't even know why I try. It's not like the dumb-dumbs are even going to understand this.
0DI0005759	[Rhonda] You heard her, Utobitha! Beware the battle cattle, but don't *fear* the battle cattle. More after this!
0DI0005760	You dared come here, after what you did?
0DI0005761	What do you think you're going to do? Fight you way up to the penthouse and assassinate me?
0DI0005762	You came here to finish what you think you started?
0DI0005763	This is nothing compared to what's waiting for you up in the penthouse.
0DI0005764	Vegas will still rise again. Your betrayal won't defeat me!
0DI0005765	The Lucky 38 will be your grave. I'll finish what Benny couldn't get right!
0DI0005766	Hold on, now, hold on. Just a moment...
0DI0005767	Turn around and leave, and I'll... I won't attack you any further.
0DI0005768	Just... stay away from the console. It doesn't do anything...
0DI0005769	You've come back to kill me this time, I assume?
0DI0005770	Ironic, how this turned out. The thousands of hours I spent calculating odds, running projections, planning for every contingency...
0DI0005771	...only to be done in by a mail carrier with a grandiosity complex.
0DI0005772	Get it over with, will you?
0DI0005773	Aggressive acts on the casino premises will be met with lethal force. Vacate the premises immediately.
0DI0005774	Vacate the premises immediately. The casino is off-limits for 24 hours.
0DI0005775	Vacate the premises immediately. All Securitrons are at a state of high alert.
0DI0005776	What of it? I enjoy them. There's something about a little diorama set inside a glass dome that I... find pleasing.
0DI0005777	If you run across any out in the wastes, turn them in to Jane. She'll compensate you.
0DI0005778	By my calculations, his death will affect the shape of the battle for Hoover Dam minimally, if at all.
0DI0005779	The Legion's aggression will outlive Caesar. Indeed, they'll try to take the dam as a tribute to his memory.
0DI0005780	Given a year, they'd have him deified - but by then the Legion will be breaking down, riven by internal conflicts, a monster consuming itself.
0DI0005781	It's irrelevant. In the short term, the Legion is still monster enough that defeating it will make me look powerful indeed.
0DI0005782	Hoover Dam, of course. A hydroelectric dam?
0DI0005783	The NCR had it up and running at 50% capacity within a year of occupying the dam. By treaty, New Vegas receives 5% of its output - more than enough.
0DI0005784	I recommend following the Securitron's instructions. Its programming is... strict, and I don't have time to change it.
0DI0005785	Cannibalism was strictly forbidden in their contract. If some of them broke that stricture, they deserved whatever punishment you dealt them.
0DI0005786	No, I was not aware of this.
0DI0005787	Is it really so hard not to engage in cannibalism? My goodness...
0DI0005788	It's a violation of their contract. I authorize you to deal with them in any way you see fit.
0DI0005789	Yes, of course. But refraining from those "dietary practices" is a primary requirement of their contract.
0DI0005790	They've been good to their word. Put together one hell of a resort hotel, too.
0DI0005791	From what I hear, I'd want to eat at the Gourmand every night... if I were ambulatory.
0DI0005792	Think you're doing well to have made it this far?
0DI0005793	Your chances of breaking through my defenses, they're... minimal, at best!
0DI0005795	I would've made you wealthy! You could've helped change the world!
0DI0005796	You're actually going to do this all over again?
0DI0005797	Damn it, will you die already?
0DI0005798	If personal gain... what you sought... should've done... as asked...
0DI0005799	Fool... to let... personalities... derail future... of mankind? ...Stupid!
0DI0005800	Those snakes? ...for them? ...you sad, misguided... whore.
0DI0005801	Slavery... the future of... mankind? What... have you... done?
0DI0005802	Your... vanity project... doomed to fail...
0DI0005803	May there be... a hell... for you... a Tartarus...  bleak, unending...
0DI0005804	No! ...Don't disable... cerebral... I'd rather be... killed... just kill... me...
0DI0005805	No... ruined everything... exposed... germs... a year of... life, if... at most...
0DI0005806	The name's Old Ben. I've been living in Freeside since the day I was born.
0DI0005807	Those bots are programmed to vaporize anyone who enters the fenced-in area without authorization from the greeter.
0DI0005808	Your loss, my friend.
0DI0005809	It is a dream come true. Santiago never thought he could work in such a wonderous den of vice and iniquity.
0DI0005811	I've heard stories of that old guy. I'm amazed he's still alive with how much he's been through.
0DI0005812	If the stories are true, he'll be a valuable commodity here at the Wrangler. I appreciate the find.
0DI0005813	Looks like that gives us a full roster of new ass to sell. Good work - enjoy the bonus.
0DI0005821	The best place to start would be with Ralph at Mick & Ralph's over on the east end of Freeside. Other than that, your guess is as good as mine.
0DI0005822	I've done a bit of everything around here - courier, butcher, crier, escort, gun for hire...
0DI0005823	Some of which I'm not proud of, but I do my best to help around town when needed.
0DI0005825	I'm retired, but life has been a bit dull without some kind of action. What's the job?
0DI0005826	Exactly one of the reasons I got out of that job. Too many shifty characters looking to have someone else move their hot items.
0DI0005827	My father ran a butcher shop here in town, but business went downhill when another vendor started selling this strange meat at half of our prices.
0DI0005828	You're telling me. Not long after my father's shop went under and he passed away from the loss, people around town started experiencing shakes.
0DI0005829	No one gets shakes like that unless they're eating human flesh, but no one would believe me. The sick bastard gradually went insane and passed away.
0DI0005830	Wasn't long before someone moved into the guy's place and found half-buried human remains in the crawlspace. I didn't bother saying told ya so.
0DI0005831	After a while I made enough money to get a passport into Vegas. Back then you could get approved for entry for a fraction of what it costs now.
0DI0005832	Well, I got a job working as a crier outside of The Tops advertising for the local talent performing at the casino. That didn't last long.
0DI0005833	Well, being a suave young guy, I chatted up the ladies from time to time, and one of the managers' girls started to take a liking to me.
0DI0005834	I never touched the woman, but the jealous prick decided it was my time to go. He framed me by saying I'd stolen from the casino.
0DI0005835	Sure enough, a few grand was missing from the casino vault. I have to assume the bastard stole the funds and figured I was a convenient fall guy.
0DI0005836	Yeah, but what can you do? I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
0DI0005837	From there I didn't have a lot of career options, as my rep was destroyed. So, the escort job sort of fell into my lap, no pun intended.
0DI0005838	Yeah, shit indeed happens. I was stripped of my casino apartment and all of my belongings and booted back into Freeside.
0DI0005840	Well, I supposed you could look at it that way, but I was packing a whole different kind of heat. No, escort just sounds better than man-whore.
0DI0005841	Yep. I was damn good at my job, too. But after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
0DI0005842	Well, I didn't have any other career opportunities open to me at the time and had to make ends meet.
0DI0005843	I was good at it too, but after a while I just felt like a piece of meat and had to quit.
0DI0005844	When I quit the escort job, I had enough money to buy a pistol belt and some other gear.
0DI0005845	Bodyguards make a good honest living, and I had the wits and physical build to handle most thugs.
0DI0005846	After saving a few tourists from trouble, I got a reputation for being a stand-up guy again, and after a decade managed to save up enough to retire.
0DI0005848	Ah, I get you. So you think because of my past escort work, I'd be interested in that kind of thing?
0DI0005849	I got out of that work because it just made me feel empty inside. What makes you think I would ever go back to that degradation?
0DI0005850	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? You're right. I looked at the whole thing from the wrong angle.
0DI0005851	I suppose I could be a loving muse to some, while simply relieve stress and tension in others. Thanks for that insight.
0DI0005852	Tell Garret I'd be happy to start at the Wrangler immediately. This should be a nice change of pace from retirement.
0DI0005853	[FAILED] What do I look like? Arm candy? I don't think so, friend.
0DI0005854	I never put much thought into the well-being my clients got out of my services. I suppose they only get as much as I put into it.
0DI0005858	And... uh... well. These uh... these boys with you? Hello, there, smiley.
0DI0005859	I would sooner spit on the grave of my dead mother than let some courier-walk-the-wasteland-fuck talk to me like that.
0DI0005860	Who the hell do you think you are? Looking to cash your chips to the sound of NCR bullets, eh? I can oblige.
0DI0005861	Look, I know you're riding high right now, but let me tell you - you ain't pissing on me right now, you're pissing on the Bear.
0DI0005862	You been far enough West I'm guessing to know how far that claw stretches. Fuck with the Bear, and...
0DI0005863	You want me to make tracks out of here, head back West, tail between our legs?
0DI0005864	No, I came for a fight today, and if you're looking to make me budge, you better have a damn good left hook or I'm not going anywhere.
0DI0005865	Do you know what you're doing? Making a nation -  like you think you're doing, ain't like chowing down on a pile of Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.
0DI0005866	Think you got the guts to carve out a frontier? Build towns, protect the roads, run supplies, train troops?
0DI0005867	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by a slip of a woman. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best were making all that noise.
0DI0005868	Hell. Can't believe we got suckered by some road jockey. Should've watched the flank while Caesar's best was making all that noise.
0DI0005869	I know what those robots of yours can do on a bad day, and I'm not eager to toss lives at them just to make a point.
0DI0005870	But if you're taking this place, you better hope you can hold it. I'll give my superiors my opinion, but I don't think they're going to listen.
0DI0005871	So if NCR comes at you, and it will, pray you're ready. I promise you, our situations reversed, I'd see you hang.
0DI0005872	Fine. Come on, men, we're moving out.
0DI0005873	Vegas? What, the families? Or... House. You're talking about House.
0DI0005874	What the hell are you on about? House? He's just a rumor on the Strip, never leaves his...
0DI0005875	Gambling? What, you looking to start a game now that the smoke's died down-
0DI0005876	You know I won't surrender the Dam, and certainly not to the ghost man of Vegas and his new right-hand-of-the-week.
0DI0005877	We held this place for years, kicked one Legate out of here so hard Caesar burned him to a crisp. It's our post, we've fought for it.
0DI0005878	I'll fight for it again today. If you're looking to convince me otherwise, you better have a lot more reasons than you just telling me to go.
0DI0005879	Look, House... Vegas... it's pretty, got you blinded a bit maybe, but NCR's got perks, too. Think about it before you sign on with him.
0DI0005880	And if you say "no," keep in mind what that means. NCR may have its problems, but when we're riled, watch out.
0DI0005881	Many graves in the East are filled with those who said as much, with braver words, not backed by strength.
0DI0005882	It is Caesar's will this gate to the West bear the flag of the Legion. Caesar's will shall be done.
0DI0005883	I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater.
0DI0005884	Caesar's will is made truth through me. I am a hammer against all that defy his rule.
0DI0005885	If you seek to stand against me, you shall fall as the West falls.
0DI0005886	Caesar's will is the will of the Legion. And the West... all beneath the flag of the Great Bear exist to test the strength of the Legion.
0DI0005887	The West shall fall as the East fell, and all the tribes that stretch to the setting sun shall bear the mark of the Legion.
0DI0005888	Enough words, then. Let our strength settle this.
0DI0005889	We shall see how brave you are when nailed to the walls of Hoover Dam, your body facing West so you may watch your world die.
0DI0005890	[SUCCEEDED] You dare speak that name? Comparing him to any man of Caesar will only earn you a slow death.
0DI0005891	You think me some lesser man, some other Legate? I am the first of the Legion, and this gate to the West shall be ours this day.
0DI0005892	[FAILED] Those are your final words? They are too weak to even wash the stain of your disgrace this day.
0DI0005893	Yet if those are the words you wish to be remembered for, then I shall... *honor* them.
0DI0005894	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. You believe your own words, even if I do not.
0DI0005895	Perhaps NCR has the strength of a cornered animal... it will not be enough to hold this place.
0DI0005896	They know nothing of my tactics - or the strength of my forces. They will learn.
0DI0005897	[FAILED] Then they know nothing of me or the Legion's subjugation of the East.
0DI0005898	And to send you to deceive me... it is you that they have tricked, not I.
0DI0005899	[SUCCEEDED] We did take the towers easier than expected. I cannot believe even the Republic would overlook such an opening in their defenses.
0DI0005900	Yet we are at throat of the Great Bear. Victory is at hand.
0DI0005901	[FAILED] I am not another Legate, and I am not such a fool as Graham, to be painted in pitch and set aflame.
0DI0005902	If all NCR believes as you do, then this battle is already won.
0DI0005903	[SUCCEEDED] You play on my instincts. Yet your intention in this... you have nothing to gain by telling me of this... "trap."
0DI0005904	Unless you seek to goad me into a retreat, leaving the battlefield and leaving my honor here to be trampled underfoot by Republic cowards.
0DI0005905	Of course. And I guard myself from such acts of cowardice and jealousy.
0DI0005906	You claim that word of my coming has been given to the West so that I might die here... even as I take the Dam?
0DI0005907	Telling me this does not benefit you at all... you gamble with your words, and your coin is lacking.
0DI0005908	If what you say is true, then they shall answer for it.
0DI0005909	But you suggest I turn from battle to answer these crimes, when I can prove myself greater by meeting them - then returning with the Dam as ours.
0DI0005910	You almost convinced me otherwise... but justice comes to all in time, and it now comes to you.
0DI0005911	You speak with conviction, and more importantly, with honor. And we secured a foothold on the Dam... easily, as you have said.
0DI0005912	Graham's overconfidence forever branded him with fire, I will not follow his trail of fire into the depths of the Grand Canyon.
0DI0005913	The Republic shall keep their Old World gate this day, I shall return East. When I return, I shall have all the armies of the Legion with me.
0DI0005914	Then ask them. The battle draws near.
0DI0005915	Perhaps it is unfortunate Vulpes was not here to hear your words... something tells me you would prove more than his match.
0DI0005916	Perhaps it is fortunate Vulpes went to his death before this day... something tells me your words would have surpassed even his skills.
0DI0005917	Until the day when our armies meet again, NCR - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
0DI0005918	Until the day when our armies meet again, envoy of Vegas - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
0DI0005919	Until the day when our armies meet again, courier - I shall wait for you on the battlefield.
0DI0005920	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. I have seen little of true battle this day. And you were brave to come here to face me when all of NCR would not.
0DI0005921	I shall honor your last words and face you alone. No man will say I refused your challenge.
0DI0005922	[SUCCEEDED] The West's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone, as you request.
0DI0005923	Woman of the West... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade.
0DI0005924	[SUCCEEDED] I shall make a cape of your skin. And your skull - it shall sit by my side, mute, watching as my armies march West.
0DI0005925	I shall honor your last words... and face you alone, as you request. No man will say I refused your challenge.
0DI0005930	[FAILED] No, I shall make it a contest - whether I can kill you *before* my hounds tear you apart.
0DI0005931	[SUCCEEDED] I have no *need* to hold it - anything the West sends against me shall break against the wall that is the Legion.
0DI0005932	[FAILED] You seek to buy my conviction, like some merchant from the West.
0DI0005933	[SUCCEEDED] You think we would march without a means of resupply? We have the Fort, we will have the Dam - other communities will fall.
0DI0005934	And we shall harvest as we move West. We only need move forward.
0DI0005935	[FAILED] Your reliance on comfort... it rots you from the inside. You are in need of the teachings the Legion will bring to your people.
0DI0005936	[SUCCEEDED] There are many towns, many slaves... ripe for the taking as the tribes from the East were.
0DI0005937	[FAILED] I shall carve your promises into your skin so that you might think on them - and let that be the lesson this day.
0DI0005938	[SUCCEEDED] You rely too much on the trappings of... civilization. The people of the West were once tribes - they will relearn their ways, or...
0DI0005939	[FAILED] Enough.
0DI0005940	[SUCCEEDED] Vulpes... brought the touch of Caesar to such places.
0DI0005941	It was necessary to weaken the West, show that the Legion could strike deep into the places where NCR thought it safe.
0DI0005942	But we do not need *those* towns. Like Hoover Dam, there is the power within Vegas... we can harness it for our needs.
0DI0005943	Hnh. Long ago... when taking Denver, I had to face such a challenge. Many died, over many years to claim the city as ours.
0DI0005944	It was the lines of food and water that nearly broke the Legion's strength... and the lack of tribals near that cursed city.
0DI0005945	What I felt in that struggle, I felt as I saw the map of the West. The West is a trap. The bear has already been caught in it, and it is dying.
0DI0005946	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. My coming would have saved you, set your people free in ways they cannot see.
0DI0005947	War would have tested them. Broken the weak with its violence, yet allowing the strong to arise.
0DI0005948	Violence gave you that strength, awakened you - I can see it upon your face, where two bullets left their mark.
0DI0005949	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, woman of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
0DI0005950	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. Then when I return, man of the West... we shall see if your belief will withstand the blades of the Legion.
0DI0005951	But I shall give you the time you need to prepare.
0DI0005952	Retreat? Retreat.
0DI0005953	I was a fool to listen to you... you know nothing of who I am.
0DI0005954	[SUCCEEDED] So you seek quarter? Terms of surrender?
0DI0005955	Our roads into NCR are hung with the bodies of those who attempted to negotiate with us.
0DI0005956	Save your speeches, we will take Hoover Dam and move forward until our feet crush the setting sun beneath them.
0DI0005957	[FAILED] It is the Legion that will surprise the West, but you will not be alive to see it.
0DI0005958	[SUCCEEDED] Hoover Dam has never seen the massed strength of the East. Only Legates such as Graham... who deserved the fire Caesar blessed him with.
0DI0005959	Now I am here, and make markers of your people as the Legion carves its way West.
0DI0005961	[SUCCEEDED] You speak in circles - what of the East? I am the East, and I will prove it this day.
0DI0005963	[SUCCEEDED] The victory here shall be swift. Our forces shall take the Dam, secure it, then build a road west on the bodies of the NCR.
0DI0005964	The East will hold. Once across the Colorado, nothing to rival Hoover Dam remains.
0DI0005966	Vegas will fall.
0DI0005967	[SUCCEEDED] Your weakness? You seek to thwart me by claiming the Legion is too strong for you?
0DI0005968	[FAILED] And how battles are lost... when you bring nothing but words to a contest of strength.
0DI0005969	I count on no one.
0DI0005970	As was I... yet I was ordered to await you. Now that you are here, we may act.
0DI0005971	A plan by Vulpes... treachery is a weapon that one should never rely on.
0DI0005972	I can only hope that the Omertas died when their treachery was exposed, to have the plan succeed only would have sullied the Legion.
0DI0005973	It does not matter, victory shall be ours, it shall be swift, and it will be honest, purchased with blood.
0DI0005974	[SUCCEEDED] That does not mean we would not succeed.
0DI0005975	[SUCCEEDED] The East was a hard-fought campaign. Even now, Caesar drew too much of the Legion's blood needed there for... this.
0DI0005976	Hoover Dam is but a place. I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion - whether quickly, or as you describe, slowly... by attrition.
0DI0005977	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, woman of the West.
0DI0005978	As for wisdom... there is wisdom in your words, man of the West.
0DI0005979	Know that I shall return East. I shall not remain there forever. On that day, the strength of the bear shall be tested.
0DI0005980	If the West is one day filled with ones such as you, perhaps it shall be a worthy fight, indeed.
0DI0005981	Then until our return... True to Caesar.
0DI0005982	More like he's going to the Wrangler for another drink. You watch.
0DI0005983	Good. Stick to the rules.
0DI0005984	Hoo boy, Gloria's gonna have your ass for letting that wino in. You're not starting the day well, rookie.
0DI0005986	She's clean.
0DI0005987	Well, some of Mr. House's projections predict a "moderate probability of civil instability subsequent to the NCR being driven from the Vegas region."
0DI0005988	One of the "mitigating contingencies" he planned was to enlist the Followers to  provide increased medical aid throughout the region.
0DI0005989	Just seems like it might help keep things stable when we go independent. Not that I know what I'm talking about!
0DI0005994	Great! I've been wanting to get a laser gun for a while now.
0DI0005995	Sounds like a stupid policy to me.
0DI0005996	Fine, I'm going, I'm going. And I'll take my business elsewhere!
0DI0005997	Think I'll do just that.
0DI0005998	New Vegas has many faces, stranger. Despite everything, it shall never be whole.
0DI0005999	When the land hunts you, when fighting for survival is the norm, your neighbors become either saviors, or enemies.
0DI0006000	Westside is a part of New Vegas, just as much as it's a part of the Wasteland. In the end, stranger, we need them both to continue making our fate.
0DI0006002	Westside attracts all sorts of travelers, including merchants and farmers. They come here to exchange their goods, or to seek protection.
0DI0006003	Our community provides enough food, clothes, weapons and medicine to encourage trade, and to arm our defenses.
0DI0006004	The Thorn demonstrates, beyond anything else, that we're self-sufficient. Our desert-blood has overcome even the strongest beasts of the Wasteland.
0DI0006005	The Thorn is my master, not the other way around. I live to make our kin able to transcend their limitations.
0DI0006006	Our land is harsh, and hostile. Our lives are cheap, and fragile. Death is our assured fate, striking when least we expect it.
0DI0006007	The Thorn awakens us to the truth. Here we escape from our bonds, and choose the moment of death against the will of destiny.
0DI0006008	The land does not care about petty squabbles among lesser men. I don't care about that either.
0DI0006009	In the end, the people of New Vegas will continue to live and die here. It matters not who their self-appointed "master" is.
0DI0006010	Bold, as it pleases The Thorn, and me. But it does take more than that to earn my admiration.
0DI0006011	You speak like a hunter, yet only actions prove one's worth. The Thorn requires a tribute of blood, and so do I.
0DI0006012	You show great promise. I look forward to the time when I can call you "My Hunter," but that time has not yet arrived.
0DI0006013	Your bravery surpasses that of any other, and I've come to admire your actions.
0DI0006014	Before death takes us, I would know you deeper. Come with me... My Hunter.
0DI0006015	You got it. Best of luck and enjoy the carnage.
0DI0006027	What'll fight on Blue?
0DI0006039	The Thorn's thirsty for blood. Pay my costs and the fight will begin in earnest.
0DI0006111	Your loss. Come back to me when you have something to offer.
0DI0006147	I can see your resolve, determined like the nature of a beast. So be it.
0DI0006148	Get to your cage and ready your arm.
0DI0006149	I've come to expect nothing less from you, brave stranger.
0DI0006151	You liked it? Wow, you're the first one who ever did!
0DI0006152	Psh. Whatever.
0DI0006153	Hmm, indulgent, what rhymes with indulgent? Efful- no, no, that's terrible.
0DI0006154	Silver... silver what? Silver eyes? No, "eyes" doesn't rhyme...
0DI0006155	One, two, three... dammit, too many syllables!
0DI0006156	There once was a man of stout heart... heart, heart, what rhymes with heart?
0DI0006157	I wonder if anything rhymes with "Cazador?"
0DI0006158	Hmm, maybe I should write something about how much the Great Khans suck.
0DI0006159	How do you spell "gesticulate?"
0DI0006160	If you are listening to this log from one of our Enclave Outposts in Chicago, give this unit whatever repairs it needs so it can continue to Navarro.
0DI0006162	Then get out of here.
0DI0006163	You did? Wow, that's great!
0DI0006164	Once you get ahold of that Platinum Chip, I'll be able to help you in all sorts of ways.
0DI0006165	Right, it's one of two locations on House's network with non-standard hardware.
0DI0006166	My guess is that it has a reader that can decode the chip, and who knows what else? Maybe a giant robot or something!
0DI0006167	That's right! Like I said, it's probably pretty important because it has non-standard hardware, just like the Lucky 38!
0DI0006168	The data on that Platinum Chip is a big secret, unless you can find a dedicated reader to decode it. Isn't that frustrating?
0DI0006169	Neat. Let me know what you find out!
0DI0006170	I have to admire your prudent nature. Why get caught up in action, you know? And results?
0DI0006171	Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're right. I mean, for one thing, it's you saying it, and you always know what you're talking about.
0DI0006172	And if you had, you know, a huge killer robot at your command, yeah, that would just clutter things up.
0DI0006173	And a lesser person might want that kind of overwhelming force on their side, but you know - where's the challenge in that?
0DI0006174	Super! Now when Mr. House is out of the way, we can use the Chip to install me at the Lucky 38.
0DI0006175	You have to get Mr. House out of the way, that's what! And then we'll install me on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
0DI0006177	Nope, not going to be that easy.
0DI0006178	Download Complete. Begin Recording.
0DI0006179	Navarro outpost scientists, I am glad that ED-E has reached you. You will find several databanks of information on this machine.
0DI0006180	Please handle this information with the utmost care as it represents the sum total of the results of my research on the Duraframe Eyebots.
0DI0006181	There are also several databanks with information on my research into Poseidon Energy and some projects they were working on in the Mojave area.
0DI0006182	Yeah, beat it.
0DI0006183	Guy's unstable, but he pays his rent and Sweetie seems to like him all right.
0DI0006184	We can come to a deal. My price is firm, though - Saint James is a good customer and it better be worth it if I'm going to lose him.
0DI0006185	I could never resist a woman like you. Here, take the key, but don't tell anyone where you go it.
0DI0006186	Oh, don't you dare play that game with me. Fine, here's the key since it's so important to you. Just don't say where you got it.
0DI0006187	Already forgotten!
0DI0006188	And here's your key.
0DI0006189	Too bad. No caps, no key.
0DI0006190	That's all right. My friends got beat so bad they'll be recuperating for quite some time, so head over there when you can.
0DI0006191	Near as I can tell, it was some sort of religious institution.
0DI0006192	Oh, I know it says "school" out front, but everything in here seems to be related to the worship of some guy from back in the day.
0DI0006193	People used to come here to learn about him, to dress like him, move like him. To be him. If that's not worship, I don't know what is.
0DI0006194	Not a whole lot to tell. There were only a few books left in here when we found it, and those were rotted away.
0DI0006195	There were some posters left that were pretty well preserved, which is how we know all this stuff was based on the same guy.
0DI0006196	The thing of it is, we don't even know what his name was. All the posters just referred to him as "The King".
0DI0006197	As far as we can tell, the guy that built this place was considered the coolest of the cool, and taught other people how to be more like him.
0DI0006198	People would come from all around to learn how to sing, dance, dress, and even speak the way he did.
0DI0006199	Sure thing. What'd you have in mind?
0DI0006200	Well, that and the giant sign outside. This place could have been "The King's House of Dog Chow" and I still would have taken the name.
0DI0006201	But I like to think I keep the memory alive.
0DI0006202	Somethin' like that, yeah. There were some working tapes here when we first got here, so we know what he sounded like.
0DI0006203	Sadly, they stopped working a few years back, so I sold them to a junk merchant who was passing through, otherwise I'd play some for you.
0DI0006204	All the outfits you see my guy wearing around were originally found in here, too. Along with more hair gel than you can shake a stick at.
0DI0006205	Rangers, this is the chief. I know I can ramble on sometimes, but I need you to listen close for the next minute or so. I've got some bad news.
0DI0006206	I messed up. Made a mistake. I thought I could help get us out of here, but... it didn't work out.
0DI0006207	Rangers get injured all the time. It's part of the job. But if you lose a few fingers, get a bad break, that's it. You step down.
0DI0006208	We rely on each other too much to let our infirmities become a liability. A ranger knows when it's time. Only I didn't.
0DI0006209	Somewhere along the way, something broke inside me. I couldn't find us a way out of this desert. I wrestled with it, and it took me down a dark road.
0DI0006210	I wish I could explain it to you. The old chief's finally at a loss for words.
0DI0006211	Send me all the Legion you can. I'll be waiting for them.
0DI0006213	Come over and introduce yourself.
0DI0006214	Come now, don't keep me waiting.
0DI0006215	I invited you here so we could talk, not so you can nose around.
0DI0006217	Uh... it's for the co-ops. Mr. Anderson told me to do it - he said it wasn't stealing if it's for the good of everybody.
0DI0006218	He caught me and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I don't know what happened after that, but when I asked, Mr. Anderson said not to worry.
0DI0006219	But... Mr. Anderson had this look on his face. It's the look grownups get when they've done something bad.
0DI0006220	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
0DI0006221	Corporal White caught me taking the water and made me tell on Mr. Anderson. I think something bad happened, but Mr. Anderson told me not to worry.
0DI0006222	[FAILED] I said I don't know anything. Leave me alone!
0DI0006223	I didn't want to get Mr. Anderson in trouble. He says the Westside needs to be able to take care of itself.
0DI0006225	No. I gotta go.
0DI0006226	Uh-huh.
0DI0006227	My girl is trapped by geckos on the ridge and I can't get to her. Please, she's going to die!
0DI0006228	I could pay you.
0DI0006229	Fine, just leave me to my misery then.
0DI0006230	Bastard. You're just like everyone else around here.
0DI0006231	I hope someone helps my girl before it's too late.
0DI0006232	I'll give you whatever you want, just hurry!
0DI0006233	Go up the path past the broken radio tower and go to the right... they're at the top of the trail.
0DI0006234	You will? Thank you for helping me. Please hurry.
0DI0006235	But she'll die if you don't help!
0DI0006236	You just gotta help her, man.
0DI0006237	Since he's dead, I don't think he'll mind. Here.
0DI0006238	I do have his spare key, but I'm not sure he'd like it if I let you in there. Saint James can be a little crazy sometimes.
0DI0006239	I still don't think he'd like it if I let you in there.
0DI0006240	Excellent! The Followers' mission will be better served with someone like yourself traveling around the Mojave.
0DI0006241	As a representative of the Followers, I present you with your very own Lab Coat. Wear it well, and may it aid our cause.
0DI0006242	Also, before I forget, here is a key to a safehouse you can use to rest if you happen to be in the area. I'll just mark it mark it on your map.
0DI0006243	That is unfortunate. If you change your mind, please see me right away.
0DI0006244	Our aim is to gradually shape a better brighter future for the wasteland.
0DI0006245	We seek to heal the planet through efforts not unlike the medicine and education we offer here in the Old Mormon Fort.
0DI0006246	All we ask is members and those seeking aid do their best to help those in need when the opportunity arises.
0DI0006248	Great, did you change your mind?
0DI0006249	I'm sure you have your reasons, but we are much too busy to waste our time on those selfish bastards.
0DI0006250	Even if we wanted to, we don't have the resources to handle such a monumental task right now.
0DI0006251	Unless you can handle our supply shortages, the best we can do is scrape by in here in Freeside.
0DI0006252	Why should we support the NCR? Their continual operational incompetence gets their soldiers killed, and they hold a monopoly on water in the mojave.
0DI0006256	Why should we support Vegas? They've locked Freeside out of the city and do nothing to help their neighboring townsfolk.
0DI0006257	No, but there is still a good chance the NCR could hold them off and we're not equipped to fight a war, here.
0DI0006258	Wow. Whatever you have planned must be pretty big to give them the boot, but this sounds dangerous.
0DI0006259	I refuse to put my people at risk. If the NCR are pushed out, the raiders and other scum will run amok.
0DI0006260	But the Followers aren't fighters. We'd get annihilated as front-line medics.
0DI0006261	In that case, they'll have our support. We cannot afford to let the Legion win.
0DI0006262	That is somewhat reassuring, but we still don't have the resources to care for the entire Mojave by ourselves.
0DI0006263	We already experience regular supply shortages. Opening our door to the entire region... I don't see how this could ever work.
0DI0006264	It is indeed our duty to teach and improve the living conditions of our fellow man, but we're talking an insane amount of logistics to make this work.
0DI0006265	Surprisingly good. Our forces have managed to secure the region with little resistance, and trade should soon reach an all-time high.
0DI0006266	The brass was particularly surprised by the lack of domestic threats in the area. They were prepared to spend months pacifying known troublemakers.
0DI0006267	When they found those threats absent, they turned to the man in charge of the area, but Hsu being Hsu, he denied having anything to do with it.
0DI0006268	So now the men have to answer to Brigadier General Moore, and both they and I have you to thank for it.
0DI0006269	We made a good team. I hope we can work together again in the future.
0DI0006270	I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you. There's much to be done, but nothing for someone with your skills.
0DI0006271	You should take some time off. You've earned it.
0DI0006272	With their leader dead, the rest of their army retreated to the east. We've sent scouts to track them, but that's it.
0DI0006273	We don't have the forces or supplies necessary to chase them down. More's the pity.
0DI0006274	Still, I've sent a few skilled men out to make sure their journey is "eventful". It should be a long time before they even think of returning.
0DI0006275	Of course, have they been dealt with?
0DI0006276	Very well. Do you know what they're up to?
0DI0006277	Okay. Is he still a threat?
0DI0006278	Fine by me. Have you found them yet?
0DI0006279	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, but those haven't panned out too well from what I hear.
0DI0006280	There've been complaints about the amount of water we're supplying, but those are just excuses for lack of diligence, I'm sure.
0DI0006281	We aid some programs the Republic has sponsored involving sharecropper farms in the area, which seem to be coming along nicely.
0DI0006282	There was some sort of trouble involving the water supply recently, but it sorted itself out, as these things often do.
0DI0006283	You have? Wow! That's amazing! You can murder Mr. House whenever you want!
0DI0006284	Wow! Do you have any idea how special that is? Red carpet treatment!
0DI0006285	Seems a little mean to use his invitation against him like that, but I'm sure it's all for the best!
0DI0006286	It sounds like Mr. House is just plain mean. No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
0DI0006287	If you've been inside the Lucky 38 before, I bet you can get in again! And that's amazing!
0DI0006288	Isn't it exciting? I always wondered why I had missiles in my shoulders but couldn't launch them. Not that I'd ever want to!
0DI0006289	The upgrade really boosts the hitting power of each Securitron! Now you just need a way of controlling them!
0DI0006290	Really? An army of Securitrons - upgraded, no less? What a development!
0DI0006291	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - heck, anybody!
0DI0006292	Let me know as soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way!
0DI0006293	I'll roll over to the Lucky 38 and see what I can do. If I'm right about the Platinum Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
0DI0006295	An army like that should be enough to defend Vegas from - I'm gonna say anybody!
0DI0006296	I'd take it straight to Mr. House if I were you! He'll think you're helping him out! Then when he's not looking - KER-POW!
0DI0006297	The big question is whether to give him the Chip before you do him in! He's the one who'll know exactly what to do with it, after all!
0DI0006298	He might upgrade his defensive capabilities right away! Or even unlock new ones!
0DI0006299	But then those defensive upgrades might make it harder for you to finish him off! Hard to say! It's up to you!
0DI0006300	It looks like you'll have to fight your way inside the Lucky 38 and take care of Mr. house with your own two hands! Or weapons held in them!
0DI0006301	You already took care of House, so when you get the Chip, all you have to do is let me know.
0DI0006303	Let me know when it's done and I'll roll over to the Lucky 38. If I'm right about the Chip, I should be able to install myself on House's mainframe!
0DI0006304	This is going to be great! I'm going to help you accomplish so much, whether I want to or not!
0DI0006305	Of course you do! Sorry about that! And it's wonderful that you do!
0DI0006306	Benny carries it with him at all times. I think he's paranoid that someone might want to take it from him.
0DI0006307	No kidding! He was running fast! He better pace himself - he has to run all the way to Fortification Hill!
0DI0006308	There's an underground facility there that might have the special hardware required to use the data on the Platinum Chip!
0DI0006309	It's too bad Caesar's Legion built its camp right above it. Talk about inconvenient!
0DI0006310	Hmm. You should probably check on that, huh?
0DI0006311	I hope that didn't sound condscending. I didn't mean to be!
0DI0006312	Well, that's just mean! I don't like Mr. House one bit! No wonder the good guys want to kill him and take his stuff!
0DI0006313	You should accept his invitation and then murder him when he least suspects it!
0DI0006314	You... blew it up? It's just funny, because that... army... seems like the secret weapon that was the whole point of... you know?
0DI0006315	I really admire how you stack the odds against yourself! Yeah, make things challenging!
0DI0006316	It's great. Really. Yeah. So anyway...
0DI0006317	You won't find better.
0DI0006318	Remember, an impressive gratuity sends a message.
0DI0006319	Our drinks have many subtle flavors.
0DI0006320	Eyebot Duraframe Subject E is both the prototype, and the last functional model in this test group.
0DI0006321	I was prepared to make several significant upgrades to the machines.
0DI0006322	However, as the project was canceled and all Duraframe assets are being diverted to Hellfire Armor, I am sending this model to the Navarro outpost.
0DI0006324	Subject E: Diagnosis complete. Begin Recording.
0DI0006325	My name is Whitley. I'm a researcher at Adams Air Force base. Until recently I was in charge of the Duraframe reinforcement project for the combat model Eyebots.
0DI0006328	Well, now, there's an interesting idea - do a bit of good before we're all dead and forgotten. You can count me in.
0DI0006329	Oh, and in case Arcade forgot to mention it, there's a five-word pass phrase needed to get into the bunker. My word is "old" - appropriate, huh?
0DI0006330	Yeah, the NCR and the Legion are about due for another dustup. So, you're going to get yourself involved in that? All right, I'm in. Could be fun.
0DI0006331	Hey, I was just asking. No need to get uppity about it. I'll be at the reunion, don't you worry.
0DI0006332	Okay! Anything else?
0DI0006333	I have my little helpers out and about, always looking for fresh things to add to the stewpot.
0DI0006334	You may have seen them around somewhere yourself. Now, deny your hunger no longer!
0DI0006335	For the right caps I might be able to put in a good word or let people know you're not such a bad guy. What do you have in mind?
0DI0006336	All right, you let your caps do the talking. How much exactly are you looking for the locals to forget?
0DI0006337	Sorry, bub, but I'm fresh out of ideas. I've done all I can to scrub up your rep around here. What's done is done.
0DI0006338	All right, I can chat you up, but it is going to cost you. I'm not risking my reputation around here for nothing.
0DI0006339	Sorry, chum, but I've done all I can to chat you up to the locals.
0DI0006340	What do you need, then?
0DI0006341	Very well, I'll let the townsfolk know you had your reasons, and convince them they were of the most benevolent means.
0DI0006342	Okay, I'll reassure the townies your intentions are good, but if you keep it up, they aren't going to believe me in the future.
0DI0006343	You've got yourself a deal. I'll let the townsfolk know some ill-tempered goon has been spreading nasty rumors about you.
0DI0006344	All right, but this is the last time I can use this line with the townies. I can only discredit so many people.
0DI0006345	This'll take some work, but I'm sure I can convince them you were off your rocker in the past and you've changed your ways.
0DI0006346	However, this is a once-only affair. Screw me once, shame on you, and all that jazz.
0DI0006347	People aren't going to believe me if you go on another spree and claim the Devil made you do it.
0DI0006348	Great, I'll let the townsfolk know you help old ladies across the street and do your best to keep the town clean if you notice litter.
0DI0006349	Okay, I'll tell the locals you've been keeping an eye on local thugs as a sort of neighborhood watch.
0DI0006350	I'll see what I can do, but there isn't much more I can say about you that won't require more caps.
0DI0006351	That'll do nicely. I'll spin some stories about how you stopped a mugging or two and saved a kid's pet rat from certain doom!
0DI0006352	Thanks, I'll spin up some tales of you slaying some nasty critters infesting some of the local homes and donating the leftovers to charity.
0DI0006353	Okay, but this is the last story I can tell without a bigger risk to my rep.
0DI0006354	I'll tell them you took out a band of NCR raiders planning to rob locals as they left Freeside.
0DI0006359	Great, this is going to require an epic tale of heroism...
0DI0006360	I've got it! I'll say you slew a nest of Deathclaws living in the sewers! It was bloody work, but you waded through the pack like a man possessed!
0DI0006361	Just to make this clear, I can only spin a whopper this big once. There's only so much people will believe before they see through the bullshit.
0DI0006366	I don't have time to discuss all the different aspects of the NCR with you, but if you want it all in a nutshell - the NCR is progress.
0DI0006367	If you wander around the wasteland you'll find all sorts of tribes, villages, and such where people spend most of their time trying to survive.
0DI0006368	The NCR gives its citizens a shot at something more. We have laws, currency, health care, government. All the things that were lost.
0DI0006369	It's not perfect, but it's worth protecting, which is why we also have the largest military in existence.
0DI0006370	I joined up at a young age. Was barely sixteen when I left home and volunteered to be in the military.
0DI0006371	Got a few strange looks at first, but those stopped when I got top marks across the board during training, and became an officer at seventeen.
0DI0006372	A few years went by, my squad helped take down gangs of raiders here and there, and one day an invitation to join the Rangers arrived.
0DI0006373	Those were the best years of my life. Doing something that truly matters, and having the freedom to handle it as you see fit. Then I got injured.
0DI0006374	Everyone was very supportive. I received a promotion to colonel and given greater responsibility, but my days as a Ranger were over.
0DI0006375	It's of immense strategic value to the NCR. Hoover Dam sends enough electricity west to light every city and major settlement.
0DI0006376	It's moderately defensible, with a single point of entry on the east side. To get to the power plants below, the enemy has to cross the entire top.
0DI0006377	The Legion's tried to cross the water on a few occasions, but slow-moving boats make easy targets for sharpshooters.
0DI0006378	They're organized, I'll give them that. The few times I've encountered them firsthand, I've been impressed with their discipline.
0DI0006379	I've heard they don't allow women in their military, considering them nothing more than breeding stock.
0DI0006380	Their men, however, are typically quite large, in phenomenal condition, and prefer close-quarter weapons.
0DI0006381	Recent engagements have taught us to fear their shock attacks, so it's a blessing that we seem to have superior firearms.
0DI0006382	I command the garrison here at the dam, yes, but Colonel Hsu over at McCarran is technically in charge of the area's forces.
0DI0006383	I do, sometimes. There are days I'd give anything to out in the open air, planting explosives and laying down covering fire.
0DI0006384	But here I am, stuck in the same stale office day after day, while other people get to do the actual fighting.
0DI0006385	But enough reminiscing. Did you have other questions?
0DI0006386	Oh, it has its perks, to be sure. I'm free to see that things on a large scale are done my way, and don't have to tolerate any disagreement.
0DI0006387	Those few people in a position to countermand my orders only care about results, and in that regard I never leave them less than pleased.
0DI0006388	I can only spare a few more moments. What did you wish to speak about?
0DI0006389	I've never once seen a single one of them back down, or disobey an order.
0DI0006390	They'll happily charge a fortified position with little more than a sharpened stick if ordered to, and do so without hesitation.
0DI0006391	Yes, extremely so. They must use conditioning routines on par with the rangers, or better.
0DI0006392	Their soldiers can run near half again as fast as my best men, and close distances with frightening speed. And they're as strong as they are fast.
0DI0006393	Their superior physicality makes them extremely dangerous up close, so I've had the men run drills for taking on larger, stronger opponents.
0DI0006394	But they've all been instructed to take them down at range, if possible. I've made it clear I don't want any heroes in my squad, just survivors.
0DI0006395	Their standard kit seems to be a blade of some sort and light armor. Guns are not uncommon, but are of questionable condition.
0DI0006396	While they prefer to use their blades, it's common for them to scavenge better weapons from their enemies and use those.
0DI0006397	The men have been told to toss their weapons over the side of the dam if they receive a fatal wound, but I doubt many will remember.
0DI0006398	As I said, our scouts were some ways west of HELIOS when they disappeared.
0DI0006399	Don't fool yourself. I've dealt with enough of these gangs to know that they can't be trusted. Was there anything else?
0DI0006400	Very well, but be brief.
0DI0006401	To name a few things off the top of my head - expand his borders, get the NCR and Legion to wipe each other out, and seize Hoover Dam.
0DI0006402	Any other questions?
0DI0006403	We've had reported sightings of Mr. House's Securitrons spying on both NCR and Legion forces.
0DI0006404	Also, given a recent analysis of the sightings, we now estimate that Mr. House has at least four times as many securitrons as previously assumed.
0DI0006405	He wouldn't show his hand like that if he weren't prepared to move. And neither the NCR or Legion can spare the troops to investigate.
0DI0006406	Which is why I'm sending you. Any other questions?
0DI0006407	Perhaps, but that's not my problem. Vegas is a nice place for the men to go on vacation, but it'd be an acceptable loss next to the Dam.
0DI0006408	Good, then you have your orders. See that Mr. House does not present a problem.
0DI0006410	Damn it all to hell! Let's go!
0DI0006411	Our instructions were pretty clear. Now you better get your ass out of here.
0DI0006412	Friend or not, no one is allowed in here. Move along!
0DI0006413	All right, but make it quick.
0DI0006414	It's probably more important that you get out of here alive. If you haven't noticed, there's a battle going on here.
0DI0006415	Now get out of here!
0DI0006416	You'll regret this!
0DI0006417	It took years for Caesar to conquer Lanius' tribe, and Caesar showed mercy to the survivors, allowing them to join the Legion.
0DI0006418	Had the positions been reversed, Caesar would be dead. Lanius is called the Monster of the East because he never, ever shows mercy.
0DI0006419	He's a story to frighten the younger Legionaries. He's dead - no man, no matter how tough, could survive a fall into the Grand Canyon.
0DI0006420	His head exploded, idiot. Of course it's your fault. Avenge Caesar!
0DI0006421	A vengeful spirit, some of the more superstitious women claim. He was a great leader of the Legion before he failed Caesar.
0DI0006422	The story says he was set on fire and thrown into the Grand Canyon, but his angry spirit rose from the ashes of his corpse, looking for revenge.
0DI0006423	Nonsense, probably, but there's no doubt that many in the Legion believe he's still alive somehow.
0DI0006424	The Legate is not a man to be crossed, especially if you're a woman. That's all I will say about it.
0DI0006425	Stop right there, no one is allowed into the control room!
0DI0006427	We are here as promised. Now let's kick some ass.
0DI0006428	See ya soon!
0DI0006429	The Boss is pretty clear on this. I can't let you in unless you're by your lonesome.
0DI0006430	Oh boy.
0DI0006431	Come back soon, now!
0DI0006434	Folks around here call me the chief, but Hanlon's just fine. The rangers run themselves pretty well, but I try to lend a hand.
0DI0006435	Mostly administrative work, helping coordinate intel on the radio. That and keeping an eye on the fires growing across the water.
0DI0006436	The best of the best, worst of the worst. He came out of NCR, one of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0006437	Like a lot of the Followers, he went out in the wilderness with a partner to try to help those who needed helping.
0DI0006438	Not much different from how the rangers used to be, except with books and medicine instead of guns.
0DI0006439	It's no secret that we've had better campaigns. Holding this whole length of river isn't easy.
0DI0006440	We're stretched thin and the Long 15 just keeps getting longer. Slow to get supplies. Slower to get reinforcements.
0DI0006441	NCR's senate has got funds tied up at the Boneyard and President Kimball ordered our most experienced rangers to chase ghosts down in Baja.
0DI0006442	Even Caesar knows that General Oliver's coming back to Hoover. Colonel Moore's doing a fine job of running things over at the dam.
0DI0006443	In her own way, of course, when she's not trying to wrangle my rangers into helping her.
0DI0006444	But just keeping that dam secure and operational day to day is enough work for one person, never mind building a defense against the Legion.
0DI0006445	Mojave Outpost sent word through the stations. The rangers coming up from Baja moved through Dayglow a week ago.
0DI0006446	Some of the patrol rangers have reported that Oliver's power armor heavy troopers are starting to reinforce the front lines.
0DI0006447	Wish they got here a bit earlier, but that's the senate for you.
0DI0006448	Not too long ago, they took Nelson and Searchlight.
0DI0006449	They've got some camps on the eastern shore of the Colorado, and the monstrosity on the hill across the lake - that's for Caesar.
0DI0006450	Some folks don't believe he's here yet, but you can tell. He's the eye of the storm. It all roils and spins around him.
0DI0006451	You don't have to see the man to see the effect he has.
0DI0006452	Intel says the legate's coming. Lanius. They call him the Monster of the East. If he's half as bad as Graham was, we're in for a heck of a fight.
0DI0006453	With Caesar and a new legate here, the Legion's not going to fall for the same old bag of tricks.
0DI0006454	Word is that the Legion's old timers have shown up, Caesar's veterans from the Red Okie Centuria and what was the Painted Rock tribe.
0DI0006455	They're the best of the best and the baddest of the bad. Short of a centurion or praetorian, they don't come any tougher.
0DI0006456	You come across a pack of them, weigh your options carefully.
0DI0006457	I could tell you a lot if you had the time, but at my age I'm not sure which of us would get tired first. What do you want to know?
0DI0006458	I didn't realize you were in such a hurry.
0DI0006459	I get so used to sitting in this chair and listening to radio reports, sometimes I forget people are getting ready for a war out there.
0DI0006460	Interesting that she would wrangle someone else into sorting out the problem.
0DI0006461	But I suppose you're in the right place. A lot of intel comes through here.
0DI0006462	This again? All right. What do you want to know?
0DI0006463	Hold on. If we're going to have this conversation, let's go somewhere more private.
0DI0006464	Don't worry. Not much bite left in this old dog.
0DI0006465	I don't know Technical Sergeant Reyes, but coordinating intel can be messy sometimes. Things get mixed up, people get confused.
0DI0006466	Heck, I get confused and I've been doing this for a long time now. What he - or she - sees as a problem might be standard operating procedure.
0DI0006467	That's not to say Reyes is wrong for being concerned, but it's easy for the sand to get in your eyes out here.
0DI0006468	Well... the logical thing to do is to check with the patrol rangers and comm officers. Don't be too discouraged if some things don't match up.
0DI0006469	Different people see different things, and sometimes the meaning gets twisted, lost in static from person to person.
0DI0006470	It's a simple system, when it works. Patrol rangers radio intel to ranger stations.
0DI0006471	Comm rangers send the intel up the station chain until it reaches Camp Golf.
0DI0006472	Then I or one of the other rangers on duty organize the data, evaluate it, and send information to camps or troopers in the field.
0DI0006473	Comm rangers might have an incomplete picture of the situation. There's a lot going on out there.
0DI0006474	Intel needs to be coordinated through Golf so we can verify and advise appropriately.
0DI0006475	Troopers have enough to deal with. We don't want them questioning their intel.
0DI0006476	You have, have you? Misdirection. When you're pinned down, outnumbered, and two days from any help, it's just about the best friend you can have.
0DI0006477	Misdirection's what's saved me all these years. It's what saved us at Hoover Dam. But it's been five years now and Caesar's right across that lake.
0DI0006478	He's closer now than he ever was before. I was a young man once. I know what it's like to want to fight for your home, but this isn't it.
0DI0006479	It's never going to end. This fight with Caesar. People back home don't know what these young men and women are in for.
0DI0006480	The Legion is the worst enemy we've ever faced, but we can't stop Caesar here, not without getting a lot of good people killed.
0DI0006481	More than anyone cares to count up. And even if we do stop him, I don't see how we're ever going to be able to pull out.
0DI0006482	We're fighting on their behalf, but Mr. House and the families are stringing us up, inch by inch.
0DI0006483	They'll drain us dry while we fight and die over this dam. We offered them sanctuary in NCR territory before, but they won't listen.
0DI0006484	Troopers and rangers have been dying here for more than five years while the families sit pretty behind that... damned wall.
0DI0006485	People back home don't listen. They don't care. Senators, Brahmin barons, folks who are just trying to make it from day to day.
0DI0006486	It's been so many years that people forget about it. Conscription brings in fresh troops to die here every month. Like it's routine.
0DI0006487	And even if we hold this dam, what then? Are we going to send the NCR's men and women to die here for another five years? Ten?
0DI0006488	Patrol the whole length of the Colorado for hundreds of miles? Holding this dam. It'll be the death of us.
0DI0006489	First thing that comes to mind is to turn me in. But that might not be the best play, all things considered.
0DI0006490	Even if your heart's in the right place, I reckon it might do a lot more harm than good.
0DI0006491	Hold on. This is ranger headquarters. There might be a dozen rangers within earshot.
0DI0006492	Think twice before you decide to give the old chief a gut full of lead.
0DI0006493	Creating fear and instability among the troopers without causing harm, it's the only thing I could think of to shake things up.
0DI0006494	It took some people getting killed to realize I had gone too far. I had to stop.
0DI0006495	Fair enough. You want to do this the right way, go get one of the rangers. Don't worry. I'm not gonna run out on you.
0DI0006496	Oliver can't stand that rangers got credit for victory at Hoover. Whatever I recommend, he does the opposite. I said I wanted them on the ridge.
0DI0006497	He put them right on the western part of the dam itself. We don't have enough firepower to hold that spot.
0DI0006498	If the troopers fall back, and they will, the rangers will advance to cover Oliver's retreat. We lose the dam, Oliver and the senate are ruined.
0DI0006499	Rangers are volunteers. Every man and woman who signs up is willing to die for the NCR, myself included.
0DI0006500	A lot of this is my fault. It's only right that I stand with them.
0DI0006501	Maybe fifty rangers will die on that dam. We lose over a thousand troopers every year. Being here is crazy. Getting out's the only sane thing to do.
0DI0006502	It's a gamble either way. Even with Caesar gone, we still might not outlast the Legion. I suppose that's a risk I'll have to take.
0DI0006503	For our sake, I hope you're right. I guess I should thank you for bringing me to my senses. So... thanks.
0DI0006504	Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out that door and pretend we never had this talk.
0DI0006505	The Legion is more than just Caesar! It's got the momentum of thousands of men behind it.
0DI0006506	They're not just going to roll off into Arizona if we give them a good shove.
0DI0006507	I don't know if you're working for Caesar or if desperation's made me a heck of a lot more persuasive. Either way, this is the right thing to do.
0DI0006508	Now, I trust we're done discussing this. I'm going to step through that door and pretend like we never had this talk.
0DI0006509	Well, you got that right.
0DI0006510	Legion fires. They burn high wherever the Legion goes.
0DI0006511	Caesar's a hard man to figure out, but he always wants you to know when more troops are at your front door.
0DI0006512	Out to the Grand Canyon. He met a missionary from Utah, a man by the name of Joshua Graham. Graham helped translate for the Followers and the tribes.
0DI0006513	All three of them got nabbed by the Blackfoots down there, back when they were still at war with every other tribe in the southwest.
0DI0006514	Somewhere along the way, he realized he needed to educate the Blackfoots or they were going to get wiped out with the rest of the tribe.
0DI0006515	Showed them how to use guns, how to make explosives. Once he taught the Blackfoots a thing or two, they needed him.
0DI0006516	And he no longer needed the Followers, NCR, or anyone else. He decided he could remake the tribes of the southwest, whether they wanted it or not.
0DI0006517	He became Caesar and Joshua Graham became his legate, his right hand. And that's where Graham stayed until Hoover Dam.
0DI0006518	Losing the dam was the worst defeat the Legion ever suffered. Graham had been with Caesar since the beginning, but he had to set an example.
0DI0006519	The praetorians covered Graham in pitch, lit him on fire, and down into the Grand Canyon he went.
0DI0006520	Yes and no. The Blackfoots don't exist anymore, just like any other tribe that gets swallowed by the Legion.
0DI0006521	Caesar takes the tribal out of the tribe. Scrapes and burns off tattoos, breaks up families, forces mixed breeding so all the old loyalties die away.
0DI0006522	The only tribe in the Legion is the Legion. Caesar is their chief, father, and god all rolled into one.
0DI0006523	It's not that clear cut. You have to understand, Graham was the toughest son of a gun anyone around these parts had ever seen.
0DI0006524	Before Hoover, we had five kill reports on Graham from rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters who tried to take him out.
0DI0006525	Some folks think he's still alive, call him the Burned Man.
0DI0006526	Senate elections are coming up. Local representatives don't want to push any more funding to the Mojave campaign because it's unpopular.
0DI0006527	Most of the folks around the Boneyard haven't been to New Vegas and probably never will.
0DI0006528	All they know is that their money gets sucked away to this desert and their brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters die here.
0DI0006529	It's complicated. Goes way back. I told President Kimball that we need more rangers here.
0DI0006530	He accepted that, but took the most experienced ones and sent them south. Patrol rangers are good men and women, but we're about to fight a war.
0DI0006531	You've seen it yourself. Some of them don't even have proper service rifles or armor.
0DI0006532	Our heavy infantry, power armor units, they're back in NCR territory protecting the interests of Brahmin barons against small-time raiders.
0DI0006533	Brahmin barons only have one vote at the ballot box, but they have a lot of money to throw around.
0DI0006534	Oh, well... now, you'll have to excuse me. The general and I don't always see eye to eye on things.
0DI0006535	Maybe it's best that I just say that he is a trooper, through and through. The man will not give up an inch for anything, least of all to the Legion.
0DI0006536	The colonel is an effective commander - one of the best - but she sharpened her claws on the Vipers and the old Jackals.
0DI0006537	Did four tours against the Brotherhood, too. She used to be ranger until an injury took her out of action. Happens to a lot of us, unfortunately.
0DI0006538	She's better at making graves than making friends. Bring in Moore and the earth will be razed. Fields will be salted.
0DI0006539	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that. Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
0DI0006540	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore, but he's got the Fiends to deal with.
0DI0006541	No, and thanks to General Oliver for that.  Colonel Hsu is at McCarran. Most of the New Vegas troopers are under his command.
0DI0006542	He's more sympathetic to the locals than Moore. Now that the Fiends aren't giving him grief, we should see more troopers assigned to the front lines.
0DI0006543	Good work on that, by the way. Hope you got good bounties out of it.
0DI0006544	The Baja rangers can do more advance night scouting and sharpshooting to assist the troopers.
0DI0006545	Ranger combat helmets are old Pre-War gear. They have built in low-light optics. Makes a big difference.
0DI0006546	They have the best equipment the NCR can get its hands on, power armor salvaged from our war with the Brotherhood.
0DI0006547	Techs strip out the joint servos so you don't need special training to wear it.
0DI0006548	It feels like you're carrying a Brahmin on your back, but it can take a heck of a lot of punishment.
0DI0006549	Nelson was barely set up. We had a big stretch of unprotected land between Forlorn Hope and Searchlight, and Nelson was the solution.
0DI0006550	A decanus named Dead Sea took the place and caused a lot of damage.
0DI0006551	Searchlight was worse. One of Caesar's frumentarii must have found something in there, flooded the whole camp with radiation.
0DI0006552	By the way, I appreciate what you did for the troopers down there.
0DI0006553	Nelson might not be the most strategically important place, but taking Dead Sea out means a lot to them.
0DI0006554	I can't say I think the legionaries at Cottonwood deserved the same fate, but what's done is done.
0DI0006555	Thanks to you, that's one less pack of slavers for people to worry about.
0DI0006556	Oh, the usual reasons. People say he's enormous, carries a big sword, chops peoples' heads off. That's not what makes him a good commander, though.
0DI0006557	Folks say he came from a heck of a tough tribe, took Caesar a long time to conquer. It was thanks to Lanius.
0DI0006558	But once Caesar broke him, he was born again. He'll go anywhere and do anything to win. Legion says he can smell weakness.
0DI0006559	Once he finds out where an army's vulnerable, he'll go to it like a dog for the throat.
0DI0006560	He was a missionary from Utah who hooked up with Caesar at the Grand Canyon, became his translator.
0DI0006561	Graham helped Caesar with the Blackfoots after they got captured together. Up until Hoover Dam, he was Caesar's legate.
0DI0006562	You wouldn't think a man of god could turn so brutal. Cruel to his opponents. Did the sort of things that make you sick to talk about.
0DI0006563	He wasn't a brilliant strategist. Wasn't tactically flexible, either. There was something about him, though. Menace, indestructibility.
0DI0006564	It made everyone afraid of him. Heck, the praetorians burned Graham four years ago and some of the tribes are still afraid of him.
0DI0006565	They say the Burned Man still walks the land, blackens the earth wherever he sets foot.
0DI0006566	Take a regular legionary and age him ten years. Whatever they lose to age they make up for with experience. Life expectancy isn't long in the Legion.
0DI0006567	You live ten years in Caesar's army, you're a force to be reckoned with.
0DI0006568	There's no real equivalent to them in the NCR. Centurions are battle-born, elite officers who earned their rank with blood and sweat.
0DI0006569	They wear special outfits, too, pieced together from the armor of all their defeated enemies. Good commanders, tough opponents.
0DI0006570	Caesar's elite guard. They travel with him wherever he goes. A bit of insurance in case any of his guests get funny ideas.
0DI0006571	They aren't the toughest legionaries, but they're the most devoted to Caesar. They believe in everything the Legion stands for.
0DI0006572	Suppose it depends on what you think is "good." Most folks want to hear about Hoover Dam and Boulder City, but it's a long story.
0DI0006573	If you want some tall tales about hunting down slavers or busting up gangs, talk to one of the younger rangers.
0DI0006574	Oh, well. I guess it must be coming up on... forty years or so. Back before Elise was chief, anyway. It was a heck of a lot harder then.
0DI0006575	Weren't as many of us to go around. But I think it was a lot easier to tell the good guys from the bad.
0DI0006576	Well, there's what we're supposed to be doing and what we're actually doing.
0DI0006577	There's a big gap between those two things, about as wide as that lake out there.
0DI0006578	There's a lot of answers to that question, but it started with the Ranger Unification Treaty. We weren't always the only show in town.
0DI0006579	Nevada had its own posse, the Desert Rangers. They fought Caesar even farther east, out in Arizona. Didn't go well for them.
0DI0006580	Years back, we met with the Desert Rangers at Mojave Outpost and agreed to help them against Caesar if they would join the NCR.
0DI0006581	"To protect against all forms of tyranny." As simple as that. Thirty, forty years ago, the wasteland was full of despots.
0DI0006582	Slavers. Raiders. Tough-talking hoodlums with gangs who liked to kick around towns. Back then the NCR military was still young.
0DI0006583	Couldn't cover much ground. It took groups like ours to tip the balance back to the good guys.
0DI0006584	Sitting on the shore of Lake Mead, looking east. Listening to a radio. Trying to not get too many people killed.
0DI0006585	I'm too old to be slapping leather, but I had hoped for something else. More than this, anyway.
0DI0006586	[SUCCEEDED] It's kind of a long one, but all right. About twenty, twenty-five years ago, a group of NCR settlers pushed way south into Baja.
0DI0006587	I guess it doesn't seem so far now if you look at a map, but back then, they were out a ways.
0DI0006588	They built this little shanty town around a well in the middle of nowhere. Called it Rattletail.
0DI0006589	[FAILED] I do, but I'm tired of telling them. Time changes how you look at things.
0DI0006590	In big battles, Caesar deploys his legionaries in waves. Recruits up front, prime soldiers behind the recruits, old guard bringing up the rear.
0DI0006591	Opponents wear themselves out dealing with the first two waves, if they survive that long. When the veterans step up, there's not much fight left.
0DI0006592	Caesar can adapt, though, and when required, he can run any mix of legionaries as skirmishers and still retain order in the ranks.
0DI0006593	Word got back to one of our stations that raiders had been attacking the place. I went out with six rangers.
0DI0006594	We must have been on the trail for a week before we got to Rattletail. We lost one woman to Night Stalkers and another almost died of dehydration.
0DI0006595	When we reach the place, it's six shacks set up around an old well.
0DI0006596	There's over two dozen bodies lying in the dunes way outside of town and five men with .308 rifles crouched behind sand bags.
0DI0006597	And these bodies, these people out in the sand, they aren't raiders. Aren't even heavily armed.
0DI0006598	They're just people who were trying to get to the only well in fifty miles. I didn't have to talk to the men to see that they did not care one bit.
0DI0006599	They had planted an NCR flag over the well and they would not budge until every last one of them was laid out, dead and cold.
0DI0006600	So I walked up and told them there was a group of raiders coming, one hundred strong. I made up some cockamamie name for them and everything.
0DI0006601	The men looked at each other, looked at us, and asked me what we were going to do about it.
0DI0006602	I told him we would take them back into NCR territory because we had already lost ten rangers on the way out. Ten rangers, five men with .308 rifles.
0DI0006603	Well, that was enough for them. They packed up what they could and we took them back north. Last I heard, they settled somewhere in Anza-Borrego.
0DI0006604	Raised Bighorners. Had some tough times, but it worked out okay for them. So there you go. That's my one bit of good.
0DI0006605	Joshua Graham, Caesar's old legate, he's wasn't so flexible.
0DI0006606	When the Legion attacked Hoover Dam, General Oliver ordered his troopers back to the middle ground just after first contact.
0DI0006607	Graham pushed all of the legionaries onto the dam, filling the east side with recruits up front and veterans in the back, by the book.
0DI0006608	But once they were in, they were stuck there. Oliver's troopers were entrenched and wouldn't give a foot.
0DI0006609	That's when we ordered the rangers and 1st recon sharpshooters to start picking off veteran legion officers from a high ridge west of the dam.
0DI0006610	That only lasted about a minute before Graham ordered the back ranks to push through to the front and rush the ridge.
0DI0006611	Caused total chaos among the younger legionaries, and Oliver's troopers fell back to the side walkways and stayed out of the veterans' way.
0DI0006612	By the time the veterans got to the ridge, we were already in Boulder City.
0DI0006613	They followed us down there, but we were out before they realized what was happening.
0DI0006614	We had packed the old city with C4 and dynamite. Crude, but it did the job. Those who didn't die in the blast were in no position to mount a defense.
0DI0006615	The ones left on the dam didn't know what to do. The troopers routed them. Graham pulled the remaining legionaries back, but the battle was over.
0DI0006616	He went south, back to the Grand Canyon, back to Caesar. And that was the last we saw or heard from Joshua Graham.
0DI0006617	Consider it the first of many bestowments.
0DI0006618	What's wrong with you? This man shot you, stole from you, left you in the desert to die.
0DI0006619	You need to work on your bloodthirst. We won't speak again until Benny is dead.
0DI0006620	Walk away if you want, but if you do, he's going up on a cross. You're still making a choice.
0DI0006621	Answer the question.
0DI0006622	That's nothing new. Am I supposed to be impressed?
0DI0006626	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Pickings were getting slim around here anyway.
0DI0006627	[FAILED] Nope, not interested. No caps in letting people walk, you know.
0DI0006628	Letting you just walk away isn't how it works, I'm afraid.
0DI0006629	Yeah, get out of here.
0DI0006630	Good. Chavez and his boys were last seen south of here. If you're lucky and he's careless, he might still be there.
0DI0006631	Fuck you for wasting my time, then.
0DI0006632	Chavez is the ringleader. Without him, his crew will fall apart, and I don't give a shit about those guys.
0DI0006633	All right, then. Guess I'll just make a quiet exit - no need for a goodbye party or anything.
0DI0006634	Understood.
0DI0006635	When I need to, yes.
0DI0006636	That's right. Fuck off.
0DI0006637	Avenge Caesar!
0DI0006638	You are free to leave.
0DI0006641	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't have wanted me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
0DI0006642	Then I'd have to help you! I mean, it seems pretty obvious Benny wouldn't want me to, but hey, not my fault I can't say no!
0DI0006643	Again, goal number one is to eliminate Mr. House and install my neuro-computational matrix on the Lucky 38's mainframe!
0DI0006644	Given how you're a new arrival, I also recommend that you get to know some of the region's tribes, so you can decide how you feel about them!
0DI0006645	By the time you've finished up all of that, the Legion should be close to attacking Hoover Dam and we'll execute the last phase of the plan!
0DI0006646	It makes me feel really dumb to admit this, but I don't actually know! I've never been inside the Lucky 38. No one has!
0DI0006647	Mr. House is in there, though! It's the central node of his entire network!
0DI0006648	You already took care of Mr. House? Wow, you work fast!
0DI0006649	I mean, Benny was always scheming about how he was going to get into the Lucky 38, but you already took care of that. Wow!
0DI0006650	The other thing you're going to need is the Platinum Chip. You know, the one Benny killed a courier for, over near Goodsprings?
0DI0006651	The Platinum Chip is the key to overriding and exploiting Mr. House's defenses!
0DI0006652	Did I just say "exploiting?" That's not a very nice word!
0DI0006653	I'll be waiting right here!
0DI0006655	If you're tired of a topic, I'm tired of it, too!
0DI0006657	You bet!
0DI0006658	What should we talk about next?
0DI0006659	Okay! Who needs artillery support? Not the good guys, that's for sure!
0DI0006660	There's a bunch! Some of them you've already met - like the Chairmen, for instance!
0DI0006661	I think you should be sure to visit the other families on the Strip, the Omertas and the White Glove Society, so you know what makes them tick!
0DI0006662	And there are some important groups farther from the Strip, too, like the Boomers, the Great Khans, and the Brotherhood of Steel!
0DI0006663	Oh no, I didn't mean that! Who needs their support? The Securitrons will be all the support you need!
0DI0006664	What I meant is, you should get to know these tribes and decide which ones you like and which you don't!
0DI0006665	You know - shape the future of Vegas! Choose your neighbors! If you like a tribe, leave it alone!
0DI0006666	Or if a tribe is nasty, or going to be a problem - go ahead and exterminate it! It's whatever you want to do!
0DI0006667	Of course! Ask away!
0DI0006668	Please go on!
0DI0006669	That's one down, four to go.
0DI0006670	That's two down, three to go.
0DI0006671	That's three down, two to go.
0DI0006672	That's four down, just one to go.
0DI0006673	That accounts for all the tribes you needed to get to know!
0DI0006674	Anything else I can help with?
0DI0006675	Really? Talk about diplomatic skills! I mean, just not getting blown up was a success!
0DI0006676	Now they'll only blow up the right sorts of people! That's what matters!
0DI0006677	Problem solved! Quick and to the point! I like the way you work!
0DI0006678	Then consider them ignored! If they end up firing their howitzers at us, we'll ignore that, too! Until it goes away!
0DI0006679	The Khans are just... they're a dirty people. They live in tents like animals! And they're very rude!
0DI0006680	They've been kicked around a lot, but no one's finished them off! Not yet, anyway!
0DI0006681	They were one of the tribes the Three Families pushed out of Vegas! A whole bunch got killed!
0DI0006682	So they settled at Bitter Springs, but they kept being so obnoxious, the NCR had to kill a whole bunch more of them!
0DI0006683	So then they settle at Red Rock Canyon! There's just no getting rid of them!
0DI0006684	You set the pace.
0DI0006685	They must be a really nasty people! I haven't heard a single good thing about them!
0DI0006686	They fire artillery on anyone who comes near their settlement at Nellis Air Force Base. Talk about rude!
0DI0006687	If they can be convinced to fire those big cannons at the Legion or NCR, though, well - that'd be neat, wouldn't it?
0DI0006688	Take all the time you need!
0DI0006689	From what I understand, they're perfectly delightful! They're cultured, clean, and super-polite!
0DI0006690	Benny didn't like them, though! He said they were "creepy."
0DI0006691	Don't hurry on my account! I'm the one with the flexible schedule.
0DI0006692	Some of Mr. House's data said that he'd lost a bunch of Securitron scouts near Hidden Valley!
0DI0006693	Telemetry showed that they'd been attacked with energy weapons! House was pretty sure it was the Brotherhood!
0DI0006694	There must be a bunch of them holed up there! Not a good place for a robot to visit!
0DI0006695	They go around in big suits of power armor, and they have lots of energy weapons! But there's a downside!
0DI0006696	They just have a thing about technology! They think it should all be theirs! If someone else has it, they get mad!
0DI0006697	All I'm saying is, not much of a chance they'll accept a Vegas that polices itself with robots!
0DI0006698	No rush! Take your time!
0DI0006699	Hmm. I remember that Benny used to pay a receptionist at Gomorrah for information - maybe she knows something!
0DI0006700	Just that Benny didn't like them! He talked on and on about how they couldn't be trusted! And this is coming from Benny!
0DI0006701	He hated their casino, said it was tacky! And he thought they were up to something, because he said they always are!
0DI0006702	Whenever you get around to it will be just fine!
0DI0006703	If you say so! Consider them filed away under "not to be discussed again!"
0DI0006704	Yay, that's great news! You finished what Mr. House and the NCR started! That's got to feel good!
0DI0006705	Really? Okay! That sounds fun!
0DI0006706	That's not aiding an enemy! Not when you do it!
0DI0006707	Maybe they'll be devoured by giant scorpions! All sorts of things could happen to them out there!
0DI0006708	Oooh, sounds dramatic! I like it! Wind them up and let them go!
0DI0006709	No more Khans! That's great! They're just bad people...
0DI0006710	Okay! Consider them forgotten! Along with the projections that predict they'll be our biggest enemy! Forgotten!
0DI0006711	Really? That's... well, that's a surprise! They'll really want to blow me up!
0DI0006712	But maybe dumb machines like me ought to get blown up and scrapped for salvage. Who knows? Not me!
0DI0006714	Wow! That is amazing! You are just - a hero! I am serious!
0DI0006715	You'd think it'd be bad for the Strip but... but I guess it must be good!
0DI0006716	Yeah - take the Strip down a notch or two, right? That'll show it! Okay!
0DI0006718	A cannibalism problem? Really? I'm so glad you weren't eaten!
0DI0006719	That's great news! I wish I could visit their casino! They have a refined sense of taste!
0DI0006720	You did? That's... that's an unusual approach!
0DI0006721	But I know it makes sense somehow if you're the one doing it! The problem is me!
0DI0006722	You really know how to make a robot happy! Seriously, you just made my day.
0DI0006723	I'll make my way there.
0DI0006724	Back to the tomb, I suppose. If you need me, et cetera.
0DI0006725	Nice! Can I order room service?
0DI0006727	Hey, as long as you're not asking me to go back to Black Mountain, I'm a happy old man.
0DI0006729	All right... don't be long. Robots there give me the creeps.
0DI0006730	All right. Guess Vegas it is.
0DI0006731	Back to the gilded cage.
0DI0006732	Nice children shouldn't stay in places like that, dearie! That's the sort of place Leo likes! But if you insist....
0DI0006733	If this statement is being broadcast, I am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
0DI0006734	I, Robert Edwin House, am deceased. Please approach a Securitron and take one of the printed obituaries.
0DI0006735	Blow on the dice, baby. We're gonna need luck to get outta here alive.
0DI0006736	Step closer to the demonstration area, if you would...
0DI0006737	I expect you're well familiar with my Securitrons by now.
0DI0006738	The titanium alloy housing that protects its electronic core deflects small arms and shrapnel easily enough...
0DI0006739	Its X-25 gatling laser, produced to spec by Glastinghouse, Inc., is deadly  against soft targets at medium range...
0DI0006740	And for close-range suppression or crowd control, the Securitron is armed with a 9mm submachinegun.
0DI0006741	All of this, you probably already knew...
0DI0006742	What you did not know is that these are the Securitrons' secondary weapons.
0DI0006743	All this time, my Securitrons have had to get by running the Mark I operating system, which lacked software drivers for their primary weapons!
0DI0006744	Today, with the delivery of the Platinum Chip, all that changes. Behold, for the first time, Securitrons running the Mark II OS!
0DI0006745	The M-235 Missile Launcher gives the Securitron the ability to engage ground and air targets at significantly longer ranges...
0DI0006746	And a rapid-fire G-28 grenade launching system ensures the Securitron is deadly in close-range engagements.
0DI0006747	The software upgrade also includes drivers for the Securitrons' highly sophisticated onboard auto-repair systems.
0DI0006748	All together, the Mark II software upgrade confers a 235% increase in combat effectiveness per unit.
0DI0006749	The city of New Vegas finally has soldiers worthy of protecting it!
0DI0006750	Return to the penthouse now. We have much to discuss...
0DI0006754	Goodbye, thank you.
0DI0006755	Fuck, I was getting tired of this place anyways. I can find girls to play with somewhere else.
0DI0006756	I'm not sure I have anything I want to hear from you, but you can have your moment.
0DI0006757	Then get the fuck out of my face.
0DI0006758	Really? That two-faced son of a bitch. I'm glad now that we kept him mostly out of the loop. Look, we could use your help with some things.
0DI0006759	Especially with Cachino gone, we could use another pair of competent hands, and I think you can provide that.
0DI0006760	Precisely. You'll have no trouble joining the battle on their side, and they'll be too distracted to notice why you're really there.
0DI0006761	An opinion you expressed with supreme subtlety and finesse. Moving on...
0DI0006762	There's a job that needs doing here, and I'm assigning it to you.
0DI0006763	Marvellous work ethic, bravo.
0DI0006764	I much prefer working with robots...
0DI0006765	You'll have to be more specific.
0DI0006766	And how do you know this?
0DI0006767	I see. So where does that put us?
0DI0006768	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, I commend you for your initiative. What do you recommend for next steps?
0DI0006769	[FAILED]And you assisted them? That's what you mean to say, isn't it?
0DI0006770	Can't put the genie back in the bottle, is that it? Maybe you should've thought of that before you conspired to destroy my property.
0DI0006771	That said, I'd know nothing of the Omertas' plot if you'd kept it secret. Perhaps I owe you my gratitude, after all...
0DI0006772	The information you've provided will suffice. When the battle for Hoover Dam comes, I'll make sure my Securitrons are waiting for the Omertas.
0DI0006773	I suppose you're right... When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, my Securitrons will be waiting for the Omertas. They won't accomplish much.
0DI0006774	Exactly how many civilians did you want to die in that crossfire?
0DI0006775	Still, you raise a fair point. My Securitrons can handle this. When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, I'll be waiting for the Omertas.
0DI0006776	You're absolutely right. You must've had run-ins with them. As have I...
0DI0006777	From time to time, the NCR has assaulted Brotherhood bunkers. In four of the six incidents I know of, the bunkers self-destructed.
0DI0006778	I surmise it's standard practice for the Brotherhood to install a self-destruct system. It's consistent with their uncompromising nature.
0DI0006779	You might use that against them. Or kill them another way, it's up to you. Return when it's done.
0DI0006780	I can't use you. Had you shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we'd be in a different position.
0DI0006781	Oh no, not so quick. I still have work for you.
0DI0006782	Don't attack unless there are clear signs that Kimball's visit is imminent. Cause enough chaos to cancel the visit, no more. Then return to me.
0DI0006783	Not so eager to take on a suicide mission, is that it? If you'd shown moderation in your dealings with the NCR, we wouldn't be in this position.
0DI0006784	Whatever those reasons may be, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
0DI0006785	[SUCCEEDED] They knew you were coming? They were better prepared than I anticipated, then. I won't underestimate them again.
0DI0006786	Before that happens, I'd ask you to complete one final task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
0DI0006787	[FAILED] Whatever your reasons, you've jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
0DI0006788	You could've succeeded!
0DI0006789	With this accomplished, all preparations will have been made. The battle for Hoover Dam will be upon us before long.
0DI0006790	The strain of defending Las Vegas from annhilation exceeded my power systems' capacity. My primary reactor shut down.
0DI0006791	For years, I played a miser with my emergency power supply. I began to run out of reserves around the time I woke the first batch of Securitrons.
0DI0006792	Negotiating an allotment of power from Hoover Dam was crucial. That's what's powered the Strip for the past seven years.
0DI0006793	Come back when your work at the substation is done.
0DI0006794	I needed the operating software on the Platinum Chip to bring it back online.
0DI0006795	And to start the reactor itself requires a tremendous jolt of current. Very attention-getting.
0DI0006796	The NCR has its hands full now, of course. I doubt they'll raise much of a fuss.
0DI0006797	This is not a good time to be dependent on energy from Hoover Dam. When the Legion attacks, the NCR may cut power altogether.
0DI0006798	And I'll be needing a good deal more power than the NCR has allotted to the Strip.
0DI0006799	Broadcasting encrypted VMQ-boosted command signals to hundreds of Securitrons eats up more power than you might expect.
0DI0006800	Indeed they do - an army that'll be too distracted with killing Legionaries to notice the real reason you're there.
0DI0006801	Your objective is to reach a control room halfway across the dam and install an override module similar to the one you used at the Substation.
0DI0006802	The override will enable to control the entire dam's power output.
0DI0006803	You may remember how the bunker at the Fort was rather dimly lit? Well, just like the Lucky 38, it needs a big jolt of electricity to power up.
0DI0006804	You've already uploaded the new operating system to the Securitrons. All they need is power and they'll be in fighting trim.
0DI0006805	As I've said, your objective is to install an override module in the control room halfway across the dam. Are you ready perform this task?
0DI0006806	Indeed you will. Just bear in mind that's not the reason you're there.
0DI0006807	No cause for alarm - you'll have an escort of Securitrons to help you fight your way onto the dam.
0DI0006808	Yeah, that's right - good to say bye to you.
0DI0006809	Heck, I can smell trouble a mile away.
0DI0006810	Sure you can, friend, but everyone needs a hand from time to time. Maybe you'll return the favor one day.
0DI0006811	I wouldn't put it exactly like that, friend.
0DI0006812	See ya round, buckaroo.
0DI0006813	Well, happy trails, then!
0DI0006814	'Til our trails cross again, pardner.
0DI0006815	Heh, I like you, friend. Have I mentioned that?
0DI0006816	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west. The supply had stopped for awhile because of a Deathclaw problem.
0DI0006817	I heard some badass wastelander killed the Deathclaws, and deliveries of limestone have been coming in again.
0DI0006818	I don't think they've gotten the trains up and running yet, but most of the concrete plant workers have come back to town now. Good for business.
0DI0006819	Most of the limestone comes from Quarry Junction out west, but I hear some Deathclaws overran the quarry.
0DI0006820	With no work to be had, all the workers around here have wandered off. I'm the only one left in town.
0DI0006821	It's tough on both sides of the fence, really. I think women have it worse. They're like money, given as rewards. Breeding stock.
0DI0006822	Honestly, as long as men meet obligations and the child count, "friendships" are a sight more equal than the level of most Legion husbands and wives.
0DI0006823	Yeah, I lived through it. I like it here better.
0DI0006824	A pittance, sugar - and I'll leave you without a care in the world.
0DI0006825	Sorry, ma'am, but ain't enough caps in all of New Vegas to make me do that. Nuh-uh.
0DI0006826	Same price as before, sugar, and the same fun, too.
0DI0006827	I told you, I ain't ever doing that again - ever. It was like being a slave all over again.
0DI0006828	Oh, we will, sugar. We will.
0DI0006829	I'll do my best to live up to my last performance.
0DI0006830	You can play hard-to-get. I understand. I know the game.
0DI0006831	Oh honey, I know you're interested. I just don't go that way is all.
0DI0006832	No freebies, Sugar. Not even for you.
0DI0006834	Me and my partner Saint James work salvage around Westside, that's all.
0DI0006835	Because it's his name. He may be high-strung, but he's all right. Hauls his half of scrap, which is all I need.
0DI0006836	Don't believe everything you hear. Me and Saint James earn our caps working salvage.
0DI0006837	It's hard work, so when I'm not working I like to relax. Which means it's time for you to fuck off.
0DI0006838	Like I told you, we work salvage. We aren't coyotes. And like I told you, fuck off.
0DI0006839	Yep, for a few years now. Guess I should be calling it Casa Marco or something, but I haven't changed the signs.
0DI0006840	Folks who can't pay their way onto the Strip need a place to stay, too. And when Pretty Sarah set her whores up here, the Casa went full-service.
0DI0006841	Roughneck prospector is all I hear, good at what he does. Been renting a room here for a year or so - nothing special.
0DI0006842	Him? Caesar's Legion taught him everything he knows. I bet there's a pound of sand ground into his palms and knees!
0DI0006843	Knowing Jimmy, I'm sure he took good care of them. I'm surprised he ran away!
0DI0006844	Oh, I know everything - how she smells, how she tastes, how it feels to slip her on and wiggle.
0DI0006845	Damn fine woman, but damn expensive, too. Just ask Saint James - he spends near every cap he gets on Sweetie's sweets.
0DI0006846	Catch you later, then.
0DI0006847	Ain't so pretty, is she? Not since she had a run-in with those Fiends over near McCarran.
0DI0006848	This Fiend named Cook-Cook on account of the flamethrower he wears? He had his way with Sarah, every way it can be done.
0DI0006849	Then he starts frying her up for kicks. Guess it was how he signed his work.
0DI0006850	Like who?
0DI0006852	That's right. Strange at first, having a woman for a pimp, but she's tough enough to handle any trouble so far.
0DI0006853	She's a good earner. Of course, she don't care who she sleeps with or what they do to her.
0DI0006854	You know where to find me, honey.
0DI0006856	You won't notice anything once the lights are out, hon. The places that count are still firm enough...
0DI0006857	Well, don't just stand there. I ain't getting any younger.
0DI0006858	Well, I'm not a goddamn charity, so come back when you do.
0DI0006859	I'll be right here if you change your mind, honey. Just let me know.
0DI0006860	I suppose he's okay, for one of those. I suppose Pretty Sarah's got to cover every sort of customer.
0DI0006861	Those boys been living here a while now. They sell salvage and do all right. I never been with either of them.
0DI0006862	That Saint James is all over Sweetie every time he rustles up the caps to afford her. She says he's peculiar but who isn't?
0DI0006864	What do you even mean? He's Dermot.
0DI0006865	Dermot knows how to work salvage than any man I ever met. Doesn't go asking questions all day, neither.
0DI0006866	That's private. I don't go asking about how you like to get laid, and I don't wanna know. Enough of that.
0DI0006867	Get ready, honey. I'm going to make it good for you.
0DI0006868	Let me help you slip into something a little more comfortable.
0DI0006869	I am going to make your toes curl, baby.
0DI0006870	So get on the bed already. I got something to show you.
0DI0006871	You know you'll be back.
0DI0006872	Then I guess you won't be getting on me, either. Improve your prospects and come back, sugar. I'll be waiting.
0DI0006873	Keep telling yourself that, sugar. You'll be back.
0DI0006874	A client's got a right to privacy. So it'll cost 200 caps for me to tell you all about it.
0DI0006875	Like I said - 200 caps to hear all about it.
0DI0006876	[SUCCEEDED] Funny how I make caps every time I open my mouth.
0DI0006877	Saint James has problems, that's for sure. Never wants me to say a thing, or for me to move around, either.
0DI0006878	Lately he brings a teddy bear with him and props it on the bed like it's watching us. It's creepy as hell.
0DI0006879	Not the worst I ever been with, but more a pervert than most.
0DI0006880	[FAILED] I'll leave it. You can leave, too.
0DI0006884	Then I guess there's no need for us to keep talking, honey. Sorry.
0DI0006885	Fine by me. You the one missing out on exciting details.
0DI0006886	Sure do. Saint James is my number one customer. He's a prospector who pays Marco to stay here at the Casa week to week.
0DI0006887	I don't know why his friend Dermot chose to stay here - he's never been with me or nobody else. But Saint James likes having me close at hand.
0DI0006888	It ain't much to look at, but this dump has something that even the Strip doesn't, and that's absolute freedom.
0DI0006889	You go other places, and there's always someone screaming at you to act a certain way, or to not do certain things.
0DI0006890	Freeside's not like that. Everyone here is free to do whatever they want, and I for one wouldn't want it any other way.
0DI0006891	Not much to tell. We're a bunch of guys that just want to do our own thing, and anyone who's got a problem with that can shove it.
0DI0006892	I didn't join the Kings. I helped start the Kings. This whole operation you see here was put together by the King and yours truly.
0DI0006893	You're looking to get past those tin cans at the gate, right? They let people by all the time, if they've got the caps.
0DI0006894	But if you're not rich, and I can tell you ain't, the King might be able to help you out, provided he likes you.
0DI0006896	What about it? Someone takes your stuff, you're free to take it back. If you can't, maybe you shouldn't have come to Freeside in the first place.
0DI0006897	We do what we want, just like everybody else. We just have more guys, so other people tend to do what we want, too.
0DI0006898	If somebody does something we don't like, we let them know about it. If they're strong enough not to care about us liking it, good for them.
0DI0006899	Pfff, that's old news. I had some fun with that girl that runs their operation, and then I got tired of her. So I moved on.
0DI0006900	She don't like that, see? Normally, I bet she'd just have a guy killed for doing that, but as you can see, I'm still around.
0DI0006901	Most people think it's cause she doesn't want to start an all-out war with us, but that ain't it at all. She's still got it bad for me.
0DI0006902	Dangerous... I like that. Maybe it's time people starting being afraid of me rather than the other way around.
0DI0006903	Oh yeah, I wanted to tell you that I got some new info for you. Each tip's gonna cost 100 caps now though.
0DI0006904	Cause I got plans. Big plans. So what do you say? Want a tip?
0DI0006905	Unfortunately, it comes with the territory around here. But being afraid sucks, no doubt about it.
0DI0006906	Oh, hey, I almost forgot to tell you I heard a few things you might be interested in.
0DI0006907	I'm kind of sorry about this, but I'm going to have to up my price to 100 caps per tip from now on.
0DI0006908	It's getting tougher to discover new things that might interest a traveler such as yourself. I'm sure you understand. So, you interested or what?
0DI0006909	Yeah... yeah, that's a good idea. They'll learn that shouldn't have messed with me. Just wait till they get what's coming to them!
0DI0006910	You really think so, pal? I'll start looking into it. I bet I can help a lot of people around here.
0DI0006911	You're probably right. This place has been going downhill for a long time. Maybe I could start over somewhere else.
0DI0006912	Just think of it. A new life...
0DI0006913	Oh yeah, I heard some new things that you might find interesting. I'm going to have to start charging 100 caps per tip, though.
0DI0006914	After all, I have to save up for my ticket out of here, right?  So how about it? Want a tip?
0DI0006915	What? N-No, I knew you were just kidding. Ha ha. You're a funny one, all right.
0DI0006916	That's true, you seem to always be on the move and it seems to be working out for you pretty well.
0DI0006917	I've already got a decent amount saved up. If I keep it up, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to go start over somewhere else soon.
0DI0006918	That's a hell of a thing to say. Build up a man's hopes, then dash them in front of him.
0DI0006919	And who says I couldn't survive just as well as you out there? People are always underestimating me, damn.
0DI0006920	This place is a shithole, but yeah, it's home. I've lived here all my life. I'd be leaving a piece of myself behind if I left.
0DI0006921	There'd be things I'd miss - the fun of watching the Kings kick the crap out of a thief, or the look of joy on a child's face after catching a rat.
0DI0006922	Ah, now you've got me all nostalgic-like. Maybe I'd be better off trying to find a way to make this place better than giving up and leaving.
0DI0006923	You're a real piece of work, you know that?
0DI0006924	It's cool. I'm just a little touchy about people making fun of me, especially smoothskins. But you're not all bad. Take the Followers, for example.
0DI0006925	Why, just the other week, one of them offered me a job. Can you imagine? Me, with a real job?
0DI0006926	Can you imagine? Me? With a real job?
0DI0006927	Yeah, I bet you have. Not important enough for you to remember, huh?
0DI0006928	You said it. With these threads, people are finally going to start noticing me.
0DI0006929	Fuck you, human. We don't all share your wonderful complexion. Some of us have to make do, you know?
0DI0006930	Anyway, I was just going to tell you that I've come across some new tidbits you might find interesting.
0DI0006931	And since you're just about my favorite person in the world, each one is only going to cost you 100 caps. Interested?
0DI0006932	Yeesh, you're just all business, aren't you? Well, I like how I look, and that's what's important. Though it'd be nice if other people did too.
0DI0006933	I don't want to mention it out in plain sight like this. You never know who might be listening. Follow me.
0DI0006934	Well, don't wait too long. What I've got is something you'd need to act on, quick.
0DI0006935	Wow, I didn't think it would be this easy. I should have done this years ago. Guess I'll be going then.
0DI0006936	Oh, here's a final tip - don't ever follow anyone into a dark alley in Freeside. Later, chump.
0DI0006937	Man, I'm tired of scrounging for caps from ungrateful idiots like you. It's past time I moved on to bigger and better things.
0DI0006938	Now are you going to hand over your caps, or am I going to shoot you and take them anyway?
0DI0006940	You're welcome to try.
0DI0006941	Yeah. The man I'm more interested in is Corporal White.
0DI0006942	White had a lot of promise. Wanted to be a ranger as bad as anyone I've seen. But he also had some extracurricular activities going. Now he's gone.
0DI0006943	Sure, if you want to investigate. It's not like there's anything to steal up there. Just a bunch of old communications equipment.
0DI0006944	If you can find out any more, I'd be interested to hear it.
0DI0006945	There's something about this I really don't like, and if I weren't tied up here I'd be staking it out personally.
0DI0006946	Better believe it. Everybody, everybody in Caesar's Legion from Caesar on down will kill themselves before they can be captured.
0DI0006947	They're so twitchy they'd probably do it if you reached out to hug them.
0DI0006948	But here's this guy who's an elite commander in their army and he just gives himself up, even as his men are slitting their own throats around him.
0DI0006949	Well, I don't know about you, but to me that sounds like a man who's willing to cooperate. Except he hasn't.
0DI0006950	Only times he speaks up are to insult you. He's a real prick, by the way. And I'm supposed to get information out of this guy.
0DI0006951	I think if you rough him up enough and really put some fear into him, he'll sing like a choir boy.
0DI0006952	So let's do this. When you're ready, I'll go in and give you a little intro. Then I leave the room and you make him regret the day he was born.
0DI0006953	We go back and forth a couple of times until either he talks or he can't move his jaw anymore. Either way we've had our entertainment for the day.
0DI0006954	Time was essential for my mission, but we waited three days for him to dispatch us. Another of his headaches. Does that sound like a man in command?
0DI0006955	He has an operative planted in this very base, but does he use his agent to rescue me? No.
0DI0006956	He's content to have the agent spend his nights radioing troop positions back to our base camp. He knows I'm here, and he's left me to rot.
0DI0006957	I haven't breathed a word about the officer we planted here - he continues to radio intelligence to Caesar's camp nearly every night.
0DI0006958	I've proven my loyalty. All you're doing is killing a loyal soldier. If that's Caesar's policy, then I say his empire will crumble.
0DI0006959	What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
0DI0006960	Then he's a fool!
0DI0006961	I knew you'd be reasonable. Now... how did you find me? Did the officer send you?
0DI0006962	No! Stay away from me!
0DI0006963	D-d-damn right.
0DI0006965	We're at your service, if you need us. Until Driver Nephi is dead. Major's orders.
0DI0006966	Oh my God, are you okay? You've gotta get to a medic. Doc Kemp can patch you up back at base.
0DI0006967	How could you just sacrifice your body like that? You never even met him. If the NCR doesn't have a medal for this, they should make one up.
0DI0006968	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, man? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
0DI0006969	I don't believe it. Who the hell are you, lady? How did you just walk right up and pull him out of there?
0DI0006970	Bullshit. What anybody else would've done is get their asses killed. You're leading some kind of charmed life.
0DI0006971	We'll make sure Ranger Morales' body gets sent back home. You don't have to, you know, pick him up on your shoulder and haul him to California.
0DI0006972	Even though I believe you would if you had to. You should go tell Private Morales the news. I know she'll be relieved.
0DI0006973	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a woman possessed.
0DI0006974	That must be some kind of code of honor you hold yourself to. You're like a man possessed.
0DI0006975	Yeah, well, it looks like it might be too late for the Fiends. But we got the message loud and clear.
0DI0006976	The Gun Runners are almost straight north of here. A little east. Isaac has a house in their compound.
0DI0006977	Yeah. It means you don't get shot.
0DI0006978	The Crimson Caravan is up north past the Gun Runners. During the day Blake is usually in their main office.
0DI0006979	Pawn shop in Westside called Miguel's. It's in outer Vegas, northwest of the Strip.
0DI0006980	You mean other than some stranger with no military ID interrogating me inside our base?
0DI0006981	Did Boyd put you up to this? I am so sick of this harassment. You tell her to stop wasting my time with this bullshit.
0DI0006982	No. I haven't seen anything suspicious. It's been business as usual.
0DI0006984	Most people already know we run this territory, and are usually in a hurry to get out. Not this guy. It's like he wants us to come get him.
0DI0006985	Not "ha ha" funny, you moron. Funny as in suspicious. He's not trying to run away like most people.
0DI0006986	I know the NCR has troops near Primm, so talk to the locals and find out if any of those troops are going to be coming our way.
0DI0006987	Why do you care? Answer: you shouldn't. I don't feel like trading life stories.
0DI0006988	It was all Cooke's idea. He and his boys managed to swipe some dynamite and hide it away in their cells.
0DI0006989	The rest of us just tagged along. Cooke's crew headed north while the rest of us stuck around for payback.
0DI0006990	The NCR called it a "work-release" prison. We lucky prisoners got the privilege of fixing up the rail lines and blasting rock for new lines.
0DI0006991	They got sloppy, though. Some of us managed to hide away some dynamite, and look who's in charge now.
0DI0006992	He and his crew went north. I heard talk about some sort of "big plan" to get back at the NCR, but haven't seen them since.
0DI0006993	One mean son of a bitch. Really, truly hates the NCR for some reason, and he got a lot of the other guys around to his way of thinking.
0DI0006995	I was an NCR medic for six months, so I'm not exactly a "doctor." Still, it's more medical training that any of the other guys here.
0DI0006996	It also gives me an excuse to stay out of any raiding parties. The gang can't lose its only doctor now, can it?
0DI0006997	Medical supplies go for a decent amount of caps in the right markets. I figured the quartermaster wouldn't notice any missing. I was wrong.
0DI0006998	Let's see... I've been a farmhand, a bouncer, a bandit, and an NCR trooper. I don't recommend any of them.
0DI0006999	The location to the highway makes it a good spot to shake down any travelers passing through. That's why Eddie and the rest are still around.
0DI0007000	Me, I like having big walls between myself and the wasteland.
0DI0007001	One night, there was a big explosion from the other cell block. I had no idea what was going on, so I took cover in my bunk.
0DI0007002	When it was all over, the guards were dead and we were free. Most of the other prisoners scattered, but a few of us stuck around, obviously.
0DI0007003	I was a sheriff, believe it or not, for a small town far to the west of here.
0DI0007004	The short version is that sometimes justice is a little slow, and I helped speed it up one too many times.
0DI0007005	I'm not sorry for anything I did, but I will do the time. Fair enough trade, if you ask me.
0DI0007006	I understand that Cooke was behind it all. I kept my head down the whole time. Didn't want any part of it.
0DI0007007	I stuck around, figuring the NCR would show up and put things back the way they were. No sense in making myself look guilty, right?
0DI0007009	Some kind of anti-NCR rebel. Some people just don't like being pushed around and told what to do.
0DI0007010	He went north with some of the other guys. Didn't say where, didn't say why. All I know is he's got some kind of score to settle with the NCR.
0DI0007011	I'm not quite sure the kind of greeting NCR troopers will give an escaped con like myself. Figure it's better to stay put for now.
0DI0007012	Right now, Eddie and his boys run the place. They've got the guns and the dynamite, so they call the shots.
0DI0007013	Do you mean that he's a goner? I can have my Vault back?
0DI0007014	That's just super! I thought we'd never see a different New Vegas, one that belongs to the people.
0DI0007015	Let's proceed.
0DI0007016	Inform me when you are ready to go.
0DI0007017	All right, forget about blaming Crenshaw. Just bomb the monorail.
0DI0007018	Without a fall guy, it's dangerous for us to be seen together. We shouldn't speak again.
0DI0007019	If you believe in the Legion's cause, your mission is a reward in and of itself. Good luck.
0DI0007020	You want my advice, start by talking to people with a lot of eyes in the field. People like Lieutenant Boyd, or Sergeant Contreras, maybe.
0DI0007021	Careful with Contreras, though. He's not above suspicion himself.
0DI0007022	Keep me apprised of any leads you get. This guy's gotten a lot of my men killed. I'm just itching to return the favor.
0DI0007023	Put the bomb in one of the vents inside the train on the back wall, towards the joint that connects the cars.  Arm it, and get out of there.
0DI0007024	I've also left some bomb ingredients in with the explosives. You are to take those to the footlocker of a Private Crenshaw.
0DI0007025	Crenshaw's a problem child. Lots of run-ins with his superiors. It'll be easy for them to believe he's working for the Legion.
0DI0007026	Report him to Colonel Hsu. Do all that and we should be free and clear.
0DI0007027	Oh, and Crenshaw should be dead before you report him. Don't leave any chance for him to deny the bombings. Let's say he pulled a gun on you.
0DI0007028	I've got him on guard duty patrolling the tarmac just inside the south gate. And I reassigned the other guard, so he should be alone.
0DI0007029	His footlocker is in the barracks in the main concourse.
0DI0007031	Ah, that. I'm surprised he didn't send you to Colonel Moore. That'd be her jurisdiction.
0DI0007032	I've already received a communique from Colonel Moore saying that she's sent a squad down to Freeside.
0DI0007033	If you'd come to me first, I might have been able to do something. But at this point, my hands are tied. Sorry.
0DI0007034	Because he's looking to avoid a bloodbath. I get it. He knows me.
0DI0007035	All right. Moore's not gonna like it. But that's for Crocker to worry about.
0DI0007036	Go to the leader of the Kings and tell him that I'll make sure Freeside gets more water, power, and food as long as the violence there stops.
0DI0007037	Well, I do get to make the calls on the distribution of supplies there.
0DI0007038	Crocker was probably counting on me being able to offer the Kings a carrot. And that's what I'm inclined to do.
0DI0007039	Moore's got her hands full right now, and she's not a subtle person in the best of times. Her solution would be quick and dirty.
0DI0007040	I agree with Crocker that a more peaceful solution is preferable, especially for the long term.
0DI0007041	Yeah. On top of everything else, I can't send a patrol on a bathroom break without it being ambushed by someone who heard they were coming.
0DI0007042	So somebody's getting the word out.
0DI0007043	Now we're trying to secure the Strip and the Dam at the same time, and it's costing us.
0DI0007044	And in the meantime General Oliver won't approve any offensive maneuvers because he doesn't want to risk losing our positions.
0DI0007045	So we're in a holding pattern here. And Caesar's on the other side of the river, planning.
0DI0007046	It's our main base. We took it because it lets us keep an eye on the Strip. And it had already been fortified before the Great War.
0DI0007047	From here we handle most of the logistics for our operations in Nevada. Troop allocation, supply distribution, intel.
0DI0007048	Usually General Oliver runs the show here, but he's on his way to the Dam now, so I've taken on a lot of his duties here.
0DI0007049	Unfortunately, no. In fact, the word from the Ranger stations has been especially concerning lately.
0DI0007050	It sounds like they've run into overwhelming resistance, and supplies just aren't reaching them.
0DI0007051	It's been so bad I asked Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope to look into it and see how it is that things could be so fouled up there.
0DI0007052	Everything was going according to President Kimball's plan at first. We met minor resistance from local troublemakers.
0DI0007053	But our two main objectives are still contested. Mr. House controls the Strip and he won't so much as meet with our ambassador.
0DI0007054	And we're holding Hoover Dam, but Caesar's Legion is positioning itself to overrun it. If it falls, so will New Vegas. We'd be forced to withdraw.
0DI0007055	Holy Christ. Get- get away from me!
0DI0007056	Hell, it's all dangerous. Know why? Because you can't trust anything that stands on two legs.
0DI0007057	If you're looking for the real trouble, head straight into the mountains. Men don't walk up there, for good reasons, kid.
0DI0007059	This is bullshit! Why are we even talking about dealing with these guys?
0DI0007060	Pace, this isn't really a good time to have this discussion...
0DI0007061	Wrong. This is exactly the right time. I'm about to prevent you from making a huge mistake.
0DI0007062	Pace, don't do this. I won't stand with you if you do.
0DI0007063	Then I'll stand on my own, just like I always have. Just like a King should.
0DI0007064	Okay, I need some answers, now. These guys just barged in here and said they were under orders to keep me here until you arrived.
0DI0007065	I'm about five seconds away from telling my men to take them down, so speak fast.
0DI0007066	Maybe you can tell me what the hell is going on here. These stony face bastards haven't said a word other than to say they're here under orders.
0DI0007067	Guess he wants to do this the hard way, boys. Take him down.
0DI0007068	An ultimatum? Do you even know who you're talking to? We're the Kings, and no King will ever accept an ultimatum.
0DI0007069	Go back to your general or commodore or whatever-the-fuck and tell them to shove their ultimatum where the sun don't shine.
0DI0007070	You know, it's that "or else" part that gets stuck in my craw. It just sounds a little too much like you're trying to tell us what to do.
0DI0007071	And nobody tells the Kings what to do. So why don't you and all of your little friends get the hell out of here. Or else.
0DI0007072	Well, Freeside citizens are also being attacked and I'd like you all to stop it, but I'm guessing that's not going to happen, is it?
0DI0007073	This little show of force accomplishes nothing. So take your toy soldiers and go home. Show's over.
0DI0007074	That sounds fair. And all I have to do is try to tone down the attacks on the Squatters, you say?
0DI0007075	And I suppose they want me to help see that happen? That seems pretty reasonable.
0DI0007076	Sounds like a challenge. Boys, let's do this!
0DI0007077	It's a beastly place. Poverty is rampant, and all that goes with it - drugs, alcohol abuse, the usual.
0DI0007078	Violence is something of a way of life there, but there's been a disturbing rise in the number of attacks on our people lately.
0DI0007079	More worrying is the fact that our sources suggest the violence is being perpetrated by the gang that runs the place, the Kings.
0DI0007080	I need someone to look into this that won't attract attention. Would you be interested?
0DI0007081	Aw, sugar, why'd you have to go make Mr. House mad? Now we've got to get all messy shooting you to little bits.
0DI0007082	Why, sugar, he's the maximum utmost! If it weren't for Mr. House, we wouldn't have this fabulous wonderland of New Vegas, would we?
0DI0007083	This is the Lucky 38 Resort and Casino - or, it used to be. Mr. House has kept the place locked up tight for ages now, nobody comes in or out.
0DI0007084	Why I'm a RobCo PDQ-88b Mk I Securitron, you silly goose! We're the finest in personal or civil robotic security on the market!
0DI0007085	How sweet of you to notice, sugar! I've been upgraded to the Mark II software, and it's peachy having these high-explosive weapons fully accessible!
0DI0007086	Not many people know this, but Mr. House is one of the world's biggest collectors of antique snow globes!
0DI0007087	If you happen to find any out in the Wasteland, you can bring them to me and I'll add them to his collection! You'll get a reward, of course.
0DI0007088	In fact, one of Mr. House's favorites went missing when we moved the collection. If you have a look around the Lucky 38, you might even find it!
0DI0007089	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take it and put it with the rest of the collection.
0DI0007090	You do? Why, that's just wonderful! I'll take them and put them with the rest of the collection.
0DI0007091	Oh, there's lots of things to tell, I'm sure. There's the Three Families, the casinos, the other attractions - what would you like to know?
0DI0007092	You make an excellent point. I never liked that Cachino fuck anyway. Here you go.
0DI0007093	With those skinny little arms? Not before the bouncer put two in the back of your head. Now stop being stupid.
0DI0007096	Well, of course I am, silly! Mr. House is just the smartest, most wonderful man there ever was!
0DI0007097	Why, did you know he single-handedly reclaimed New Vegas from all those nasty tribes that used to live here?
0DI0007098	Well, he single-handedly sent in his Securitrons to do it, but that counts in my book.
0DI0007099	Sugar, I may be a robot on the outside, but on the inside, my neuro-computational matrix is an exact copy of Mr. House's favorite girl.
0DI0007100	Anything you like, sugar.
0DI0007101	Mr. House has a lot of needs, sugar. I take care of all of them, and a lady doesn't kiss and tell.
0DI0007102	Then maybe you shouldn't pry into a lady's particulars, hmm?
0DI0007103	They're just new money, sugar. They might pretend they're sophisticated, but between you and me, they're not far off from tribals.
0DI0007104	The Omertas especially are just awful brutes. The Chairmen and the White Glove Society at least pretend to have some culture.
0DI0007105	Well, of course there used to be a lot more of them, but these days there are three open to the public: The Tops, the Ultra-Luxe, and Gomorrah.
0DI0007106	And the Lucky 38 of course, but we're not open to the public. You're a special case, sugar.
0DI0007107	Well, let's see: the NCR has an embassy here, but why you'd want to go talk to a bunch of boring old politicians I surely don't know.
0DI0007108	Oh, and the Vault 21 Hotel and Gift Shop has an adorable collection of old Vault-Tec memorabilia.
0DI0007109	And I suppose if you like neon signs, you might check out Michael Angelo's sign shop.
0DI0007110	Hey, listen, I'd love to sell you some more info, but you've tapped everything I've heard lately.
0DI0007111	Come back in a few days. I'll put my ear to the ground and hopefully have heard a few more things by then.
0DI0007112	What do ya say, want another tip?
0DI0007113	I got more where that came from. Want another?
0DI0007114	That one was pretty good, right? How about another?
0DI0007115	I've heard here and there that the word "Hope" has recently become quite popular with the Squatters.
0DI0007116	But that's all I've heard. If I knew more, I'd try to bilk you out of more caps. You interested in one of my other tips?
0DI0007117	Exactly what I was thinking. It's nice to have a little style, you know?
0DI0007118	But you're probably here for more of my special commodity, and luckily for you, I haven't been idle since last we spoke.
0DI0007119	However, all that hard work on my part means that the price has gone up. 100 a tip, now. You game?
0DI0007120	Oh yeah, what would you have gotten?
0DI0007121	Yeah, it does look pretty sweet, doesn't i- hey, screw you! Who asked you anyway? The crap I put up with...
0DI0007122	Yeah... that's a good idea... no sense making money and waiting for someone to just come and take it, right?
0DI0007123	Hmmm... you're a long-term thinker, man. I like that. You might be on to something there.
0DI0007124	...Really? Wow, it never occurred to me to actually give the money away. Do people really do things like that?
0DI0007125	Of course, after all you did for me, here are some chips for you. Play, have some fun.
0DI0007126	You play some games, have some fun. You did right by us.
0DI0007127	Real subtle. Here you go. Play some games. Have some fun.
0DI0007128	I'm not afraid of a gunfight, but I'd rather get back to Red Rock without a few extra holes in me if I can help it.
0DI0007129	You and me at Gomorrah, rolled up in those silk sheets. I got leave coming up in a bit, so let me know if you'll be around.
0DI0007131	All right, you can go on in. Can't guarantee your safety, though. Just saying.
0DI0007132	Quit wasting my time.
0DI0007133	Wow, you sound awesome.
0DI0007134	That is a neat idea. I'll be the spotter. I'll find someone to play the target.
0DI0007135	Ooo, you know a lot about dinosaurs.
0DI0007136	You bet I will, I'm almost old enough to fly in the VR sims. That'll be awesome!
0DI0007137	Very well traveller. You may pass.
0DI0007138	You better believe it. I'll knock your block off!
0DI0007139	Yes! It has been a long time since La Fantoma had a good sidekick!
0DI0007140	I've been around dogs all my life. They're my life, always were - all the way back when I was a tribal, one of the Hangdogs, outside Denver.
0DI0007141	Dogs roamed that city. Our tribe made peace with them. Thought they were our spirit animals - helped us hunt, provided for us in some lean times.
0DI0007142	Then the Legion came. Good thing, too. Stronger now, don't need those beliefs anymore.
0DI0007143	When the Legion showed up, we fought, most tribes did. Hangdogs hung out longer than most... broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
0DI0007144	So we gave up, our elders couldn't bear the idea of our spirit animals burning in the afterlife.
0DI0007145	Still, Caesar was impressed enough to conscript us, use our skills with dogs to join the Legion as houndmasters.
0DI0007146	Be seeing you around.
0DI0007148	Antony said he was punishing me for trying to hide it from the Legion.
0DI0007150	Seek Caesar by way of Cottonwood Cove, south of Nelson. The Cursor Lucullus will be waiting.
0DI0007151	We are soldiers of a different stripe, capable in battle, but skilled as infiltrators and agents as well.
0DI0007152	You're kicking me into gear, huh? I think I'll drive my chassis over to your pad. Wait for me down there, and don't forget the oil.
0DI0007153	Carlitos, huh? Yeah, I do. Try the diner, but don't start any trouble, you hear?
0DI0007154	Mitch!? You know "mole-butt?"
0DI0007155	I hadn't thought about that name in a long time. I was just a child, and he had a big mole in his rear bumper.
0DI0007156	You understand, kids and all that. Everyone knows about each other in a Vault, there's no other way. I hope mol... I mean Mitch, is doing well!
0DI0007157	Vault 21's previous manager is no longer capable of servicing your needs. Hotel arrangement functions are now purview of Mr. House.
0DI0007158	Observe the rules, citizen.
0DI0007159	Proceed to your accomodations. Please, enjoy your stay at Vault 21.
0DI0007160	Vault 21 hopes to service your needs in the future. Goodbye.
0DI0007161	You mean, Mitch? It's been ages since I've heard the name. My sister and I used to call him "Mole-butt." Don't ask.
0DI0007162	That was a long time ago, before we exchanged the warmth of our home for the thin air of the Wasteland.
0DI0007163	I'm not one for running a business. Never really had a head for numbers or smooth-talk. My talents are a little more... direct.
0DI0007164	Mama always said that was my gift. When we were kids, the others used to fight over and steal one another's toys. I always broke mine.
0DI0007165	And if any of the others messed with me, I broke theirs too. Sometimes I'd break them even if they were nice to me, just to show them what's what.
0DI0007166	One day mama took me aside and said, "Boy, you're never going to go very far, but you're going to make a whole lotta people come up short."
0DI0007167	Make it quick. I got shit to do.
0DI0007168	Glory? Glory's fucking crazy.
0DI0007169	Some of my siblings are real pieces of work, but I'd bet on Glory if she were facing down a deathclaw with a plastic spoon.
0DI0007170	She's got the smarts to do whatever she wants, but she and momma are always butting heads, so she gets all the shit jobs.
0DI0007171	Where else?
0DI0007172	Nah, I'm gonna chill with my girl.
0DI0007173	Can't. The King's got me busy on something.
0DI0007174	Thanks for getting me outta that cage! Now for once will you just lay down and stay down?
0DI0007175	No one rules Vegas except me, got it? You're a lowdown gofer! You deliver mail!
0DI0007176	How ya like being Mister Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
0DI0007177	How ya like being Miss Good-Two-Shoes, hey? How's it feeling?
0DI0007178	Sweet to offer, baby, but if you cut these ropes every Legionary in this camp's gonna come running. With machetes.
0DI0007179	Now on the other hand, if I had a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin, I could see myself out. Know what I mean?
0DI0007180	I know I been bad, but it's cruel to jerk me around like this...
0DI0007181	Like I said, baby, all Benny needs is a Stealth Boy and a Bobby Pin.
0DI0007182	Baby... your generosity and spirit of forgiveness? Off the charts.
0DI0007183	This little care package is everything I need. I'll take it from here.
0DI0007184	Baby, if you show me the door to scramsville, that's where I'll go - out of your hair, never to return.
0DI0007185	I been a fink to you, caused more than my share of grief by a hard mile. Let me go, you won't see me again.
0DI0007186	No one likes a tease, baby.
0DI0007187	Then stop bringing it up!
0DI0007188	Check's in the mail, hey? Don't get my hopes up.
0DI0007189	Yeah? What about it?
0DI0007190	Yeah, we talked about it, but that went a big fat nowhere.
0DI0007191	It's too late for that, baby. This decision you gotta make is going down now. So what's it gonna be?
0DI0007192	What am I gonna say? "No thanks?"
0DI0007193	If you can get these ropes off, I'll do my best to take down my share of the guards.
0DI0007194	Ring-a-ding-ding, baby. I've got your back.
0DI0007195	You fink! Murdering me like this, down on my knees?
0DI0007196	That's it, baby! Time to vacate these premises!
0DI0007197	Baby, you can't just leave me tied up! Those Legion boys'll hoist me up on a cross for the mess you made - if I'm lucky!
0DI0007198	Baby, that can go any direction you want. We can take Vegas together, or I can head for the nearest sunset. Your call.
0DI0007199	Thanks for nothing, you fink!
0DI0007200	What ya talking about? I been ready!
0DI0007201	That's it, baby! Show these punks what you got!
0DI0007202	Groovy, baby! Plant these losers in the ground!
0DI0007203	That's it - sock it to the Legion, baby!
0DI0007204	Keep it up! Show these finks what's what!
0DI0007205	They got nothing on you, baby! Keep it up!
0DI0007206	Yeah! Give these Praetorian bums the big send-off, baby!
0DI0007207	I sure do, but loose lips sink ships.
0DI0007208	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you look pretty trustworthy.
0DI0007209	[FAILED] Sorry, but the Omertas don't look very kindly upon gossiping.
0DI0007210	I... well, since you ask so nicely, and I'm not sure I could resist those pretty eyes. What do you want to know?
0DI0007211	I've heard some pretty shady rumors about the Ultra Luxe.
0DI0007212	I'm not sure what the deal is, but although they try to put on airs, that place is just plain creepy. Maybe it's the masks.
0DI0007213	Not much of a rumor, but I hear the Tops is always looking for new talent. Lord knows they've needed it for a long time.
0DI0007214	I'm not sure what's going on at Lucky 38. That place is weird. Nobody ever goes in. Nobody ever comes out.
0DI0007215	I hear you've actually been inside Lucky 38? You're the first person who's been in there in as long as anybody can remember.
0DI0007216	It's hard to believe that not too long ago most of the families on the Strip were little more than warring tribes.
0DI0007217	The Omertas even had a big war with the Khans, once upon a time.
0DI0007218	Sorry, that's all the news worth talking about. All I have at least.
0DI0007219	Gossip is one thing, dirt on the Family is something else totally.
0DI0007220	I knew someone would call in that mark soon. What do you want to know?
0DI0007221	That was one of my sisters, but my family always repays our debts. What do you want to know?
0DI0007222	Depends on who you're looking for.
0DI0007223	Cachino is usually on this floor in Brimstone, having drinks. If he isn't there then he's probably in his room upstairs.
0DI0007224	Troike spends all his days down in Zoara on the lower level.
0DI0007225	Troike is dead, but I'm sure you know that.
0DI0007226	Yeah. I know him. You'll probably find him in his room upstairs. He usually just sends down for girls or food.
0DI0007227	I knew someone named Clanden. Good fucking riddance.
0DI0007228	Big Sal and Nero split their time in Zoara overlooking the main casino floor from the balcony. No one but Family is allowed up there, though.
0DI0007229	All I can tell you is to find Cachino. He's the lowest level Lieutenant you're going to be able to talk to.
0DI0007230	Some of the girls say he's been involved in some shady business the Family wouldn't really like. Ask him about it.
0DI0007231	Sorry, they don't tell me their plans and I don't want to know. I'm just happy they don't make me fuck anybody anymore.
0DI0007232	Fire away.
0DI0007233	Enjoy yourself.
0DI0007235	And here I thought us Great Khans were tough to kill. So, what happens now?
0DI0007236	Yeah... about that...
0DI0007237	Yeah? On what?
0DI0007238	He's one of the Chairmen, big shots who run The Tops casino in New Vegas. A friend from the city contacted me with info on a big job.
0DI0007239	I should've known that the caps were too good to be true, but there was still no way I could pass up the chance.
0DI0007241	And face NCR "justice?" No thanks. I'd rather not spend the next ten years doing hard labor.
0DI0007242	Just a big, fancy poker chip as far as I know. Don't know why anyone would make one out of platinum, though.
0DI0007243	We'd try to bribe our way out, but seeing as how Benny didn't pay us yet, that won't happen.
0DI0007244	He's a snake, that's why. He owed us the rest of the pay for the job, so maybe he didn't want to pay up.
0DI0007245	[SUCCEEDED] I can't believe I'm doing this, but all right, the hostages can go. The NCR had better keep their end of the deal, though.
0DI0007247	[FAILED] Right, and they'd probably give us all medals, too. Maybe I should kill a hostage because you wasted my time with this shit.
0DI0007248	All right, quit fucking around. You survived and you tracked us down. What now?
0DI0007249	You mean... just let them go? How would I explain this to my superiors?
0DI0007250	I've been thinking about it since you brought it up earlier. 500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
0DI0007251	500 caps would go a long way for some soldier's families.
0DI0007253	This doesn't feel quite right, but it resolves things and gets my troopers back in one piece.
0DI0007255	[SUCCEEDED] That makes sense, and it's still more than these troopers see in a month.
0DI0007256	[FAILED] You're asking me to accept a bribe. I'd like to make sure the risk to my career - and freedom - benefits the families of my troops.
0DI0007258	500 caps was the amount requested.
0DI0007259	We agreed on 400 caps.
0DI0007260	You're right. The Great Khans are free to go.
0DI0007261	I don't like it, but orders are orders.
0DI0007262	Ah, excellent. I received word you may be coming. We helped the receptionist over at Gomorrah with some thugs that were taking advantage of her.
0DI0007263	She owes us a favor. Go talk to her, she'll be able to point you in the right direction.
0DI0007265	Ranger Station Alpha. Ranger Lineholm is in command here.
0DI0007266	I'm not really much of a historian. The short version is that the Rangers are the elite of the NCR military. Best fighters in the wasteland.
0DI0007267	For about ten years now. Toughest training I've ever done, and was the proudest day of my life when I got my Ranger badge.
0DI0007268	Did you know that the first battle at Hoover Dam was won because of the Rangers? Legion had the numbers, but we had the skill.
0DI0007270	Couple dozen, I'd say, most of them posted at stations like this one. We either man the station or patrol the immediate area.
0DI0007271	The Rangers mostly draw from the basic NCR army. A trooper who shows exceptional skill at fighting and scouting can be nominated for the training.
0DI0007273	Forgive my challenge. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
0DI0007274	Ah - you must be the courier who's been of service to us lately. I'll take you to my Decanus at once.
0DI0007275	<Brothers! Attack!>
0DI0007276	Brothers! Attack!
0DI0007277	Brothers, help!
0DI0007278	The Legion will decide that, Profligate, not you. Will you go before my Decanus for judgement, or be killed where you stand?
0DI0007279	Follow me. Make any trouble, and you'll wind up on a cross - if you're lucky.
0DI0007280	My commander, you ignorant degenerate! Now, will you go before Dead Sea?
0DI0007282	Let's be straight, baby: there's lucky and there's *too* lucky. You keep up like this and you're gonna break the bank.
0DI0007283	Now, we're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
0DI0007284	Smart move, kid. We're happy to have you come on in and spend some dough at the bar, take in a show, whatever - but you're cut off from the games.
0DI0007285	Fine, then, you want to play rough? We'll play rough!
0DI0007286	Jesus Christ!
0DI0007287	You're free to enjoy the shows and the bar, but no more games for you at The Tops. Thanks for playing.
0DI0007288	You've taken us for a ride, and we want you out.
0DI0007289	All right, come back any time.
0DI0007290	Have you ever heard the story of the bomber that crashed into the lake before the War? Supposedly it's mostly intact, even after all that time.
0DI0007291	I'm in charge of the radio - hence the title "Comm Officer." I'd much rather be out on patrol, since nothing much happens around here.
0DI0007292	Mission accomplished, asshole. I never would've suspected a thing if you hadn't told me - but now I'll have to have you killed.
0DI0007293	And you fell for that? Really? Because I'm going to have you killed now.
0DI0007294	You do know why I wanted to meet you, right?
0DI0007295	A man nearly kills you, so you track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
0DI0007296	You arrive on the Strip and waltz into the Lucky 38 like someone left you a key under the doormat?
0DI0007297	You assassinate the head of the Chairmen in his own casino - and get away with it?
0DI0007298	You visit the Tops, and next thing you know, the head of the Chairmen is fleeing the Strip like a whimpering little pup?
0DI0007299	Then something happens to Mr. House's robots - some kind of military upgrade?
0DI0007300	But the topper, the coup de grace? Mr. House dies - while you're visiting him at the Lucky 38.
0DI0007301	When you set your mind to something, you get results. I like that.
0DI0007302	...Relax. I'm fucking with you.
0DI0007303	We'll deal with Benny when the time comes. In the meantime...
0DI0007304	We'll talk about the Platinum Chip when the time comes. In the meantime...
0DI0007305	Maybe I should have you struck blind so my face is the last sight you ever behold. Look...
0DI0007306	Praetorians, to arms!
0DI0007307	Praetorians, to me!
0DI0007308	Vulpes Inculta, the best of my frumentarii, is dead.
0DI0007309	All the bribes I sent to the Omertas ended up buying me nothing.
0DI0007310	The Great Khans aren't exactly clamoring to fight for my Legion now.
0DI0007311	The garrison I established at Nelson has been wiped out.
0DI0007312	Years of meticulous scheming to place a mole at Camp McCarran - wasted.
0DI0007313	The Kings of Freeside are cooperating with the NCR now, which frees up soldiers to defend the dam.
0DI0007314	You even disrupted a promising weapons deal with the Van Graffs.
0DI0007315	Is it any wonder my Legion has so little love for you?
0DI0007316	So tell me this, because I really want to know. I am feared - with good reason.
0DI0007317	But you - of all people - dare to come here and stand before me, the mighty Caesar. What were you thinking?
0DI0007318	You spread word of the massacre of Nipton, just like Vulpes asked you.
0DI0007319	Beams of light shot down from the sky over HELIOS One, killing who knows how many Profligate troops.
0DI0007320	Silus, the Centurion who let himself get captured, died at McCarran before he could reveal sensitive information.
0DI0007321	You freed the Centurion Silus from McCarran so that he might be punished for his cowardice.
0DI0007322	The monorail that the Profligates rode from McCarran to the Strip has been destroyed.
0DI0007323	You turned Camp Forlorn Hope into a mass grave.
0DI0007324	Chief Hanlon, a nemesis of my Legion, died the humiliating death he deserved.
0DI0007325	In Boulder City, you let the renegade Khans go free, but left NCR troopers gurgling on the ground, drowning in their own blood.
0DI0007326	A number of NCR Ranger stations have been wiped off the face of the Mojave, thanks to you.
0DI0007327	The Profligates still hate me more than they hate you, I think, but I've been at this longer than you have.
0DI0007328	I get it. We share a common enemy. And now you come before the mighty Caesar to what - offer your services?
0DI0007329	I have eyes and ears everywhere. It behooves me not to invade the west blind and deaf.
0DI0007330	It hasn't been hard to track your progress. It's not as though you've been keeping a low profile.
0DI0007331	Benny's theory, if I understood it through all the screaming, was that Mr. House stashed some kind of ultimate weapon down there.
0DI0007332	A gigantic robot to stomp us all to death, who cares? Whatever it is, House built it, so I want it destroyed.
0DI0007333	I don't know. And I don't like not knowing.
0DI0007334	I know Mr. House built it. I'm thinking it's probably some kind of weapon that he can't activate from a distance.
0DI0007335	I like the servile attitude. Keep it up.
0DI0007336	The time is fast approaching when my Legion will assault the great dam and invade the west.
0DI0007337	Before that happens, I want Mr. House knocked out of the game, a quick one-two punch - with you doing the punching.
0DI0007338	Before that happens, I want Mr. House erased from the picture. Not just the man you killed, but what he left behind. His legacy.
0DI0007339	Yes. But then I'd have to kill them.
0DI0007340	I wouldn't trust Benny to lick my boots clean. This one falls to you.
0DI0007341	You don't get it, do you? The weapons I wield are forged from blood, flesh, sinew, bone - mortal stuff. Fragile, even.
0DI0007342	And yet my Legion obeys me, even unto death. Why? Because they live to serve the greater good, and they know of no alternatives.
0DI0007343	House's machines, his technologies - what do they propose? The possibility of victory without sacrifice. No blood spilled, just... rivets.
0DI0007344	That's not an idea to be put in circulation. If mankind's going to survive this moment in history, it needs warriors, not gadgets.
0DI0007345	The Boomers settled at the old air base northeast of Vegas many years ago. No one knows exactly how long it's been.
0DI0007346	It may be that no one's traded with them or even spoken to them that entire time. If so, they're sitting on one hell of a stockpile of ammunition...
0DI0007347	My scouts have seen people moving around the base. The perimeter is guarded, with spotters in towers directing the artillery fire.
0DI0007348	They must have extraordinary vision. Some of my scouts were targeted at extreme distances.
0DI0007349	So no, I can't tell you what to expect inside the base. No one's been inside it, except them.
0DI0007350	The worst impulses of mankind, concentrated in one insane, backward tribe.
0DI0007351	The Brotherhood seems to have formed not long after the great atomic war. It's hard to know - they care little for history.
0DI0007352	Some of the Brotherhood scribes we captured further East didn't even know the name of their founder, Roger Maxson.
0DI0007353	They like to pretty up their mission with trappings of chivalry, but the truth is they're horders. They horde technology.
0DI0007354	It's been 200 years, and they still have the mentality of scavengers. They say they're preserving these technologies, but for what?
0DI0007355	They have no vision. They offer no future. They're a dead end.
0DI0007356	You don't think very far ahead, do you?
0DI0007357	Sure, their hatred of the NCR would seem to qualify them for use as proxies. But then what do you do with them? Each paladin is quite powerful.
0DI0007358	I'd have to be convinced that present benefits outweighed future costs.
0DI0007359	A man of potential, held back by the craven political context he inhabits. You realize he was a general? "The Hero of the Mojave," they called him.
0DI0007360	A title he earned by extirpating lesser tribes that dared attack NCR citizens. His responses were swift and draconian.
0DI0007361	President Tandi, the "founding mother," coddled hostile tribes... but her successors were less naive, so they gave Kimball free rein.
0DI0007362	And after a respectable military career, what does he do? Become a politician.
0DI0007363	But he did so by election. What better way to stunt the growth of leaders, not to mention whole cultures?
0DI0007364	A leader shouldn't have to kowtow to those who serve him. With so much energy wasted on those below, how is he ever to move forward?
0DI0007365	Had he taken the government by force, used his army to stage a coup, things would be very different.
0DI0007366	I'll just have to do it for him.
0DI0007367	It'll frighten them. If I can reach out and kill whomever I choose, then they know the only reason they're alive is I haven't tried yet.
0DI0007368	You have to understand that Kimball is a symbol. Without him, there would be no NCR occupation of the Mojave.
0DI0007369	He mustered the troops - as many as his senate would allow - and sent them in. All the right reasons, done all the wrong ways.
0DI0007370	Any invasion by a democracy is a half-measure. When Kimball dies, the NCR will recoil from the Mojave, and from his legacy.
0DI0007371	By the time they recover and try to strike back, I'll be invading them.
0DI0007372	Lanius is the greatest of my battlefield commanders. Some might call him a great man, but I'm not sure he qualifies.
0DI0007373	Once, he was the greatest warrior of the Hidebarks, a tribe of the Arizona. Maniacal in battle. Sometimes he'd ambush Legion patrols by himself.
0DI0007374	When, after several months we found and surrounded the Hidebarks' camp, their Chieftain raised a banner of surrender.
0DI0007375	The warrior who was not yet Lanius went insane with rage. He struck down his Chieftain and attacked his own tribe.
0DI0007376	He killed fifteen before they brought him down. He didn't die, obviously.
0DI0007377	I had him tended to. He was maimed, most of face torn off. It was days before he regained consciousness.
0DI0007378	When he did, I went to his bedside and showed him the helmet I'd had forged to cover his face. I said he could have it if he'd fight for me.
0DI0007379	He accepted... on condition that he be allowed to kill the surviving males of his tribe. I said, make it the adult males and you have a deal.
0DI0007380	Lanius is savage. Savagely loyal, too, but only to me - he has no love for my Legion. But this has its uses.
0DI0007381	He has no attachment to his men, no compunction about battlefield losses. All he cares about is destroying the enemy.
0DI0007382	When another legatus or a Centurion fails to achieve results, I send Lanius to make things right.
0DI0007383	His first step is to beat the failed commander to death in front of his assembled troops. Then he orders the ritual of decimatio.
0DI0007384	It means "decimation," but in ancient Rome the word had a very specific meaning - a punishment for cowardice.
0DI0007385	The Legionaries are lined up in ranks. Every tenth man steps forward and is beaten to death by his brothers.
0DI0007386	It instills a certain... robust obedience.
0DI0007387	Yes. This time my Legionaries will be more frightened of the commander behind them than the enemy before them.
0DI0007388	There will be no failure this time, no retreat, no years of gathering slaves and resources for another assault.
0DI0007389	With Lanius to drive the Legion forward, the dam will be taken. It will be our bridgehead across the Colorado.
0DI0007390	It's not going to happen again. That's all I have to say about it.
0DI0007391	And I've heard it's a bad idea to tempt the wrath of Caesar. Change the subject.
0DI0007392	Vulpes is the best of my Frumentarii. A remarkable individual from an unremarkable tribe south of the Utah.
0DI0007393	He was brought into the Legion as a boy, survived training, fought well enough as Legionary to be promoted to the rank of Decanus.
0DI0007394	Then, in battle against an unimportant tribe, he broke ranks and led his contubernium through a hole in their defenses to capture its chieftain.
0DI0007395	Well, his Centurion wanted him crucified for disobedience. So I made him a Frumentari.
0DI0007396	Whatever I require. Infiltration, assassination, dramatic atrocities to break the spirit of the enemy - et cetera.
0DI0007397	They're mentally flexible. They operate behind enemy lines for extended periods, imitating the enemy's customs without becoming sullied.
0DI0007398	In all these things, Vulpes is a master.
0DI0007399	My Praetorians embody the martial ideals of my Legion. Each one of them has done enough conquering and killing to deserve the rank of Centurion.
0DI0007400	Instead, I invited them to join my guard. So the invitee chooses whichever current guard he thinks is weakest - and challenges him.
0DI0007401	The fight is to the death. It keeps them from getting complacent.
0DI0007402	Lucius has been the head of my guard for five years now. He was a subordinate guard for eight before that.
0DI0007403	No invitee has dared to challenge him yet. Maybe it's an issue of respect - he is getting on in years.
0DI0007404	Lanius will be waiting for you. Your arrival will signal to him that it's time to launch the attack.
0DI0007405	As for what to expect, it's going to be the greatest battle - and victory - mankind has seen since it almost wiped itself off the face of this Earth.
0DI0007406	Tactically, it's simple - kill and kill some more. I may have a few surprises in store for the NCR, but that won't concern you.
0DI0007407	Because he complicates the equation of force. He's a free agent, an unpredictable element.
0DI0007408	I'm sure he's trying to sit out this battle, just as he did four years ago, hoping the Legion and Profligates will wipe each other out.
0DI0007409	When he sees the Profligates losing this battle, however, he might throw his support behind them. Except he won't, because he'll be dead.
0DI0007410	Mark my words, you piece of shit. This is the last time you will ever refuse to perform an order I've given you.
0DI0007411	If you meant what you said, you best be on your way, and at good speed. And forget all that I could have given you.
0DI0007412	If you ever - ever - disobey me again, I will order my Praetorians to hack you to death with their machetes for my entertainment.
0DI0007413	I warned you about the price of disobedience. I guess you weren't listening.
0DI0007414	Praetorians! Kill this nuisance!
0DI0007415	Months spent feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal - all for nothing. Any other crimes?
0DI0007416	Weeks of effort to convince those miserable Khans to join the Legion - ruined. Any other crimes?
0DI0007417	And so you wiped out the garrison I placed at Nelson? That strategically vital garrison? What else?
0DI0007418	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at Camp McCarran? What else have you done?
0DI0007419	Understand this. From this moment forward, any other crimes will be punished by death. No exceptions.
0DI0007420	I will have you hacked into pieces by my Praetorians - for my amusement. Understand?
0DI0007421	Now getting back to business...
0DI0007422	That's right. Under normal circumstances, the reason it wouldn't happen again is that you'd be crucified - or worse.
0DI0007423	Only in light of the extraordinary service you've rendered unto me am I going to overlook this failure.
0DI0007424	Bear in mind how much you have to make up for, how much you have to prove yourself in your next task...
0DI0007425	What else, then?
0DI0007426	What did you just say?
0DI0007427	Benny is my prisoner. You don't "deal with him" unless you've dealt with me.
0DI0007428	Don't worry, you'll get the Platinum Chip he was carrying. And then you'll use it like I tell you to.
0DI0007429	You should be listening, that's what you should be doing.
0DI0007430	That's right, you should be going - because you have work to do.
0DI0007431	Oh, I'll give you the Platinum Chip. And then you'll use it exactly like I tell you to.
0DI0007432	Here's your chip. Is there anything else I can help you with?
0DI0007433	Here's your chips. Is there anything else I can help you with?
0DI0007438	Is there anything else I can help you with?
0DI0007439	Believe me, I would love orders to take Cottonwood Cove apart and kick the Legion back across the river.
0DI0007440	But, the brass at McCarran doesn't want us to waste resources on something they consider a minor target. So we just get to watch.
0DI0007441	Undoubtedly. Rangers are tough nuts to crack, though, and any force small enough to launch a surprise attack isn't going back in one piece.
0DI0007442	On the other hand, if the Legion goes for a full-scale attack, we'll see 'em coming, fall back, and wait for reinforcements.
0DI0007443	So, we know what they'll do and they know what we'll do, so we just sit around and keep an eye on each other.
0DI0007444	The Legion's been sending raiding parties across the river in larger numbers lately. We don't have the men at this post to intercept them all.
0DI0007445	Skirmishes, mostly. The Legion raiding parties usually fall back when they know it's us they're up against.
0DI0007447	Watch out for Great Khans.
0DI0007449	[SUCCEEDED] We were on patrol near the Dam when a Legion raiding party jumped us. Didn't even have to time to radio it in.
0DI0007450	I was hit in the head with a machete and knocked out. Didn't kill me, though some nights I wish it had. When I woke up, my nerve was gone.
0DI0007451	The rest of my squad was crucified, butchered, mutilated. I don't know how they missed me. Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew they'd broken me.
0DI0007452	I gambled and drank a lot after that. Got into trouble, but the Rangers gave me a second chance instead of kicking me out. So, here I am.
0DI0007453	[FAILED] No, I'm not going to bring it up.
0DI0007454	Maybe. But, thanks for saying it, anyway.
0DI0007456	I... I was different back then.
0DI0007457	Are you... going to spank us? I *so* love handcuffs!
0DI0007458	Come on, big man, roll up in here!
0DI0007459	Check your weapons and move up!
0DI0007460	Move up to the next position.
0DI0007461	All clear!
0DI0007462	Zone clear! Advance to the next position.
0DI0007463	That looks like all of them.
0DI0007464	I think it is safe to move up.
0DI0007465	Keep your heads down and move up to the next location.
0DI0007466	Looks like we got them, move fast and look alive.
0DI0007467	WooooOOOOOOoooo.
0DI0007468	You're no friend to the Great Khans. You should turn around and leave - and if we see you in the Mojave, well... accidents happen.
0DI0007469	Uhh, hey. Welcome to Red Rock Canyon. You've seemed a little bipolar lately - maybe you're having withdrawal symptoms?
0DI0007470	Talk to Jack, he'd be happy to sell you some top-quality chems. He'll even give you a discount.
0DI0007471	Hey, welcome to Red Rock Canyon! Since you've done so much for the Great Khans, Papa Khan told me to let you know you can buy weapons at our Armory.
0DI0007472	You can find it in the basement of the burned-out old building at the mouth of the canyon.
0DI0007473	Crocker. Can. Kiss. My. Sweet. Republic. Ass.
0DI0007474	Where's your sexy friend, Vic?!
0DI0007475	Hellloooo, sparky.
0DI0007476	Who wants to swim? Water's fiiiiine.
0DI0007477	Uh oooooh, it's the *law,* girls!
0DI0007478	All right, ladies, show's over.
0DI0007479	All right, girls, show's over.
0DI0007480	Take it on home.
0DI0007481	Want to dance, hit Gomorrah.
0DI0007482	All right, enough fun for tonight.
0DI0007483	Get out. Get out.
0DI0007484	Ladies, please remove yourselves from the fountain.
0DI0007485	Please remove yourselves from the fountain.
0DI0007486	And gather your clothes and belongings.
0DI0007487	Ladies, please disperse.
0DI0007488	Please disperse.
0DI0007489	Ladies, the fountain is a restricted area.
0DI0007490	The fountain is a restricted area.
0DI0007491	Ladies, if you wish to bathe, please check into the Ultra-Luxe.
0DI0007492	The fountain is for wishes, ladies.
0DI0007493	Please remove your bra from the bottom of the fountain.
0DI0007494	The bathhouse is in the Ultra-Luxe.
0DI0007495	Can barely see the street.
0DI0007496	Those last five shots were a bad idea...
0DI0007497	Why do they call it a monorail... it's a train. A *train.*
0DI0007498	Why's everything spinning?
0DI0007499	I swear the monorail was *just* ahead... somewhere.
0DI0007500	So fucked up I can't feel my legs.
0DI0007501	We need to stop and pee soon.
0DI0007502	I got a pressure in me like Hoover Dam.
0DI0007503	Is there a place to grab food by the monorail?
0DI0007504	What, we leaving *already?*
0DI0007505	Can't believe we have patrol duty in the morning...
0DI0007506	I swear... I'm not drinking... ever... again.
0DI0007507	That's it, keep moving.
0DI0007508	Have half a mind to throw you all in a cell and let you sweat it off.
0DI0007509	Going to have words with your commanding officer after this.
0DI0007510	Come on, come on.
0DI0007511	Don't have the patience for this drunk escort shit tonight...
0DI0007512	Don't give us any trouble now.
0DI0007513	Monorail's just ahead, boys, keep moving.
0DI0007514	Stand tall and walk straight, you idiots are giving us a bad name.
0DI0007515	Look alive, guys, you're on NCR time.
0DI0007516	Uh... I was just... uh... getting some fresh air and stretching my legs. It's getting pretty late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
0DI0007517	Yeah, yeah... me too. It's getting a bit late though, I should get going. Goodnight.
0DI0007518	I'm not sneaking! I'm uh... just stretching my legs. I should be getting back though, it's late. Goodnight.
0DI0007519	Nothing as severe. Charlie seems to be getting a lot of extra medical supplies for some reason, while Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in awhile.
0DI0007520	Echo has been reporting heavy Legion activity down on their end, but that's about it.
0DI0007521	Oh. Well, thanks for helping get to the bottom of this, I guess.
0DI0007522	No confession? No evidence? What good is that?
0DI0007523	I'm sure the assassins will wait for you to show up.
0DI0007524	You're making me question your usefulness, you realize.
0DI0007525	Success depends on forethought, dispassionate calculation of probabilites, accounting for every stray variable.
0DI0007526	Your history of aggression towards the NCR has rendered you useless in this concern, unable to influence the outcome of events.
0DI0007527	Consequently, I have to "wait and see" what happens. It's... grotesque.
0DI0007528	I'll send a Securitron ahead to meet with the NCR at the security checkpoint and get things started.
0DI0007529	Once you get there ask for Ranger Grant. I've used roaming Securitrons to feed him useful information in the past.
0DI0007530	If I tell him we've heard of a Legion assassination plot, I believe he'll let you investigate.
0DI0007531	This is not an optional assignment. Kimball may be a grandstanding boor, but I want him protected.
0DI0007532	Until you do this, consider yourself suspended... without pay.
0DI0007538	I don't like the sound of this. Hope that collar isn't what I think it is. What did you do, Elijah?
0DI0007539	It pays like ass, but it's hard to get other work with my skill set.
0DI0007541	Ha! Good question. These days it's hard to say. Once upon a time it was about technology. Controlling it so it couldn't destroy us again.
0DI0007542	Energy weapons and power armor are usually tops on our list, although I appreciate anything that's vintage.
0DI0007543	But that all seems so limited now. We haven't grown or adapted. And now we're stuck in a hole, not carrying out our mission.
0DI0007544	More sexual favors than I can even count. I am still tired from it.
0DI0007545	No, actually, you're born into it. My parents, their parents, so on. When you're young you can choose to leave. But it's home, so most people don't.
0DI0007546	We don't take on new members, really. You can do the math on our long-term prospects based on that point. I keep hoping we'll change that.
0DI0007547	I'm a procurement specialist. Like I said, it's basically grocery shopping. Except sometimes the groceries are scavenged parts and arcane technology.
0DI0007548	The elder who brought us to the Mojave, Father Elijah, usually had me looking for these old memory units. But he'd never tell me what they were for.
0DI0007549	Nowadays I'm usually sent to do business with traders at places like the 188. But sometimes I think it's just to keep me out of everyone's hair.
0DI0007550	I know sometimes I sound like I don't. I know. But there's something that still rings true to me about our code.
0DI0007551	There's an honor to it. We're protecting people. Even if it's from themselves, it's a good cause.
0DI0007552	We just lose sight of the big picture sometimes. Treat all our practices with the same sacredness.
0DI0007553	Ah, the Codex. If it's in there, we have to abide it, if it's not, it's not important.
0DI0007554	It documents our history, too. Part of what Scribes like me do is update it. Hmm... I wonder...
0DI0007555	Nah, they'd probably catch it if I rewrote the Founder's axioms.
0DI0007556	No, no. We only protect people from themselves, and only in the sense that we don't let them have the really good Pre-War toys.
0DI0007557	And sometimes it's more like we protect ourselves from them and hope to outlive them and become humanity's sole heirs.
0DI0007558	We've had people go rogue, though, and start helping people. One chapter had a small civil war over it. We take our isolationism seriously.
0DI0007559	I called them family before. That's not far off. Both the good and the bad. It's like a big unending family reunion in that bunker.
0DI0007560	There's people you love, people you'll never speak to again, and it's always awkward when you run into someone you used to date.
0DI0007561	He was our Elder when we came East. A wizard with technology, really. His mind just worked that way naturally. Learned a lot from him.
0DI0007562	But he started having disagreements with the other Elders. The Brotherhood's interest is in old technology. He wanted to explore developing new tech.
0DI0007563	And there were other ways he wanted to push. Other weapons. Ones with ethics questions attached. Rather than deal with him, they sent him East.
0DI0007564	I like punching things, but sometimes shooting things just has to do.
0DI0007566	What are your thoughts?
0DI0007567	Okay, I won't!
0DI0007568	Okay, well... I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
0DI0007569	He isn't. I already checked there this morning. We were supposed to meet up here about an hour ago.
0DI0007570	I guess I'll just keep waiting. Sorry to bother you.
0DI0007571	Why would you say something like that? That's just mean.
0DI0007573	That shot came from the Chief's office!
0DI0007574	Chief! Why did you do it?
0DI0007575	Don't get killed out there.
0DI0007577	Ranger Station Alpha used to be the frontline outpost for NCR. When we moved onto the Dam, this station has fallen into more a support role.
0DI0007578	There are other Ranger posts around. Reyes might have mixed up the report.
0DI0007579	Reyes got the numbers wrong - not much more to it than that.
0DI0007582	You think I haven't tried? Every time I do, Camp Golf acknowledges the situation. And soon after that, more ammo.
0DI0007583	We're not going to die of thirst any time soon, but I'd rather have too much than not enough.
0DI0007584	Eh, it's not my call to make. You'd have to clear it with Ranger Ericsen.
0DI0007586	The security codes are unique to the radios at each Ranger station. They're useless anywhere else.
0DI0007587	This holotape contains the updated security codes for the Ranger Stations. Show it to the comm officers there.
0DI0007588	Once the new codes are in use, anyone still using the old codes will just hear static if they're listening in on our frequencies.
0DI0007589	Thank you, and good luck.
0DI0007590	All right, then. Come and talk to me when you do.
0DI0007591	I knew it. Every one of the false reports was signed off by Chief Hanlon at Camp Golf, but why would the Chief manipulate the reports?
0DI0007592	I need you to take everything we've found to Chief Hanlon and confront him with it. I don't want to make this public unless we have to.
0DI0007593	I knew it. I suspected that Chief Hanlon was behind all this, but since he's dead, there's no way we'll ever know.
0DI0007594	Thanks for all your help.
0DI0007595	I saw some Legion assholes carrying crates to a cave north of here. May have been NCR shit, I don't fucking know.
0DI0007596	Gonna play a song for you right now. It's about that special someone you only find once... in a Blue Moon.
0DI0007597	Got some Dean Martin coming up, talking about the greatest feeling in the world, love. "Ain't That A Kick in the Head." Sure is, Dino. It sure is.
0DI0007598	Here's Bing Crosby reminding us of those times when you absolutely have to kiss the person you love. "Something's Gotta Give," up next.
0DI0007599	Hey New Vegas, have you ever said you loved someone when it wasn't quite true? Sure you have. But you shouldn't. Because It's a Sin to Tell a Lie.
0DI0007600	And now Nat King Cole, reminding us what really matters with "Love Me As Though There Were No Tomorrow." Because in New Vegas, hey, you never know.
0DI0007601	Got a song for you, now. It's about a guy who's cold on the exterior, but deep down, you know he's a good man. And his name... is Johnny Guitar.
0DI0007602	In New Vegas, we know the pain that numbers can bring us. Well, so does Guy Mitchell, who's got "Heartaches by the Number."
0DI0007603	Have you ever been in love with a celebrity? You don't have to be shy, I feel it between us, too. Sometimes you can't help being Mad About the Boy.
0DI0007604	You know, sometimes the journey beats the destination. Especially if your spurs go Jingle Jangle Jingle, and you meet some nice gals on the way. 
0DI0007605	I am a loyal servant of Caesar, and I thank my good fortune for the day that he plucked me as a babe from the shore of the Great Salt Lake.
0DI0007606	For five years I have had the privilege of serving as a Decanus. If fortune continues to smile upon me, I will serve him until I draw my last breath.
0DI0007607	I hope that satisfies your curiosity about me, because I won't waste any more of Caesar's time talking about myself.
0DI0007608	I'll execute Caesar's will by hurling your corpse into the Colorado - like the other Profligates before you!
0DI0007609	I am Dead Sea, Decanus of the Legion by the grace of Caesar, not that you're in any position to ask questions.
0DI0007610	True to Caesar.
0DI0007611	All right, you're clean. Come back by here when you're done at the tables.
0DI0007612	[FAILED] Nice try, wiseass. Now hand everything over before you make a *second* mistake.
0DI0007613	[FAILED] Oh, now, what surprise - someone trying to smuggle in weapons.
0DI0007614	Look, jackass, the job's rough enough as it is without troublemakers like you, so either hand it all over or take your caps elsewhere.
0DI0007615	You just made a big mistake.
0DI0007616	Things guards can't spot when they're patting you down or checking for iron at your hip.
0DI0007617	Simple - you can't bring guns into the casino, that's why. They'll strip you to your fists.
0DI0007618	Surrre, they say you get it all back when you leave. Me? I don't like being without a little *insurance* when it's my caps on the table.
0DI0007619	Take a look at these beauties.
0DI0007620	The right weapons for my kind of customer.
0DI0007621	The others here don't understand our kind, but you can count of me, friend.
0DI0007622	You aren't exactly good for business, so you'll have to live with my prices.
0DI0007623	Have a discount, friend. I can't wait to see what you do with these, next.
0DI0007624	It's an honor to have my wares used by such a wild badass. Cut's on the house, friend.
0DI0007625	Suit yourself, it's not my fault if they find your body dumped in Freeside.
0DI0007627	You know where to find me, friend.
0DI0007628	Make yourself scarce, I got to keep my image.
0DI0007629	Bring on the mayhem, friend.
0DI0007630	[SUCCEEDED] You might - one fellow I knew was able to slip a pistol past the guards. You? I'm guessing you could get a machine gun by them.
0DI0007631	[FAILED] An experienced smuggler could get a machine gun or pistol in - you? You're welcome to try.
0DI0007633	People have been counterfeiting bottle caps forever, but it's always been small scale.
0DI0007634	A bottle cap press is a whole other threat. We can't have anyone devaluing our currency by mass producing new bottle caps.
0DI0007635	Certainly. Bottle caps do wear out or get damaged. Some people even insist on using bottle caps in explosive devices for some reason.
0DI0007636	We make it a point to scour Pre-War bottling plants and recover or disable the bottle cap presses. It seems we missed one.
0DI0007637	Lots of little things - the paint on the label, the machining, the type of metal it's made from.
0DI0007638	I know there's counterfeit caps floating around, of course. Fortunately, they're very time-consuming to make, so the numbers are small.
0DI0007639	All right. Sit still and let me work.
0DI0007640	I'm afraid I can't do this for free. My supplies are stretched thin enough as it is.
0DI0007641	Very Well. You may proceed. However, be warned. Aggressive acts will earn you a place on a cross.
0DI0007642	I'll expect to see some tangible progress before long, then.
0DI0007643	I'm the person who will pay you when you complete the delivery contract you signed. Now go get the Chip.
0DI0007644	Excellent idea.
0DI0007645	By "goodbye," I assume you mean to say that you can't talk right now because you need to go get the Platinum Chip off Benny's body.
0DI0007646	There will time for questions and answers once you've delivered the Chip. Until then, you'll have to tolerate your ignorance... just as I do.
0DI0007647	His destination is hardly a mystery. It's a near certainty that he's making his way for Caesar's camp, at Fortification Hill.
0DI0007648	It's one of just two places on Earth that have the hardware necessary to read the Platinum Chip  - the Lucky 38 is the other, of course.
0DI0007649	And whose idea was it to offer yourself up as a sacrificial lamb? Really, what did you expect?
0DI0007650	Are you going to keep giving him opportunities to kill you? It's becoming a hobby of his.
0DI0007651	I suspected he'd found a way to access my encrypted databases, but well - this explains it.
0DI0007652	That would be how he learned of the Platinum Chip in the first place... not to mention where to intercept you, on your way in.
0DI0007653	Highly resourceful, Benny. He would've made a fine agent, had he stayed loyal. It's fortunate you came along to replace him - and ironic.
0DI0007654	As I've told you before, you are contractually obligated to deliver the Chip. Do your job - you have everything to gain.
0DI0007655	I won't lie to you. It'll be dangerous.
0DI0007656	What about him? He has every reason to go to the Fort, so that's where you'll find him.
0DI0007657	All I ask is that you recover the Chip. What happens to Benny is up to you.
0DI0007658	Come back when you have something to report.
0DI0007659	And why would you have done that?
0DI0007660	Success depends on forcing the NCR to rout from Hoover Dam. Hmm, does giving then a powerful ally in the battle make that more or less likely?
0DI0007661	Your assignment is unchanged - destroy the Brotherhood of Steel. Please get it right this time.
0DI0007662	Hidden Valley is the place to keep working, then.
0DI0007663	They occupied Nellis Air Force Base a little over 50 years ago. One of my Securitrons got some video of their arrival - and then... exploded.
0DI0007664	Odds are they were Vault dwellers. That's everything I know about them, really.
0DI0007665	Only if you come within a mile or so of them.
0DI0007666	Given their history of extreme isolationism, it's tempting to leave them be. But those howitzers of theirs...
0DI0007667	You can't let indeterminate variables rattle around in your equations like that. They have to be accounted for, one way or another.
0DI0007668	Yes, though at the time they called themselves the "Slither Kin." A vicious clan, not that that's changed, exactly.
0DI0007669	They were nomads, capable fighters, but their specialty was betrayal. They'd invite travelers into their yurts, drug them, murder or enslave them.
0DI0007670	They took pride in their craft. I don't think Omertas saw other people as people at all. Everyone else was just... prey.
0DI0007671	They reminded me of a certain criminal element Vegas used to attract. I told them some stories, gave them some clothes - and they ran with it.
0DI0007672	The Chairmen, as we know them now, went by the unfortunate appellation of the "Mojave Boot-Riders." They were nomads, too.
0DI0007673	As for the White Glove Society, I afraid I'm contractually obligated not to reveal their original name.
0DI0007674	They're a terrorist group, basically. Militant, quasi-religious fanatics obsessed with hoarding Pre-War technology.
0DI0007675	Not all technology, mind you. You don't see them raiding hospitals to cart away Auto-Docs or armfuls of prosthetic organs.
0DI0007676	No, they greatly prefer the sort of technology that puts people in hospitals. Or graves, rather, since hospitals went the way of the Dodo.
0DI0007677	Because they're ridiculous! Because they galavant around the Mojave pretending to be Knights of Yore.
0DI0007678	Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.
0DI0007679	The world has no use for emotionally unstable techno-fetishists. Just wipe them out, will you?
0DI0007680	I care because he is a known quantity - not the man so much as the political context he inhabits.
0DI0007681	Kimball rose to prominence as the "Hero of the Mojave" when he led a campaign of reprisals against tribals who dared to attack NCR citizens.
0DI0007682	Ordering the occupation of Hoover Dam was his first act of office. As water and electricity flowed to NCR cities, his popularity soared.
0DI0007683	Conversely, his failure to annex the Mojave these seven years, and the immense costs of occupying a foreign land, have eroded his popular support.
0DI0007684	Kimball's entire political career is inextricably bound up with the NCR's occupation of the Mojave. It's his war.
0DI0007685	If I compell the NCR to retreat, Kimball will be the sacrifice offered to the gods, so decent NCR citizens can get on with their lives.
0DI0007686	In retrospect, the Mojave and Hoover Dam will seem like one man's misadventure. Kimball will be blamed, not me. Not New Vegas.
0DI0007687	Then the Hero of the Mojave would become the Martyr of Hoover Dam. And when, subsequently, I force the NCR to retreat...
0DI0007688	They lick their wounds, and dream of righteous vengeance against New Vegas. Hello, embargo, farewell, tourist economy.
0DI0007689	I've calculated and re-calculated these probabilities. Kimball must live.
0DI0007690	Imagine two snarling dogs fighting over a curve of bone, perhaps the rib of their master, long-dead.
0DI0007691	It'll be a pitched battle, that's a certainty. Perhaps the greatest battle the Earth has seen since the human race nearly made itself extinct.
0DI0007692	With Caesar dead, it's hard to know what to expect. The Legate, Lanius, is renowned as a brutal man, not a subtle tactician.
0DI0007693	Frontal assaults, wave attacks - these are the sort of tactics one would expect from such a man.
0DI0007694	The Legion will mount a ferocious and determined frontal assault from the east, that much is certain.
0DI0007695	Still, Caesar is a capable strategist. I'd be surprised if he hasn't found some way to infiltrate the dam, or the NCR's rear areas.
0DI0007696	General Oliver's strategy - or "tunnel vision," as I like to call it - has been to mass troops at Hoover Dam.
0DI0007697	He wants to out-fight the Legion in a straight-forward slugging match, and then, when they rout, pursue and destroy them in detail.
0DI0007698	A crushing, decisive victory of this sort would overshadow the tactical ingenuity of Chief Hanlon's defense four years ago, you see.
0DI0007699	A good deal should be obvious to you by now. I won't spoil the rest by talking out of turn.
0DI0007700	We do need it. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
0DI0007701	Take care of yourself out there. And if you ever need a friendly hand, know that folks around here will always welcome you.
0DI0007702	[SUCCEEDED] Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, take this: it's half of our savings. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
0DI0007704	[FAILED] We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. This is all we can give.
0DI0007706	I shouldn't have trusted you.
0DI0007707	You think you can take it? All right, bastard! I'll give you what you deserve!
0DI0007708	Goodbye, stranger.
0DI0007709	You're going to leave, just like that? All right, stranger... Thank you for everything.
0DI0007710	Yes, I suppose you're right. Please, accept half of our reserve. We'll manage, somehow, as we've always done.
0DI0007711	... I... I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
0DI0007712	That's right, get out of here! If I see you ever again, I'll pump you full of lead, you hear?
0DI0007713	We do need it, stranger. Still, I wish there was something we could give you in return.
0DI0007714	If you see Alice again, please, tell her we won't hold it against her. Tell Alice that we love her.
0DI0007715	We've worked day and night, for months, to make that much. Sorry, stranger, it'll have to do.
0DI0007718	Uh... you were kidding just now when you said that thing about the Codex, right?
0DI0007719	Wow. Good thing the safety was on.
0DI0007720	Ah, hell. Well, how could you know, right? Okay. Two other options still on the table.
0DI0007721	I haven't been anywhere but here for... well, who the hell knows? If there's a corpse I haven't been babysitting it.
0DI0007722	But I'll tell you who needs some babysitting. Those damn kids keep running around in here.
0DI0007723	They got parents? I don't know. Wish they did so they'd leave me be.
0DI0007724	Sorry, but I need it to shoot Stacey. We can find you another gun.
0DI0007725	Really? Cool! Bring it back to me when you're done, okay? I think Stacey might be turning into an alien.
0DI0007726	I don't really like to go to bed until it gets dark out.
0DI0007727	Yeah, it's time for me to sleep now.
0DI0007728	Goodnight.
0DI0007729	This is the best gun in the whole galaxy. I paid a million caps for it. And it wasn't even brand new.
0DI0007730	You mean it? Wow, thanks!
0DI0007731	I bet me and Stacey can get something real cool at Mick and Ralph's with that.
0DI0007732	Yeah? Let's see it.
0DI0007733	Aw, man. It's Stacey's fault. She pretends like she didn't get hit.
0DI0007734	That's still a lot of money. I guess I'll take it.
0DI0007735	I'll be shooting Stacey till you get back. Just saying goodbye to it, you know?
0DI0007736	Sorry, I may be little, but I'm not dumb.
0DI0007737	Well, if you can get me most of it, I could give you a loan for the rest.
0DI0007739	Heh heh heh heh ooo, heh heh heh.
0DI0007740	Indeed I have, my articulate friend. Not a few minutes ago I chanced upon a pair of destitute orphans grappling over just such an item.
0DI0007741	If you cover the area methodically, I'm quite certain you'll happen upon them with only the most insubstantial of delays.
0DI0007742	Be well. And do try and avoid the tragic path of the sot that led me to my present infirmities and spiritual woes.
0DI0007743	Kids. Run by sh- shumtimes.
0DI0007744	Blaaagghhh.
0DI0007746	The power station, the dam, they're my babies. Well... don't tell my grandchildren I said that. Anything in here that I haven't rebuilt I've fixed.
0DI0007747	I've been here since well before the first battle. I've ground my knuckles on so much cement in here it is nearly as much me as it is cement.
0DI0007748	I'm the head engineer. I make sure the turbines keep spinning and the water keeps pumping.
0DI0007749	Well he mostly stays out of the way, which is a good thing. He'd probably end up doing some real damage if he tried to make himself useful.
0DI0007750	Right now we mostly let him operate the switchboard for the intercom. Flipping switches seems to keep him pretty happy.
0DI0007751	Sad what happened to him. He was a good kid.
0DI0007752	I was down here for most of it, so I can't tell you much of what the boys with the guns were doing up top.
0DI0007753	From talking to the boys that were fighting up there, I can tell you that Hanlon managed to pull off what most people would have thought impossible.
0DI0007754	Alright, what's on your mind?
0DI0007755	Good day to you, and stay out of trouble.
0DI0007756	Been better, been worse. When I first came here there was but one turbine spinning.
0DI0007757	At one point shortly after the last battle I had six of them spinning, was a wonderful sound. Only four of them are running right now.
0DI0007758	A little bit ago one of the intake towers got clogged. No water running through it anymore to spin the generators.
0DI0007759	One of these days I'll get some boys out to the turbine to get it running again, but right now it is pretty low on the priority list.
0DI0007760	You've got my ear.
0DI0007761	Well to each their own I guess.
0DI0007762	What do you need to know?
0DI0007764	Okay. This will just take a moment.
0DI0007767	Contreras?! What's his involvement? Was he selling drugs to Price?
0DI0007768	Sounds like the evidence we need to bring him in for questioning and search his shack, but why are you telling me all of this?
0DI0007769	Well, thanks for the tip, but we'll need more evidence. Talk to Boyd at McCarran.
0DI0007770	I've been working with her in this investigation.
0DI0007775	Don't think too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
0DI0007779	Here's a little tink-tink to weight your pockets.
0DI0007780	Here you go, this'll give you some zing.
0DI0007781	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip cat.
0DI0007782	Right on, right on. You're a pretty hip kitten.
0DI0007783	Leaving? Into exile? Good. Save us the trouble.
0DI0007784	But mark me well. Any hint of treachery or thought of return and we will erase the both of you from existence.
0DI0007785	Respect, nothing. She plans to whisper in his ear. Poison him against the Codex.
0DI0007786	A paladin always has a say where the Codex is concerned. Veronica's aspirations are seditious.
0DI0007787	All of us here are sworn to obey and protect the Codex, even against one of our own. She's gone too far this time.
0DI0007788	No... this has to end now.
0DI0007789	Execute them.
0DI0007790	Hmmph. She'd be doing a greater service by carrying out her duties and not trying to undermine the elder's authority.
0DI0007791	This had better be the last time her loyalty falters. You've been warned.
0DI0007792	You're pathetic. Hide behind words all you like, but your cowardice shows through.
0DI0007793	Their sentimentality prevents them from administering justice.
0DI0007794	Our duty is to the Codex above all, something your companion has forgotten. And that gives us the authority to make it our place.
0DI0007795	No. No!
0DI0007796	High Elder Maxson didn't just found the Brotherhood. He defined it. To serve in the Brotherhood is to serve his ideals.
0DI0007797	Our way of life is based on them. We know no other path. There is no other path.
0DI0007798	With her... leanings... Veronica spits in the face of every Knight, Paladin, and Scribe to serve in our ranks.
0DI0007799	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. It's not like any of the troopers around here are jumping up to volunteer.
0DI0007800	[FAILED] That's one of the least trustworthy lines I've ever heard. Sorry. No can do.
0DI0007801	If you want to do some good, head up to Camp Forlorn Hope. I'll mark it on your map for you.
0DI0007802	That's a shame. Well, let me know if you change your mind or those Legion sons of bitches will be holed up in Nelson for weeks.
0DI0007803	Troopers tried moving down from Forlorn Hope because we got this big gap between there and Searchlight. Turns out we were spread too thin.
0DI0007804	We took our sweet ass time setting up in Nelson and the Legion managed to hop over the Colorado and attack before things were settled.
0DI0007805	There's Novac, due west. Just look for the big lizard. They got some decent supplies and a place to stay.
0DI0007806	The 188's north on the 95, good for all kinds of trade. Not much south on 95 unless you turn west on 164 to Nipton, right off the rail line.
0DI0007807	Nope. I'm just the only ranger around. The rest of the kids here are troopers, inexperienced, out-numbered and under-equipped.
0DI0007808	I sent you packing last time for a reason. Why should I let you in now?
0DI0007809	Good. We clear out the hostages and they lose their advantage. They're down in a clearing, crucified on some telephone poles.
0DI0007810	I'll cover you from the ridge. Just make it quick. These boys should be put out of their misery, not plinked to death with some old varmint rifle.
0DI0007811	And don't get any dreamy notions about playing the hero and dragging those boys out. You'll get swarmed. Now let's go.
0DI0007812	[SUCCEEDED] Good point. Anyway, it's your hide. Guess I should take all the help I can get.
0DI0007813	[FAILED] Nice speech. Take a hike.
0DI0007815	Sources at the Dam are telling us that the involvement of one key person appears to have heavily influenced the outcome.
0DI0007816	Reports indicate that NCR forces emerged victorious, and the Legion scattered amidst the defeat of its most feared military leader.
0DI0007817	Preliminary word is that Caesar's Legion has taken control of the Dam, and that the NCR presence in Nevada is severely crippled.
0DI0007818	While it initially appeared to be an NCR victory, we're receiving word that our own Mr. House may have been the one to secure the Dam for himself.
0DI0007819	But in a shocking turn of events, the Dam has been rendered useless, and both sides have taken heavy casualties. Neither faction appears to have won.
0DI0007820	But in a shocking turn of events, an army of Securitrons has seized control of the Dam, preventing both sides from claiming it.
0DI0007821	The great one can be found upstairs. Don't think about wasting his time. He's very important. You should feel lucky to be granted some of his time.
0DI0007822	Hurry back. Never have we been so close.
0DI0007823	Very few. Time is wasting. Hurry back so we can begin.
0DI0007824	It doesn't need to all come from the same source. There are a bunch of different vendors around who sell meat. Fitz, the Nash's, Crimson Caravan...
0DI0007825	We've never really tried to go out and organize deals with merchants to supply our food. Already having an overstock of food, we haven't needed to.
0DI0007826	But we really need some good-old red meat on the menu soon, so I'm willing to divert some caps in their direction if they're open to supplying us.
0DI0007829	Sir, yes, Sir!
0DI0007831	My pleasure. Thanks again.
0DI0007832	Ahh, doing this out of the goodness of your heart. You don't see that very often around here. Thank you.
0DI0007833	You're welcome. Enjoy.
0DI0007834	That's very gracious of you. Again, you have my thanks.
0DI0007838	I'm a ranger. They're troopers. Different branches. I don't have authority over them even though they're as green as a Super Mutant's backside.
0DI0007839	Besides, they'd probably start crying as soon as they saw the hostages get so much as a bruise. Nope, they don't got the stomach for it.
0DI0007840	The troopers won't go down into the camp with their comrades at risk. Dirty game the Legion likes to roll out whenever they get a chance.
0DI0007841	Problem is, Ranger Milo doesn't want to play. If we take out the hostages, they've got squat for leverage.
0DI0007842	All right, I have to admit I wasn't expecting you to say that. I was just joking. But if it makes you feel any better, I am impressed.
0DI0007843	So anyway, how about those hostages?
0DI0007847	Back at "Ranger School", they taught us not to run headlong into a battle when you're outnumbered ten to one.
0DI0007848	You want to go down there and try to haul those crippled boys off those poles, you're dumber than you look.
0DI0007849	"Dishonorable", that's a good one. Okay then, you can just turn around and head back toward Novac or wherever it is you came from.
0DI0007850	I wouldn't want you to get any dirt under your fingernails or tarnish your good name or whatever the heck you're so worried about.
0DI0007852	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I'll be damned. Looks like you've got some dirt in you after all.
0DI0007853	[FAILED] Right. You have trouble even saying the word "bad". Go on, get out of here if you know what's good for you.
0DI0007855	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I don't care much, either. At least not enough to turn down an offer for help.
0DI0007856	Well, now that you've sweet-talked me...
0DI0007857	[FAILED] Naw, why don't you just get out of here?
0DI0007858	Now that's a delivery service you can count on.
0DI0007859	[Primm Slim] Loading Public Appeasement Oration... complete. Howdy... citizens. How about a yee-haw for law and order in the fine town of ERROR: TOKEN NOT FOUND?
0DI0007860	[Meyers] Howdy do, folks. I'm Sheriff Meyers. Be good, or I'll shoot you dead.
0DI0007861	[McGee] People of Primm, the NCR wishes to inform you that you are under their jurisdiction now. And from now on, you're gonna be living by our rules.
0DI0007862	[Swank] If I know my pal Benny, he's swinging with the Big Cat Upstairs as we speak. Or he's chasing some angel broad with cans as big as her halo! <Laughs>
0DI0007863	[Swank] Do I seem worried to you, baby? Sometimes a cat just needs room to swing. He'll be back, sure as a conga drum's got a groovy beat.
0DI0007864	Once again, Caesar, dead. A shocking turn of events whose impact is anyone's guess at this point.
0DI0007865	Caesar said he expected to resume his campaign of terror and mayhem as soon as he receives medical clearance.
0DI0007866	<Sighs> Dang it. I could've used one of those.
0DI0007867	Caesar's Legion is believed to have been behind the attack.
0DI0007868	When asked why, the source said someone alerted them to the fact that Caesar's Legion was comprised of, quote, a bunch of squares.
0DI0007869	Travelers are advised not to make friendly chit-chat with them.
0DI0007870	Freesiders are hoping they'll drop food. I wouldn't get your hopes up, Freesiders.
0DI0007871	In possibly related news, local chem dealers report an overall decrease in their standard of living.
0DI0007872	The leader of the Kings, who would only identify himself as "The King" voiced his displeasure, calling NCR citizens, quote, the devil in disguise.
0DI0007873	[The King] I feel so bad. I think it's time we reconsider, baby.
0DI0007874	No suspects have been identified, but seniors are advised to be on the lookout for the  so-called Denture Killer.
0DI0007875	[Cachino] Before he left, Nero told me him and Big Sal were real tired, see? Said they were gonna go camping up at Lake Mead. 
0DI0007876	Asked to comment, Big Sal said, quote, the fuck you looking at? You wearing a wire? Are you? I'll break your fucking kneecaps. Hey. Get back here.
0DI0007877	One witness said, quote, God sent us two angels. And at least one had him a .308 caliber flaming sword of justice with a telescopic sight.
0DI0007878	[No-Bark Noonan] It's ghouls, I tell ya. Religious ghouls in rockets looking for a land to call their own.
0DI0007879	Possible causes suggested were engineering mistakes, centuries-old equipment, and the fact that the rockets were piloted by a cult of crazy ghouls.
0DI0007880	Witness descriptions are remarkably similar to accounts of the Goodsprings courier who, as we reported, recently survived a gunshot to the head.
0DI0007881	[Private Morales] It was such an incredible thing he did, putting his life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do.
0DI0007882	[Private Morales] It was such an incredible thing she did, putting her life on the line like that for my husband. It's not something most people would do. 
0DI0007883	[Marjorie] Mr. Gunderson is no longer a welcome guest at the Ultra-Luxe.
0DI0007884	The attacks are all the more troubling since there has not been a zoo in the area in quite some time.
0DI0007885	The chief scientist at the plant vowed to fix the problem, blaming it on an atmosphere of, quote, severe underappreciation.
0DI0007886	Those who can afford passports are saying the added security is well worth the price of admission.
0DI0007887	One anonymous official told us a serious mechanical failure would be a disaster because of the age of the train and scarcity of replacement parts. 
0DI0007888	NCR sources say that holding the Dam against Caesar's Legion has become their main strategic priority, and this move would not be unexpected.
0DI0007889	One refugee told us the legate took over an underperforming squad of troops by beating its commander to death in full view of everyone.
0DI0007890	If you should find it, do not - repeat, do not - belittle a Super Mutant for taking the bunny slope.
0DI0007891	Those who claim to have dined at the restaurant find the food appealing but say many tables remain empty.
0DI0007892	The secret ingredient? Tender loving care, according to the chef.
0DI0007893	The president's Vertibird exploded in midair as he departed following the address. Investigators say the explosion was not an accident.
0DI0007894	The president's Vertibird crashed into the side of the Dam as he departed following the address. Authorities suspect sabotage.
0DI0007895	The president's Vertibird was destroyed by one of the Dam's howitzer cannons. Investigators say the gun had been tampered with.
0DI0007896	An assassin attacked the president in full view of the crowd, but was not apprehended. Witness descriptions of the killer differ wildly.
0DI0007897	An NCR private scheduled to receive an award exploded as he reached the stage, killing the president in the blast.
0DI0007898	He added he didn't want to see the NCR in the ghetto, and called for a mass, quote, return to sender.
0DI0007899	[Cachino] Said he'd always wanted to sleep with the Lakelurks.
0DI0007900	[No-Bark Noonan] Don't you laugh at me. I know a spell that'll make you show your true form. Cave rat taught it to me. 
0DI0007901	Listeners are not advised to follow that path in hopes of similar results.
0DI0007902	[Private Morales] Esteban's going home now. I can't tell you what that means to me.
0DI0007903	[Marjorie] Nor is he allowed to sample the world-class cuisine of the Gourmand, New Vegas' only 5-star restaurant.
0DI0007904	The legate then ordered a tenth of his own force be killed by the other nine tenths. And you thought your boss was a pain.
0DI0007905	Once again, NCR President Aaron Kimball, dead at 48.
0DI0007906	In other news...
0DI0007907	Also in the headlines...
0DI0007908	Moving on..,
0DI0007909	Also...
0DI0007910	In addition...
0DI0007911	One more story for you...
0DI0007912	[SUCCEEDED] Being sentimental is not how I made the Crimson Caravan so successful, but I'll allow it, just this once.
0DI0007913	Janet will be paid what she's owed. Consider it a gift.
0DI0007914	[FAILED] You'll have to try harder than that. The rumors about my heart being made of stone are true.
0DI0007915	[SUCCEEDED] Intriguing. Janet puts in a good word for me, and the Crimson Caravan gains exclusive access to the Boomers. Yes, that works for me.
0DI0007917	[FAILED] The Crimson Caravan Company's operations require dependable employees. I'm not going to reward someone for breaking their work contract.
0DI0007918	Take all the time you need.
0DI0007919	I'm glad to hear it.
0DI0007920	Most merchant companies - successful merchant companies, rather - have them. It can be inconvenient to replace employees on short notice.
0DI0007921	The contracts keep employees around for a specific duration of time, after which they get paid - after their upkeep expenses are deducted, of course.
0DI0007922	Food, water, living quarters, medicine, and clothes - just the basic stuff. It all comes out of the Company's coffers.
0DI0007923	Yes, and they have been for decades now. The hired hands know what they're signing up for - we don't hide anything with fancy talk.
0DI0007924	That's because we are. We always pay up when the contract ends, though. Won't stay in business long if you've got a reputation as a cheat.
0DI0007926	Need anything else?
0DI0007927	Well, pain-killers are easy to come by, but it isn't easy finding iodine, allergy meds, and a few of these other items. Why do you ask?
0DI0007928	Really?  Huh, never thought of that.  The Crimson Caravan isn't really in the drug business.
0DI0007930	Excellent.  We should be able to get the shipments started in about a week.
0DI0007931	[SUCCEEDED] Well, the Far Go Traders have been trying to edge us out on the new armor contract for the troops. This could swing things in our favor.
0DI0007932	All right, let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
0DI0007933	[FAILED] This is business. I really can't cut them a deal on the cost.
0DI0007934	[SUCCEEDED] That should work. We'll do a weighted exchanged based on the going value of meat and vegetables. Water is invaluable in this dusty hole.
0DI0007935	Let McCarran know they should expect the first shipment in a week or so.
0DI0007936	[FAILED] We don't need vegetables, and besides, they spoil. The meat you can dry and turn into jerky.
0DI0007937	Trade routes, my friend, trade routes. Just about every major town in the wasteland has a Crimson Caravan branch in it.
0DI0007938	Out here, we usually split our caravans into smaller bands - that way, we don't lose everything if they get hit.
0DI0007939	It's not very efficient, though, but hopefully we'll be able to start running larger caravans once things get civilized.
0DI0007940	A little place in the NCR called Oak Creek. Used to be a farming town until it got taken over by ranchers.
0DI0007941	I didn't want to herd Brahmin for a living, so I signed on with the Crimson Caravan and headed east. Not much to tell, really.
0DI0007942	Oh, heck, I've heard of you. Supposed to be a regular hero or something, ain't that right?
0DI0007943	But maybe you're a little too... "reputable" to get involved in some dirty work for the Republic.
0DI0007944	I've heard of you. You're just the kind of person I'm looking for. Not afraid of stepping on a few toes to get a job done. Think you can lend a hand?
0DI0007945	Is that so? Can't say I've ever heard a good word about you. Lot of bad ones, though.
0DI0007946	So why don't you just turn your butt around and scoot back down the road before I blast some daylight through you?
0DI0007947	My apologies, but that name and face ain't ringing the old school bell upstairs. Afraid I can't let you through until the "situation" is resolved.
0DI0007948	Much obliged.
0DI0007951	If you had a few dozen doses of Psycho on you, maybe we could pep these weepy troopers into charging down into Nelson and taking back the camp.
0DI0007952	But since that's not likely, you could help me take out the Legion's trooper hostages.
0DI0007954	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel, and a body bag and we'll get started.
0DI0007955	Well, you'll probably be fine. For a little while, anyway.
0DI0007958	And now, I'd like to play one of my very favorite songs for you.
0DI0007959	Ladies and gentlemen, this next song goes out from me to you.
0DI0007960	More classics coming right up for you. So stay tuned.
0DI0007961	Coming up, I've got some tunes I think you all are gonna like.

0DI0007964	You're gonna love this next song. I guarantee it.

0DI0007967	This next song is... just magical. I hope you enjoy.
0DI0007968	This next song helped me through a very difficult time in my life. I hope one day it can do the same for you.
0DI0007969	Got some songs coming up for you right now. At least one is probably about love.
0DI0007970	We've got some news for you, coming right up.
0DI0007971	All the latest news, coming your way right now. 
0DI0007972	If you like news, you're gonna love our next segment.

0DI0007976	And now the news.

0DI0007979	Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora, here.
0DI0007980	I've got news for you.
0DI0007981	That's all for now. This is Mr. New Vegas saying, I'm just no good without you.
0DI0007982	You know I think all news, whether it's good or bad, brings us closer together. Don't you?
0DI0007983	That's all I have for you. This is Mr. New Vegas, wishing you ladylike luck tonight.
0DI0007984	Boy, the Mojave Wasteland is just a fascinating place, isn't it? You never know what'll happen next.
0DI0007985	We'll have more news for you at the top of the hour.
0DI0007986	You know, they say no news is good news. But I think my program would be awfully dull if that were the case.
0DI0007987	Those were our top stories.
0DI0007988	And that's the news.
0DI0007989	Stay classy, New Vegas.
0DI0007990	Mojave, mo problems, am I right?
0DI0007991	That's the news. This is Mr. New Vegas, filling in for Mr. New Vegas.
0DI0007992	Those are our stories this hour. This is Mr. New Vegas signing off. Just kidding. I'm not going anywhere. My love for you is too strong.
0DI0007993	That news was brought to you by the Tops Casino. You'll dig us, baby! We're the Tops!

0DI0008000	Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has died in a tragic revolver-cleaning accident inside his locked office at Camp Golf.
0DI0008001	Sources report the NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, has unexpectedly passed away. NCR soldiers rallied to show their support for the officer.
0DI0008002	Word out of Camp Golf is that many NCR Rangers can expect redeployment in the near future. One anonymous soldier said it was part of a new strategy.

0DI0008006	Tensions are brewing in Freeside between the ruling gang known as the Kings and the large number of NCR squatters seeking refuge there.
0DI0008007	The Kings have been killed in a fight with NCR forces after weeks of mounting hostility. Witnesses report The King's last word was simply "Don't."

0DI0008011	Gomorrah is under new management after the sudden departure of Omerta bosses Nero and Big Sal. The Casino's new manager spoke to reporters.

0DI0008013	Rumors continue to swell that Mr. House, the father of New Vegas, has passed away. Who will fill the power vacuum on the Strip remains uncertain.

0DI0008015	A Legion slaver party was wiped out in a failed raid of the Bitter Springs refugee camp, with two armed civilians inflicting heavy Legion casualties.
0DI0008016	The Bitter Springs refugee camp has been overrun by Legion slavers. Refugees should stay away, and avoid talking to strangers in football pads.
0DI0008017	A hostage crisis between the NCR and Great Khans was resolved peacefully when a third-party negotiator successfully secured the hostages' release.
0DI0008018	A group of Great Khans were killed in a bloody end to a hostage crisis in Boulder City. It's not currently known why the Khans were in the area.

0DI0008028	Rumors have surfaced that Tops Hotel owner Benny has taken yet another unexpected leave of absence. We spoke to his right-hand man, Swank.
0DI0008029	We have unconfirmed reports that Caesar has died in his base camp after a failed surgery, performed by an unknown and possibly unqualified surgeon.
0DI0008030	We're hearing rumors that Caesar may have been assassinated by an unknown party. It is currently unknown how the assassin was able to evade security.

0DI0008070	For around five years now. I handle the supply ends of things - raw materials and stuff.
0DI0008071	Makers of the finest high-grade weapons and ammunition in the wasteland.
0DI0008072	If you ever get your hands on a piece of sweet, deadly hardware, there's a good chance that it came from one of our factories.
0DI0008073	[SUCCEEDED] I guess we'll have to.  If Caesar's Legion drives the NCR from the area, there goes ninety percent of our business.
0DI0008074	I don't like the idea of buying supplies from our competition, but it's only temporary. We'll call in extra supplies from our distributors.
0DI0008075	Let Contreras know we'll have the extra guns and ammo ready for the next shipment.
0DI0008076	[FAILED] Oh hell, no.  Working with our competition is not an option.
0DI0008077	[SUCCEEDED] You're right.  I suppose we could refurbish used and damaged weapons to fill the order.
0DI0008078	They'll be in like new condition and then we can use our loader to make fresh ammo from spent brass.
0DI0008079	We'll have to wait a few days for gunpowder, but this might just work out.  Tell Contreras the extra guns and ammo will be in the next shipment.
0DI0008080	[FAILED] Sorry, but blackening our reputation with our biggest client isn't worth the risk.
0DI0008081	No problem.
0DI0008082	Well, I guess so.  Look.  We just need metal, and lots of it.
0DI0008083	We can handle the weapons, we just need extra scrap to melt down for the bullets.
0DI0008084	I'll give you some caps for each piece of metal you can bring me.  Anything like scrap, cans, or any basic junk made of metal will do.
0DI0008085	I'll need at least 100 pieces to have enough for the bullets.  I'll cash in whatever you've got until we have enough.  Good luck.
0DI0008086	None whatsoever. Everything inside the fence is off-limits, and the guards have strict orders to shoot to kill.
0DI0008087	A lot of our high-end weaponry comes from Pre-War military schematics. If our competition got a hold of them, it'd be bad for business.
0DI0008088	Thanks, that'll help.
0DI0008097	Well, keep at it.
0DI0008098	Out here, we don't have bosses. Me, the gunsmiths, and the guards all know what we're supposed to be doing.
0DI0008099	Working for the Gun Runners is a sweet job. None of us would dare screw it up.
0DI0008100	Yep. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
0DI0008101	Here you go. I promised you an extra reward for coming along, so that's what you get.
0DI0008102	Maybe, maybe not. I always warned him not to push my buttons. Well, ain't nobody going to miss him, anyways.
0DI0008105	It's been a pleasure.
0DI0008106	I'm afraid we have no current openings for caravaneers or guards, but I'm in need of a runner.
0DI0008107	Deliver this invoice to Dr. Hildern. You can find him somewhere inside Camp McCarran.
0DI0008108	I see. Was there anything else, then?
0DI0008109	As much as I like to handle matters personally, I can't be everywhere at once.
0DI0008110	There is a negotiation with a smaller trading outfit that I'd like resolved as quickly as possible.
0DI0008111	There's also the matter of Henry Jamison, an employee whose services I'd rather do without. His family connections make it difficult, however.
0DI0008112	And finally, I need someone to "acquire" the Gun Runner's manufacturing specifications. This job needs to be quiet - no alarms, no deaths.
0DI0008113	Certainly. What would you like to know?
0DI0008114	The Crimson Caravan Company has been in business for over 130 years. We're partially responsible for the progress in the NCR.
0DI0008115	Well, the Gun Runners continue to dominate the weapons market, and the Mormon traders from New Canaan control the majority of the northern routes.
0DI0008116	Normally, I oversee company operations at the Hub in California. However, the New Vegas branch has been underperforming in recent years.
0DI0008117	Given the conditions here, it's not hard to see why. I'll change all that, soon enough.
0DI0008118	All right. Is there anything else I can do for you?
0DI0008119	There's a small trading outfit, Cassidy Caravans, that I'm interested in acquiring. They've been rather competitive, so it's time to buy them out.
0DI0008120	I have it on good authority that the owner, Cass, wants out of the caravan business.
0DI0008121	Cass frequently trades with the NCR, so you'll likely find her at the Mojave Outpost.
0DI0008122	The Jamisons are very wealthy ranchers back in Redding, California and significant investors in the Crimson Caravan Company.
0DI0008123	I was pressured into posting young Henry as the manager of the New Vegas branch. As you can see, he wasn't exactly cut out for the job.
0DI0008124	He was much more interested in gambling and prostitutes, and because of his family, I can't simply fire him.
0DI0008125	Henry needs to be convinced to quit, one way or another. I won't have a useless employee on the company payroll.
0DI0008126	The quality of the Gun Runners' armaments is due to their manufacturing process. They craft all weapons on-site.
0DI0008127	I want to know the secrets of their manufacturing process, which means you'll need to find some way to get inside their heavily-guarded factory.
0DI0008128	I would greatly prefer that you perform this job undetected and without killing anyone, if it can be helped.
0DI0008129	Thank you. Was there something else?
0DI0008130	Fuck no. No matter what that old bitch McLafferty says, my dad said I could be in charge of the New Vegas branch.
0DI0008131	Besides, I got into a little money trouble with the Omertas. If I quit the Crimson Caravan, how am I supposed to get the money to gamble?
0DI0008133	One of the families that runs the Strip. They're a pack of cheaters, but you still don't want to fuck with them.
0DI0008134	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, whatever. Forget the severance. Just get the Omertas off my back, and you can tell McLafferty she won't see my face again.
0DI0008135	[FAILED] Tough shit. That's what I want, or I'm not going anywhere.
0DI0008136	We done, then?
0DI0008137	You do that. And tell the old bitch to pay up quick, you hear?
0DI0008138	I wanted to be where the action is, so I got my dad to pull some strings and get me a cushy position with the Crimson Caravan.
0DI0008139	Everything was great until McLafferty came along. That old bitch is gonna hear about it from my dad, just you wait.
0DI0008140	That's all right.
0DI0008141	Have a seat in the Auto-Doc. This will take a few hours.
0DI0008144	Huh. I've never seen a coin toss go someone's way that many times. You certainly don't need the help of a Probability Calculator implant.
0DI0008145	If fact, you ought to be on the Strip cleaning out the casinos.
0DI0008146	If I implant the Probability Calculator in your frontal lobe, you'll be able to calculate odds a little better.
0DI0008147	It's not quite the same as making you luckier, but you'll be able to nudge things your way more often. I can do the implant for 4000 caps.
0DI0008158	All right, this will only take a few minutes.
0DI0008161	Yes, I am. I received my medical training at the Angel's Boneyard Medical University back in the NCR.
0DI0008162	It's not a requirement to be a Follower to enter the university, but I believe in what they do, so I joined them.
0DI0008163	Of course! We prefer bulk donations of 500 caps - it's apparently a lot easier on the accountants, for some reason.
0DI0008164	We believe that technology for basic necessities, like food, water, and medicine, should be shared, not hoarded.
0DI0008165	We're also strongly in favor of proper education. I've come across more than a few "doctors" whose techniques came out of the back of a magazine.
0DI0008166	We've worked with them in the past. The NCR became too focused on things like patents and profitability, so the Followers go their own way now.
0DI0008167	The NCR and the Followers have a cool relationship at the moment. We see them as oppressive, and they view us as anarchists.
0DI0008168	Yes, the Mormon Fort in Freeside. It's hard to miss.
0DI0008169	Very much appreciated. These caps will go towards funding schools and other services to the poorer part of the community.
0DI0008176	Not interested? Not interested?
0DI0008177	You have an interest in this even if you're too stupid to know it. If you have an interest in breathing, you have an interest in this.
0DI0008178	Return to the Fort and do whatever it takes to recover the Chip.
0DI0008179	It was a place of splendor. As magnificent as today's Strip may seem, it's but a shadow of the neon paradise that was Las Vegas.
0DI0008180	I grew up not far from here, and though I traveled the old world extensively, I never found another place like it.
0DI0008181	By 2065 I deemed it a mathematical certainty that an atomic war would devastate the Earth within 15 years. Every projection I ran confirmed it.
0DI0008182	I knew I couldn't "save the world," nor did I care to. But I could save Vegas, and in the process, perhaps, save mankind.
0DI0008183	I set to work immediately. I thought I had plenty of time to prepare. As it turned out, I was 20 hours short.
0DI0008184	On the day of the Great War, 77 atomic warheads targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas.
0DI0008185	My networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 warheads, neutralizing them before impact.
0DI0008186	Laser cannons mounted on the roof of the Lucky 38 destroyed another 9 warheads. The rest got through, though none hit the city itself.
0DI0008187	A sub-optimal performance, admittedly. If only the Platinum Chip had arrived a day sooner...
0DI0008188	The Platinum Chip was printed in Sunnyvale, California on October 22nd, 2077 - the day before the Great War.
0DI0008189	It was to have been delivered by courier the following afternoon... but by then, the world had ended.
0DI0008190	The Chip contained vital software upgrades, but not just for my Securitrons. Every aspect of the missile defense grid would have been upgraded, too.
0DI0008191	Given that I had to make do with buggy software, the outcome could have been worse. I nearly died as it was.
0DI0008192	Software glitches set off a cascade of system crashes. I had to take the Lucky 38's reactor offline, lest it melt down.
0DI0008193	For nearly five years I battled power outages and more system crashes until I finally managed to reboot my data core with an older version of the OS.
0DI0008194	I spent the next few decades in a veritable coma. But I survived, obviously - and eventually thrived.
0DI0008196	I don't know. Some kind of man-fish freak like the one I killed over there.
0DI0008197	I'd heard fishermen spin old tales of 'Lakelurks' swimming in the water, but I always thought they were just bullshit mermaid stories.
0DI0008198	Fool! We've fortified this place to hold out indefinitely against an army. What chance do you think you have?
0DI0008199	The army of bloodthirsty maniacs with you would disagree. No, I think I'll hold the fort here until our reinforcements arrive.
0DI0008200	If that's true, then there's nothing else for it. My men and I will hold out as long as we can.
0DI0008201	Do you really think your ragtag band of slavers has more manpower than the armed forces of the NCR?
0DI0008202	I'd pit one of my men against two of your cutthroats any day. Backed by additional troops, we'll mop the floor with your pathetic Legion.
0DI0008203	And go where? According to you, the road west is blocked. And while you might let us by, I highly doubt your allies will do the same.
0DI0008204	My thoughts exactly.
0DI0008205	Better that than simply give up. What other option is available? Retreat?
0DI0008206	Then let's get this over with.
0DI0008207	[SUCCEEDED] Perhaps I do have a secret tunnel out of here. But that doesn't change anything. My duty is to stay and fight.
0DI0008208	[FAILED] Even if we hadn't blocked the river to prevent the Legion from coming at us from the south, that'd be absurd.
0DI0008209	Caesar's forces are arrayed all along the eastern bank. We'd be under fire the whole way.
0DI0008210	My men and I are soldiers. We share an obligation to follow orders. And our orders are to hold this dam.
0DI0008211	It will see that our orders are carried through to the end. That's what good soldiers do.
0DI0008212	[SUCCEEDED] Y-You're right. These men have placed their lives in my hands, and I won't throw them away for a lost cause.
0DI0008213	Don't expect to hold this place for very long, however. The NCR will be back.
0DI0008214	[FAILED] It sure as hell is. Aside from being an important source of power and water, it's a symbol of hope.
0DI0008215	Though I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.
0DI0008216	We choose to stay, though I think we'll all debate you on the dying part.
0DI0008217	I suppose there's no point in remaining here any longer. Very well, my men and I will leave.
0DI0008219	Wow, I wish I had more of them. All this interest. It'd be my biggest seller.
0DI0008220	I sold it to a man not too long ago. Real twitchy, nervous sort of guy. Kinda seemed like he was wiggin' out about something.
0DI0008221	Had a funny collar on. I wanted to ask him about it but I figured maybe I'd regret asking. People are weird around here.
0DI0008222	Well it was metal, and kind of thick. At first I thought he'd come from Gomorrah, but they're more into leather there.
0DI0008223	Didn't look comfortable. He kept reaching up like he was gonna itch it, but he always stopped himself.
0DI0008224	No, but I know where he was going. He asked me if I knew of any place where he could hide out for a while.
0DI0008225	Wanted somewhere with concrete walls. Something about airwaves. I forget.
0DI0008226	But I guess he spent all his money on the rangefinder, because he said it had to be somewhere free to stay.
0DI0008227	I said I didn't know about anything like that around here. But if he wanted to live for free, a lot of people do that in Freeside.
0DI0008228	I know there's a concrete building there across from Mick and Ralph's. No ceiling, but I think it still counts.
0DI0008229	Went up there one time to try and... you know... meet my neighbors in the biz. But you know, I don't think they took me very seriously.
0DI0008230	Oh he was pretty average, I'd say. Average height, average age. Dark hair. Beard of some kind.
0DI0008231	Thank Mars. The assault can resume.
0DI0008232	The only thing down there is a swim of several hundred feet against the current. You'd drown for sure.
0DI0008233	This slaughter pleases me. No act is more sacred than consecrating a site in the blood of one's enemies.
0DI0008234	The rest of the dam is fully under our control. A few pitiful holdouts remain, but their time is short. The general was the last source of concern.
0DI0008235	With their commander dead, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
0DI0008236	Judging by the lack of blood, I take it the coward Oliver fled rather than face me. No matter.
0DI0008238	With their commander gone, the NCR will pull out of this region, allowing our conquest to continue westward unopposed for a time.
0DI0008239	The Legion will swell with the number of slaves we will claim from this place, and the tribute we gather will fund further campaigns.
0DI0008240	Perhaps, in time, I will be granted the honor of conquering the land known as California. But for now, we rest.
0DI0008241	Know that your efforts are appreciated and will not go unrewarded. But we can speak of that later.
0DI0008242	For now, come, we must see to the burning of the dead.
0DI0008243	Blah.
0DI0008244	Finally, Mars has accepted my sacrifices and unleashes me.
0DI0008245	Legatus, a stranger arrives. One who bears the Mark.
0DI0008246	And yet you managed to slip past. Impressive. You may not find the fighting to the west quite so easy to get around, however.
0DI0008247	Good news, indeed. If only the same could be said for the west.
0DI0008248	The enemy is much more fortified ahead, and have snipers set up at key positions, which keep our men pinned down.
0DI0008249	In addition, they've managed to beat back our men emerging from the intake tower ahead and secure it.
0DI0008250	If we could just get rid of those damn snipers, or release our waiting men in the intake tower, we'd have the manpower to storm their positions.
0DI0008251	My contubernium came up through one of the intake towers ahead and headed east, taking the NCR fools unawares from behind.
0DI0008252	Their confusion allowed us to slaughter them like brahmin calves. Unfortunately, my brothers heading west did not fare as well.
0DI0008253	Any assistance you can provide is welcome, and will mean more of our men to carve through the foe by your side.
0DI0008254	Then I wish you luck, and good hunting.
0DI0008255	Ha ha, Mars favors the bold, does he not?
0DI0008256	This is definitely part of my missing supplies. I'll talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
0DI0008257	[SUCCEEDED] I... I guess you're right. I'll do the right thing and turn myself in.
0DI0008262	Understandable. Let me know when you've decided.
0DI0008267	Look, I'm not leaving this place 'til I have what I came for. I'll be in the storage basement if you change your mind.
0DI0008268	Damn right it is. Now let's get going.
0DI0008269	Then get your ass back into town before talking to me. I wanna know you're serious about this.
0DI0008270	Okay, but please find him as soon as you can.
0DI0008271	What? How? What happened?
0DI0008272	What? Why the hell would you do that? Are you insane?
0DI0008273	Dammit! Okay, well, thank you for finding out at least. Was there something else you needed?
0DI0008274	Oh, because that makes it so much better! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
0DI0008275	You're psychotic! Get out of my sight, I have nothing to say to you any more!
0DI0008276	Huh? Wait, what are you talking about? We're allied with Caesar now? Psh. Typical. Nobody tells me anything.
0DI0008277	Oh, nothing really. Just trying to psych myself up to try my initiation. Again. Raaaar!
0DI0008278	I can tell you they're a bunch of big dumb jerks with no appreciation for art. I mean, can you believe their initiation?
0DI0008279	You would? Really? Okay, well then, here goes:
0DI0008280	This one's a haiku.
0DI0008281	Radscorpion bites,
0DI0008282	my foot in the box canyon.
0DI0008283	Ow, ow, ow, ow... ow.
0DI0008284	I wrote this limerick the last time I went to Freeside.
0DI0008285	There once was a fellow called Garret,
0DI0008286	whose sister she did love to bare it.
0DI0008287	She flashed it around, all over town,
0DI0008288	so if you would screw her, beware it.
0DI0008289	I, uh, got kicked out of the Atomic Wrangler for that one.
0DI0008290	This is a poem I wrote about the dark loneliness that suffuses my soul.
0DI0008291	Rainclouds wrap my heart in sorrow black as silk,
0DI0008292	My empty scream does not echo, even though we're in a canyon.
0DI0008293	My soul aches, but not as much as my limbs, because I've been beaten severely.
0DI0008294	Here's one about the girl I love.
0DI0008295	Her hair stands tall, like the spiky bits on a Deathclaw.
0DI0008296	Her eyes are bright as radioactive sludge, glowing with the light of love.
0DI0008297	But when I talk to her, she laughs and mocks and has her brothers beat me.
0DI0008298	Oh, why do nice girls hate me?
0DI0008299	That's it. What do you think??
0DI0008300	Oh. You heard that, huh? Okay, so yeah, I was writing poetry. I know, I know, it's not a very Great Khan-like thing to do.
0DI0008301	The Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp when I was a kid, and they brought a bunch of old books. I used to read pre-War poetry for hours.
0DI0008302	Yeah, well, I guess maybe I'm not. But what else can I do?
0DI0008303	Sure, okay.
0DI0008304	Have you seen this tribe? If it's not an epic drunken ballad of cracking skulls and hearing lamentations they think it's a waste of time.
0DI0008305	You'd do that? Thanks! I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
0DI0008306	I don't know. I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
0DI0008307	You think so? I mean, I'd go myself, but what if they said no? The Khans wouldn't take me back, and then I'd have nobody.
0DI0008308	No, I suppose not.
0DI0008309	Not much. They found us when we came to the Mojave, gave us a bunch of books on science and history - I guess they're like teachers or something?
0DI0008310	We're always looking for new members. Does he have any particular talent?
0DI0008311	Hmm. Well, I suppose we could always use another junior archivist in the library. All right, tell him we'll accept him as a probationary initiate.
0DI0008312	Excellent! Ezekiel's been after me to find him a new assistant for ages. Tell the boy we'll take him.
0DI0008313	Ah. Well... I suppose we could always find him a place. Maybe doing inventory on the Pre-War Unexploded Munitions Collection back West.
0DI0008314	All right, tell the boy to report here, he can leave on the next caravan.
0DI0008315	They did? That's great! Thank you! I'm out of this crummy camp!
0DI0008316	I've got a message for you from Papa Khan. He wants you to return to Red Rock Canyon and speak to him as soon as possible.
0DI0008317	You're already quite charming. The Empathy Synthesizer would just be a waste of caps, I'm afraid.
0DI0008318	The Empathy Synthesizer will allow you to more easily pick up on subtle emotions and body language. The price is 4,000 caps.
0DI0008319	That would be the NEMEAN Sub-Dermal Armor. It's a bit pricey - 8,000 caps - but the implant causes your skin cells to be bolstered with iron.
0DI0008320	It won't make you bulletproof, but it will make you a little harder to injure.
0DI0008321	That's the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder. The implant speeds up cell regeneration, an effect similar to that of some lizards and sea creatures.
0DI0008322	The implant is very expensive, however - 12,000 caps.
0DI0008325	The Platinum Chip unlocks this bunker. Hence, you have it.
0DI0008326	Hence, Benny was captured or killed - possibly by you, but by my estimates, far more probably by Caesar's Legion. Hence, Caesar gave you the Chip.
0DI0008327	Hence, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
0DI0008328	That you were searched very thoroughly when you arrived at the Fort is a certainty. And as the Chip is a little too large to be secreted away...
0DI0008329	I also regard it a certainty that the Chip was discovered, taken from you, and given to Caesar - who returned it to you.
0DI0008330	Two plus two equaling four, Caesar wants you to destroy whatever you find in this bunker.
0DI0008331	But that's not going to happen, because you're going to work for me.
0DI0008332	That's rather obvious, isn't it?
0DI0008333	Surely you know that I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
0DI0008334	I oversaw the city's renovations starting from 2274 onward. The Three Families are my employees.
0DI0008335	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a kind of barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
0DI0008336	It's a facility I built many years before you were born. You might think of it as a barracks. You'll understand soon enough.
0DI0008337	Was that meant to be a shocking revelation? Of course Caesar wants it destroyed - he's afraid of what the bunker might hold, and rightly so.
0DI0008338	But you're not going to do that. You're going to do the smart thing, and work for me.
0DI0008339	I don't respond well to threats. Now, where were we...?
0DI0008340	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, you'll receive a nice bonus when the work is done. And speaking of getting it done...
0DI0008341	[FAILED] You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip, and you'll be paid when the delivery is made.
0DI0008342	Good. I won't hold you up any longer.
0DI0008343	I like to think you have enough sense to do the right thing. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.
0DI0008344	So what are you doing here? Return to the Fort at once.
0DI0008345	Recover the Platinum Chip. Once you've entered the bunker hidden beneath the weather station, you'll receive further instructions.
0DI0008346	Are you a child? The Platinum Chip was taken from you, obviously.
0DI0008347	That would make for a welcome change.
0DI0008348	Then gather together the firepower or explosives or whatever else you need and improvise.
0DI0008349	I don't care if you have to kill every Legionary at the Fort. Get the job done.
0DI0008350	Goodbye? Is that some kind of joke? You barely understand what I want you to accomplish down there.
0DI0008351	I've spent too many years waiting for this moment to see it fumbled by an insubordinate contractor.
0DI0008352	I can't reach through this monitor and compell you to follow instructions, but know this - if you disappoint me, you will pay for it.
0DI0008353	It is obvious to you that I built this place? The Platinum Chip opened it, after all?
0DI0008354	In any case, you're here. So let's get to it.
0DI0008355	My army will do what an army does best - defend territory from invaders... and maintain order.
0DI0008356	The same equipment failure that prevents me from remotely operating this facility seems to have activated its security robots and turrets.
0DI0008357	There's a security room near the base of the stairs... perhaps you can deactivate them yourself.
0DI0008358	Listen to me, very carefully. I've waited too long for this moment for you to go fouling it up on a lark.
0DI0008359	Do as I say, and your rewards will be immense. Thwart me, and your punishment will become the purpose of my existence.
0DI0008360	Then there will be no safe haven for you.
0DI0008361	I see - you're in a predicament.
0DI0008362	Just off the turbine room down below are three power regulators. It's a redundant system - only one is needed.
0DI0008363	Go ahead and destroy one. The explosion will be large enough to be heard and felt aboveground.
0DI0008364	The bunker will be destroyed, and you'll die instantly.
0DI0008365	I see that now. I thought I knew him better than that. But it was like talking to a stranger.
0DI0008366	No. Our case wouldn't be any stronger if tomorrow they all died when their energy weapons backfired.
0DI0008367	I just didn't expect that. There was no getting through to him.
0DI0008368	Well I knew he wouldn't listen to me. That's why we went out of our way to find something that he couldn't ignore.
0DI0008369	But it didn't make any difference.
0DI0008370	How can I help them when they won't accept it?
0DI0008371	It wouldn't matter. The Elder has final say.
0DI0008372	The hell of it is he's one of our most progressive members. If I can't get him to agree, it's hopeless.
0DI0008373	He won't tolerate any resistance. If he catches wind I've been talking to people, he'll charge me with sedition.
0DI0008374	I... I don't know if I can stay. Maybe it'd be better for everyone if I left. Spent my life... somewhere else.
0DI0008375	Work with the Followers of the Apocalypse, maybe. Put my knowledge to some good use.
0DI0008376	Or I can stay here with the people I care about and do... whatever I can, until it comes to a slow or sudden end.
0DI0008377	Ha! Well that's... imaginative. But it's not really for me.
0DI0008378	I couldn't get one of their most reasonable members to accept a rational argument. I don't see them coming out in droves to support my coup.
0DI0008379	And that's really not what the Brotherhood needs right now anyway. They're hanging by a thread.
0DI0008380	They may be a bunch of wooden conformists, but anything I did without them would feel... empty.
0DI0008381	I'd always be reminded of this day. How I wasn't strong enough to stand by them.
0DI0008382	So I guess I'll stay. Won't be easy, but at least I won't feel guilty about the choice.
0DI0008383	Let's get going. I'd like to get my mind off all this. And some fresh air would do me some good right about now.
0DI0008384	There's no getting around that, is there? What would my life be like here, knowing what's to come?
0DI0008385	They're not going to like this. We're given a chance when we're young to choose whether to stay. If we do, it's supposed to be for life.
0DI0008386	But they haven't left me any choice. It's this or a lifetime of scavenging and watching my friends die in losing battles. I guess it's settled, then.
0DI0008387	Not even a hint, huh? Geez, I really am all alone on this one.
0DI0008388	I guess I'll stay. If I left there wouldn't be any coming back. It might be something I'd instantly regret.
0DI0008389	Things are going to get harder for the Brotherhood before they get easier. I should support them in whatever way I can.
0DI0008390	I suppose you've given me no reason not to trust you. Fine, take the data and go. I hope you know what you're doing.
0DI0008391	He didn't say, but it sounded very important.
0DI0008392	Excellent. I'll let him know you're coming. Good luck out there.
0DI0008393	That's too bad. I hope you'll change your mind.
0DI0008394	In exchange for great Caesar's promise of all the lands west of New Vegas, the Khans have agreed to fight alongside the Legion when the time comes.
0DI0008395	I am one of the frumentarii: it is my duty to scout the Wastes in Caesar's name and make contact with any tribes that might serve a useful purpose.
0DI0008396	You might say I'm somewhere between a scout and an ambassador. I'm assigned here as part of the alliance between the Legion and the Great Khans.
0DI0008397	Though they have been cruelly oppressed by the NCR, the Khans remain great warriors. The Legion is honored to have such allies in battle.
0DI0008398	Speak, then.
0DI0008399	You don't have to say anything - I am Papa Khan, and I have spoken. When I'm gone, you will lead the tribe.
0DI0008400	In a hurry, are you? Very well then: The Great Khans came east out of the NCR 14 years ago. We ruled the Wastes, then, and called no man master.
0DI0008401	But we underestimated the Families of the Strip, and they drove us back to Bitter Springs, where we remained until the NCR arrived and drove us here.
0DI0008402	Typical. No reverence for history in the younger generations.
0DI0008403	They allied with Mr. House, the self-proclaimed master of New Vegas. He supported them with the resources of New Vegas: weapons, technology, caps.
0DI0008404	They were better equipped, and we could not stand against them.
0DI0008405	When the NCR came to the Mojave, we thought they would be easy pickings. We raided their caravans, their towns, their camps - they couldn't stop us.
0DI0008406	At least, that's what we thought. They tracked us to Bitter Springs and surrounded us.
0DI0008407	When our children, our sick and old, fled through a nearby pass, the NCR gunned them down.
0DI0008408	Oh, they claimed it was a miscommunication, but tell that to those who saw our families butchered. Tell it to the survivors who were banished here.
0DI0008409	It's because of that that we have sworn to take revenge on the NCR. With our new allies in Caesar's Legion, we will crush them!
0DI0008410	Then when I die, you can pass control of the Great Khans on to Regis. For now you are my heir, and will be accorded the honor of that position.
0DI0008411	Nothing, forget about it. I shouldn't be talking about this with an outsider.
0DI0008412	I probably shouldn't say anything, but it seems Papa's been making decisions based more on his desire for revenge than what's good for the tribe.
0DI0008413	This alliance with Caesar, for one thing - I have my doubts about it.
0DI0008414	I really don't like to talk about it. Let's just say it was a tragedy and the NCR is to blame, and we'll leave it at that.
0DI0008415	Sure, go ahead.
0DI0008416	I just don't trust the words of Caesar's ambassador that much. He's promising a lot, and I don't see the advantage for him. It makes me suspicious.
0DI0008417	As you wish. When Caesar goes to war, we go with him.
0DI0008418	As you wish. When the Republic goes to war, we go with it.
0DI0008419	I... very well. If that's what you want, that's what we'll do.
0DI0008420	I'll start the preparations and we'll leave when the NCR is distracted by Caesar's attack.
0DI0008421	As you wish, chieftain.
0DI0008422	What does the Codex say?
0DI0008423	The Codex is clear on this. It's-
0DI0008424	A bunch of closed-minded bullshit.
0DI0008425	We do not help them, or let them in.
0DI0008426	It says they can't be trusted.
0DI0008427	But-
0DI0008428	We keep knowledge they must never have.
0DI0008429	It says that we are to protect humanity from them at all costs.
0DI0008430	Give it a chance. For me. I can't stay here and watch us waste away.
0DI0008431	I'm sorry.
0DI0008432	I can't.
0DI0008433	We'll die out.
0DI0008434	<Sighs> I know.
0DI0008435	Then we will accept that fate with honor.
0DI0008436	Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.
0DI0008437	We unlocked the secret of HELIOS One.
0DI0008438	What? Wonderful news!
0DI0008439	Then we have a game-changing weapon.
0DI0008440	No. It's not. ARCHIMEDES II is an orbital laser. Effective only outdoors in a limited radius and requiring a long recharge.
0DI0008441	In the hands of the enemy-
0DI0008442	It was worth keeping from our enemies. If they had it-
0DI0008443	They'd be marginally more effective. We lost most of the chapter defending glorified artillery.
0DI0008444	We couldn't have known. We fought for what we believed in.
0DI0008445	We did as the Codex dictated.
0DI0008446	And nearly died for it. Tomorrow you'd do it all over again, having learned nothing.
0DI0008447	Are you trying to shame me?
0DI0008448	How dare you insult the honor of the brothers and sisters who died there!
0DI0008449	I'm trying to open your eyes.
0DI0008450	We need to engage the outside world. We can't win without new recruits.
0DI0008451	Veronica. I hope-
0DI0008452	Shouldn't you be securing supplies for us?
0DI0008453	I brought you a present.
0DI0008454	This disk has secrets to breeding plants that can thrive in the wasteland.
0DI0008455	High Elder Maxson didn't found us to be botanists, Veronica.
0DI0008456	I'm waiting to hear why this deserves our attention.
0DI0008457	Think about it. No more trading guns for food. Total self-sufficiency. It's what we always wanted.
0DI0008458	This won't get us Hoover Dam.
0DI0008459	This won't defeat our enemies.
0DI0008460	Yes it will. If we feed people, they'll support us. They'll join us.
0DI0008461	We found a gun that disables power armor. One of these could defeat the whole Brotherhood.
0DI0008462	We have to stop limiting our focus to military technology. It won't save us.
0DI0008463	That could be the only one of its kind.
0DI0008464	Then it's a good thing this weapon has fallen into the right hands.
0DI0008465	That's not the point. Technology won't win our wars. We need numbers. New recruits.
0DI0008470	Well, it's not like I'm super-attached to working with Caesar or anything, but if it'll stop his patrols from harassing my runners, I'm all for it.
0DI0008471	Papa hasn't steered us wrong yet.
0DI0008472	I'll see you around.
0DI0008473	All right, then. Be patient since this will take awhile.
0DI0008475	Have a seat. This will take awhile.
0DI0008476	It might not look like much, but it's what keeps us Westside locals independent.
0DI0008477	We started it a few years ago. I admit, we had a lot of trouble at first, but eventually we got some help from Tom Anderson with the Followers.
0DI0008478	We're finally to the point where the co-op members can start making money from sales instead of just breaking even.
0DI0008480	Well, I've lived in Nevada all my life. Started out in New Reno, but headed down here as soon as I got the chance.
0DI0008481	If you can believe it, things are even worse back home. The whole city's still run by crime families. Used to be the Mordinos and Wrights.
0DI0008482	Now it's the Wrights and Van Graffs. Seems like things never get better. Anyway, that's all behind me now.
0DI0008483	It was Hector's idea, if you can believe it. He overheard me talking to Anderson about his idea to divert the water over here.
0DI0008484	We needed someone to be able to go into the cisterns and get the water out, but any of us would be suspicious. Hector volunteered.
0DI0008485	He said that no one pays attention to him, even with his brahmin. Anderson and I argued, but eventually we decided to let him go ahead with it.
0DI0008486	Look, this affects all of us, even Hector. What were we supposed to do, let all of our gardens die? Watch Westside fall apart?
0DI0008487	Pretty much what you'd expect. White talked to Hector and then went to talk to Anderson.
0DI0008488	White made the mistake of assuming that because Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse, he wouldn't try anything.
0DI0008489	Anderson acted docile, but as soon as White turned to go, Anderson shot him in the back. At least that's what Anderson told me.
0DI0008490	Wait... what are you going to do?
0DI0008491	You're the one who should be worried. Good luck.
0DI0008492	Please, just... don't let them shut down the co-op.
0DI0008495	Come back real soon!
0DI0008496	Papa Khan has been talking to Caesar's emissary for weeks now - they're always going on about crushing the NCR.
0DI0008497	Papa's announced that if Caesar goes to war against the NCR, the Khans will go with him.
0DI0008498	Red Rock Canyon isn't exactly the most hospitable place - there's no food, barely any water, and nothing anybody wants.
0DI0008499	We used to send patrols out to acquire supplies, but ever since Bitter Springs there just aren't enough of us left.
0DI0008500	Sure, what do you want to know?
0DI0008501	We're supplying things people want in exchange for things our tribe needs. Don't judge us.
0DI0008502	We make regular shipments to a lot of settlements around the Mojave - a lot of our business comes from the Fiends lately.
0DI0008503	Personally, I think they're kind of creepy, but Papa likes the fact that they get hopped up on Psycho and harass NCR patrols.
0DI0008505	We make the happy stuff. What do you need? Jet, Psycho, a little Med-X to ease the pain?
0DI0008507	Naw, man, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
0DI0008508	Naw, kitten, more like... drug suppliers. Yeah. Other folks sell 'em. Diane's mostly in charge of that.
0DI0008509	Guess I just had a natural talent for it. When I was a kid, these cats called the Followers of the Apocalypse came to our camp.
0DI0008510	They knew all kinds of kooky scientastical stuff, so I ate up all the chemistry they could teach. Diane had the head for business, so we teamed up.
0DI0008511	Diane's my girl, man. We've been taking care of each other our whole lives, ever since our folks died. Now we keep the Khans in caps together.
0DI0008512	Ah, the other dudes call him Jerry the Punk. That's kind of harsh, though - I think he's just a sensitive soul that needs some love.
0DI0008513	He's usually down around the proving ground if you want to say yo.
0DI0008514	What's on your brainpan?
0DI0008515	And what benefit would this alliance give us?
0DI0008516	You want a reason, how about four?
0DI0008517	They're called bodyguards, and every one of them is packing. Me, too - so baby makes five.
0DI0008518	Add to that every Chairman in this joint is armed, and not with some hold-out peashooter like maybe you smuggled through security.
0DI0008519	Anything I needed to worry about, baby, got confiscated at the door.
0DI0008520	You're bluffing, baby... Except maybe you're not.
0DI0008521	Sweet little caper, getting your weapons back. But let cooler heads prevail, hey? No need for violence.
0DI0008523	You're already the strongest person I've ever met. The implant won't do anything more for you.
0DI0008524	I can implant the Hypertrophy Accelerator for 4,000 caps. It will boost your adrenal glands and quickly increase your muscle mass.
0DI0008525	Your eyesight would make a hawk jealous. The Optic Enhancer implant won't do anything more for you.
0DI0008526	The Optics Enhancer, as the name suggests, gets attached directly to your optic nerve. The price is 4,000 caps.
0DI0008527	Your cardiovascular system is practically super-human. The Nociception Regulator won't boost it any further.
0DI0008528	The Nociception Regulator modifies your cardiovascular system, and you won't tire as quickly. The price is 4,000 caps, same as most other implants.
0DI0008529	Your higher brain functions are off the charts. The implant won't help at all - sorry.
0DI0008530	For 4,000 caps, I can install a Logic Co-Processor.
0DI0008531	I think you would really benefit from the Logic Co-Processor implant, so I'm going to cut the price to 3,000.
0DI0008532	Your reaction times are already so fast it's a wonder you can't catch bullets. The Reflex Booster can't make you any faster.
0DI0008533	The Reflex Booster does exactly what it says - speeds up your reaction times. For 4,000 caps, I can attach the implant to your central nervous node.
0DI0008534	All right. Was there something else you were interested in?
0DI0008535	So all this time the old man had an entire army on lay-away? Clever player.
0DI0008536	Just imagine the look on Baldie's face when those Securitrons come pouring out on judgment day! I'd pay to have that bronzed!
0DI0008537	So all you gotta do now is talk to Yes Man, figure out how to set things in motion.
0DI0008538	Make Vegas a town I woulda been proud of, baby. Let it swing.
0DI0008539	The Brotherhood is failing. I've always known that. If we don't change course, we're going to fall apart or... fade away.
0DI0008540	But until recently I haven't understood where we went wrong, or how to fix it.
0DI0008541	I think I need to go home.
0DI0008542	Okay. Well, when you do, let me know, all right?
0DI0008543	Great. Thanks. Thank you. I'll encourage people to name their non-ugly children after you. Seriously.
0DI0008544	Sure, yeah. Just not too long, okay? I worry about them sometimes.
0DI0008545	Wow, don't everybody volunteer all at once now.
0DI0008546	I could do that. You're not interested in coming along? Hate to break up the band over a silly little thing like the future of everyone I care about.
0DI0008547	This from the girl who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for her lost package.
0DI0008548	This from the guy who walked from I-15 to the Colorado River looking for his lost package.
0DI0008549	I hope you change your mind.
0DI0008550	Not much for family gatherings, huh? All right, have it your way.
0DI0008551	You ever want to look me up again, I'll be in my bunker in Hidden Valley. That's the luxury bunker.
0DI0008552	I'm not giving up. He wants evidence, but he'll never go looking for it. He's scared I'm right.
0DI0008553	He'll never listen unless I hold the proof right in front of his face.
0DI0008554	He's a stubborn old man, but when it comes down to it, he's got our best interests at heart.
0DI0008555	If he sees some indisputable sign we're on the wrong course, he won't ignore it.
0DI0008556	I don't know. I don't know. We'd need something that shows the Brotherhood will fail. Or that it can do better a different way.
0DI0008557	The only thing that'd get his attention is technology.
0DI0008558	Huh. Maybe Father Elijah had the right idea.
0DI0008559	That's my question to the Elder. All these years, the Brotherhood has collected weapons technology. And for what?
0DI0008560	To keep it out of people's hands? That clearly hasn't worked. To defend ourselves? We can't compete with the NCR's numbers. Or the Legion's.
0DI0008561	We're fighting a war for a lost cause. If we're going to survive, we have to find a role in society. Attract new members.
0DI0008562	Look at the Followers of the Apocalypse. They use their expertise to improve people's lives. They train them to be self-sufficient.
0DI0008563	That expertise cultivates respect and gratitude. Spreads their ideals. Draws talent to their cause. They make friends like we make enemies.
0DI0008564	But they don't know a fraction of what we know. If we took on their role, we could stand up to anyone. We wouldn't have to hide.
0DI0008565	Our Elder before McNamara. He had a nose for recovering lost technology. He'd send Scribes out into the desert chasing whatever leads he found.
0DI0008566	There were a few he only trusted me with. I can think of at least one that'd prove my point, if it still exists.
0DI0008567	There's a comm terminal not too far from here I'd use to access messages from him. If we go there I can pull up his research on it.
0DI0008568	It's a targeting device for some kind of doomsday weapon based at HELIOS One. It was lost sometime after the War.
0DI0008569	We held HELIOS One for a time. Lost a lot of people defending it. Too many. All for this weapon they never got working.
0DI0008570	If it turns out to be a dud, it'd show how flawed our goals have been. Father Elijah said he thinks a scavenger might have sold it on the Strip.
0DI0008571	I'm with you. Being around here isn't the same anymore.
0DI0008572	No, but it does make it easier to forgive him. He's just misguided.
0DI0008573	It's not too late to change his mind.
0DI0008574	Have you considered that he might be senile?
0DI0008575	The Brotherhood's strategy for survival worked back when we had a larger force, and no organized enemies.
0DI0008576	We're a tiny splinter from a shrinking group. We don't take on new members. But we're still picking fights with the big boys.
0DI0008577	Electromagnetic weapon from before the Great War. Experimental. It never saw mass production.
0DI0008578	But they were building it as a countermeasure to power armor, which they feared the Chinese were developing.
0DI0008579	Supposedly a prototype was being housed at Nellis. Imagine what it could do to the Brotherhood. We'd be on equal footing with any idiot with a gun.
0DI0008580	More or less. Supposedly it's a vegetation enhancer. NCR has a science branch headquartered at McCarran airport. Guess they found something.
0DI0008581	Guess somebody wasn't very good at keeping secrets, either.
0DI0008582	We'd never pursue it because it's not a weapon. But self-sufficiency is fundamental to us. If it works they'd see the value of an alternate course.
0DI0008583	Yeah, maybe they'll think twice about engaging the NCR if they know one of those could be floating around.
0DI0008584	The notes say to look around Nellis Air Force Base. He suggests going through filing cabinets and computers in the commanding officer's quarters.
0DI0008585	They defended HELIOS like it was their last stand. Didn't even know if there was anything worth defending. How could there be, with all we lost?
0DI0008586	Even if it did work, it'd be under NCR control now. So it'd either prove our goals are wrong or we're incapable of pursuing them.
0DI0008587	There's a pawn shop in Outer Vegas we could check. And I've heard of a gift shop in the Strip that deals in Pre-War antiques.
0DI0008588	Okay. What better way to persuade them than to give them a taste of what they stand to gain, right?
0DI0008589	Maybe the best place to start is to see what we can find out directly from the NCR. Let's head to their OSI office at McCarran.
0DI0008590	I like the way you think.
0DI0008591	Well now... the armory could always use more firepower. Very well. Tell the Powder Gangers we accept their offer.
0DI0008592	However, they would still have to pass the initiation rite to truly join our ranks.
0DI0008593	If you can scout out the camp, bring back any intel on troop movement or plans for future raids. The rangers could put that information to good use.
0DI0008594	Also, if you're any good at covert ops, I would love to get a bug planted on their radio. So far, we've been unable to crack their encryption.
0DI0008595	What?! How did you pull it off?
0DI0008596	Good to hear. This is the bug you'll need for the radio.
0DI0008597	Report back if you pick up any intel or manage to sneak the bug into their radio.
0DI0008598	Just let me know if you're available for the op. After what they did to Searchlight, they have a shitstorm coming.
0DI0008599	That's exactly what we needed to put a cork in that camp. The Legion won't be moving through there anytime soon.
0DI0008600	It's a fitting revenge for Searchlight. Thanks for taking care of those bastards for us.
0DI0008601	This is more than I could have hoped for! It almost seems too good to be true, but the details are all here.
0DI0008602	Looks like they're planning to strike some of the southern caravans. I'll notify the rangers and patrols in that area immediately.
0DI0008603	Here are some caps for your trouble. You've done us a great service.
0DI0008604	Well, unless you want to go in there and clean out that camp for me, I guess this should be more than enough for now.
0DI0008605	What?.. Really?! You're mad, but I like it!
0DI0008606	According to the notes you gave me, all of the southern raiding parties come from that camp. Caesar regularly sends fresh squads to relieve patrols.
0DI0008607	Killing their Centurion and leadership would be a start, but finding a way to permanently shut down that dock is what we really need.
0DI0008608	Report back when the camp is clear. I'll try and shuffle some men in that direction once the Legion is gone.
0DI0008609	Yeah, I know I wouldn't sign up for that solo op if asked.
0DI0008611	Looks like they're planning to shift their raids north of Vegas. I'll shift some of the rangers and NCR patrols in that direction when they're free.
0DI0008616	Fitting that the camp was taken care of in a way similar to Searchlight. Thank you for taking care of that place for us.
0DI0008617	A single man slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! I'm amazed.
0DI0008618	It took everything we had in the last battle at the dam to stand against those brutes. You're a beast, son.
0DI0008619	You've done a fine job, friend. Here is a little something for your work.
0DI0008620	A single woman slaughters an entire camp of legionaries?! Oh, that's priceless!
0DI0008621	Considering the way Caesar treats women, that should really put some doubts into his troops' minds. Wait til the rangers hear about this!
0DI0008622	You've done a fine job, friend. Here's a little something for your work.
0DI0008623	Hello Veronica. How goes your mission?
0DI0008624	We'll know in a second. I wanted to talk to you.
0DI0008625	Veronica, tell me this isn't about-
0DI0008626	Yes, goddamn it, it is. But you're going to hear me out this time.
0DI0008627	We've been through this.
0DI0008628	The things I've seen now. Other groups succeeding where we fail. It's not too late for us.
0DI0008629	We've outlasted the end of the world. We'll outlast these upstarts.
0DI0008630	Waiting in a hole for everyone else to die.
0DI0008631	If we must.
0DI0008632	This is a dead end for us.
0DI0008633	I see no evidence of that. Nor do I see anyone out there with a solution to our problems.
0DI0008634	How could you? You're too scared to look.
0DI0008636	The Great Khans? Oh, you mean those raiders that used to clash with the Vegas tribes?
0DI0008637	Yes, some years back we taught them reading, writing, basic science - we hoped they would use it to make medical supplies, but they turned to drugs.
0DI0008638	I was never much involved in the cultural side of that project, but Ezekiel was.
0DI0008639	He's a member of the Followers like myself, but his particular field is pre-War history and tribal culture.
0DI0008640	I do recall him being fascinated by the Khans, he kept going on about parallels to some ancient historical empire or another.
0DI0008641	He rarely stops in here these days - you'd do best to look for him out in the wastes east of New Vegas. He's always looking for new tribes to study.
0DI0008643	Oh my, yes! They're a fascinating tribe with a long and, unfortunately, tragic history.
0DI0008644	Their original incarnation, much farther out west, was almost completely wiped out by one of those itinerant heroes so common in the post-War years.
0DI0008645	Then of course the "New Khans" suffered a similar fate, some say at the hands of the same hero, though of course the dates are all wrong for that.
0DI0008647	Finally.
0DI0008648	Killing our Bighorners, shooting at the lodge, that sort of thing. It's getting hard to keep people from retaliating.
0DI0008649	Guess I can't say for sure if they're NCR. Whoever they are, they want us dead or gone.
0DI0008650	Not looking to fight. That'll give NCR an excuse to come up here and wipe us out.
0DI0008651	You're human - they might be willing to be listen to what you have to say. Maybe.
0DI0008652	I'm not asking you to kill them. Just talk them into leaving. Hell, pay them off if you have to.
0DI0008654	All right. Can't say I blame you.
0DI0008656	Yep, get a move on.
0DI0008657	Just doing what I'm paid to do - harass the muties until they leave or attack us. If they leave, we let 'em go. If they attack, we wipe them out.
0DI0008658	Either way, the job's not done until they've cleared out of the town.
0DI0008659	Won't name names, but some important folks in the NCR are sick of muties attacking their Brahmin herds. They want them gone from NCR territory.
0DI0008660	Maybe this group had something to do with attacking Brahmin, maybe not. Doesn't matter. We're getting paid to make them go away.
0DI0008661	We're still owed half - 2500 caps. Pay up and we'll be on our way. If you're short, maybe you can get the money from the muties.
0DI0008662	I'm sure that we can.
0DI0008663	You know what? I don't need this bullshit right now. We'll take off that goddamn power armor, if it'll just shut you up.
0DI0008665	I know, but now that I can see the way out, I'm not so sure. I'd rather not join my dead buddies anytime soon.
0DI0008666	I'm going to start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
0DI0008667	If you find my friends, please return their dogtags to the NCR. People need to know what happened here.
0DI0008668	If they won't listen, do what you can to make them listen. The dead need to be avenged.
0DI0008669	Sure enough, you got me clear of this mess. Here you go.
0DI0008671	This is unacceptable, we demand the immediate return of our power armor.
0DI0008672	A battle is about to be fought out there, to come here requesting our men to give up their armor is insane.
0DI0008673	It is not your armor, that power armor is property of the Brotherhood of Steel and you have no right to claim it as your own.
0DI0008674	Well, if you ask me, what we really need is to get the whole squad out on the practice range - shape up our marksmanship and explosives skill.
0DI0008675	I'm sure the others have their own ideas, though.
0DI0008676	Are you sure? I've got enough clout to get them started, but these guys are pretty lazy. I doubt they'll want to be pulled in different directions.
0DI0008677	Okay, I'll be here if you come to your senses.
0DI0008678	You're the boss.
0DI0008679	That's right. Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
0DI0008680	Maybe you just ain't had a healthy dose of human niceness in a while.
0DI0008681	Folks just don't talk to other folks, and everybody's always cross with each other.
0DI0008682	That'd be swell. Only, if they knew the idea came from me, they probably wouldn't take you serious no more, so maybe you oughta think about it first.
0DI0008683	And I sure hope you're more convincing than I am, or they ain't gonna listen.
0DI0008685	Whatever you think's best.
0DI0008686	Excellent! Squad readiness records can be accessed from two terminals at the resort: the main terminal in the lobby or a secure one in a back office.
0DI0008687	The main terminal is typically unlocked, but is also in the middle of a major thoroughfare, you'll have to be stealthy to access it.
0DI0008688	The office terminal is locked, but you might have an easier time accessing it, especially at night.
0DI0008689	As you wish; I'm sure the optimal solution will become apparent to you in time.
0DI0008690	Psycho! The big red one! I used to run with the Fiends, I still got the hookups. Smuggle some in and you'll see an improvement.
0DI0008691	My man Jack at Red Rock Canyon got the goods. But listen: once you get folks dosed on Psycho, ain't a lot of room for much else.
0DI0008692	So if you got any other plans for bulking up the Misfits crew, might want to see about them first.
0DI0008693	Right. Head to Red Rock Canyon - that's deep Khan territory, so watch your back. Talk to Jack, tell him Razz wants the usual. See you soon.
0DI0008695	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, this isn't worth the trouble to fight over.
0DI0008696	[FAILED] No, we have men to outfit and are putting it to good use.
0DI0008697	Wait for me downstairs, this won't take long.
0DI0008698	[FAILED] Yes, it would be, we can't have outsiders running around using our technology.
0DI0008699	[SUCCEEDED] It would mean more people better protected and able to fight.
0DI0008700	Well, hurry it up. We don't have much time.
0DI0008701	Well, after they migrated to the Mojave, we established relations with them, but that soured when all they wanted was to make drugs.
0DI0008702	The NCR eventually took them down quite a bit, but the really fascinating thing about them is the origin of their culture as a whole. You see....
0DI0008703	Oh, of course! I'm sorry, I do tend to get wrapped up in my own theories and forget that not everyone finds them as fascinating as I do.
0DI0008704	Here, I salvaged this book from an old library. It's a history of a people called the Mongols. I think that's what the Khans built their culture on.
0DI0008705	You should read it, it's fascinating stuff.
0DI0008706	Groovetastic. Tell him it's on his tab.
0DI0008707	Of course I will, dearie, if it's helpful. Don't you worry what will happen to little old me. I'm tougher than I look!
0DI0008708	Of course, dearie.
0DI0008709	I know that, dearie.
0DI0008711	Okay, if you say so. Hell, it's not like we've got a lot to lose here.
0DI0008713	[SUCCEEDED] That's... brilliant. Simple, yet elegant. I can't believe I didn't think of that.
0DI0008714	[FAILED] Neuron decay is rapid after death, and I doubt a live Nightstalker would cooperate with my test.
0DI0008715	Sure, maybe not if you're some hulking reprobate like Regis or baked to the gills like Jack. I've tried five times and still haven't made it.
0DI0008716	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe you're right. Maybe I can find my true calling, someplace they'll appreciate my poetry! Someplace like the Old Mormon Fort, maybe.
0DI0008717	Do you think the Followers of the Apocalypse would take me? I remember all those books they brought us when they visited our tribe.
0DI0008718	[FAILED] I don't know... the Khans don't really get me, but at least they're family, you know?
0DI0008719	Cheat? The only way I could cheat is if I was so doped up on painkillers that I don't feel anything.
0DI0008720	Really? Wow, um... okay. Thanks.
0DI0008721	Whoa... you were serious. Okay, yeah, this might just work. Thanks.
0DI0008723	You've done some great work for us up to this point, and we are hoping to use your unique abilities to aid us once again.
0DI0008724	Thanks to the tasks my subordinates have delegated to you, the NCR now has a unique opportunity.
0DI0008725	Good, you just stand there and listen, then, that'll make this go faster.
0DI0008726	We now have a chance to take the fight to those bastards on their home turf.
0DI0008727	I am in the beginning stages of planning out an assault on The Fort. I've made calls to our allies, and they are on their way to our position.
0DI0008728	Once our forces are in placed and garrisoned here, we'll begin our assault.
0DI0008729	Okay, listen here. Unless we can get some additional support, I'm going to need you to help me resolve this situation.
0DI0008730	You need to make your way to this camp they have on the eastern bank and take out the Legate. That should hamstring this attack.
0DI0008731	Sir! I don't know what happened, a bunch of Legionnaires just stormed into the power station.
0DI0008732	Into the power station? How is that possible?
0DI0008733	I don't know sir. There was some talk of them entering through the clogged intake tunnels, but I don't have any confirmation.
0DI0008734	On my way up here there was some chatter about their commander, the Legate I think he's called, set up at some kind of base on the eastern bank.
0DI0008735	Thanks again for this. You're platinum, baby.
0DI0008736	Nowheresville, that's where. Sorry about the double-cross - or are we up to quadruple? - but if someone's gonna die, it's you.
0DI0008737	Baby, getting outplayed and getting cheated ain't the same thing.
0DI0008738	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful, full of disappointments.
0DI0008739	That temper of yours? Kinda why this conversation's taking place over an intercom.
0DI0008740	Do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Good night all! It's been a gas...
0DI0008741	You don't wanna do that, baby - not without hearing what I got to say first.
0DI0008742	Huh...? Hnngk!
0DI0008743	[SUCCEEDED] All this is just work ethic run wild, that's your line? I don't know...
0DI0008744	Can you get it through your thick skull to leave me and the Chip alone? If bullets can't get through, what hope is there?
0DI0008745	[FAILED] Color me unconvinced. The safe bet is to cash you out.
0DI0008746	A lifelong-learner is you, hey? Then make your questions count, because your lifelong is running lifeshort.
0DI0008747	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit, I'm actually gonna to let you live. What's come over me?
0DI0008748	Scramsville, baby. The Strip and you part ways, dig? You come around me again, you won't be getting back up.
0DI0008750	Zzzz....
0DI0008751	Luck is for losers, baby. Someone pulled strings.
0DI0008752	It's the House edge, baby. The key to stacking the odds in his favor - or was, until I swiped it.
0DI0008753	There's more to it, but we don't have the time. By which I mean you don't.
0DI0008754	Angle? I'm head-on, baby, flat-out, all stops pulled, full steam ahead.
0DI0008755	Side bets are for losers. I'm playing to win.
0DI0008756	Can't do that, baby. The Chip, it's... special. But savor this, baby...
0DI0008757	I can comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. After what you been through, you deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
0DI0008758	Give me a moment or two to catch my breath and knock back a few cocktails, and I'll swing by for a meet and greet.
0DI0008759	I'll clue you in, guaranteed - every question answered. This can be the start of a beautiful friendship.
0DI0008760	Baby, the meet and greet we scheduled in the Presidential? The whole point is to explain why I can't hand the Chip over.
0DI0008761	Now let's just forget this little ambush, and meet up in the suite like we planned. How's that sound?
0DI0008762	What the fuck...?
0DI0008763	It can't work like that, baby - not out in public like this. You really need me to spell that out?
0DI0008764	Baby, this is not the place to go talking about that!
0DI0008765	Yeah, hello... Well, serves me right for using a 9mm.
0DI0008766	House was on to me from word Go? I thought I was being so clever...
0DI0008767	Yeah, that's one word for it.
0DI0008768	Baby, if ever there was a need for violence, you is it. Just do me a favor and stay dead this time, hey? Ta-ta.
0DI0008770	I get it, you're sore. A crumb's life is painful. But soon you won't feel a thing. Ta-ta.
0DI0008771	It was worth a try.
0DI0008772	I know, I made a bad first impression. You got every reason to think I'm a creep. But baby, this is an 18 karat opportunity.
0DI0008773	I've got the Chip, but to see this shin-dig through to the end? I'm gonna need help. And hello! Who shows up but you?
0DI0008774	It can't be a coincidence, baby. You and me were meant to work together.
0DI0008775	Baby, wow-ee wow wow! You and me are gonna swing!
0DI0008776	Here's the key. I'll be by in a few... just as soon as my legs stop shaking.
0DI0008777	Or else what, punk? Or else this?
0DI0008778	I'm gonna take a meeting with this pally up in the Prez. You boys wait at the bottom of the elevator. You hear trouble, come up blazing.
0DI0008779	You think you scare me? Come on! Do it!
0DI0008780	That the best you can do?
0DI0008781	I didn't even feel that one!
0DI0008782	That's right, gimme another!
0DI0008783	I thought this was supposed to hurt!
0DI0008784	Come on, ya bum! Put your shoulder into it!
0DI0008785	Come on, ya bitch! You swing like a girl!
0DI0008786	Check out the digs. Real cozy in here.
0DI0008787	I can hardly stand the excitement.
0DI0008788	These Legion boys are coo-coo, you realize?
0DI0008789	What are you waiting for? Do it!
0DI0008790	Come on, end it!
0DI0008791	You gonna do it or not?
0DI0008792	Happy now, you twisted bitch? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
0DI0008793	Happy now, you twisted bum? Well, I ain't gonna give you the satisfaction.
0DI0008794	Scram, will ya?
0DI0008796	Hey, baby! Over here!
0DI0008797	I ain't waiting all day, baby.
0DI0008798	Baby, I'm dying over here.
0DI0008799	Yeah, to die in my sleep at a ripe old age after a marathon session of hey-hey with thirty sex-starved broads. You'll set that up?
0DI0008800	Look, I ain't a harbor for illusions. I ain't expecting to get out of this shin-dig alive.
0DI0008801	That's why I'm trying to hand you my scheme, baby. It's called having a legacy.
0DI0008802	I know, so many options! How do you choose just one?
0DI0008803	Yeah... getting butchered like livestock. Something to aspire to.
0DI0008804	Yeah, real popular around here. It's a crowd pleaser.
0DI0008805	You'd do that for me, baby? Don't tease if you don't mean it.
0DI0008806	Now you're talking! That is the ring-a-ding move, baby.
0DI0008807	First base is whatever Mr. House would have you do. Follow orders, rig the game to his specifications.
0DI0008808	Then, when he ain't looking, you knock him out of the running and find a way to take control of those Securitrons of his.
0DI0008809	Go see Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
0DI0008811	First base is do whatever Mr. House would've had you do. Finish rigging the game, then puzzle out how to take over where he left off, dig?
0DI0008812	For hows and whats, just talk to Yes Man. I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful.
0DI0008813	You cashed out the old man? So how's it feel to end an era?
0DI0008814	You got the future of Vegas in the palm of your hand, baby. What happens next is up to you.
0DI0008815	Mr. House hides Vegas under his skirt when the bombs fall a thousand years ago, so it belongs to him? Forever? You buy that?
0DI0008816	Baby, every boss has a line to explain why he's special, why everyone gotta do what he says. Just figuring that out?
0DI0008817	Vegas gotta swing, baby, gotta have pizzazz. Respect where due, but that old man is square to the core.
0DI0008818	Ain't we covered this? The only thing not bad about them is they ain't Legion.
0DI0008819	The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave, only difference is they pass laws to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
0DI0008820	Nah, just spruce it up with a crucifixion here and there. Come closer so I can step on you.
0DI0008821	The Legion is twisted, baby - original losers worshipping the king of creeps like he's some kind of god.
0DI0008822	They're worse than roaches. My advice? Put on your stomping shoes.
0DI0008823	More like two, after what you did to the Omertas.
0DI0008824	The Chairmen are true blue. The Omertas are degenerates - never trust them. Or the White Gloves - just something creepy about them.
0DI0008825	Set it up right, and the families will roll with your caper. You might have to do some convincing.
0DI0008826	Seven years. Took over three days after Mr. House introduced himself.
0DI0008827	Our chief at the time, mountain of a guy named Bingo, wanted to stay nomadic. I disagreed, so he challenged me to the knife.
0DI0008828	He looked so surprised when I stuck that knife in his neck. Thought he was so tough, but he was so slow.
0DI0008829	That's how I made chief. It's how things were back then.
0DI0008830	Nah, in the way-back we called ourselves the Boot Riders. Silly name, but that's how we rode the Mojave, dig? - on our feet.
0DI0008831	We were nomadic badasses, not to be trifled with. A gang of ruffians, though with a certain panache.
0DI0008832	When House gave us the Tops to renovate, his robots dropped off boxes full of suits and ties and wingtip shoes. Told us we were the "Chairmen" now.
0DI0008833	That caused an uproar. But I said "the name sticks." Ciao to the old ways, baby - time to swing in style. If the shoes fit, you wear them.
0DI0008834	We were east of Vegas when the first Securitron we ever saw rolled up on us. We junked it in a minute flat.
0DI0008835	The next day twenty roll up. So we listened.
0DI0008836	Said we'd been selected. Vegas needed us to defend it. In exchange, we'd get cushy digs, full stomachs, medical treatment.
0DI0008837	Everything a nomad never gets, in other words. Most of the tribe thought we should say no. I thought it was the best idea ever.
0DI0008838	No, come on, don't slaughter me like I'm some kind of animal!
0DI0008839	Don't do that, baby, not crucifixion. I could be up there for days with those twisted creeps laughing and pointing.
0DI0008840	Machetes at twenty paces, hey? I accept your challenge.
0DI0008841	I see. Keep it simple, hey? Around here, it's one of the better options...
0DI0008842	You sick, twisted fuck!
0DI0008843	You sick, vindictive fuck!
0DI0008844	You're a class act, baby. Not to say I'm gonna make it easy for you...
0DI0008845	I'll believe it when it happens!
0DI0008846	The direct approach, hey? Fair enough.
0DI0008847	But you should wait until the bunker's taken care of. Caesar won't like it if you eat dessert first.
0DI0008848	Nah, I'd rather see it coming.
0DI0008849	Do it, baby. Make it clean.
0DI0008850	Don't I know it! Too bad a conjugal visit here isn't practical...
0DI0008851	Well ain't you a sentimental broad? Gimme a sec to jump off Cloud 9, I'll meet you on the ground...
0DI0008852	Oh I made an impression all right! The dent in that mattress was permanent!
0DI0008853	Yeah, well, laugh it up on your own time.
0DI0008854	That we do, baby, that we do...
0DI0008855	Did I say I blamed society? I know why I'm here, baby. Do you?
0DI0008856	Didn't leave much choice when you showed up. Like I said, you forced my hand.
0DI0008857	Sure, Baldie wants you to go down in the bunker and destroy whatever Mr. House stashed there.
0DI0008858	You don't want to do that, baby. Whatever's down in that bunker is the key to the city called Vegas. So here's what you do...
0DI0008859	You go down there and use the Chip to do whatever Mr. House woulda wanted you to do. And when you get back to the Strip, you find Yes Man.
0DI0008860	I made it so that cat can't help but be helpful, dig?
0DI0008861	I prefer the term "relocated."
0DI0008862	It took every Stealth Boy I had to cross the river at Cottonwood Cove. That was a close shave, riding a boat full of Legion boys.
0DI0008863	Once I was across, I changed into a uniform I swiped off a dead Legionary outside Nelson. Tried to sneak into the bunker, but that didn't work out.
0DI0008864	They found the Chip. I wasn't gonna tell them what it was used for, but... let's just say they were persuasive.
0DI0008865	What? How could you do that?
0DI0008866	You loser! You had Vegas in the palm of your hand and you threw it away?
0DI0008871	Of course, dearie. I know it's dangerous, but it'll all turn out for the best, you'll see. I'll go to him now - it would be rude to keep him waiting!
0DI0008872	Lily is eccentric, certainly, but I've never felt she was dangerous. More importantly, she asked if she could help me in some way.
0DI0008873	I've told her about the risks, and she still insists on helping me.
0DI0008874	I'll be waiting.
0DI0008875	Possibly immediate and permanent mental damage. There's a reason the Stealth Boy Mark IIs never got beyond the prototype stage.
0DI0008876	Lily already has a pre-existing condition, and the experiment will likely make things worse for her.
0DI0008877	The stealth field has been modulated to use less power and thus last longer, but for some reason it has pronounced negative effects on the user.
0DI0008878	However, these pronounced effects will allow me to pinpoint exactly what parts of the brain they're affecting.
0DI0008879	Unfortunately, I'll need to run the test on a live subject, and Marcus has encouraged me to investigate the Nightstalker mutation first.
0DI0008880	Once you're done thinking, talk to Lily.
0DI0008881	He's got no resources but a decent cause. We've got plenty of resources and a totally lost cause.
0DI0008882	No power armor. No energy weapons. And they're giving the NCR more trouble than we ever did.
0DI0008883	Ordinary guys with knives and bullets, and they're taking over Nevada.
0DI0008884	There's a lot more troops here than we thought. No wonder we couldn't hold HELIOS One.
0DI0008885	A bunch of shut-ins who scorn outsiders and hold technology over them. Gee, where have I heard that one before?
0DI0008886	Can't help but be impressed with what they're doing here.
0DI0008887	Even the stupid NCR is investing in new research. We're getting left in the dust.
0DI0008888	Leading his people to a new land with big dreams and a clean slate. Makes me think of my old mentor.
0DI0008889	Holy hell, that's a lot of energy weapons. Guess we dropped the ball on that one.
0DI0008891	God, you're not lying, are you? You really did kill them.
0DI0008892	In that case, this is for them.
0DI0008893	You think? Well good, then. That puts me a little more at ease.
0DI0008894	Hey, so where are you headed, anyway?
0DI0008895	That seems wise. I think I am, too. Although for how much longer, I'm not sure.
0DI0008896	Not very friendly, are they?
0DI0008897	Well, thanks for weighing in. Gives me something to think about.
0DI0008898	Wow. I've got to admit, you have completely defied my first impression of you.
0DI0008899	Eye lasers. I'll be sure and look out for that next time.
0DI0008900	Any other juicy bits of intel?
0DI0008901	Ooo. Very exciting. Gonna strike it rich, huh?
0DI0008902	Huh. Just on your way to do a little heavily fortified sightseeing. Kind of a thrillseeker, aren't you?
0DI0008903	Just wherever the wind takes you, huh? I like that. Keeps things interesting.
0DI0008904	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like he can really handle himself.
0DI0008905	I'll be honest. You're the first person I've run across out here that looks like she can really handle herself.
0DI0008906	There are places I've never been to that'd be too dangerous for just me. What do you think? Maybe we could travel together, help each other out.
0DI0008907	Guess we have that in common, then.
0DI0008908	This is quite a journey you're going on, then. Must be an interesting relationship to have brought you all this way.
0DI0008909	Heh. Good. That's the look I was going for. Trust me on this one, though. You'll be glad you brought me along.
0DI0008910	If I turn out to be a burden, we can part ways at any time. No hard feelings.
0DI0008911	Oh, nowhere in particular, really. Just hoping to see more of the world. Looking for a fresh perspective.
0DI0008912	I want to see how different groups have adapted to survive in the Mojave. See if there's something I can learn from.
0DI0008913	Now you're talking. One thing you should know, first, though. I asked you about the Brotherhood because I'm one of them.
0DI0008914	I know, I know. But I had to know how you'd react when I told you. We've made a lot of enemies.
0DI0008915	You still okay bringing me along?
0DI0008916	Aw, you really know how to make a girl feel like a stray cat.
0DI0008917	But okay. My offer stands, if we run into each other again.
0DI0008918	Suit yourself. You can always change your mind.
0DI0008919	Like I said, they can handle themselves. And I'm not the only one getting supplies for them. It's a big family.
0DI0008920	Good. I hoped you'd come around. Shall we?
0DI0008921	I'm great at punching people. I'm not gonna lie. It's a gift.
0DI0008922	Well, thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl from California with stars in her eyes and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
0DI0008923	Let's hit the road, huh?
0DI0008924	Sure. Just don't ever ask me if your outfit makes you look fat.
0DI0008925	Fair enough. Maybe one day I'll have your complete trust, and I can be on a long leash. A girl can dream.
0DI0008926	I like long walks in the desert and candle-lit metal workshops.
0DI0008927	My favorite subject.
0DI0008928	He was dead when I got there.
0DI0008929	This better not be about the meaning of life.
0DI0008930	Well, when two people really love each other... you really don't know this stuff yet?
0DI0008931	Ooo, do I get a prize if I answer right?
0DI0008932	I was told we wouldn't be tested on this.
0DI0008933	A lifetime supply of Fancy Lads Snack Cakes, revenge against my enemies, and world peace. In that order.
0DI0008934	I was young and I needed the money.
0DI0008935	It's a free wasteland.
0DI0008936	Yeah. They say he built the Strip. Of course, they say a lot of things. No one's actually met him.
0DI0008937	Me? I think it's a hoax. Probably a group of people who want to avoid attention, or some made-up persona of a self-aware computer.
0DI0008938	Why else would he shut himself in like that?
0DI0008939	Yeah. It's not for poker.
0DI0008940	I've never seen anything quite like it, but I can tell you it looks like it was fabricated before the War, and not at a mint.
0DI0008941	Some kind of tech... I'm gonna say... mid-2200s. Hold onto it. Might be your lucky chip.
0DI0008942	Sure, he's one of the hotel managers on the Strip. He comes up in the news now and then.
0DI0008943	Him and the other Chairmen run the Tops. It's one of the nicer hotels, or so I hear.
0DI0008944	Elder McNamara wouldn't shell out for a passport for me, so I've actually never been to the Strip. Why do people get so cheap when they get old?
0DI0008945	Yep. It's your typical city layout. Rich people in a gated community surrounded by extreme poverty.
0DI0008946	House gave the area around the Strip to the locals, but he has no interest in it, so he ignores it entirely. It just needs new management.
0DI0008947	I'd love to see the Brotherhood do it, but since the Codex doesn't say "clean up Freeside" no one listens to me. Bunch of sticklers.
0DI0008948	I'm worried they'll be the death of the Brotherhood. They take what they want. We defend our interests to the death.
0DI0008949	But there's a handful of us and tens or hundreds of thousands of them. So it's not going to end well.
0DI0008950	Last time we clashed we lost a lot of people. Retreated to our bunker. Now we're afraid to even move around during the day.
0DI0008951	Silliest dressed band of raping, slaving marauders you'll see east of California, I'll say that. Where's that touch of Old World class?
0DI0008952	Although I hear the soldiers mount each other as much as they mount their women, so maybe they did keep a little something from the Empire.
0DI0008953	No such privilege for the women, though. Figures. So... to answer your question... they're a bunch of hypocritical jerkwads. It's a word.
0DI0008954	Darn it, I had some spectacular answers coming, too.
0DI0008955	Let's.
0DI0008956	Thanks for your support. I'll make sure that the NCR Emergency radio is up and running. Go kill those bastards.
0DI0008957	Like I said earlier, we have some supplemental forces on the way, but this wasn't the situation I was expecting, so I can only offer what is on hand.
0DI0008958	All right. I'll dismantle the prototype to avoid any further incidents with the Nightkin.
0DI0008959	Very well. It will be worth it, I'm sure.
0DI0008960	I'm close to the cure, I can feel it. Lily's continued help will give me the last bit of data that I need.
0DI0008961	I understand. Get back to me with an answer as soon as you can.
0DI0008962	Permanent damage to her mind is a certainty. Even the cure won't help her.
0DI0008963	Fucking Cooke has us trapped here. After we escaped from an NCR prison, he dragged us around the wasteland until we ended up in this shit hole.
0DI0008964	A group of us want to leave, go back to the NCR and surrender. But Cooke won't let us.
0DI0008965	After you cut off access to the sulfur, Cooke left. I guess we're free to surrender to the NCR now.
0DI0008966	We're waiting on you.  A lot of us are interested in joining the Khans.
0DI0008967	Cooke is just an overambitious prick, and he's going to get us all killed.
0DI0008968	I'm a nobody. Just a survivor. Things were well enough until the NCR threw me behind bars.
0DI0008969	I made my living sneaking into NCR camps looking for shit to steal. I got sloppy, and then I got caught.
0DI0008970	Made it out during Cooke's big prison break, like the rest of the guys here.
0DI0008971	Samuel Cooke. It was his idea to organize a jailbreak, but now he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
0DI0008972	I can be pretty sneaky when I need to be, and the prison guards were a joke.
0DI0008973	So when Cooke told me his plan, I spread the info to anyone that might be useful.
0DI0008974	Cooke organized the breakout. But he's just an overambitious prick who's going to get us all killed.
0DI0008975	You won't get a fucking cap from me, and you're lucky I don't blow your goddamn head off.
0DI0008976	The whole point of killing the geckos was so we could get at the sulfur and you've just made that a hell of a lot more difficult. Now fuck off.
0DI0008977	Everybody has to do it. Well, everybody who wants to be a Khan, anyways. They toss you into the ring there and beat on you for a solid minute.
0DI0008978	If you survive, you're in.
0DI0008979	I don't think so. You already have a dog right there.
0DI0008980	I don't know about that...
0DI0008981	I brush it every day. One hundred brushes.
0DI0008982	Okay. Take good care of him and bring him back when you're done.
0DI0008983	You know what? I think it's best if he stays with me.
0DI0008986	No problem. Glad I could help out.
0DI0008987	More than you already have? Might want to ask around, but truth is, you've already helped out a lot in the short time you've been here.
0DI0008988	I suppose you could talk to Ghost, up on top of the barracks - uh, Ranger Ghost. Something about trouble in Nipton, maybe.
0DI0008989	Help? Oh, well... you could speak to Ranger Jackson. He might have something for you.
0DI0008990	He sort of runs things around here, mostly ends up sending reports back West that aren't filled with the best news.
0DI0008991	All right then... just sign here, here, and... here.
0DI0008992	Wow, you have come a long way, then. I've never been there, but I've met some traders who pass that way.
0DI0008993	Well, welcome, then. I'm Veronica. I live in a hole in the ground.
0DI0008994	Huh. Well, in that case I take it back. You look pretty good, given the circumstances.
0DI0008995	Yeah, guess the roads must've been long, then, if you forgot where you started from.
0DI0008996	That's why I asked. My business is boring. You try trading and scavenging for a living and see if you don't start nosing into other people's affairs.
0DI0008997	Well, a bunker, if you want to get technical. I think it sounds more interesting my way.
0DI0008998	But I'm not there much anymore. I'm usually out here picking up food and supplies for my family. Whatever they need.
0DI0008999	Yeah. I'm not worried. They can handle themselves. But somebody has to get the groceries, know what I mean?
0DI0009000	And actually these days I think they'd rather have me out here anyway. But that's a whole other story.
0DI0009001	So, listen, can I ask you something on the level?
0DI0009002	I had a run-in with this group calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel. Pretty strange bunch. Do you know anything about them?
0DI0009003	Forget I said anything, then.
0DI0009004	Sure. It's a small wasteland. I'm sure we'll run into each other again.
0DI0009006	Well that shouldn't be a problem for me. I can't afford anything like that.
0DI0009007	Oh my gosh, really? Well, I didn't see where they went, but I'll keep an eye out. Wow, I had no idea they were so dangerous.
0DI0009008	Thanks for letting me know. Glad I didn't do any business with them.
0DI0009009	Do they? That's a relief. I wasn't so sure, myself. Protecting people from technology seems like a big job for such a small group.
0DI0009010	Yeah, it's pretty far out, right? Fixating on old technology just doesn't seem very relevant to most people's lives.
0DI0009011	That bad, huh? Guess I'm lucky I got away with my life. I'll make sure and avoid them from now on. Thanks.
0DI0009012	That's okay, I wouldn't expect anybody to. I think they tend to keep to themselves.
0DI0009013	I have to watch Cooke. I wouldn't put it past him to just start killing the opposition, starting with me.
0DI0009014	Thanks. Take this keycard - I tried hacking the locking mechanisms on the doors, but it seems that the only way in is with one of these.
0DI0009015	Cooke is planning to use the sulfur to make bigger explosives.
0DI0009016	Will you check out the caves and see if there's anything you can do?
0DI0009017	Without access to the sulfur, he'll lose what influence he has left with the men here.
0DI0009018	Good to hear. Without access to the sulfur, Cooke doesn't have much to offer the gang. I... I guess it's over, then. We can turn ourselves in.
0DI0009019	Well, that's a hell of a lot better than going back to prison.
0DI0009020	We can't survive like this - there are too many of us and we don't have the resources. And maybe it's the right thing to do.
0DI0009021	[FAILED] No, this needs to end. I'm tired of running and living like scavengers.
0DI0009022	[SUCCEEDED] I hadn't thought of that. Would you be willing to talk to them on our behalf?
0DI0009023	Thank you. I think I just needed to hear someone else say it. I suppose without rule of law, we're no better than raiders.
0DI0009024	Thank you. We'll wait here until we hear from you.
0DI0009025	That coward Lem has been talking about surrendering to the NCR. Now the men are confused, not sure who's leading this gang. Fucking idiots.
0DI0009026	Lem's been taken care of. We can start mining that sulfur now, thanks to you.
0DI0009027	Some of the computers still work, but the only files are diaries and garbage. Typical vault.
0DI0009028	You really don't know? I'm Samuel Cooke. I was the brains behind the NCRCF prison break.
0DI0009029	Their "republic" is a joke. They're a bunch of tyrants led by an even greater tyrant, that idiot Kimball.
0DI0009030	They think they have the right to annex every inch of dirt in the West and force their system on every man, woman, and child.
0DI0009031	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He had his uses, but he's a coward and a troublemaker.
0DI0009032	He was an inmate like the rest of us. He was useful during the jailbreak, but now...
0DI0009033	He's just another coward. He wants us to leave the vault and hand our asses to the NCR, as if they'd treat us like human beings.
0DI0009034	I was blowing up supply caravans along the 15 freeway. The NCR got wise to my ambush spots, picked me up and threw me in a cage.
0DI0009035	A beautiful thing. Saved a little blast powder here, hid a makeshift weapon there, and one day I orchestrated a little symphony for the  NCR.
0DI0009036	Didn't have a choice. He was confusing the men, and I need to control them or we're just a bunch of disorganized idiots.
0DI0009037	I have to keep an eye on that bastard Lem. The second I turn my back, he might go crying to the NCR.
0DI0009038	So, what do you say? You going to take care of those geckos?
0DI0009039	Explosives. Bombs. Big, big fucking bombs. You gonna help us or not?
0DI0009040	There aren't enough of us here to make a real impact on the NCR, and the Khans probably hate the NCR more than we do. Strength in numbers, they say.
0DI0009041	So, will you talk to Papa Khan on our behalf?
0DI0009042	Great. Come back as soon as you can.
0DI0009043	Great. Get to it. Oh, and take this - there's some weird shit with this Vault's security and some doors will only open if you have a keycard.
0DI0009044	Heard there was an abandoned vault along this mountain ridge, and that the wildlife here had teeth big enough to keep the NCR away.
0DI0009045	It's a fucking deathtrap around here. Fiends swarm all over Vault 3 in the east, and there are fucking Deathclaws south of that, at Quarry Junction.
0DI0009046	If you're looking for humans, the Khans are north of us and an NCR base at McCarran, past Vault 3. Supposedly there are muties to the southeast.
0DI0009047	Like raiders, but worse - these guys are messed up on every damn chem there is. You can spot them by the horned skulls they wear as hats.
0DI0009048	The NCR's been mining there for awhile, but now it's full of Deathclaws. Don't go there unless you want a quick, bloody death.
0DI0009049	It's the main base for the NCR, and a breeding ground for oppression in the name of patriotic bullshit. Do humanity a favor and blow it up.
0DI0009050	They've been through some rough times, but they can hold their own. I wouldn't mind taking the boys and signing up with them, if it weren't for Lem.
0DI0009051	I've heard the muties there are different. Completely insane, and supposedly they use some kind of invisibility technology. I'd stay away.
0DI0009052	Good. Hey, I got another job for you if you're interested.
0DI0009053	I'd rather not, but fair enough. We'll do it.
0DI0009055	You must be crazy if you're just "passing through" this place.
0DI0009056	Then why are you in here bothering me instead of out there hunting them?
0DI0009057	Look, I don't need your shit. Either get out of the way or things are gonna get rough.
0DI0009058	Look if you really want to help either get the fuck out of our way or hack that damn computer over there.
0DI0009059	All I know is that the whole place is filled with radiation, there are nasty creatures roaming about.
0DI0009060	And that my employer is paying me a pretty penny to loot it.
0DI0009061	Some caravan company, Crimson something or other. Some old broad said they're looking to expand their business, be more competitive or some shit.
0DI0009062	I don't really care, so long as I get paid.
0DI0009063	The location of some radiation suits. I found an inventory list that says they should be here but I can't seem to find them anywhere.
0DI0009064	The computer should know what happened to them.
0DI0009065	Yeah you do that.
0DI0009066	Well then, get your ass out there.
0DI0009067	[FAILED] Fuck you. You'll get the same as everyone else.
0DI0009068	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, fine, but you gotta bring us those suits first.
0DI0009069	Good, now get going.
0DI0009070	Just go already.
0DI0009071	Good, we're going to the Police Station first. Here's the key, we'll follow you there.
0DI0009072	And just so you know, I'm not leaving town until I get what I came for. If you decide to go wandering off somewhere else, don't expect me to follow.
0DI0009073	Well hurry the fuck up, I don't wanna wait all day.
0DI0009075	We're gonna check out the police and fire stations. They were the buildings used the most by the NCR, so they're our best chance at good shit.
0DI0009076	I found the keys on one of the trooper corpses.
0DI0009077	Anything that's valuable. You done with the questions yet?
0DI0009078	It's about damn time.
0DI0009080	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a point. Selling meds to the locals could be a pretty nice side gig. All right, I'll tell Jack to give it a try.
0DI0009081	[FAILED] That's touching, but it would take away from our bottom line. I'll have to pass.
0DI0009082	Here you go, you've earned these.
0DI0009083	Here you go. Enjoy it.
0DI0009084	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa... you're right. I should start a side project making meds to keep my aura clean.
0DI0009085	[FAILED] I don't know what you've been smoking, but where can I get some?
0DI0009086	[SUCCEEDED] Right on, let's have it!
0DI0009087	[FAILED] Cool. Maybe later.
0DI0009096	Cool. Maybe later.
0DI0009097	I don't have any compelling reason to trust you, given your behavior. So no, I'm not really inclined to give you a job.
0DI0009098	Hmm... you look like you could handle yourself in a fix. All right, I'll tell you what. Anders, one of my best runners, is overdue to report back.
0DI0009099	If you can find out what happened to him, I'll give you some real work.
0DI0009100	Great! Here's your payment.
0DI0009101	And you didn't even get skinned alive. I'm impressed. Here's your payment.
0DI0009102	Like I said, find Anders first, then we'll see about trusting you with more work.
0DI0009103	Yeah, you did good finding him. Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
0DI0009104	Okay, if you want a little work, I think I can find you something.
0DI0009105	Not right at the moment, but you could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
0DI0009106	Ordinarily I would, but it seems like all our clients have ended up dead. You could talk to Jack - he's always looking for new recipes.
0DI0009107	Diane handles most of the transactional elements of this little enterprise, but I'm always in the market for new recipes if you've got the spark.
0DI0009108	Already on it. I whipped up a few Stimpaks already, but if you've got any more recipes I'll take them.
0DI0009109	What do you mean, helpful? My stuff already makes people feel groodalicious.
0DI0009110	Yeah, you made a pretty good argument. We'll keep it small for now, but if it turns a profit we might expand.
0DI0009111	Helpful? What, like bathtub Stimpaks? What's the point of that?
0DI0009112	Oh, you're buying? Cool.
0DI0009113	Oh, you're buying? Tell you what, since you've been acting all, well, random lately, how about a discount? Might calm you down.
0DI0009114	Jack handles the small-time purchases. You should talk to him unless you're looking for a major shipment.
0DI0009115	Right on. What have you got?
0DI0009116	We've got an associate in the Crimson Caravan Trading Company who distributes for us in Outer Vegas. He's been after us for a new shipment.
0DI0009117	Groodalicious. That ought to rake in the caps. What do I owe you?
0DI0009118	About three weeks ago I sent Anders southeast to find a route into Arizona to open new markets for our product.
0DI0009119	He should have been back two days ago, but there's been no sign of him.
0DI0009120	Okay then. Job'll be waiting if you change your mind.
0DI0009121	Thanks. Prove you're reliable on this, and I'll have more for you later.
0DI0009122	With Anders out of commission for so long, we're shorthanded on runners, and some backlogs have piled up.
0DI0009124	You up for something challenging?
0DI0009125	I've got a shipment of Jet and Psycho that needs to be delivered to Motor Runner at Vault 3.
0DI0009126	Great. Here's the package - your contact is Don Hostetler at the Crimson Caravan. Come back and see me when you're done.
0DI0009127	Don't get cocky, the Fiends are twitchy. Most of them won't bother a Khan, but the ones outside the Vault... well, they're outside for a reason.
0DI0009128	Here's the package - good luck. Your payment will be waiting when you get back.
0DI0009131	About goddamn time. Tell the Khans if they can't keep a steady supply, we'll find someone who can.
0DI0009132	Huh? Oh! Oh, right. Yeah. I'll take that. You should go now, before you draw any attention.
0DI0009141	Caps it is. Will there be anything else?
0DI0009142	Here's your NCR money. Will there be anything else?
0DI0009143	Very well. Will there be anything else?
0DI0009144	Enjoy your stay at The Tops.
0DI0009145	Let's see... good guard dog tendencies. If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
0DI0009146	Rex will be faster.
0DI0009147	Rex will be tougher.
0DI0009148	All right, if you want.
0DI0009149	Ha! How do you like that you sons of bitches?!
0DI0009150	Ahhh!...
0DI0009151	You sick bastard, I could have shot you! You must be the backup I've been calling for.
0DI0009152	Where are the rest of your men?
0DI0009153	My army has been ready for some time now. My orders were to await the coming of a messenger.
0DI0009154	You are messenger and message both, it would seem.
0DI0009155	I am the commander of this army. The Son of Mars has granted me the name Lanius. And the time to serve him has come once more.
0DI0009156	Our forces are better equipped to take objectives than hold them. I do not wish to defend this place if another option exists.
0DI0009157	Our opponents follow a strict chain of command, which is both a strength and weakness. I intend to use you to strike at that weakness.
0DI0009158	Find the enemy commander, this General Oliver. Kill him or his resolve. Do this, and his cowards will retreat, leaving the dam to us.
0DI0009159	The word means "butcher" in Latin. I was granted the name after proving myself in several battles.
0DI0009160	Perhaps after today's battle, you too will earn yourself a new name.
0DI0009161	I live to serve Caesar's will - and the will of the Legion. If my victory serves them both, then I am pleased.
0DI0009162	They are passable foes. Like their citizens, they prefer their war from a distance, and at that, they excel.
0DI0009163	Their leaders have on occasion shown brilliance, their rangers in particular have adapted well to our strategies.
0DI0009164	But their rangers are few, and this General Oliver we face is not their best. I regret not being able to face Hanlon, the one who led them last time.
0DI0009165	Their men take comfort in - and rely on - killing at a distance. They will not have the luxury of such comforts this time.
0DI0009166	Our warriors will wash over them in a tide of blood, severing arms before they can attack, legs before they can run, and heads before they can pray.
0DI0009167	So yes, fortune favors our chances, messenger. Provided *you* move quickly.
0DI0009168	In the past, the NCR has relied upon attrition, withering our numbers with ranged fire and falling back as necessary.
0DI0009169	Not this time. The dam contains tunnels to its heart, overlooked by the NCR... now occupied by the Legion.
0DI0009170	When the battle begins, the NCR will find our teeth at their throats in a dozen places. There will be no attrition, no falling back, only carnage.
0DI0009171	It was not intended for war - its top sides are bound to two intake towers by a series of bridges. No doubt snipers nest there.
0DI0009172	On the far side of the dam, a small building provides access to the power plant below. That is where Oliver hides.
0DI0009173	Then ask them. But don't waste my time. The battle draws near.
0DI0009174	Mars's eyes are upon you. Do not fail him - or us.
0DI0009175	I'm not sure what you mean. I think you have me confused with someone else.
0DI0009176	Well that's too bad. I'm just here to enjoy the show so if you don't mind...
0DI0009177	Then leave me alone.
0DI0009178	What the... how'd you...
0DI0009179	For the Legion!
0DI0009180	You will regret this.
0DI0009181	Die, Profligate!
0DI0009182	Sorry, that just ain't gonna happen.
0DI0009183	For Caesar!
0DI0009184	Yeah, thought so.
0DI0009185	I don't have time for this.
0DI0009186	Death to the Legion's enemies!
0DI0009188	Die, infidel!
0DI0009189	Oh shit... really? We should go take a look!
0DI0009190	Settle down. No one uses the radio until I know what's going on.
0DI0009191	Okay, lead the way!
0DI0009192	We're just going to be a moment. We should both take a look first.
0DI0009193	Uh... I think I should check it out first before radioing it in.
0DI0009194	It's your own fault for finding this - now I'm going to have to kill you.
0DI0009195	Fuck it, you're more trouble than you're worth.
0DI0009196	[SUCCEEDED] No, I didn't, not until now anyway. Very well, human. You've made your point, and I withdraw my... request.
0DI0009197	[FAILED] No more negotiating, and definitely no more waiting. This is your last chance before we take it by force.
0DI0009198	There are caches of Stealth Boys out there. With the Mark II in hand, it shouldn't be difficult to upgrade every one of them.
0DI0009199	Our lives, our decision to make. We're tired of sitting around in Jacobstown waiting for a cure.
0DI0009200	Good, good. Smart move, human.
0DI0009201	I knew humans could never be reasonable! I knew it! Stupid, stupid humans! I'll kill you!
0DI0009202	[FAILED] I may be angry, but I'm not stupid.
0DI0009203	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, I should.
0DI0009206	Karl sends his regards.
0DI0009207	You don't give up, do you?
0DI0009208	You've been a persistent annoyance. I had hoped to avoid this, but it seems I have no choice but to deal with you myself.
0DI0009209	Caesar thinks he can change human nature. Most of the Legion is following Caesar, not Caesar's ideals. When he's gone, it'll crumble.
0DI0009210	Might not happen overnight. Might take a few decades. But it'll happen. Basic human nature - greed, ambition, jealousy - will see to it.
0DI0009211	They expand, fast. If you've got land they want, they'll take it, eventually. Did it out West, they'll do it here.
0DI0009212	They keep rolling over people, they'll regret it. That's how revolutions start.
0DI0009213	Seen them grow from a single town - Shady Sands - into the republic. They've done good for the most part.
0DI0009214	Not really. Heard it's paradise in the wasteland. Never been in there myself, doubt they'd let a mutant in.
0DI0009215	Amazes me people would come from all over the wastes to throw away everything they've got in that town.
0DI0009217	You lost me a great opportunity to deal a blow to the Profligates' morale. If not for the service you've rendered unto me, I'd have you crucified.
0DI0009219	I want you to destroy whatever you find in there. And then I want you to come back here and tell me about it.
0DI0009220	So go to the building and take this fucking Platinum Chip with you. My Legionaries will meet you there, with your weapons and equipment.
0DI0009221	Talk to Benny on your way out. He knows I'm going to let you decide how he dies. Maybe you want to remind him.
0DI0009223	I'm not asking you to do this. I'm telling you.
0DI0009224	Now take the Platinum Chip, go down in that bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find. Now get to it. Vale.
0DI0009226	Now take the Platinum Chip, go to the bunker or whatever it is, and destroy whatever gizmo-happy Brahmin shit you find down there.
0DI0009227	And just in case you're thinking of slipping away, now that you've finally got that Platinum Chip in your hands?
0DI0009228	Go ahead, try that. And I'll have you hunted down, and your head mounted on a pole. Now get to it. Vale.
0DI0009229	Cyber-dogs and the like. It's not a field I work in much anymore.
0DI0009230	Yes, but the leadership and I didn't see eye to eye, so I left. It was the right decision, since the Enclave's oil rig was destroyed not long after.
0DI0009231	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Get some rest, I'll brief you in the morning.
0DI0009233	Ask your questions, but keep it short.
0DI0009234	Glad you could join us. Most of my men are already on duty and the crowd has already started gathering outside.
0DI0009235	We've got a busy day ahead of us.
0DI0009236	We trust you, so you're free to have your weapons. Just don't do anything too crazy and we'll back you up.
0DI0009237	You'll be allowed to carry your weapons, but they must remain holstered.
0DI0009238	If you pull them out, my men will shoot you. Understand?
0DI0009239	Security detail consists of rangers stationed here at the dam. Some will keep an eye on the crowd while others will watch the perimeter.
0DI0009240	Snipers and sharpshooters have been assigned to key locations and we also have a special K9 unit sniffing out members of the crowd.
0DI0009241	I've also locked down access to critical locations such as the landing platform on the visitor center.
0DI0009242	I have a full itinerary here. Here you go.
0DI0009243	The President arrives, gives a speech, and then leaves. That's all someone like you needs to know.
0DI0009244	The Legion will definitely try something, but we don't have any solid leads yet.
0DI0009245	I'd almost expect something direct from them, but given the circumstances there's a possibility of something more subtle like sabotage.
0DI0009246	But since we don't have anything solid we'll just have to keep our eyes out for anything out of the ordinary.
0DI0009247	Possible security threats... there was a new guy allowed to help with security at the last minute. Other than that, we don't have any solid leads.
0DI0009248	Someone like you... I'm just glad to have you on board. Do whatever you can. Security sweeps, talk to people, keep an eye out.
0DI0009249	Keep an eye on the crowd and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Other than that, just stay out of the way.
0DI0009250	The plan is to get through today without the shit hitting the fan.
0DI0009251	So I'll be overseeing the security team personally and keeping in constant contact with people over the radio.
0DI0009252	It's a good bet that the Legion is going to try something today so we have to be prepared for anything.
0DI0009253	We'll do whatever it takes to get the President through this visit in one piece.
0DI0009254	President Kimball is arriving shortly. If you want to do any last minute security sweeps or take a look around for anything suspicious, do it now.
0DI0009255	Once you're ready, meet me outside on the observation deck, but don't take too long.
0DI0009256	Good. The President doesn't arrive until tomorrow. Let's get some rest and we'll have a brief talk first thing in the morning.
0DI0009257	If there's nothing else, then let's get moving.
0DI0009258	Alright, I'll give you full access.
0DI0009259	Not a chance. Only the necessary personnel have authorization.
0DI0009260	Well I'm glad I have your approval.
0DI0009262	Maybe now I can get my old life back, or at least most of it.
0DI0009263	It's not much, but I want you to have this. Thanks for your help.
0DI0009264	[FAILED] I'm still not so sure about that.
0DI0009265	[SUCCEEDED] Guess it can't hurt to say hello.
0DI0009266	I know that this place was originally a mining town before the NCR took it over.  I think they mined gold before the war.
0DI0009267	Sorry I don't know much more than that.
0DI0009269	[FAILED] Sorry, I'm not giving it to you.
0DI0009270	[SUCCEEDED] You're probably right. Here, take it.
0DI0009271	[FAILED] Bullying me won't make me give it to you.
0DI0009272	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here. Take it. Just leave me alone.
0DI0009273	Suffering? I may be suffering but I still want to live. You tell that bastard that I have every intention of doing so.
0DI0009274	I'll kill you for that!
0DI0009278	What? No, he... what do you mean, aren't allowed to serve? Why would he lie about that?
0DI0009279	That lying little weasel! I almost fell for it, too! All right, you've got a deal. You can tell Papa I won't support an alliance.
0DI0009280	I'm afraid not. Our instructions were very specific. You have to die.
0DI0009281	I hope you'll be a half-decent challenge.
0DI0009282	Aieee!
0DI0009283	Ave Caesar!
0DI0009284	Oh God help us!
0DI0009285	I haven't heard anything like that. Do you have any proof?
0DI0009286	Okay, come on back when you do.
0DI0009287	Okay, I won't bother.
0DI0009288	[SUCCEEDED] Dude! What a total haul! No way that's copasheshy. Yeah, okay, me and Diana got your back. No sweat.
0DI0009289	[FAILED] Dude... wait, what? That's totally kakadoodle, man. You been huffing fumes in the Magic Bus or something?
0DI0009290	Well-spoken.
0DI0009291	Noooooooo!
0DI0009292	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I am! That is to say, Caesar has many fine warriors, and I wouldn't wish to compare them to the Great Khans.
0DI0009293	[FAILED] You insult our hosts, where I wouldn't dare to. You might want to watch that talk around Papa Khan.
0DI0009294	[SUCCEEDED] Enough! How dare you compare Caesar's finest to this tribe of savages? The mightiest Great Khan is scarcely a match for a Legion recruit!
0DI0009295	The Burned Man would leave their mightiest shitting themselves in terror! I would... Uhhh, that is....
0DI0009296	[FAILED] Win? I wasn't aware we were competing.
0DI0009297	You motherless bastard. You'll pay for this!
0DI0009298	I suppose if asked, I would. But that's a moot point, because Papa's in charge now, and he's not going anywhere.
0DI0009299	Doesn't he? Caesar's representative tells a different tale.
0DI0009300	The glory of the Great Khans will be restored, and once the NCR is pushed back to California, all the land from here to the Colorado will be ours.
0DI0009301	I won't hear any more talk against Caesar or his alliance. The Great Khans will answer Caesar's call to war, and the NCR will pay for their crimes.
0DI0009302	Hah! The Great Khans will not be slaves. Caesar himself has promised us the land from here to the Colorado and the freedom to raid as we see fit.
0DI0009303	Don't you dare mention the NCR under this roof. They are butchers without honor, killers of women and children!
0DI0009304	If you should ever tire of wandering alone, seek us out. You might just have the makings of a Great Khan yourself.
0DI0009305	Whatever your motivation was, I think we owe you a debt.
0DI0009306	You've helped me see Caesar for what he is, and I thank you for that - but if you suggest that again I will have your head.
0DI0009307	We'll remain until the camp is packed up. If you have some plan, see to it quickly.
0DI0009308	Name's Regis. I'm Papa's second-in-command. You might say I... share your concern about Caesar.
0DI0009309	You want to convince Papa not to ally with Caesar, right? Trust me, you'll get nowhere just talking to him about it.
0DI0009310	He's fixated on restoring the glory of the Great Khans, and he sees Caesar as the path to that restoration.
0DI0009311	Because Papa listens to me. And because I actually know how to get things done around here.
0DI0009312	Papa can be a stubborn man, but he's not a tyrant. He listens to his tribe, and to four voices in particular: me, Jack and Diane, and Melissa.
0DI0009313	If you can convince all of us that allying with Caesar is a bad idea, you might be able to sway him.
0DI0009314	I have my doubts about Caesar, yes, but I won't publicly go against Papa Khan based on nothing more than doubts.
0DI0009315	I've heard rumors that tribes who aligned with Caesar in the past were torn apart and reduced to slaves - prove it, and I'll back you.
0DI0009316	You'd have to talk to them - but those two have been thick as thieves since they were kids. Convince one and the other will come around.
0DI0009317	Ah, Melissa. She's a bit of a dreamer. Last time she was in camp, Karl filled her head with stories of serving the Legion as a speculatore.
0DI0009318	Personally, I've never seen a woman in Legionaire's armor, so I have my doubts.
0DI0009319	Good. Oh, one more thing: Caesar's representative, Karl, has become fast friends with Papa. Karl's the one who has him so fixated on this alliance.
0DI0009320	You'll probably have an easier time of things if you can find a way to get him out of the picture.
0DI0009321	I see. Then the Great Khans will fight for the Legion should Caesar give the call. If you change your mind, let me know.
0DI0009322	All right, what is it you wanted?
0DI0009323	Karl talks prettily about the honor and nobility of the Great Khans, but I suspect his actual opinion is less flattering.
0DI0009324	Maybe you could find something he wrote that expresses that opinion, or trick him into losing his cool in the longhouse right in front of Papa.
0DI0009325	I would too, if I were you.
0DI0009328	How are those readings looking, Calamity?
0DI0009329	Stealth field is stable, and the readings are clean. Gamma wave activity is... zero? Odd, but everything looks right.
0DI0009330	The stealth field is unstable and scrambling things. This reading says gamma wave activity is zero, but that can't possibly be right.
0DI0009331	Gamma wave activity is... zero? That can't be right. Must be a result of the interference.
0DI0009332	That's like saying Caesar and Kimball would listen to each other. Nightkin don't have a lot of trust for others, mutants included.
0DI0009333	Help? No, look, I apprec... You know, what, yes, I could use the help. And you look like you can handle yourself.
0DI0009334	I need to get the caravans moving again, that means clearing a path north. There's too much crawling the asphalt up the road to allow it.
0DI0009336	Take care - cool your heels over in the barracks, if you want.
0DI0009337	Thanks, I appreciate it. Come back here when you're done, I might accidentally "lose" some supplies to pay you with.
0DI0009338	At least you asked. More than some that pass through here.
0DI0009340	A Legion outpost. What's it look like?
0DI0009341	We crossed the river when the Profligates fled from Searchlight. From here we stage raiding parties and process captures.
0DI0009342	I'm an officer of the Legion, of the rank Decanus. When we encamped, I commanded a contubernium of eight Legionaries.
0DI0009343	So I command what's left. Under the wise leadership of Centurion Aurelius, of course.
0DI0009344	As much as their cowardice will allow. The Profligates avoid open battle, but on good days we find one of their patrols.
0DI0009345	Their landmines have caused us more trouble than their marksmanship - which is lacking.
0DI0009346	Of course my child. After all that you have done for us we would love to help you in the upcoming battle.
0DI0009347	After all the training in virtual reality, the young ones would relish an opportunity to put their skills to battle. We'll be there when you need us.
0DI0009348	We have our ears on the radio waves. When the fighting starts you can count on our air support.
0DI0009349	Quit goofing off and clear the channel. I'll be damned if the President dies on my watch because you were screwing around.
0DI0009350	Man, I don't even know. It's crazy.
0DI0009351	Shh. You feel that? That's the winds of change, baby, and Fantastic's riding them with his magic angel wings.
0DI0009352	They saw the shit I did for the NCR, how I carried them on my back, brought fire to the heathens. I wasn't gonna help them but they begged.
0DI0009353	Well, somebody begged. Couldn't say who for sure. It's all a blur, you know? Chems, man. What a trip.
0DI0009354	I'm working on some top secret shit I can't even tell you about, it's so mind-blowing.
0DI0009355	But here's a little taste. You know how you can only collect sunlight during the day? What if you could make it daytime all the time?
0DI0009356	Crazy, right? Or is it? I'm gonna find somebody smart and ask him that question, see what he says. It'll be fucking intense.
0DI0009357	Keeping watch, mostly. Trying to make sure the dangers of this plant are minimized.
0DI0009358	I was out on patrol at the time so I wasn't in the camp when it happened.
0DI0009359	There were a few others with me after it happened, including some of my superiors.
0DI0009360	Between radiation poisoning and attacks by the Legion they all died out.
0DI0009361	I don't know, unfortunately. There may be clues somewhere inside the camp, but I'm not about to run in there to find out.
0DI0009362	I want you to put down the troopers that... changed. Turned into ghouls.
0DI0009363	We don't get many supplies out here, but I can offer you some caps and maybe some old gear.
0DI0009364	I understand.
0DI0009365	The whole area is irradiated and filled with mutated creatures.
0DI0009366	[FAILED] Sorry I don't have anything else to offer.
0DI0009367	[SUCCEEDED]I can't offer much more aside from some extra ammo.
0DI0009368	Thank you. Could you bring me their dog tags? Some of the troopers should still be wearing them.
0DI0009369	I'll give you some caps for each one you bring back to me. There's an old rifle in it for you if you can bring me at least 10.
0DI0009370	Oh and take these radiation supplies. You'll need them.
0DI0009371	Those boys aren't themselves anymore. They're in pain, and you don't let good men suffer like that.
0DI0009372	Those troopers deserve a clean death.
0DI0009373	Because it's a far safer place to be than here.
0DI0009374	Mostly ghouls, and a handful of radscorps. I think some geckos moved in not too long ago.
0DI0009375	They seem to stick mostly to the south end of the camp.
0DI0009376	If he's a ghoul he should be put down. I can't let a rabid dog suffer.
0DI0009378	Doesn't mean he isn't suffering, or that he won't go feral eventually.
0DI0009380	[FAILED] I'd rather not take the chance.
0DI0009381	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll give him a shot.
0DI0009382	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't take that risk.
0DI0009383	[SUCCEEDED] Well, maybe I can give him a chance.
0DI0009384	There's a ranger station north of here that has a few ghouls running it. Maybe they'll take him in.
0DI0009385	Good luck with that.
0DI0009387	Thank you for the help. I can rest easier knowing those poor soldiers no longer have to suffer.
0DI0009388	Couldn't you tell? That damn radiation bomb got me. I can't serve the NCR like this...
0DI0009390	I'm not so sure about that. I don't know how the NCR feels about ghouls.
0DI0009394	Sorry, I'm not about to give it up. It's the only thing I have left that reminds me of who I was.
0DI0009395	He wants to kill me? What did I ever do to him?
0DI0009397	Believe me, I'd love to leave, but I can't because I don't know what effect the radiation will have on me.
0DI0009398	I'm guessing it's because I'm outside of the heavy radiation areas. I'm not going outside to find out, though.
0DI0009400	I don't really know the details of it, it all happened too quickly. I remember being hit by a blast of energy.
0DI0009401	Next thing I know, I wake up like... like this.  I've been staying in this house ever since.
0DI0009402	I don't know much about what's going on outside, aside from the creatures that moved in since then.
0DI0009403	Yeah, but I don't want to go feral, and that's probably what more radiation would do to me.
0DI0009404	Radscorpions. Fuckers creep the hell out of me. I'm not going outside while they're still crawling around.
0DI0009405	Look, just leave me alone. I'm not going outside.
0DI0009408	Maybe it's time for me to leave this place, then. Any ideas where I can go?
0DI0009409	Nope, no way. I'm not going anywhere until I know they're gone.
0DI0009410	[FAILED] Sorry, I don't believe you.
0DI0009411	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks for your help. I can finally get out of this place.
0DI0009412	Ok.
0DI0009415	You know what? Why the hell not. There are plenty of places out there to explore, and I'm kinda tired of being stuck in this house.
0DI0009416	Are you sure he'll be okay with it? Not everyone is crazy about ghouls.
0DI0009417	I don't know if that's such a great idea.
0DI0009418	There's a Ranger Station run by ghouls? Finally, I feel like I have a place to go. Thanks for your help.
0DI0009420	Really? Thanks, I owe you one.
0DI0009421	Any ideas where I can go?
0DI0009423	I think I'll take my chances with the wasteland.
0DI0009424	I see. Thanks for saving us the trouble.
0DI0009425	I guess this is it. Not much air left now. Minutes, maybe. And this is what I have to show for it.
0DI0009426	Guess the joke's <gasps air> on me. Prolly shouldn't have killed... all those people. Prolly shoulda stayed at home... and taken care of my ma.
0DI0009427	She... always used to say people who... murder and steal... die bad in the end. Said they...
0DI0009428	I doubt the NCR thinks so. Heh.
0DI0009429	It wasn't easy. There's a lot of initiation rituals to go through, and I've got the scars to prove it.
0DI0009430	But, in the end, I was tough enough to be made a member. Proudest day of my life.
0DI0009431	The President is visiting today. Ranger Grant doesn't want anyone snooping around up there that doesn't have authorization.
0DI0009432	Only NCR engineers or people with explicit permission from Ranger Grant are allowed roof access.
0DI0009433	If you have to ask, you're not authorized.
0DI0009434	Sorry, no can do.
0DI0009435	Okay, just this once. Make it quick though, I don't want to get in trouble for this.
0DI0009436	Not a chance.
0DI0009437	Yeah, but those are the rules.
0DI0009438	Other things weren't lost, but were blocked from our collective memory. Knowledge of what we're capable of, and how things spiral out of control.
0DI0009439	It's in our nature to want to forget truths that keep us awake at night.
0DI0009440	And for that reason it's all the more important that the Followers walk the wastes to remind people of them.
0DI0009441	By all means.
0DI0009442	I would think you'd know better than I. But perhaps they kept their operation here a secret, even from members of their own order.
0DI0009443	They weren't here for me to ask, but I doubt they were here for electricity.
0DI0009444	When the NCR first came here, it was under Brotherhood control. They usually steer clear of one another, but something here changed their minds.
0DI0009445	The Brotherhood's interest in Pre-War technology has always been in weapons. It's likely they were trying to reclaim ARCHIMEDES when the NCR arrived.
0DI0009446	Damned if I know. Put up a hell of a fight, though. We had them outnumbered, I don't know, twenty to one, maybe.
0DI0009447	They held out as long as they could. Lost most of their force before they retreated. Gave us a little parting gift, too.
0DI0009448	They had some of the plant running, but they shut it all down. Enabled an old security system, too, to keep us away from the controls. Jerkoffs.
0DI0009449	None that aren't feral ghouls. Those poor bastards - I can't imagine how they must be suffering.
0DI0009450	I'd like to put them out of their misery but I don't have the heart to do it. Can you do me a favor?
0DI0009451	Some Legionaries snuck into the camp and set off some kind of radiation bomb.
0DI0009452	I don't know where they got it, but it was damn effective. Killed almost everyone and turned the rest into ghouls.
0DI0009453	Sure, what's on your mind?
0DI0009454	Head north toward Novac. Look for a big dinosaur, can't miss it.
0DI0009455	Who is Private Edwards?
0DI0009456	You want to hear the story of the Great Khans? It's a long one, full of honor, glory and betrayal. We have suffered, but we will regain our glory.
0DI0009457	Papa is one of the best leaders the Khans have ever had. He's kept us together through all of our hardships, ever since we left California.
0DI0009458	Bitter Springs changed him, though. He started to really hate the NCR after the Massacre, and sometimes I worry that's poisoned his mind.
0DI0009459	You can ask, but why would I do that? Karl's told me all about life in the Legion! He says I've got all the makings of a speculatore.
0DI0009460	My name is Karl. Glorious Caesar has sent me as an emissary to the Great Khans as a token of our alliance.
0DI0009461	You march all the way out to Red Rock Canyon, enter my home as bold as you please, and you have no idea who I am? You've got guts, I'll give you that.
0DI0009462	Well, then, let me educate you: I am the chief of the Great Khans - the Khan of Khans, if you like. This is my tribe and these are my people.
0DI0009463	Name's Regis - I'm Papa Khan's advisor and right-hand man. I'm also the chief enforcer of the tribe's laws - so watch your behavior.
0DI0009464	They're a tribe of fine warriors, with many proud traditions and a glorious history. They will be worthy additions to the Legion.
0DI0009465	[SUCCEEDED] Join? Oh, no, I simply couldn't. That is... I'm not worthy of such an honor.
0DI0009466	[FAILED] Alas, my first loyalty is to Caesar, and a soldier cannot have two masters.
0DI0009467	Unh... Legion caught me. Said this... was the penalty for drug runners. Please... let me down.
0DI0009468	A Legion patrol caught me trying to cross the river. When they found the, umm, package I was carrying, they strung me up there.
0DI0009469	Please... for the love of God, let me down!
0DI0009470	Well, not exactly. More like... trying to expand our markets. I heard there was a lot of untapped territory down south, but the Legion caught me.
0DI0009471	Unnnh.
0DI0009472	Thank God. Let me down, please!
0DI0009473	They did? Heh. Probably mostly Jack's idea, he always was the soft touch.
0DI0009474	Thanks. You've saved my life, and done the Great Khans a huge favor. I'll be heading back to Red Rock Canyon now - maybe we'll see each other there.
0DI0009475	No! God, please!
0DI0009476	Sure, just make them quick.
0DI0009477	Okay, but keep it quick. I'd like to get out of here before the Legionnaires come to check on me.
0DI0009478	Thanks. See you around.
0DI0009479	Thank you, that was very helpful. I don't think I'll need those books after all.
0DI0009480	Uh, never mind. Take the supplies. All yours, friend.
0DI0009481	All right. I'll have him brought in for questioning.
0DI0009482	Tyrone wasn't authorized to deliver any of this. There were reports of our supplies being used by the Great Khans to make illegal chems.
0DI0009483	Until now, we've never had any hard evidence. Most of the chems end up with the Fiends, a group of crazies the NCR tangles with regularly.
0DI0009484	We'll have to conduct a thorough investigation of all our quartermasters, and crack down on sloppy record-keeping. Thank you.
0DI0009485	Other than Tyrone, were any other NCR citizens involved in this smuggling operation?
0DI0009486	All right. Thanks for all your help.
0DI0009487	Just a little rest stop that me and my good friend Lupe set up. Last stop on your way into New Vegas, first stop on your way out, that's what I say.
0DI0009488	Uh-huh. And how exactly was he exposed?
0DI0009489	I knew I shouldn't have trusted you! You're going to pay for that!
0DI0009490	Well, fuck. I can't believe I'm going back to Red Rock empty-handed. Thanks for trying to help.
0DI0009491	I don't think that's the whole story, but fuck it. I'm going back to Red Rock. I've had enough of this place.
0DI0009492	Absolutely not! Caesar is of great use to me.
0DI0009493	I don't want you harming a hair on that man's head - assuming you can find one.
0DI0009494	I... really don't see the connection. Look, I'm a soldier, not a scientist. I just do my job.
0DI0009495	That's... great? So there was a problem, after all. Huh. Well, I'm not a scientist, so it's not my fault if I didn't see anything wrong.
0DI0009496	They're based out of the old fort in Freeside. They supposedly helped the NCR out at some point, but they go their own way now.
0DI0009497	They know stuff about tech and medicine and usually help out anybody who asks. Can't say I know any more than that.
0DI0009500	The Old Mormon Fort serves as the regional hub for the Followers of the Apocalypse. I am the administrator for this region.
0DI0009501	The Followers of the Apocalypse aren't just interested in research. We care for our fellow man and do everything we can to help humanity.
0DI0009502	Here in Freeside, we provide food and medical services for those in need. We have also organized reconstruction efforts.
0DI0009503	With the help of Bill Ronte, we were able to install a water pump just west of here, but the Kings quickly took control of the pump.
0DI0009504	We arose from the Boneyards of Adytum years ago. Since then, we have made it our mission to rebuild the wasteland and reeducate its inhabitants.
0DI0009505	We hope to forge a brave new world free of war and poverty by sharing knowledge and resources. Our primary goal is the free exchange of ideas.
0DI0009506	That's too bad. Ol' Festus was looking forward to a good tussle.
0DI0009507	If this is your first rodeo with the ol' horseshoes, say "How do I play?". Otherwise, say "Lucky Horseshoes" to begin.
0DI0009509	Well, it has been awhile. All right, let's do this.
0DI0009510	All over the place. The easiest place to find them is unopened bottles of Sunset Sarsaparilla.
0DI0009511	You'd think they'd all have been picked clean by now, but somehow new bottles keep appearing in the machines.
0DI0009512	Some say it's old Festus that does it, hoping someone will finally collect enough caps to earn the treasure.
0DI0009513	Other than bottles, you'll just have to scavenge. You can find caps in the unlikeliest of places, and blue-star caps are no exception.
0DI0009514	Nah, I gave it up years ago. Too dangerous. And even if I did still collect them, I'd tell you the same.
0DI0009515	There's people out there so mad with the idea of treasure that they'll attack strangers just on the suspicion that they have some of those caps.
0DI0009516	No one knows. Money? Weapons? Water? It is, or maybe was, something of value, and that's enough to get people motivated.
0DI0009517	It's said that the treasure is guarded by a man named Festus, and he's the one who asks for the blue-star caps.
0DI0009518	It's also said that he's been around since the war, standing a lonely vigil, waiting for someone to come and take the treasure off his hands.
0DI0009519	That'd make him pretty damn old, but I've met a few people in my travels who claimed they actually met him, and they weren't the lying type either.
0DI0009520	You're right. I'm sorry. That imbecile in the next room has me on edge. I used to be more fun.
0DI0009521	I'm still passionate about my work though. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
0DI0009522	I'm in the Followers of the Apocalypse. How about you?
0DI0009523	Jesus. You're a real goddamn psycho.
0DI0009524	I know I'm not young and pretty any more, but I appreciate the thought all the same. Here, take the parts, you flatterer.
0DI0009526	[SUCCEEDED] Eh, fair enough. It's not like anyone's ever wanted to buy them before. 250 caps it is.
0DI0009527	[FAILED] Oh, I don't know about that. Lots of folks travel by on their way to New Vegas.
0DI0009528	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Yes, you are quite the smoothtalker. What the hell - 250 it is.
0DI0009529	[FAILED] Oh, you're charming in your own way, I suppose. Not budging on the price for those parts, though.
0DI0009532	A pleasure doing business with you.
0DI0009533	No worries. I'll hold onto those parts for you.
0DI0009534	Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
0DI0009535	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. Here, Rey! Mama's got something for you.
0DI0009536	[FAILED] I happen to disagree. 700 caps, and that's my one and only offer.
0DI0009538	He and I had joined up with the same caravan. Add in a lot of whiskey, and, well, let's just say we got to know each other.
0DI0009539	Because of a promise. One I haven't been able to keep. The Nightkin all suffer from schizophrenia. It's the Stealth Boys they use, used to use.
0DI0009540	Nightkin have a hard time being seen like normal folks. Can't stand it. A few already left to try and find more Stealth Boys.
0DI0009541	Miserable situation. They either stay here and suffer, or dig up Stealth Boys and lose their minds. Not much of a choice.
0DI0009542	That happens, there's a good chance other Nightkin will follow. It'll make it hard to get a cure to them.
0DI0009543	Worse, if Keene and the Nightkin tear up the Mojave hunting for Stealth Boys, people are going get killed.
0DI0009544	Most humans can't tell the difference between mutants. Might come here looking for payback.
0DI0009545	I watch over the Bighorners. They're sweet, gentle creatures, but sometimes they get ornery. Just like my grandkids!
0DI0009546	Outside New Vegas, at what was once called Nellis Air Force Base, resides an unusual tribe known as the Boomers.
0DI0009547	They are, shall we say, aggressively reclusive? They have several howitzers they fire at anyone who dares approach the base.
0DI0009548	Artillery of this sort has a range of several miles. If it's going to fire on Hoover Dam, I want it firing at my targets.
0DI0009549	If not, then I want to make sure that the Boomers don't sign similar treaties to fire their guns in support of the NCR or Caesar's Legion.
0DI0009550	I offer many benefits, but vacation time isn't one of them.
0DI0009551	Why is good help so impossible to find?
0DI0009552	Use extreme caution when approaching the base. Their firepower is... considerable.
0DI0009553	Recently, one of my roaming Securitrons observed a man near the base studying the pattern of its artillery fire. Maybe he's learned something.
0DI0009554	You laid the foundation for my victory, so fine - I'll permit some latitude in how you schedule your work.
0DI0009556	The Omertas are fanatically loyal to each other. Still, among any group, one can find the occasional degenerate.
0DI0009557	Gomorrah's receptionist happens to be one. For years she passed on whispers of what was taking place at the casino, in exchange for payment.
0DI0009558	A few months ago, she clammed up. Odds are she's scared, but I've had no way of approaching her. Start with her.
0DI0009559	The print-out I've given you lists every lead I've been able to uncover. See what you can find out.
0DI0009560	After all that we've accomplished?
0DI0009561	Arrogance was their undoing. There might be a lesson in that. But moving on...
0DI0009562	Indeed. Moving on...
0DI0009563	Since 2278, I've lost five roaming Securitrons near Hidden Valley.
0DI0009564	I didn't receive any clear video of the incidents, but telemetry from the units destroyed indicates they were attacked with energy weapons.
0DI0009565	It's obvious that the Brotherhood has a base in Hidden Valley or thereabouts. Finding it won't be easy, but getting inside will be the real trick.
0DI0009566	We're talking about a coterie of bulging-eyed fanatics who think all Pre-War technology belongs to them.
0DI0009567	They'll never accept my using an army of robots to defend New Vegas. While it's a fight I can win, I'd rather sidestep it altogether.
0DI0009568	Don't tell me that you've fallen for the stories of noble paladins on crusade, preserving mankind's technology in a benighted age? Dross!
0DI0009569	In any case... this is an employer - employee relationship. I've given you an assignment, and the directions are clear.
0DI0009570	Simple - an NCR Ranger named Grant is in charge of security arrangements for the visit. Present yourself to him, let him know you want to help.
0DI0009571	Given your reputation, it's a near-certainty that he'll accept your offer.
0DI0009572	Don't dally. The precise time of Kimball's visit is a closely-guarded secret, but it will happen soon.
0DI0009573	There's nothing to think about. You have a job to do, so do it.
0DI0009576	A lot of the crops grown here support the various NCR camps in the region - McCarran, Golf, and Forlorn Hope, to name a few.
0DI0009577	We can't have wastelanders popping in here for a free meal, so my squad and I are assigned to keep things from going to hell.
0DI0009578	Impressive, aren't they? You don't see anything like this outside of NCR territory, that's for sure.
0DI0009579	We get the water - clean water - pumped in from Lake Mead. If you follow the big pipes, they'll take you all the way to the Lake.
0DI0009580	The Office of Science and Industry has carefully calculated the amount of water needed for these crops. The whole thing is handled by computer.
0DI0009581	Besides, most of these crops look fine to me. If the farmers can't handle the job, they shouldn't have signed up in the first place.
0DI0009582	If there really is a problem, they can take it up with Lieutenant Boyd at McCarran. Farming isn't my department.
0DI0009583	Corporal White is currently solving the mystery of the Great Water Shortage. Tried to convince me he had proof, even. I didn't buy any of it.
0DI0009584	He went over to Westside to talk to Tom Anderson. Anderson's a Follower of the Apocalypse. Helps the people in Westside grow crops or something.
0DI0009585	Haven't seen him. Serves him right if the NCR declares him AWOL.
0DI0009586	He's a glory hound, always looking for a way to get promoted to Ranger. Thinks he's too good to be a regular trooper like the rest of us.
0DI0009589	Sure do. Came from The Hub on account of the Thaler Act. Farming's decent work, but the whole thing's a bum deal.
0DI0009590	Something the politicians back in Shady Sands came up with. They pay us to move here and farm the land. They even protect the fields.
0DI0009591	Bad soil and rationed water. It's to be expected around here, but the rationing's off. Worst part is NCR won't admit it.
0DI0009592	Pretty hard to meet their crop quotas with twenty percent less water than we're supposed to be getting. Not that OSI cares about any of this.
0DI0009593	They're part of the deal, the Thaler Act. We work the fields while they protect the crops and the water.
0DI0009594	Lotta folks come to New Vegas and lose everything in Freeside or the Strip. They get hungry, desperate, and try to take our hard work.
0DI0009595	Much as I sympathize, their theft would put me in a bad spot. I got a crop quota to meet.
0DI0009596	Everything I can. Farmers out here don't have the luxury of being picky. I get by mostly on maize and tobacco.
0DI0009598	Westside, huh? I hope the NCR does something about those thieving bastards. I appreciate it, and so do the rest of the farmers.
0DI0009599	Maybe you don't want for food much, but you can sell these on the market for a good price. Like I said, we're much obliged for the help.
0DI0009600	That's what I figured. Don't know why the heck they're so stubborn they couldn't just admit it.
0DI0009601	Sure you don't. All just a happy coincidence, am I right?
0DI0009602	I hear the Brahmin ranchers out in Redding are looking for some hard workers, so I might try there first. I hate working with Brahmin, though.
0DI0009603	Good luck to you out here.
0DI0009604	I wouldn't be able to meet the quota, and the NCR would kick me out of my job, anyway. Nah, it's better I get out on my own terms.
0DI0009605	Yes, he said he was looking into the water shortage, but I haven't heard back from him. Got the feeling he wasn't here in any official way.
0DI0009606	White was talking to me about computer stuff and water delivery schedules through the pipes, but I'm just a farmer. Tech stuff is beyond me.
0DI0009607	The last person I saw him talking to was Lieutenant Romanowski. Romanowski's around here somewhere. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
0DI0009608	Ever since he lost his job a few years back he hasn't been the same. He took a switch to us for the tiniest things.
0DI0009609	We were trying to get away when the legion showed up. I'm glad he ran off like a coward, but slavery wasn't the kind of escape I was looking for.
0DI0009610	Anything you can do to help, just please get us out of here.
0DI0009612	Just making some deliveries to the troops here in Primm. I'm stationed in California, but I come across the border a couple times a month.
0DI0009613	You trying to get me busted? Keep your damn voice down - Lieutenant Hayes already has his eye on me.
0DI0009614	Look, I already told Chomps that the NCR's getting suspicious of all these "misplaced" supplies. Bigger risk means bigger cost - 300 caps bigger.
0DI0009615	Keep your damn voice down. Even though Lieutenant Hayes got himself killed recently, somebody else might be watching me.
0DI0009617	Yeah, and as it turns out, the advance wasn't enough. The price has gone up. That's just how it goes.
0DI0009618	[SUCCEEDED] I've reconsidered my position, and I think it would be in my best interest if I were to sacrifice my profit on this particular deal.
0DI0009619	[FAILED] I'd love to help you and Chomps, but I got my own expenses to worry about.
0DI0009620	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, I'll just eat the cost and do a favor for Chomps. Just this one time only.
0DI0009621	[FAILED] Hey, that's just business.
0DI0009622	Pleasure doing business with you. Of course, this whole deal never happened, am I right?
0DI0009623	Whatever. You know where to find me.
0DI0009624	Still got 'em. You ready to pay up?
0DI0009625	It's better than farming or herding Brahmin. As long as they don't send me to the front lines, I'm a happy man.
0DI0009626	I'm just the middle man. The Great Khans are a hard group, and some of them are no good, but they're not all the same.
0DI0009627	I believe in the NCR, but that doesn't make it right for them to roll over anyone who doesn't want any part of 'em.
0DI0009628	He's always been shady, but this is the first time he's outright screwed me.
0DI0009630	She's my daughter. Takes a little too much after her mother, rest her soul, but she's happy with the Great Khans, and that's enough for me.
0DI0009631	Don't leave a trail.
0DI0009632	The only Khans this far into NCR territory is me and my crew, and I didn't steal squat from you.
0DI0009633	Besides, even if some of my gang did steal from you, I wouldn't rat them out. Loyalty actually means something to the Great Khans.
0DI0009634	As far as I know, it's just me and my crew out here, and if it really was Great Khans who mugged you, they didn't come this way. I'd have seen 'em.
0DI0009635	Awaiting a delivery, but it's a no-show. I'm guessing that the Deathclaws in the quarry have something to do with that.
0DI0009636	Is that right? What's your angle?
0DI0009637	I know something of your reputation with my gang, and I can't be seen working with you. Sorry, but I'll handle this.
0DI0009638	Supplies to make chems. The NCR's the best source since they're hard to come by anywhere else.
0DI0009639	We don't really use the chems ourselves, just sell them to anybody with the caps. If it ends up hurting the NCR in the process, that's a bonus.
0DI0009640	The Khans and the NCR don't get along - they prefer to shoot us on sight, even if we're not looking for a fight.
0DI0009641	Right. All right, here's the deal.
0DI0009642	I was expecting a shipment of chemicals. It's usually in a suitcase dropped off in one of the big machines up here.
0DI0009643	Because of the Deathclaws, I have to assume that the suitcase is still in Sloan. Snoop around the place and get it for me.
0DI0009644	All right, fair enough. You help us out, and I'll owe you one.
0DI0009645	That's a motive I can understand.
0DI0009646	I wouldn't eat or drink them, but no, they won't explode if you drop them or anything.
0DI0009648	Don't kill anybody if you don't have to. I'm a scout, and I like to keep a low profile.
0DI0009649	You actually came through for us. I... didn't expect that. Anyway, the Great Khans pay their debts and don't forget their friends.
0DI0009650	If you ever come out to Red Rock Canyon, I'll put in a good word for you.
0DI0009651	We're an independent group. We take care of our own and don't take crap from anybody, especially the NCR.
0DI0009652	That's a smart move. The Great Khans look out for their friends.
0DI0009653	Bitter Springs happened. Women and children died when the NCR attacked the Great Khans there, and the NCR just pretends it never happened.
0DI0009654	Our main camp is up in Red Rock Canyon, but we don't allow just anyone to come on in.
0DI0009655	The NCR can't touch us there - too many places for us to ambush them. We see their scouts poking around once in awhile, but they keep their distance.
0DI0009656	<snuffle>
0DI0009657	<whuff>
0DI0009659	<snuffle!>
0DI0009660	[SUCCEEDED] <snuffle!>
0DI0009661	[FAILED] <whuff!>
0DI0009662	This battle is far from over. Once the reinforcements from McCarran arrive, the counteroffensive will begin.
0DI0009663	They're a bunch of escaped cons from down south. The NCR was using them to maintain the railways as part of their sentence.
0DI0009664	I don't know who screwed up, but the Powder Gangers are loose. It was one group that attacked us and took our entire supply of dynamite.
0DI0009665	We'd see them occasionally, but they didn't seem too keen on getting too close to the quarry. Not sure if it was the noise or all the workers.
0DI0009666	I can't believe that an entire pack moved into the quarry. I thought that kind of bad luck only happened in New Vegas.
0DI0009667	Have you even seen a Deathclaw? They're taller than a man and far, far stronger and faster. And, there's a whole pack of them out there.
0DI0009668	You'd have to be the meanest, toughest, roughest bastard in the wasteland to have any chance against them, and I don't think that's you.
0DI0009669	You'd need to take out the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Kill 'em, and the pack will scatter. Pretty tough job.
0DI0009670	I don't what it is about you, but I think you could actually pull it off. Deathclaws are tough bastards, but you might be even tougher.
0DI0009671	Nobody here's any use to you in a fight against Deathclaws, but take these medical supplies. You'll probably need them.
0DI0009672	To do the job right, you've got to get rid of the pack leaders - the Mother Deathclaw and the Deathclaw Alpha Male. Should run the rest of 'em off.
0DI0009674	It all gets shipped by rail over towards Boulder City and Hoover Dam. The NCR's probably building fortifications with it all.
0DI0009675	It's a big machine which moves rocks around, piles at a time. It's Pre-War tech, so you need to thump it once in awhile to keep it running.
0DI0009676	Nope. The NCR's been trying to switch over to using paper money, like in the Pre-War days. Trouble is that the exchange rates ain't exactly fair.
0DI0009677	For example, a hundred bucks in NCR money is valued at roughly half that in caps around here. Seems like a rotten deal for us, but work is work.
0DI0009679	Yeah, he - or she, I guess - wandered into camp a couple of months back. Seemed friendly enough.
0DI0009680	Ugly-looking thing, but the guys like having it around. Good for morale and all that.
0DI0009681	Uh... hmm... well, no accounting for taste I guess. Anyway...
0DI0009682	I've got this recipe for a Deathclaw Omelet that I've been itching to try out. Trouble is - I need a Deathclaw egg. Kinda obvious, I suppose.
0DI0009684	You're just pulling my leg, right? Why would anyone... uh... never mind. Anyway...
0DI0009686	Ha. Yeah, can you believe some people still eat that stuff? Anyway...
0DI0009687	My great-aunt Rose ran a bed and breakfast back in California, in a town called Modoc. She's the one who created the recipe in the first place.
0DI0009688	I don't know how she managed to get a hold of a female Deathclaw, but she kept it in a shed. Aunt Rose had a steady supply of eggs for her omelets.
0DI0009689	At least, she did until some stranger came along and killed the Deathclaw. Shot it right in the eye.
0DI0009690	The quarry just north of here is full of Deathclaws, so there's bound to be an egg or two in there somewhere.
0DI0009691	Of course, a Deathclaw egg from anywhere will do. According to my Aunt Rose, those things have a ridiculously long shelf life.
0DI0009692	I don't have much in the way of money, but I'd be willing to share the secret of the recipe.
0DI0009693	All right. Do you need anything to eat or drink?
0DI0009694	All right, then!
0DI0009698	Oh, I'm not. I'm making my way to New Vegas. They say anything goes there, and best of all, the NCR can't mess it up for you.
0DI0009699	I'll get there eventually. I've heard that you can't even get into the Strip unless you're rich.
0DI0009700	Born and raised. Things back in California are better than they've ever been, according to my grandpa.
0DI0009701	The Raiders are mostly gone now and it's easy enough to get a job at one of the mills or farms. But now there's taxes and laws and other things.
0DI0009702	The NCR keeps things safe and orderly, but it's all very boring. So, I came out east towards the frontier.
0DI0009703	Well, there's the Deathclaws, of course, and there was that one group of Powder Gangers who stole all the dynamite.
0DI0009704	I think we're too small and poor for anyone to bother with, really. I keep a weapon near my bunk, though - same as everybody here.
0DI0009705	I can't believe you actually got one. Give me a bit to get the recipe set up, then talk to me again.
0DI0009706	Stay safe. The road's dangerous in these parts. Or so I hear.
0DI0009707	What? This? He stole this from me at gunpoint. Lucky for me, he got distracted and I got a chance to draw on him.
0DI0009708	It's a, uh, necklace that I made out of these special caps. You ever see any caps with a blue star on them like these?
0DI0009709	Ah, then you know how rare they are. I'm just glad they're back where they belong. You can never be too careful these days.
0DI0009710	Well, it was nice to meet you. I'm going to take a few moments to get myself together, then head out.
0DI0009711	That's too bad. They're very rare. Well, I should be going. Nice talking to you.
0DI0009712	You know, I was just thinking the same thing about you.
0DI0009713	They are nice, aren't they? I'm very proud of them.
0DI0009714	Pretty sure, yeah. it's really nice, isn't it? Have you ever seen caps with pretty blue stars on them like these?
0DI0009715	Well, I guess you're just too smart for me. Unfortunately, I can't leave any witnesses behind.
0DI0009716	So what if I did? What are you going to do about it?
0DI0009717	H-here. You can have the damn necklace. Just leave me alone!
0DI0009718	You are such a wimp! Die!
0DI0009719	Not if I kill you first!
0DI0009720	Fat chance of that. What are you going to do if don't?
0DI0009721	Uh, sure. I'll just be going then.
0DI0009722	It started off innocently enough. I was traveling, as I often do, and happened to observe you picking up one of those blue-star caps.
0DI0009723	You didn't show any reaction to it, so I figured you didn't know what you'd gotten your hands on.
0DI0009724	Okay, you're a dangerous sort. I get that. But I have some information I think you'll find useful, which made me follow you for a spell.
0DI0009725	There's an old wasteland legend that says somewhere out there is a fabulous treasure from before the war.
0DI0009726	Those caps with the blue star on them, the tale goes, are the key to that treasure. They're called Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
0DI0009727	I had to make sure of your disposition. There's a lot of jumpy folks out there that'd shoot a man as soon as talk to him.
0DI0009728	Now that's we're conversing, though, I can tell you what I know about those caps.
0DI0009729	Fine. Just do me a favor. If you find more of those things, and plan on keeping them, watch out for a man named Allen Marks.
0DI0009730	He's killed more than a few people to collect as many of those caps as he can, and your ignorance as to what they are won't protect you.
0DI0009731	Not for long. I met her on the road a few days ago, and we've been traveling together since.
0DI0009732	Yeah, every once in a while you can find a cap with a blue star on it. They're pretty rare, so I started collecting them.
0DI0009733	Once I had enough, I made a necklace out of them, since I thought they were lucky.
0DI0009734	And maybe they are, since you managed to show up at just the right time.
0DI0009737	[SUCCEEDED] Really? I had no idea. And here I've been carrying them all this time, never knowing how dangerous they were.
0DI0009738	What do you think I should do with them? Bury 'em or something?
0DI0009739	[FAILED] Even if what you're saying is true, I think I'll take my chances. This necklace and I have been through a lot, and we're both still kicking.
0DI0009740	If that's not lucky, what is?
0DI0009741	What? The hell I will!
0DI0009742	Uh, yeah, sure. H-here you go. Just don't hurt me.
0DI0009743	They're all yours. I sincerely hope they work better for you than they did for me.
0DI0009744	You got it. I'm glad I ran into you. Thanks for the advice.
0DI0009745	I will. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
0DI0009746	Prepared already. I like it. There's no need to give me the details, it's probably best that way.
0DI0009747	Even though you already have a plan, I may have some information that you might find useful.
0DI0009748	You better start thinking about it soon, we're on a limited time schedule.
0DI0009749	I do have some information that could help you.
0DI0009750	True, but I don't think it'll be that easy.
0DI0009751	Going in guns blazing with all the NCR Troopers and Rangers stationed at the dam will just get you killed.
0DI0009752	I do have some information that you might find useful, if you're interested.
0DI0009753	Fine, be like that. I'm just here to give you whatever information I can to help you get the job done.
0DI0009754	If you don't need my help, that's fine with me.
0DI0009755	I've been spying in the dam for a while now. I've gathered quite a bit of information from various sources.
0DI0009757	I'll be in the crowd. Do whatever you need to do, then find me before Kimball arrives.
0DI0009758	Here's your disguise. This'll get you past most of the NCR there, but watch out for the rangers. Odds are this won't fool them.
0DI0009759	I'll meet you there. Good luck.
0DI0009760	Suggestions, eh? I'd suggest you play to your strengths. There's probably plenty of ways to kill Kimball, just find one that works best for you.
0DI0009761	We'll have a few hours before he arrives. You should look around and see if you can find anything that you can use.
0DI0009762	Just be careful. You don't want to cause a scene before Kimball even shows up.
0DI0009763	I've been able to get some basic information on the schedule for Kimball's visit as well as getting some rough security details.
0DI0009764	I have some disguises for us. I've already got mine. A wealthy Brahmin Baron who bribed his way into seeing the President.
0DI0009765	As for you, I have a NCR trooper uniform that I acquired. It'll fool most of the troopers and civilians, but it probably won't fool the rangers.
0DI0009766	Well, I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
0DI0009767	If there's nothing else, then we should get moving.
0DI0009768	The President is scheduled to arrive sometime in the afternoon. It's going to be a short visit to boost morale for the NCR troops.
0DI0009769	He's going to arrive, give a speech, and then leave. No meet and greet, no questions, just a quick in and out.
0DI0009770	They're probably afraid something is going to happen. For good reason.
0DI0009771	I wasn't able to find a final itinerary for his visit, but if you can find one, you can get more details on what's going to happen.
0DI0009772	Security is going to be tight. Rangers are stationed all around the observation deck where Kimball is going to give his speech.
0DI0009773	Security is led by a Ranger Grant. He's a pretty rough guy who's seen a lot of combat. It's best if you steer clear of him.
0DI0009774	The crowd consists of troopers and a few select civilians who were lucky enough to bribe their way in. They shouldn't cause much trouble for you.
0DI0009775	Finally, there's the additional security that Kimball will be bringing with him. I wasn't able to find out much on that.
0DI0009776	If I had more time in their computers I could've accessed the full duty roster and guard deployment. Maybe you'll have better luck.
0DI0009777	Okay, what would you like to know?
0DI0009778	Here you go. Put it to good use.
0DI0009779	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing us both up, so I'll just hold on to this.
0DI0009780	Suit yourself. What else do you want to know?
0DI0009782	Harder than you think. I don't want you blowing this, so I'll just hold on to this.
0DI0009784	Have you seen my helmet? I can't seem to find it.
0DI0009785	It's always in the last place you look. I wonder why that is.
0DI0009786	Thanks mister, you're the greatest.
0DI0009788	There it is! Thanks lady, you're the greatest.
0DI0009789	He's coming to give a big fancy speech to all of us troops stationed here at the dam.
0DI0009790	I'm pretty excited. He seems like such a nice guy and I get to meet him.
0DI0009791	He's giving me a medal. I don't know why though. I'm just doing my job like all the other guys. I'm still excited though.
0DI0009792	I can't believe someone killed President Kimball. He was such a nice guy, why would anyone want to hurt him?
0DI0009793	I can't believe someone wanted to kill President Kimball. I'm glad he got out of here safe.
0DI0009794	Momma always told me not to talk to strangers, but you seem like a nice person.
0DI0009795	Momma left me on a farm when she went out prospecting, but when she never came back, the owner didn't want me around and kicked me out on my own.
0DI0009796	A nice guy came up and asked me if I wanted to join the NCR so I did. Now the Troopers are my family. I like it here. Everyone is so nice.
0DI0009797	That's too bad. I need it for the ceremony. I need to look my best and I need my lucky helmet.
0DI0009798	I'll just have to keep looking. Thanks anyway.
0DI0009799	Ha ha, you big joker you. You're funny. I like you.
0DI0009800	I really need to find my helmet though. Thanks anyway.
0DI0009801	So, you must be the Courier the reports mentioned. Pass this message on to your commander - Hoover Dam will not fall while I still draw breath.
0DI0009802	What's it look like, man? I'm fucking king of the NCR. Caesar's Legion has Caesar, the NCR's got Fantastic. It's Fantastic's NCR now.
0DI0009803	This whole war's about power, man. Caesar wants it. NCR wants it. Fantastic's got it.
0DI0009804	After I fixed HELIOS One and basically saved the NCR from the dumbshits who run it, I got myself a little promotion. Now I run the whole shebang.
0DI0009805	Whoa, hey. All right, man. It's cool. Who said anything about being your master?
0DI0009806	I'm just the guy who tells you to do the stuff you do before you do it.
0DI0009807	Man, what aren't my responsibilities? Dam overflow, dam underflow. Dam leakage. Sometimes the dam gets too big and I have to shrink it down.
0DI0009808	People come to me to resolve their disputes with my wisdom.
0DI0009809	Like, hey  Fantastic, who gets to keep this doodad we found? Or, yo, Fantastic, when will you accept that you're the father of my child? It's crazy.
0DI0009810	They sure as shit did. I mean there's still formalities, like I have to run everything by Lawson before I do it.
0DI0009811	But do I ever do that? Is his name Fantastic?
0DI0009812	No, man. That's just what I'm supposed to do.
0DI0009813	But when he tells me to push the middle button to divert the intake, and the right button feels nicer when I touch it, I know where my loyalty is.
0DI0009814	Man, I just don't know how an idiot like that gets put in charge of anything.
0DI0009815	I should think so, but it would be up to Marjorie.
0DI0009816	I have, however, told her how instrumental you were in revolutionizing our cuisine. And she knows what we stand to gain from a ruler who supports it.
0DI0009817	Have a word with her, see what she says. I daresay she'll be more receptive with these new developments.
0DI0009818	Better get back to it then, I don't want those poor soldiers suffering for longer than they have to.
0DI0009819	The rangers at Echo have been keeping an eye on that place. It's relatively new, but those bastards have already dug in.
0DI0009820	They appear to be running a slave-trading operation and it also seems to be one of the primary crossing points for Legion raiding parties.
0DI0009821	Let's hear it.
0DI0009823	No, I'm not. Not yet anyway. I'm Private Kyle Edwards, former NCR trooper.
0DI0009824	I'm here because I have nowhere else to go.
0DI0009825	Are you sure about that?
0DI0009826	Yeah, I am. What of it?
0DI0009827	Not much, I'm afraid. What do you want to know?
0DI0009828	Name's Logan. What the hell do you want?
0DI0009829	That's none of your damn business.
0DI0009830	Tell you what. Bring us those suits, and you can come with us while we loot the town. You can keep a share.
0DI0009831	It's about damn time. You ready to go?
0DI0009832	Anything branded by the NCR related to weapons, computers, or radios.
0DI0009833	There's gotta be more than that, keep looking.
0DI0009834	Alright, we can move on now. Here's the key to the Fire Station.
0DI0009835	Same stuff. Any NCR weapons, computer parts, or radio parts.
0DI0009836	I'll need more than that. Keep looking.
0DI0009837	Alright, thanks for the help. Time to die loser.
0DI0009838	You have been a useful associate, that I'll grant you. Okay, he's yours for a discount. Just make sure the stage is downwind of the audience.
0DI0009839	Well, well. Congratulations on getting the Mark II prototype functional, doctor. Now just hand it over and we'll be on our way.
0DI0009840	It is different! Right now I'm trying very hard to remain civil, and you're not making it easy with your incessant questions!
0DI0009841	Bah! Humans.
0DI0009843	Oooh, those Nightstalkers, always killing my Bighorners! It'll be nice to give them a piece of my mind!
0DI0009844	Oh no, dearie, three makes a crowd.
0DI0009845	I've compared the brain chemistry of a Nightkin to one of the local Nightstalkers we killed. They both exhibit similar neurochemical changes.
0DI0009846	Now, I'm not claiming that Nightstalkers are running around wearing Stealth Boys, mind you. I just don't think it's all a coincidence.
0DI0009847	Very well. Please stand back - I don't want any erroneous readings. You're welcome to stay and observe if you want, though.
0DI0009848	Wait, Lily's not in position yet. Talk to me again once she's settled in.
0DI0009849	Oh, all right.
0DI0009850	Maybe you're right... but what will they think? How can I look them in the face ever again?
0DI0009851	Well, I guess I don't deserve any better, huh? So be it...
0DI0009852	You're right, there's no place for me here. Just... just tell them I'm sorry, and that they won't have to worry about me, ever again.
0DI0009853	[SUCCEEDED]... It's all me, isn't it? The pain, the anger, my joy, all of that's just me.
0DI0009854	I should've met you before, stranger. Thank you.
0DI0009855	[FAILED] Some choice. I can't stay here now, and I don't have the means to leave.
0DI0009856	Father... what's he going to do to me? I can't stay here, I can't hide from this!
0DI0009857	Are you out of your mind? I just... no, no, no!
0DI0009858	I don't want to get out, do you hear me! I just... no, no, no!
0DI0009859	You think I really care about the money? I just... no, no, no!
0DI0009860	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. I've heard about you. You've got quite the reputation already.
0DI0009861	Well let's get down to business. Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
0DI0009862	So you're the bigshot that Caesar put in charge of this mission. Can't say I'm impressed, but let's just get down to business.
0DI0009863	Once we get started, we're going to be on a tight schedule. Are you ready to do this?
0DI0009864	Right, straight to business. Good. No wonder Caesar sent you.
0DI0009866	Good. Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk the plan over first thing in the morning.
0DI0009867	Get some sleep. You got a big day ahead of you.
0DI0009868	Good. Now Kimball is scheduled to give his speech tomorrow. We'll rest here tonight and talk over the plan first thing in the morning.
0DI0009870	Well hurry it up and get your shit together.
0DI0009871	All right, power on the Stealth Boy, Lily.
0DI0009872	Interesting. Try thinking aggressive thoughts now. Think about smashing a Radscorpion.
0DI0009873	All right, we're done here. Go ahead and power the Stealth Boy down, Lily.
0DI0009874	Turning it on. Urgh... feels strange. Strange but good.
0DI0009875	Grrr! Lily smash! Haha.
0DI0009876	Awww... I liked having it on.
0DI0009877	I'll get back to you on that in a moment. Once I've analyzed the results - uh, oh.
0DI0009878	Was a resort Pre-War. I renamed it to Jacobstown after an old friend. Died a long time ago.
0DI0009879	I figured us mutants needed a place to call our own. Town's far enough away from humans so they don't bother us much.
0DI0009880	One of these days I'm hoping we can trade with the rest of the wasteland. No more fighting, just... get along.
0DI0009881	Was part of Super Mutant army, ran a town, walked the wasteland with a tribal. Now I'm here.
0DI0009882	Long story, so here's the short version. The Master created the Super Mutants and Nightkin.
0DI0009883	The Master thought he could unify everyone. No more differences, no more war. Didn't end well.
0DI0009884	Town was Broken Hills. Bunch of Super Mutants, humans, and Ghouls all living together peacefully. Well, most of the time.
0DI0009885	We were looking for a GECK to save the village of Arroyo. Eventually, we did. Nuked an oil rig in the process.
0DI0009886	We went separate ways after that. I went east into the Rockies, looking for other mutants like myself.
0DI0009887	Don't know what happened to my friend. I've got a feeling it turned out all right in the end.
0DI0009889	Bighorners. Good eating. And we can trade the hides. Got a lot of wild ones around here, so it's easy to restock the herd.
0DI0009890	You must be the backup I've been calling for. Where are the rest of your men?
0DI0009891	Thank God. I hoped someone would come eventually, but where are the rest of your men?
0DI0009892	Shit. Have you any damn idea what lives in these caves!? We need to get out of...
0DI0009893	We need to go now!
0DI0009896	I managed to kill that thing, but not before it mangled my leg all up. No way I'm walking out of here like this.
0DI0009897	I've been keeping quiet and hoping they don't realize one of their buddies is missing. We need to get out of here before they come back.
0DI0009898	With my bare hands. I would have shot it, but I was cleaning my gun when they swarmed the camp.
0DI0009899	The ugly bastard knocked me down and started dragging me down into these caves. I managed to get my knife out and get a good throw into it's back.
0DI0009900	Once he was on the ground, all it took was a bit of choking and punching to finish him off.
0DI0009901	[SUCCEEDED] Thanks a lot, doc. I think I should be able to walk out of here, now.
0DI0009902	I don't want to risk running into a pack of those freaks alone, though. Could you escort me out of here?
0DI0009903	[FAILED] Whoa there, buddy. What you're suggesting is downright archaic.
0DI0009904	I think my tourniquet will work for now, but I still can't walk like this.
0DI0009905	If I had a doctor's bag, I could probaly fix it up myself.
0DI0009906	Thanks a lot, doc. Looks like I should be able to at least walk out of here, now.
0DI0009908	Great, just leave me here, then.
0DI0009909	You can have it if you get me out of here alive. I won't have a use for it when I get back to California.
0DI0009910	Great, I'll start heading back to California now. I'm not about to let myself get killed by future NCR incompetence.
0DI0009913	Are you crazy? No way in hell am I going deeper into these caves.
0DI0009914	You haven't seen what they did to the other troopers, and I'd rather not find out why they took all of the bodies.
0DI0009915	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you have a point. They were good men and deserved better.
0DI0009916	I can't guarantee I'll be much help against their numbers, but I'll do what I can. Chances are we won't get out of here alive anyway.
0DI0009917	[FAILED] Hey, I'm all for being a hero when the time is right, but there are at least 12 of those bastards lurking around in here.
0DI0009918	I'd rather not join my buddies any time soon.
0DI0009919	Lead on.
0DI0009920	All right, let's see here... neural pathways look good... definitely a breed of guard dog.
0DI0009921	If I transplant this brain into Rex, he'll be a bit more ferocious in his attacks.
0DI0009923	Let's take a look... exceptional synapse responses... descended from some type of cattle dog, I imagine.
0DI0009924	If you want me to transplant this brain into Rex, he'll become more durable.
0DI0009926	All right. Your call.
0DI0009927	Big brain on this one. All right, let's see... damn, heavy amounts of the chemicals used in the drug Turbo are present.
0DI0009928	Transplanting this brain will make Rex faster than he was before.
0DI0009936	Oh yeah? Fuck off, asshole.
0DI0009937	You better make it worthwhile. I ain't going to risk my neck in The Wasteland for shit.
0DI0009938	[FAILED] Like I give a shit. Didn't I say get lost, or are you looking for a beating?
0DI0009939	[SUCCEEDED] I don't... wait. You've got a point.
0DI0009940	All right, fellas. Let's get out of this shit hole.
0DI0009941	What? Hey, guys! Help me here!
0DI0009943	That'll do, yeah.
0DI0009945	[SUCCEEDED] Heh. More than I could make in a week of shaking down these assholes anyways.
0DI0009947	[FAILED] You're shitting me. You got a real offer, or are you just going to waste my time?
0DI0009948	Then what the hell do you want? Don't try anything, I mean it!
0DI0009949	It's payback time, that's what! They've got no right to screw me over, and I'm tired of it!
0DI0009950	You too? Think I'm just a little girl? I'll show you!
0DI0009951	Dammit, I can take care of this by myself! That bitch is going to pay for all these years of bossing me around.
0DI0009952	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, but this better not be a trick!
0DI0009953	[FAILED] I'm not stupid little girl anymore, you can't talk me out of this!
0DI0009954	Wh-What are you talking about? Andy wants to help me leave this hole... doesn't he?
0DI0009955	She's guarding it, I know she is!
0DI0009956	She's locked the bedroom door - like that's going to stop me. I was... I've got a gun, I'm going to make her give it to me!
0DI0009959	... That- that- that son of a bitch! I'll take the money and I'll kill him too!
0DI0009960	[SUCCEEDED] I... I don't know what I want. But I hate this place, and I hate these people.
0DI0009961	It all used to be so simple. Why did they change? Why can't they see my pain?
0DI0009964	[FAILED] The money, yes! It's mine, and nobody can stop me from getting it!
0DI0009965	Do they? Look at my Mother, all she cares for is a patch of bare dirt where nothing green will ever grow to feed us.
0DI0009966	My Father? A trading business that he'll never own, risking his neck every day against Wastelanders and cut-throat "merchants."
0DI0009967	And I'm supposed to be part of those dreams? What about my dreams, stranger? What about me?
0DI0009968	Yeah, okay... I'll shoot the lock off the door and... and then.... Argh, dammit!
0DI0009969	... I can't do it, I can't. She deserves it, and worse, but I can't hurt my own mother!
0DI0009970	Oh, you think I won't do it? I'll show you!
0DI0009971	Fine. Take it. But what the hell am I supposed to do now?
0DI0009972	Oh, you think I won't do it? You think I'm not right in wanting back my life!? I'll show you!
0DI0009973	Wait right there. You told my men that Alice's mother was waiting for me outside, didn't you?
0DI0009974	Wait right there. I don't recall seeing your pretty face before - what do you want?
0DI0009975	Nobody threatens me and walks away alive!
0DI0009976	[SUCCEEDED] Hmmm... I've got my eye on you. Get the fuck off my turf.
0DI0009977	[FAILED] Please, I've seen kids who were better liars than you. Tell the truth now - what are you after?
0DI0009978	You think I give a shit? Has it crossed your mind that Alice is all the way in this with me?
0DI0009979	Maybe because I'm so good-looking.
0DI0009980	Maybe because her mother's trying to break her back planting crops that die from rads as soon as they're in the ground.
0DI0009981	Or maybe she's just a dupe. Why do you even care? She's happy making her own way in the world.
0DI0009982	Oh boy, you've just made your last mistake.
0DI0009983	Leaving so soon? And I thought we'd have time for a little chat.
0DI0009984	And... you think that's worth her happiness? Go on and tell her, then. Watch what happens when you crush her dreams.
0DI0009985	Family's just what the world throws on our shoulders without our say or opinion.
0DI0009986	You think Alice cares about her family? Tell her, then. Family's what drove her to me in the first place.
0DI0009987	It's not polite to leave in the middle of a conversation, but I won't try to teach you manners. This time.
0DI0009988	And how exactly would you do that?
0DI0009989	Yeah, sure.
0DI0009990	I'm glad we understand each other. Alice's at her home, getting our means out of this shit-hole. Make sure things go smoothly.
0DI0009991	That's right, and good riddance.
0DI0009993	'Cause that's the law of the land. You never know when someone's going to stab you in the back... and I like mine upright.
0DI0009994	Maybe one day, stranger, when you've seen all I've seen, done all I've done, you'll sooner trust a Radscorpion than a new face in The Wasteland.
0DI0009995	And I only asked first... I'll try one last time before I find out the hard way. Where you come from, and where you going?
0DI0009996	All right... keep walking.
0DI0009997	I'll see you again, stranger.
0DI0009998	So long, warrior.
0DI0009999	You ain't too smart, are you? Okay, let's dance.
0DI0010000	[FAILED] I sure am, stranger. But there ain't anything about you that makes me want to go into details.
0DI0010001	[SUCCEEDED] You've got a sharp eye on you. I take it you like guns, huh? Question is, can you handle more than just a weapon...
0DI0010002	Sure thing. What's on your noggin?
0DI0010003	What's eating you?
0DI0010004	We're independent folks here. Merchants, gamblers, NCR whores, all of them trade with us and we offer protection against critters and the Fiends.
0DI0010005	That's a long one, stranger. Let's just say I got tired of killing in The Wasteland and now I've found a better home for my old butt.
0DI0010006	Alice... Oh yeah. I've seen her 'round here much too often as of late. I reckon she's been hanging out with Andy and his crew.
0DI0010007	You heard me. We don't like those stiff-back, clean-hand, little pussies. New Vegas belongs to the people.
0DI0010008	The NCR's just a corrupt and bloated monster, no better than any other Wasteland crawler. We make this land wealthy, and we ain't giving it up.
0DI0010010	They're a bunch of lunatics, so pumped full of chems that they don't give a damn about life anymore. Fiends rape, kill and maim for the hell of it.
0DI0010011	Vault 3's Fiend territory. Those shit-heads attack Westside all the time, even making it to the rest of Outer Vegas when they crawl under the sewers.
0DI0010013	Bad weeds don't die easy. Still, things will be safer now that you've taught a lesson to those crazies.
0DI0010014	Try "The Gray." Beats me why people go into that forsaken thing. At least with huts and sewers you know they ain't crumbling on top of your head.
0DI0010015	Outer Vegas ain't exactly a safe place. Despite our numbers, The Wasteland creeps through every nook and cranny.
0DI0010016	I make sure any dangers to the people of North Vegas stay outside our barriers, stranger. Day and night, I stand watch.
0DI0010018	I know she's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
0DI0010020	Folks call this East Vegas, but I don't care much for names.
0DI0010021	The east side gets lots of merchant and gambler traffic. We're safer here than in North Vegas or Westside, though we've got to put up with the NCR.
0DI0010023	Don't get me started, stranger. We don't take kindly to either of them. We've fought hard for our home, and we're here to stay.
0DI0010024	The Legion knows nothing of working the land. Those folks would rather pillage, burn and steal, like mad beasts. That ain't honest living.
0DI0010025	The NCR's no better. They won't burn your home and rape your daughter, sure, but they'll steal your wealth all the same... when you ain't looking.
0DI0010028	He did, huh? All right, what do you want?
0DI0010029	He should really mind his own business. Crandon's good to keep scum in check, but he ain't exactly subtle.
0DI0010030	If you're good at snooping around, then I could use you. I need to find out what my daughter's up to.
0DI0010031	She's been frequenting the square in North Vegas, probably hanging out with street scum. I want to know more about her new "friends."
0DI0010032	Whatever you say, stranger. Go snoop somewhere else and get the fuck out of my house, right now!
0DI0010033	Are you deaf? I don't give a damn about what you want. Just get out of here.
0DI0010034	Get lost!
0DI0010036	You think I'm going to be easy, huh? Come get some, asshole!
0DI0010038	All right, we've got a deal then. I'll make sure to compensate you for your time, if you find anything useful.
0DI0010039	This ain't "babysitting," stranger. I'm telling you, these people are nasty and Alice is in danger.
0DI0010040	Oh yeah? What for?
0DI0010041	Maybe they don't wanna talk to you. Maybe they ain't here anymore. Maybe you ask too many questions, stranger.
0DI0010042	This is our turf. Don't even try to snoop around or I'll fucking kill your right here, right now.
0DI0010044	So what? I don't give a shit about what you like. Go cry to your mama.
0DI0010048	What? You've got to be kidding me... Fuck, why do I always gotta fix someone else's crap around here?
0DI0010049	I'm ready for you... Hey, guys, need a hand here!
0DI0010050	I mean you've first got to know yourself before you can truly know the gun.
0DI0010051	So, let's see it, stranger. Do you know yourself?
0DI0010053	[SUCCEEDED] We see eye to eye, we speak warrior to warrior... And I thought myself too old to find an equal, Ha!
0DI0010054	Listen, warrior. There're two kinds of folks. You load your gun like an ordinary man, or you load it like a devil.
0DI0010055	We ain't ordinary, are we? See, I pack good brass up with slow-burning powder, then cap it with a heavy semiwadcutter bullet.
0DI0010056	That's how you make .44 ammo that'll put the fear of the heavens on any waster that dare cross your path.
0DI0010057	[FAILED] You don't get it yet, stranger. I'm not surprised, though. It takes a special type. Come back when you've got what it takes.
0DI0010058	Alpha Squad reporting in. Thanks for the support back there. We've been assigned to ensure you make it to the Legate. How can we be of assistance?
0DI0010059	If you want. It's not really my thing. What do you want to know?
0DI0010060	Give me my rifle and a clear line of sight and I'll start picking them off before they've even seen me.
0DI0010061	Didn't have much hand-to-hand training, so our chances are better if you keep the enemy out of my face.
0DI0010062	I'm trained as a spotter, too. If you're looking through a scope, I can find your targets for you.
0DI0010064	Don't ever say that name again.
0DI0010065	He was a good spotter.
0DI0010066	Yeah. We were.
0DI0010068	When Carla went missing he was the first person I told.
0DI0010069	He tried to hide it, but I could tell right away. He was glad.
0DI0010071	Carla's dead. That's all you need to know.
0DI0010072	I met Carla while I was at the Strip on leave. She said I looked lost.
0DI0010073	She talked a lot. Suited me fine - I never know what to say. And listening to her, it could... make you forget.
0DI0010074	She stuck out, pretty much everywhere we went. Like she was from a different time. A better time. I never met anyone like her.
0DI0010075	No. I wanted to. I just couldn't.
0DI0010076	Yeah. I don't know much. Just rumors.
0DI0010077	All I know is he's supposed to be in charge of the Strip. And he's been able to stop the NCR from taking it over.
0DI0010078	Wish he'd give it up, so the NCR could focus on securing the border.
0DI0010080	No. It doesn't.
0DI0010081	It's NCR land, for the most part. We tamed it, now we're settling it.
0DI0010082	Lot of people complain about it, but they forget what it was like before we showed up.
0DI0010083	It's a lot of territory to secure. Too much, even for a big army like the NCR's.
0DI0010084	Coming east was about securing the land, so people could live without fear.
0DI0010085	It's not always that simple. But I think the cause is still right.
0DI0010086	And God help us if they lose.
0DI0010087	Yeah. Lots of thoughts. All about the best ways to kill them.
0DI0010088	They got what they had coming. Glad we were the ones to deliver it.
0DI0010089	Dark in here. If you want to use a scope, I can spot for you. Keep you on target.
0DI0010090	It's possible, but I've yet to see any hard evidence or hear of any cases where humans were negatively affected.
0DI0010091	Its negative effects are more pronounced on Nightkin.
0DI0010092	Because Marcus asked me to and because it's a reason for me to get up in the morning. I'd like to get one more grand accomplishment done.
0DI0010093	I'm not convinced that the Nightstalker mutation is a natural one, and I need someone to investigate their lair for proof.
0DI0010094	Some of the Super Mutants have looked around as well, but they've come back empty-handed. Perhaps a pair of fresh eyes will have better luck.
0DI0010097	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've been a mean son of a bitch the past couple years.
0DI0010098	It won't be easy, but I'll try going sober. Maybe then my family will want me back.
0DI0010099	Thank you for doing what you can. I won't let this go to waste.
0DI0010100	[FAILED] They're my blood, man. You don't just walk away from your blood!
0DI0010101	[FAILED] They're my blood, lady. You don't just walk away from your blood!
0DI0010102	What?! Why won't you tell me?
0DI0010103	Did my wife put you up to this?! What lies did she tell you?
0DI0010104	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I don't have much left at this point. Please, just tell me where they are.
0DI0010105	Dammit, I'll find them eventually! Mark my words!
0DI0010107	What am I supposed to do? I've got no money left, and now my family has abandoned me.
0DI0010108	[FAILED] Well look who is all high and mighty! You're no better than me when it boils down, bub.
0DI0010109	Crap, those goody-goodies kicked me out of there once already. No way I'm getting in.
0DI0010110	Even if I could get in, rehab is for chumps. Well, thanks for doing what you could.
0DI0010111	Guess I'll get a fresh start and keep an eye out in case they leave the Fort.
0DI0010112	[SUCCEEDED] You're right. I've got nothing left...
0DI0010113	I'll never see my kids grow up, but they're better off without me.
0DI0010114	[FAILED] You think you're better than me? You're just like those goody-goody Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0010115	Ha. I'm not saying. It's part of my mystique, after all.
0DI0010116	I'm still not saying.
0DI0010117	Well, ain't like I've got places to be.
0DI0010118	Sure do. Had a wife for awhile - tribal girl, really pretty eyes - but she's been gone a long time now.
0DI0010119	I'll be fine... eventually.
0DI0010120	There won't be a next time. I hope.
0DI0010121	I... may have overheard some things at Gomorrah that I passed on to the NCR. That's all! Honest.
0DI0010123	Oh. Um... okay.
0DI0010124	What? I only talk to Captain Curtis over at McCarran. I would never work with slavers. Honest.
0DI0010125	No! Well, not really. I mean, I'm not listening through doors or sneaking around or anything. People talk out loud, and I just pay attention.
0DI0010126	The NCR likes to keep tabs on the activities of the families, and they pay me good caps to hang around the casinos and keep my ears open.
0DI0010127	It isn't normally. The NCR wanted me to just gamble and listen, nothing else.
0DI0010129	I do odd jobs here and there, usually helping Sarah keep the Vault tidy. I came to New Vegas to be a professional gambler.
0DI0010130	Too bad for me that the "professional" part isn't working out so good. But, I love gambling, so I'm here to stay on the Strip until they kick me out.
0DI0010131	My name's Frank Weathers. I'm a farmer, got a few hundred acres near Junktown. Well, I was a farmer. I guess I'm not much of anything now.
0DI0010132	They're cannibals, slavers, and worse.
0DI0010133	I hear rumors they're poised to overrun the entire Colorado River Valley, and even the Army won't be enough to stop them.
0DI0010134	One of the officers here, or at Camp McCarran, might be able to tell you more.
0DI0010135	Why does anybody? I thought I'd strike it rich at the tables, make my fortune and never have to plow those damn fields again.
0DI0010136	I just wanted to provide for my family - and now they're gone. All gone. God forgive me....
0DI0010137	Yes? Have you found them?
0DI0010138	We were crossing the Mojave, not far from Searchlight, when a band of Caesar's Legion slavers came out of nowhere. They took my family.
0DI0010139	Caesar's Legion attacked us near Searchlight. The rangers say they probably took my family to Cottonwood Cove.
0DI0010140	If you want me to stick around, that ends now. I don't care what the reasons are, I will not help the Legion. Ever. Got it?
0DI0010141	Bullshit. You're a goddamned coward, trying to pick the winning side.
0DI0010142	We will never work together again.
0DI0010143	Then this is over. Next time I see you, it'll be through my scope.
0DI0010144	Any Legion with you and I'm pulling the trigger.
0DI0010145	I should never have trusted you.
0DI0010146	All right. But we'd better not have to have this talk again.
0DI0010147	Then we're finished here.
0DI0010148	I should never have worked with you in the first place.
0DI0010149	You're right. You won't.
0DI0010150	Good thing I'm still alive, then.
0DI0010246	What happened?
0DI0010314	Thumbs down, you son of a bitch.
0DI0010315	Wish there was more of them. I wasn't done yet.
0DI0010316	Heh. Yeah. That was some kind of stunt we pulled.
0DI0010317	Whatever happens from here on out, we killed that prick in the middle of his fortress.
0DI0010318	Ought to give the rest of them something to think about.
0DI0010319	Intel we had back in the NCR said they had a whole succession lined up. They'll replace him as soon as word gets out.
0DI0010320	The other thing I heard is that he wasn't really commanding the army anymore. Guess we made sure of that.
0DI0010321	Yeah, it does. But we got these bastards pretty good today.
0DI0010322	Goddamn it. We could've gotten them out.
0DI0010323	Mercy killing is a last resort. Glad you recognized we had options.
0DI0010324	To hell with mercy killing. We're getting those guys out of there.
0DI0010326	Good luck to ya.
0DI0010327	I do decent enough. The NCR patrols usually stop by for a quick bite, and travelers like yourself pass by a couple times a week.
0DI0010328	The caravans or NCR patrols usually don't stop, but we usually get people like yourself wandering on by a few times a week.
0DI0010331	This is your last warning. You will relinquish your weapons and banned items, or prepare to face the consequences.
0DI0010332	This fool challenges the Legion, brothers! Let us teach him some manners!
0DI0010333	Very well. Lucullus, escort this fool back to Cottonwood Cove.
0DI0010334	Caesar strictly forbids the use of chems and alcohol. By his order, all visitors must also relinquish their arms upon entry.
0DI0010335	If you come in peace, then there is no reason to not disarm. You will not be harmed unless Caesar wills it.
0DI0010336	Alcohol and all chems, including stims and other addictive items.
0DI0010337	[SUCCEEDED] I know not why Caesar would wish to speak with such a physically inferior whelp, but I will allow this one exception.
0DI0010338	You may bear Caesar's mark, but do not attempt to share any of your medicine with anyone in The Fort.
0DI0010339	[FAILED] Thus is Caesar's will. Do not test my patience.
0DI0010340	Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about your skills. You've killed more NCR than most recruits.
0DI0010341	Good, good! Your growing number of NCR kills rivals most legionaries.
0DI0010342	Keep up the good work!
0DI0010343	Ha! Perhaps I was wrong about your skills, Profligate. Your kill count rivals some of our best warriors!
0DI0010344	How many?
0DI0010345	As much as the Profligates' cowardice will allow. They haven't found the balls to attack us here, but we catch them out on patrols.
0DI0010346	With two contubernia at my command, I've killed and captured four times my numbers.
0DI0010347	It is the armor of a Centurion. You have the rare honor of beholding it unspattered by the blood of my inferiors.
0DI0010348	The things the Profligates will build, to spy on us like cowards with little machines!
0DI0010349	Find that officer and give him this old map of our patrol routes. The Profligates will try to set up ambushes... and we'll be waiting for them.
0DI0010351	Of course I am, you fool. I am a Centurion!
0DI0010352	When Vulpes Inculta drove the NCR from Searchlight by clever means, Caesar himself ordered me to set up this camp and harass the Profligates!
0DI0010353	It's a modest presence, a single finger of the Legion reaching across the river's narrows. But with me here, it has an iron knuckle.
0DI0010354	Why would it bother me to enslave these wretches? They have no purpose, no creed, no honor.
0DI0010355	They live in pitiful squalor, undisciplined, intemperate. To enslave them is to save them - to give them purpose, and virtue.
0DI0010356	Honestas, Industria, Prudentia - even the virtues of slaves are beyond the Dissolute on this side of the river.
0DI0010357	It's a weak bunch, to be honest. I'd rather have extra currency to buy supplies or better captures off traders.
0DI0010358	There's a boy, too old to be trained as a Legionary. Normally they have to die, but he's too frail to make trouble.
0DI0010359	The old woman's dried up, but she could keep house or do gardening - if she can learn to keep her mouth shut.
0DI0010360	The girl's the only one of real value, young enough to breed, not hideous to look at. What's your offer for the lot?
0DI0010361	Let me know if you change your mind.
0DI0010362	Seems I'm fortunate to get that much for them, given the circumstances!
0DI0010363	Here, this is the key to their collars. You'll want to take those off before you go far, trust me.
0DI0010365	It was easy. The Colorado is narrow here, and when the Profligates abandoned Searchlight, there was no one to guard the crossing.
0DI0010366	It's just a small outpost, but we keep busy. Raiding parties go out, new captures come in.
0DI0010367	I have Blackfoot in me, the first tribe that Caesar ever led in battle - the tribe that formed the Legion.
0DI0010368	If not for him, we'd still be living in tents or shacks, scavenging for food like animals. If we were alive at all.
0DI0010370	The best Cursor in the Legion. You'll reach Fortification Hill without incident, that's for sure.
0DI0010371	Wait until you see the encampment, how massive it is. And a personal audience with mighty Caesar - glorious!
0DI0010372	Captures lose any claim to the names they called themselves when they let themselves be taken.
0DI0010373	If they're fortunate enough to become slaves, a new name will be given to them - one they can be proud of.
0DI0010377	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. You may proceed.
0DI0010378	However, be warned. Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross.
0DI0010379	[FAILED] Tread lightly, fool. You are entering Caesar's land.
0DI0010380	Aggressive acts against us will earn you a place on a cross. Turn back now, or pay the consequences.
0DI0010381	You wear the Mark of Caesar?! You must be who Cursor Lucullus is waiting for.
0DI0010382	You may continue, but be warned. Mark or no, we will not tolerate aggressive action by visitors in the camp.
0DI0010383	To arms, brothers!
0DI0010384	Very well. You may proceed.
0DI0010386	Fool. Your deeds are known well among us.
0DI0010387	To arms, my brothers!
0DI0010389	All who are not Legion are "Dissolute." They live in squalor, unrestrained by morality, lacking moderation, temper, and self-control.
0DI0010390	Their very existence is a blight on the common good. Even worse are the Profligates, the subtype of Dissolute one finds this side of the river.
0DI0010391	They hold themselves to be civilized, when in fact they are corrupt and self-interested. The truth will be made clear to them soon enough.
0DI0010392	You'd know better than I would. But you must be remarkable, for Caesar to take such an interest.
0DI0010393	Vale, as you wish. My orders are to wait here until you're ready to make the trip.
0DI0010394	Women are physically and intellectually inferior to men. Their role is to bear children and ensure the survival of our species.
0DI0010395	Not to say that all women are equally incapable. I trust Caesar will find a worthy use for you.
0DI0010397	Th-thank you! I don't know that we'll ever be able to repay you, but we'll do our best one day once I've found a place to settle.
0DI0010398	Thank you! Thank you so much!
0DI0010399	[SUCCEEDED] Finally! Let's get out of here!
0DI0010400	[FAILED] I don't believe you. This key has to have been stolen.
0DI0010401	None of the guards have said we're free to go. As soon as we step out of here, we're just going to get caught again, or worse.
0DI0010402	One of these days we'll be free.
0DI0010403	My family was ambushed by a pack of Legion raiders near Searchlight and Frank ran off, the gutless coward!
0DI0010404	I have no idea where he is, but at least we're free from his abuse.
0DI0010406	Momma...
0DI0010407	Accident or not, you're to blame!
0DI0010408	Wasting my time is more like it.
0DI0010410	If they're more powerful than the Profligates' landmines, by all means show me how.
0DI0010411	Here, this is edible.
0DI0010415	Are we done, then?
0DI0010416	Tin cans, gunpowder, scrap metal, and duct tape? We won't have any trouble finding those ingredients!
0DI0010417	That would be worth knowing, especially if we can then rearm and reuse them.
0DI0010418	[SUCCEEDED] The light is a button that can interrupt detonation? We were too busy throwing ourselves to the ground to figure that out.
0DI0010419	To rearm the mine, we'd just press the button again - simple. The Profligates will regret that we learned this.
0DI0010420	[FAILED] Go find a minefield and practice that "trick" several times, then. Idiot.
0DI0010421	If you have nothing to teach, don't make the offer.
0DI0010422	What of it?
0DI0010423	So I'm supposed to just start giving in to the demands of random strangers that come in here, huh? I don't think so.
0DI0010424	You want something from me, you're gonna have to earn it. And it just so happens that I've got a few things I need taken care of. So what do you say?
0DI0010425	I'd love to help you, but it seems I can't even prevent my own friends from getting killed. I'm sorry as can be, but I can't help you.
0DI0010426	Roger that. I'll have snipers move to position.
0DI0010427	Confirmed. We'll stay with you and help you break through the line.
0DI0010428	You are in charge of this operation. That sounds like a suicide mission, but our order are to take commands from you.
0DI0010429	Unit, let's move out!
0DI0010430	We aren't assigned for a suicide mission. Give us something we can do, and we'll do it. However I am not sending my unit on a suicide run.
0DI0010431	Confirmed, we'll fall back. Good luck.
0DI0010432	Yeah, I guess you're right. Here.
0DI0010433	You give Lupa a worthy death in the arena, and her brain is yours. Don't let your guard down just because she's old, though.
0DI0010434	Oh, and standard arena rules still apply. You don't get to wear armor and you get only a machete for a weapon.
0DI0010435	Not too common but you still see 'em around.
0DI0010436	All right. You've been a good dog, Lupa. Die well, girl.
0DI0010437	Take all the time you need, otherwise Lupa will tear your throat out.
0DI0010438	Damnit! I can't believe the Legion actually got someone past our security. Good job catching him.
0DI0010439	I'll have a security team sweep the area to see if the Legion has any more surprises for us.
0DI0010440	I'm also canceling the President's speech. We'll have a security team get him out of here right away. But let's not relax until he's safe.
0DI0010441	Good timing. Looks like his Vertibird is arriving early. Here it comes now.
0DI0010442	I hope you're up for this, because we won't get a second chance.
0DI0010443	Well I have a bomb here that can be put on the vertibird that will detonate at a certain altitude, but it's a little unstable and dangerous.
0DI0010444	Rise and shine. You have a big day ahead of you.
0DI0010445	So, do you have a plan for how you're going to kill Kimball?
0DI0010446	Thanks. We haven't been paired together long, but he's a smart dog.
0DI0010447	Nope. Haven't noticed anything strange at all. Neither has my friend here, and he has a good nose for these things.
0DI0010448	Not since the last time you asked, no.
0DI0010452	Then stay off the line and get back to work!
0DI0010453	Only engineers and authorized personnel are allowed upstairs. Please step away.
0DI0010454	I warned you. Intruder!
0DI0010455	Move it, you curs!
0DI0010456	There's still more killing to be done!
0DI0010458	I will personally gut the first man to slow down!
0DI0010459	Leave none alive!
0DI0010460	My men await in the tunnel below. I am to divide them between the dam top and the tunnels that lead to the western power plant.
0DI0010461	The fighting in the power plant is the fiercest, as expected. But the dogs have been caught off guard, and their positions can expect no support.
0DI0010462	However, the pipes below have been sealed, cutting off our men until the dam top can be secured.
0DI0010463	I've been diverting half of my men to the tower next to this one. It's a bit of a swim, but the enemy hasn't sealed those pipes yet.
0DI0010464	Some of the other centuriae are more stubborn in following their orders exactly, though, and wait in the pipes below.
0DI0010465	If you should make it down there, unsealing the pipes again will allow us to spill over the enemy like a tide of blood.
0DI0010466	More than a few, if I have my way.
0DI0010467	[SUCCEEDED] Your words have merit... Very well. I shall tell my men to concentrate their efforts here.
0DI0010468	[FAILED] I have my orders, and they explicitly state that I am to divide my men.
0DI0010469	[SUCCEEDED] Agreed. If we take the power plant, this battle is over. I'll have my men focus their efforts there. May the Son of Mars go with you.
0DI0010470	[FAILED] Forgive my appraisal of your prowess, but all the same I'd rather send some of my men with you to help secure the dam top.
0DI0010471	This whole area used to be a Great Khan encampment before they relocated to Red Rock Canyon. We just haven't had the manpower to clean it all up yet.
0DI0010472	Thanks. Your concern is touching.
0DI0010473	That's very generous of you. I appreciate it.
0DI0010474	Here, take this. I hope you put it to good use.
0DI0010475	If a reward is all you're concerned with, here. Enjoy it.
0DI0010476	Sure, but make them quick.
0DI0010477	Ah. I should have expected as much. There's still a lot of bad blood between the Khans and the NCR, ever since the incident here.
0DI0010478	Really? Well, this canyon used to be a Great Khan stronghold, I suppose that explains why he was able to evade us so easily.
0DI0010479	The incident, yes. It was a tragic mistake, but the NCR has done everything it can to make amends since then.
0DI0010480	About three years ago, this canyon was the main encampment for the Great Khans. NCR's 1st Recon tracked them here after a raid and made an attack.
0DI0010481	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
0DI0010482	We provided medical aid to the wounded - all the wounded - and permitted the Khans to resettle at Red Rock Canyon.
0DI0010483	I don't know how you did it, but thank you.
0DI0010484	I'm glad it's taken care of, but still, I wish it could have been resolved without violence. There's too much bad blood there already.
0DI0010485	Sure. What do you need?
0DI0010486	About three years ago, NCR's 1st Recon launched an attack on the Khan encampment here.
0DI0010487	There was a communication mix-up that resulted in some noncombatants being killed. I guess he was still bitter about it.
0DI0010488	It was a tragic mistake, but we've done all we can to make amends.
0DI0010489	[SUCCEEDED] As you wish.
0DI0010490	[FAILED] I don't think so. If you work for the NCR, you're no better than they are. Flails of God!
0DI0010492	Well, still. Thanks again.
0DI0010493	Oh! Oh, yeah, sure, I think I can spare a little. Here. And thanks again.
0DI0010494	Oh! Right, of course, I can give you a few spare meds and a few caps. Here.
0DI0010495	No problem, here you go. I'm kind of amazed you found them at all. Thanks again for everything.
0DI0010496	Really? Wow. Well, you did pay for them, so here you go. Thanks again for everything.
0DI0010497	Alright. What do you want to know?
0DI0010498	If you can find a way to cut off access to the sulfur in the caves below the vault, I've got some caps waiting for you.
0DI0010502	There are some fire geckos in the lower levels of the Vault. We need to get them gone so we can get to the sulfur.
0DI0010503	You go clear them out for us, and there'll be some caps for you.
0DI0010504	I want you to head to Red Rock Canyon, north of here. Find Papa Khan and ask him if he'd allow the Powder gangers to join up.
0DI0010513	Profligate troops, Powder Gangers, men of the Legion such as myself - the people here didn't care. It was a town of whores.
0DI0010514	For a pittance, the town agreed to lead those it had sheltered into a trap. Only when I sprang it did they realize they were caught inside it, too.
0DI0010520	Yes, they did. As will all the rest of them, in due time.
0DI0010539	Him? When his ticket came up, they burned him alive on a pile of tires.
0DI0010540	We get in position and next thing we know, we're surrounded by those fucking Legion freaks.
0DI0010541	They dragged us and everybody else into the center of town. And that asshole with a dog on his head, he starts talking about how we're bad people!
0DI0010542	He said we needed to be punished for what we did, not all of us, but some of us. And then he gives everyone a fucking lottery ticket...
0DI0010544	What do you think? He started drawing tickets, and that's how people got punished.
0DI0010545	First up was the "lucky losers." They got decapitated - guess that's "lucky" because it's pretty quick.
0DI0010546	Then came the crucifixions. Goddamn but those went on and on and on...
0DI0010547	Third-place runners-up got enslaved. I got the fuck beat out of my legs, and the winner they let go free.
0DI0010548	Yeah, a bunch of those Legion fucks dragged them off right away. They was headed East, if you're feeling heroic.
0DI0010549	Don't act like you'd be doing me a favor. I don't give a fuck.
0DI0010550	That's how I figure it. Got problems of my own to handle.
0DI0010551	Then you're a fucking dream come true, ain't ya? How much you gonna give me?
0DI0010552	Big fucking deal. Hand it over.
0DI0010553	Good enough. Hand it over.
0DI0010554	Three doses? That's almost enough for a party.
0DI0010555	Five doses? Nice. A fella could put himself out of his misery with five doses.
0DI0010556	Bullshit. You're holding, you just want it all for yourself!
0DI0010557	Powder Ganger? What? I mean, yeah, used to be, sure!
0DI0010558	But not no more! Powder Gang is small-time, man! I'm a winner! I won the motherfucking lottery!
0DI0010559	Doctor's Bags would be a huge help too.
0DI0010560	I think that should just about cover us. I really don't know how to thank you, bringing me these supplies saved a lot of people.
0DI0010561	If I was the assassin, I'd be up on that ridge. Or if I didn't care about escaping, maybe that near tower, or the landing pad behind us.
0DI0010562	You say so.
0DI0010563	You'll be glad you did this. I'm gonna put a hole through Caesar's head.
0DI0010564	Great Khan, looks like. Guess he fought at Bitter Springs. Or saw it happen.
0DI0010565	Thanks. Anything else?
0DI0010566	What? There's no way... we're miles from the Colorado. They...they aren't even waiting for the Dam to fall. They're already inside the borders...
0DI0010567	...we'll never stop them, not at this rate. We're doomed. Thanks for bringing the word - even if the news is bad, I'll let the men know.
0DI0010568	Legion!
0DI0010569	First NCR Recon. It's a sniper battalion. Sees a lot of action.
0DI0010570	They moved us around a lot. I was stationed at Camp Golf for a while. Last I heard they were at Camp McCarran.
0DI0010571	They pick you out if you do well at the firing range. Pays a little better, so I said okay.
0DI0010572	"The last thing you never see."
0DI0010573	Pretty accurate, and so were we.
0DI0010574	Yeah. You can tell by the patch. Bear skull with crossed rifles behind it. Slogan underneath.
0DI0010575	Was an airport before the war. Command liked it because it was already fortified and it let them keep an eye on the Strip.
0DI0010576	They've got an old monorail that still runs between them. Used mostly for supplies and deployment. But if you get leave you're allowed to go gamble.
0DI0010577	Was General Oliver's post, but I heard he's been up at the Dam a lot lately. Guessing Colonel Hsu is running it.
0DI0010578	It was on the front line for a while. Only resort in New Vegas no one wanted to get sent to.
0DI0010579	Doesn't have that kind of importance anymore, though. They pulled most of the troops out of there after we took the Hoover Dam.
0DI0010580	Didn't know him. He's a signature on my discharge papers.
0DI0010581	Wasn't real popular, though. Even overheard my C.O. complain about him once.
0DI0010582	"General Wait-and-see," he called him.
0DI0010583	Yeah. He introduced himself to me once. I shook his hand. Doubt he'd remember me now, though.
0DI0010584	When he looked at you, you could see he understood. After some of the things we'd seen, that meant something.
0DI0010585	What I heard, he'd be a general right now if Oliver didn't know the president.
0DI0010586	The big one. The one the NCR is trying to hold onto, that the Legion's pushing for. Whole war depends on holding it.
0DI0010587	Okay. But let's make sure and come back here. I'd love to wipe this place off the map.
0DI0010588	I don't think I'd hold it against you.
0DI0010589	Fine. But if you make any new friends in there, all bets are off.
0DI0010590	You're making a mistake. I want to be a part of this.
0DI0010591	You ever change your mind, I'll be right there with you.
0DI0010592	That's what the scope's for.
0DI0010593	Damn right. You and I, we're just a couple of problem solvers.
0DI0010594	If you're sure. There's a lot of high ground around the town. We could do a lot of damage.
0DI0010595	Just saying.
0DI0010596	Better be a good reason. I didn't join up with you to go on nature walks.
0DI0010598	Oh, it was great. I wouldn't trade it.
0DI0010599	Something about that lifestyle, the discipline. Seeing new places, making people safe. What's not to like?
0DI0010600	Ah, well... I just felt like it was time, you know? Wanted to have a home.
0DI0010601	Plus I was up at Camp Golf when Bitter Springs went down. I faked like I was sick to get out of going, because I knew some of the people there.
0DI0010602	But when everybody came back nobody would tell me what happened. And people would call us murderers sometimes when we showed up to secure towns.
0DI0010603	I still don't know exactly. Just that a lot of people died who didn't want to be part of the fighting at all.
0DI0010604	I don't blame anybody for it. There's so much chaos when you're fighting, you're lucky not to shoot your own guys.
0DI0010605	But it did take something out of it for me. Just wasn't the same. So when it came time to re-enlist, I just took my papers and walked.
0DI0010607	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you at the docks. He'll take you to Caesar.
0DI0010608	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not like this!
0DI0010609	[FAILED] I appreciate you trying, but you'll have to find another way to get us out of here.
0DI0010610	You may find one in the workshop. You're a friend to the tribe, so I trust it will not find it's way into the wrong hands.
0DI0010611	They are too rare and valuable to simply give away, nor have you proven yourself a friend.
0DI0010612	[SUCCEEDED] All right, two it is. They'll still be more than enough to take you down, I think.
0DI0010613	[FAILED] No deal. You and four of my dogs. Not two, not three - four.
0DI0010614	And just about every one of them is occupied. Not all at the same time, usually - groups of Legionaries come and go all the time.
0DI0010615	This also only one camp of many. You might have noticed the other camps down by the river.
0DI0010616	They do say that! I guess you can be my friend.
0DI0010617	Um... can you help me?
0DI0010618	A bomb on the President's vertibird? Only a limited number of people had access to the vertibird.
0DI0010619	We have to get the President out of here now. I'll cancel the speech and have security search the area.
0DI0010620	We can't relax until we get the President out of here safely.
0DI0010621	What the hell? This must control some sort of bomb that he was going to use to kill the President.
0DI0010622	Nice work catching this. I'll have my Rangers go deal with this man right away.
0DI0010623	I've heard of you. I'm glad you're here to help us out. This is a delicate matter and we need all the help we can get from people we can trust.
0DI0010624	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time. Once we start we'll be on a strict timetable.
0DI0010625	So you're the one Mr. House sent. His Securitron here informed me of what's going on.
0DI0010626	Since Mr. House has helped me in the past, I'll let you help us during the President's visit. However, I will be keeping an eye on you.
0DI0010628	So you're the one Colonel Moore sent to help out with the President's visit. Well, I'm running security for the visit, which means I'm in charge.
0DI0010629	If anything goes down, you tell me first, you got that?
0DI0010631	Are you ready?
0DI0010632	Looks like that's his vertibird coming right now. It's show time, let's not mess this up.
0DI0010633	Now if you'll excuse me I've got some security procedures to oversee.
0DI0010634	For revenge! The NCR committed an atrocity here, an atrocity that they tried to bury and forget. I'm going to remind them.
0DI0010635	[SUCCEEDED] I know that. But what else can I do?
0DI0010636	[FAILED] Keep deluding yourself if you want. I've seen the NCR's true face.
0DI0010637	Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe three years is vengeance enough. Thank you for helping me see that.
0DI0010638	Here. This will unlock the supply caches we left in caves around these mountains. You might get some use out of them.
0DI0010639	You're right. A Khan's vengeance should be direct and bloody. No more skulking in caves - I'll remind the NCR why they feared us!
0DI0010640	Then you'll have to kill me. My vengeance will not be stayed.
0DI0010641	Why should I let you leave? You could lead the NCR right to me. I should kill you now.
0DI0010643	Our creatures come from the farthest reaches of the Wasteland. The Thorn takes care of them until the time to spill their blood comes.
0DI0010644	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of serving The Thorn.
0DI0010645	Think you have what it takes? Hmm, all right. Prove your worth and I'll reward your service.
0DI0010646	The Thorn needs newborn specimens that will one day grow to honor us with their blood.
0DI0010647	Bring me a dozen Giant Mantis' eggs. If you accomplish this, I might gift you with greater tasks in the future.
0DI0010649	You'll find egg-carrying Mantises in The Wasteland. But a wise hunter would search at a Mantis' breeding ground, like the nearby ruins of Vault 22.
0DI0010650	You've got yourself a deal.
0DI0010651	So long, stranger.
0DI0010653	We constantly replenish our stock to keep this holy ground soaked red. Only a few brave ones ever earn the honor of servicing The Thorn.
0DI0010655	You speak the truth, stranger, and The Thorn lives by the justice that honor and strength dispense. Here's a more fitting sum.
0DI0010656	Those are the risks of a hunter's life. I've delivered as promised, but perhaps I should better search for someone with greater resolve and honor?
0DI0010657	Bring me a dozen Radscorpion eggs. I'll see to it that you're rewarded fairly.
0DI0010658	Bring me a dozen Fire Gecko eggs. This great challenge will earn you a matching reward.
0DI0010659	The Thorn's calling its elite hunters to collect one of its deadliest creatures. Find Night Stalker eggs and your bravery will be greatly rewarded.
0DI0010660	I'm asking our top hunters to gather Cazador eggs. I'd be impressed by whoever returns with such a prize.
0DI0010661	This is it, hunter. I've decided to grant you the opportunity to earn the greatest honor The Thorn could ever expect.
0DI0010662	Deathclaws are our most precious and our most feared contenders. I want you to be the one to deliver the sacred eggs to me, personally.
0DI0010663	I thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
0DI0010664	Don't think your servile gesture earns my respect, stranger. But if that's how you want it, so it'll be.
0DI0010665	The eggs I seek are not easy to find, stranger. Your best chances are in the mountains north of Goodsprings, and west from Quarry Junction.
0DI0010670	You're proving your worth to The Thorn. I hope these extra caps are sufficient to demonstrate my fairness.
0DI0010672	Thank you, stranger. The Thorn thanks you.
0DI0010674	Fire Geckos are among The Wasteland's most dangerous creatures. Near the Ireteba Peaks lies a nest where you may find their eggs.
0DI0010675	Confident, I like that.
0DI0010679	You are a match to my elite, but don't congratulate yourself so profusely just yet. Still, your valor deserves recognition and I shall honor it.
0DI0010681	Night Stalkers are amongst the most fearsome beasts you'll ever face. They're also hard to find, but I know of a nest at a cave near Bittersprings.
0DI0010688	Do you have good news for The Thorn?
0DI0010692	That actually manages to surprise me, stranger. I'm starting to believe that there's something special about you.
0DI0010693	Cazadores are extremely deadly, but they are also reclusive. Try looking near the Red Rock's canyons.
0DI0010694	The crowd loves your bravery.
0DI0010697	Good work, stranger. The Thorn will nurture these eggs until their hatchlings are ready to bleed for us.
0DI0010698	Here's a compensation for your service. I trust that we're in agreement over it.
0DI0010703	Quarry Junction is overrun with Deathclaws, but you may stand a better chance at a nest near the Repconn Test Site.
0DI0010706	You've done enough to last many lifetimes, stranger. But... I'd like you to come see me, again.
0DI0010707	Thank you, my brave hunter.
0DI0010711	You know what I'd be real excited about? If you'd showed up and saved me before they smashed my legs.
0DI0010712	Now why don't you fuck off and let me sleep, hero? That'd be real exciting, too.
0DI0010713	Refugee camp? Is that what they're calling it? Good old NCR, they can whitewash anything.
0DI0010714	Let me tell you something, that refugee camp? It's built on the blood and tears of my people. Nobody likes to talk about it, but I remember.
0DI0010715	Come for me then. Flails of God!
0DI0010717	We were the Flails of God. The scourge of the Mojave, the best warriors and raiders in the Wasteland. Until the NCR tracked us back to Bitter Springs.
0DI0010718	The main force hit the canyon by surprise. While our warriors tried to hold them off, we sent our women, our children, our old through the Red Pass.
0DI0010719	NCR's First Recon Battalion was waiting for them on Coyote Tail Ridge. No Khan left alive, that was the order. My family....
0DI0010720	Ta-ta.
0DI0010721	I think we're clear.
0DI0010722	Thought my time had come. For a minute there everything made sense. I could feel the end coming. I was ready for it.
0DI0010723	Now... I'm back where I was.
0DI0010724	Guess I did. Guess I figured whatever we could handle, this time the Legion was going to send more.
0DI0010725	I should've died here a long time ago. When I spotted the legionaries today I thought I understood. Things were finally going to even out.
0DI0010726	But I'm still here and nothing's changed.
0DI0010727	I guess they brought us here. One less Legion raiding party running loose now. Never a bad thing, you can take my word for that.
0DI0010728	Still feels like I'm living on borrowed time. But I don't see any reason not to take a lot more of those sons of bitches with me.
0DI0010729	You got a point. There's still some things I can do before all this is over.
0DI0010730	I don't mean disrespect. It's a hell of a thing having someone with your ability looking out for me.
0DI0010731	But I've come to believe that there are things nobody can stop. I thought for sure that's what we'd finally come up against today.
0DI0010732	It would've made sense for things to end here. But now... I'm still waiting.
0DI0010733	<Sighs> Goddamn it. It's like I'm being toyed with.
0DI0010734	I don't know what I'm supposed to do about all this.
0DI0010735	If that's how it is, there's not a lot of comfort in knowing it.
0DI0010736	I never thought of it that way. Always expected something... more final. But maybe it is.
0DI0010737	With the Khans, the only difference between a soldier and a civilian is that the civilian is more likely to miss when he shoots at you.
0DI0010738	Maybe Bitter Springs just seemed different. Maybe it's the same as killing legionaries.
0DI0010739	They'd have died whether or not they were soldiers. Whether or not I was there. And my leaving the NCR hasn't stopped any wars or saved any lives.
0DI0010740	There's no controlling war. No sense regretting what you can't stop.
0DI0010741	We need to get to the camp before they do!
0DI0010742	More coming!
0DI0010743	Alice McLafferty runs the Crimson Caravan. You can find her over in the main office.
0DI0010744	I'm getting ready to run a caravan up towards Utah. There's a town called New Canaan which is supposed to be pretty prosperous.
0DI0010745	The Crimson Caravan doesn't have any branches out that way, so it'll be up to me get to things started.
0DI0010746	Yeah, he used to come around here a lot. Haven't seen him in a while, though. Why?
0DI0010747	He used to go on and on about water and the farms east of the Strip. He was talking to one of the farmers named Bascom, had some problem with NCR.
0DI0010748	Boring as hell, but it was his money and his time, so I let him talk about whatever.
0DI0010750	Fuck off. You already screwed me once, and it's not happening again.
0DI0010751	A hundred caps. No kissing, no rough stuff.
0DI0010752	Fifty caps, just like we agreed.
0DI0010753	We can go right over here, baby.
0DI0010754	Well now, that's unusual. Normally no one cares enough to ask. To be honest, I don't rightly know. My mama was from around these parts.
0DI0010755	I can remember her face, but not her name. More than I can remember of my daddy, I guess. We lived in Westside before the Omertas bought me.
0DI0010756	As bad as it can be some days in here, it's better than living in that dump.
0DI0010757	Suit yourself. The offer's always open if you feel like changing your mind.
0DI0010759	Hmm... I don't know. Doesn't that... mess you up?
0DI0010760	[SUCCEEDED] Well, if you know what you're doing... okay. You show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
0DI0010761	[FAILED] That's nice, honey, but no thanks.
0DI0010762	[SUCCEEDED] Well... no I guess not. Okay - you show me a good time, and I'll return the favor.
0DI0010763	[FAILED] Um... it's sweet of you to offer, but no thanks.
0DI0010764	Yeah, you're right. For you, and just you, fifty caps. Don't tell anyone.
0DI0010766	Yeah, you are different from my usual guys. Fine, fifty caps, but don't tell anyone.
0DI0010767	Too bad, baby. Come back when you have the caps. I'll still be here.
0DI0010768	Forget it, it's done.
0DI0010769	So, what else did you want?
0DI0010770	Ugh. I figured you were a bit slow, but I never thought - forget it, it's done.
0DI0010771	Fuck you. So what do you want now?
0DI0010772	Too bad, baby. You know where to find me.
0DI0010773	Tell the truth... I think this is exactly what I've been waiting for.
0DI0010774	Let's go up there first, huh?
0DI0010775	Something's wrong. Got a group coming our way. Looks like a Legion raiding party. It's big.
0DI0010776	It might be too big.
0DI0010777	Main force got spotted too soon. We heard shooting. Then Khans started coming through Canyon 37 in bunches.
0DI0010778	It was all wrong, though. Women, kids, elderly. Wounded started coming through, too.
0DI0010779	We radioed to confirm our orders but command didn't get what we were seeing. They told us to shoot till we were out of ammo. So that's what we did.
0DI0010780	Yeah, I guess not.
0DI0010781	Yeah, well. I'm not a soldier anymore. Those rules don't seem like much of an excuse now.
0DI0010782	Anyway... I don't know why we're here. Thought maybe it'd help me see things better.
0DI0010783	I'd like to stay here for the night. Think some things over.
0DI0010784	Maybe not. Maybe I wouldn't have either at one point. But that's why they train you. Break you down till you're automatic.
0DI0010785	With the Khans, any of them can be dangerous. There's a lot you can't see through a scope.
0DI0010786	Still. I often wonder the same thing.
0DI0010787	You can do what you want, but I'm not going anywhere.
0DI0010788	No. I only would've needed one bullet to do things right that day.
0DI0010789	All right. We won't stay for long.
0DI0010790	Fine, but I'd still like to when we get a chance.
0DI0010791	Easy target for grabbing slaves. Bunch of refugees, just a few soldiers defending it.
0DI0010792	I don't think they're here for us. Too bad. Would've made me feel good about myself.
0DI0010793	Ha! If only it was this easy all the time.
0DI0010794	I'm not. Always figured this was how it was gonna end for me. Just didn't know when.
0DI0010795	That day you showed up in Novac, I had a feeling I was supposed to go with you. That it was time to end all this.
0DI0010796	And now I know.
0DI0010797	Well, things aren't great here, but I've seen a lot worse. We've got the Fiends to the south of us, and that ain't good.
0DI0010798	The scorpions hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends.
0DI0010799	Probably the best thing we've got going on is the co-op, run by Mr. Ettienne. Gets some help from of the Followers of the Apocalypse, I think.
0DI0010800	Not so much lately. The NCR is giving them hell any time they poke their damned heads out. Bless those boys and gals for getting rid of that vermin.
0DI0010801	I feel pity for any man or woman that gets addicted to chems, but when they prey on decent folk... well, then it's time to put 'em down.
0DI0010802	Not much to tell. Typical gang of dumb bullies and angry nobodies. They're holed up a bit south of here, in the Monte Carlo Suites.
0DI0010803	They think they're tough, but any time they tangle with the Fiends, they get torn right up.
0DI0010804	Food from the people and for the people. Anyone can buy, but the profits are shared by the folks who make the produce.
0DI0010805	Locals got these little gardens that do real well. Gosh darn well, truth be told. Ettienne got some help from that Anderson kid, I think.
0DI0010806	Anyway, we don't gotta rely on merchants so much. And it means the troopers can use all the food they make over on the east side. Works out nice.
0DI0010807	Oh, heh. Yeah, that's Mean Sonofabitch. I know the name sounds bad, but he likes it. He's one nasty old coot.
0DI0010808	Far as I can tell, he's one of them original Super Mutants, what came from the Boneyard. Wandered about after that "Master" fellow died.
0DI0010809	Eventually got caught somewhere around the Hub, back in NCR. Boy, they sure treated him mean down there. Cut him up so bad he can't talk no more.
0DI0010810	I tried to buy him, just so they'd stop hurting him, but they didn't want any of it.
0DI0010811	I run the liquor store in Westside. With things this rough, some folks need a lot of booze just to step out the door in the morning.
0DI0010812	After I close up shop, I walk around and help keep the peace. Not that I'm good with a gun, mind you, but someone's got to do it, you know?
0DI0010814	What else did you want to chat about?
0DI0010815	He just showed up here one day. Couldn't really talk, but he remembered me all right.
0DI0010816	Ever since then he's just been, well... hanging around, I guess. Does odd jobs for folks and smashes the bad guys when they come poking around.
0DI0010817	Some folks steer clear of him, for sure, but he don't seem to mind.
0DI0010818	Turned out some of them "Night Kids"  - whatever you call those sneaky Super Mutant types - got in and busted him out.
0DI0010819	I guess somebody named "Tabitha" led the bunch that freed him. Don't know much more than that.
0DI0010821	I'll surrender on one condition - you protect Westside's secret. Without that water, this community won't survive long.
0DI0010822	I'll say that White and I had a... falling out over a woman. A crime of passion, if you will.
0DI0010823	Thank you. I won't make any trouble when they come for me.
0DI0010824	Then you leave me no choice.
0DI0010825	Ten percent of the co-op's profits.
0DI0010826	Good. Tell Etienne about our deal and I'll turn myself in.
0DI0010827	Then we have an agreement. Thank you for keeping my secret - such a thing will never happen again.
0DI0010828	If the NCR thinks White was killed by, say, members from the scorpions gang, it may be enough for them to close the case.
0DI0010829	Thank you. What happened was regrettable, but I'll make sure it never happens again.
0DI0010830	[SUCCEEDED] Twenty percent it is. Etienne won't like it, but at least our secret will be safe.
0DI0010831	I'll turn myself in. Thank you for understanding.
0DI0010833	Thank you for keeping my secret. I'll make sure that nothing like it ever happens again.
0DI0010834	[FAILED] You ask too much. We barely make a profit as it is.
0DI0010835	Perhaps a partnership in the co-op would be enough. Say, ten percent of daily profits?
0DI0010836	That's not a bargain I can accept. Westside depends on that water for survival and self-reliance.
0DI0010837	No, no, no - they haven't yet earned the right to be called "slaves"! Those three in the pen are captures, nothing more.
0DI0010838	I'm a Slavemaster, so I know what I'm talking about. Back at the Fort, I'd have those three half-broken and well on their way.
0DI0010839	But this is just a holding area, so all I do is assess their fitness and decide whether to send them on.
0DI0010840	[SUCCEEDED] Pustulah -- what? Is that contagious? That doesn't sound good at all!
0DI0010841	[FAILED]I think my Latin is better than yours. I inspect all the captives myself, and there was no "dentata."
0DI0010842	A fair price. Always best to have caps on hand in case traders stop by.
0DI0010843	Here's the key to their collars. You want to take those off before you've gone far, trust me.
0DI0010846	Please do. An outbreak of pustulah-whatever is the last thing we need.
0DI0010848	Are you trying to get me killed? Get away from me!
0DI0010849	No way! I seen what happens when you mess with these collars!
0DI0010850	Sounds like I don't have much choice.
0DI0010851	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, you did it! Nice work!
0DI0010852	[FAILED] Forget it, I'm not gonna get my head blown off just because you don't know what you're doing!
0DI0010853	Good idea. I'd like to keep my head intact.
0DI0010854	Sorry, I'm just glad someone is doing something. The last thing I need is to be made some legionaire's bitch and sent off to God knows where.
0DI0010855	That man knows where we are? Just when I didn't think this could get any worse!
0DI0010856	At least he's too much of a coward to come after us himself. What if he'd ended up in this pen with us?
0DI0010858	[SUCCEEDED] You think we can make it? You really do?
0DI0010861	[FAILED] Are you crazy? They'd run us down in an instant!
0DI0010862	If you want to help us, you'll have to come up with something better than suicide!
0DI0010863	No way. If the guard catches you, we'll be beaten.
0DI0010864	If you want to help, get that gate unlocked or see if you can get the one they call Canyon Runner to let us go.
0DI0010865	All you're doing is killing us! Leave us alone!
0DI0010866	If there's any chance you can free us, it's worth the risk...
0DI0010867	[SUCCEEDED] My goodness! I swear my heart skipped a beat!
0DI0010868	[FAILED] That's enough of that! If you're going to get us out of here, it'll have to be another way.
0DI0010869	Anything that gets us out of here, please.
0DI0010870	[SUCCEEDED] Why? Why?
0DI0010871	[FAILED] Okay, you can quit. I don't know what you're trying to do, but it ain't helping.
0DI0010872	So you can kill more of us? Get away from me!
0DI0010873	If you say so... you know these collars have a bomb in them, don't you?
0DI0010874	Hurry up. The guards keep eyeing me like I'm a piece of meat.
0DI0010875	[SUCCEEDED] You did it! Thank you so much!
0DI0010876	[FAILED] Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. It is obvious you don't know what you're doing!
0DI0010877	Yeah, like get the key from the slavemaster or pay him to release us?
0DI0010878	Here.
0DI0010885	Dynamite or grenades?
0DI0010886	Watch yourself with this.
0DI0010891	This is your size.
0DI0010893	Excellent. You've done very well indeed. These tribals will make useful machete fodder.
0DI0010894	And if it should turn out we need their land later, well, it's not like we don't have the force to drive them out again.
0DI0010895	In the meantime, however, I have something else I want you to look into.
0DI0010896	We've had some disturbing reports recently concerning the Omertas, one of the Three Families that run the Strip.
0DI0010897	Our intelligence has discovered that high ranking members of the Omertas have been having clandestine meetings for the past several months.
0DI0010898	We haven't been able to determine whom they've been meeting with, but if it's Caesar's men, we'll need to act.
0DI0010899	I need you to uncover what they're up to, and stop it if it threatens the NCR. Any questions?
0DI0010900	Then stop wasting my time and get on it!
0DI0010901	Since the majority of my men are on assignment dealing with the Legion, I need someone to handle other matters that have arisen.
0DI0010902	Make no mistake, there's a battle coming, and I intend to make sure there are no loose ends when the time comes.
0DI0010903	One such loose end is a gang known as the Great Khans. Have you heard of them?
0DI0010904	But not too busy to come all the way out here? I don't think so. Stay a while, and listen to my offer.
0DI0010905	Then I don't need to tell you that they can be a pain in the ass.
0DI0010906	The NCR has a rather sordid history with them, and I'm concerned that we'll find them aiding our enemies when the Legion attack comes.
0DI0010907	That is, unless we get to them first. I want you to visit them in their canyons to the far west and make sure they're in no shape to join the Legion.
0DI0010908	They're just another gang of raiders as far as I'm concerned, so deal with them appropriately. Any questions?
0DI0010909	Good, that anger is something I can use, and I think you may get a chance to settle your score sooner than you might have planned.
0DI0010910	They're a rowdy bunch, and pride themselves as warriors. The dark leather and horned helmets they wear are pretty distinctive.
0DI0010911	Then you'll need to make sure none of them are left to do so. Any other questions?
0DI0010912	I can't lend you any troops, but I've already sent word to quartermaster Bardon that you're to be given full access to our hardware.
0DI0010913	You'll have to pay for what you take, however. We can't afford to give away equipment. Did you have any other questions?
0DI0010914	Good. I look forward to hearing of your progress.
0DI0010916	Liza O'Malley at the Embassy may have some information for you as well.
0DI0010918	Good riddance. We've had reports for years that they're the ones who supply the Fiends with chems, but no one's done anything about it.
0DI0010919	In any event, no one will miss them. And I've got another mission for you.
0DI0010920	Head to their casino, Gomorrah, and ask around. If you discover that what they're up to threatens the NCR, stop it.
0DI0010921	The Omertas themselves likely won't be forthcoming, so you may need to talk to some of their help to pick up a trail. Anything else?
0DI0010922	Our preliminary research shows that the Omertas used to do some business in Freeside, mostly buying weapons. Any other questions?
0DI0010923	Excellent. You'd think living in the lap of luxury and power would be enough for some people, but no.
0DI0010924	But we have other problems. While investigating the Omertas, what little I could on my end, I came across something much more sinister.
0DI0010925	Evidence suggests that Mr. House is planning to make some kind of move when the battle breaks out, and I'm guessing he won't be coming to our rescue.
0DI0010926	While we don't know what his exact plans are, my orders are to avoid all risks. I'm sending you to take Mr. House out of the equation. Any questions?
0DI0010927	Now that that's out of the way, let's see... Mr. House was a concern, but someone conveniently dealt with him for us.
0DI0010928	Oh, that reminds me, you might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed.
0DI0010929	The next time we speak, I expect you to have something for me.
0DI0010930	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't dismiss it that lightly, but it's nothing we need get involved with for now. Good work, I suppose.
0DI0010931	[FAILED] I highly doubt that. You'd do well to report only facts to me, otherwise we might have ourselves a problem.
0DI0010932	However, their activity has quieted down some so maybe my original information was wrong.
0DI0010933	If you must, but please keep it brief.
0DI0010934	But he's still alive? I'll have to remember to send someone to follow up on that later. Anyway, at least he's out of the picture for the time being.
0DI0010935	You might be happy to know that your efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
0DI0010936	The brass have been throwing around the idea of having the president visit the dam for a while now. To rally the troops and boost morale and such.
0DI0010937	With our recent achievements, they finally feel secure enough to stage the damn thing. But while it's being planned, I have one last mission for you.
0DI0010938	Several years ago, we managed to wrest the HELIOS One solar power station from the Brotherhood of Steel chapter local to this area.
0DI0010939	It was a crushing victory, but no one's heard a peep from the Brotherhood since. Most people assume the Brotherhood is scattered and not a threat.
0DI0010940	Recently we've had scouts go missing in an area west of HELIOS, and I'm concerned that the Brotherhood is involved.
0DI0010941	I want you to find them, and once you do, finish them for good. Any questions?
0DI0010942	Then that's one more nuisance we won't have to worry about. Good work. Our efforts haven't gone unnoticed, either.
0DI0010943	I shouldn't have to say this, but please don't bother me until the mission is completed.
0DI0010944	No, just because you secured the aid of the Khans, assuming they don't try to kill us, don't think the Brotherhood will be so easily swayed.
0DI0010945	These are people that both hate us *and* outgun us. There can be no compromise. Anything else?
0DI0010946	Don't even think about it. Any Brotherhood survivors likely harbor a deep grudge against us. We can't afford to leave such an enemy alive.
0DI0010947	Any other objections? Maybe you'd like to bring the Brotherhood some flowers?
0DI0010948	A fair question, and one I've had our strategists think about for some time. Their consensus is that we must focus on the one thing we can count on.
0DI0010949	With the Brotherhood that's their obsessive attachment to technology. They'd never go anywhere that didn't have working power.
0DI0010950	I'm willing to bet that wherever they're hiding, there's a working reactor powering their equipment. That's their vulnerability.
0DI0010951	Detonate that reactor, and we can safely cross the Brotherhood off our list of concerns. Was there anything else?
0DI0010952	After the battle, we consolidated our hold on the plant before pursuing our enemies.
0DI0010953	It was a mistake, to be sure, but there wasn't really any place for them to go. When we finally gave chase, however, they had simply vanished.
0DI0010954	Some of our people think they had some means of conveyance, like the vertibirds the Enclave used, and hightailed it out of here.
0DI0010955	I think that they found someplace to hide close to HELIOS, and never went that far at all. Any other questions?
0DI0010957	Ah, that's a relief. A Brotherhood attack while we're busy with the Legion would be catastrophic.
0DI0010958	The situation being what it is, we can't afford to lose even a single man unnecessarily.
0DI0010959	Don't give up. They're out there, somewhere, and we're not safe until they've been destroyed.
0DI0010960	And you believed them? Do you have any idea how long we've been fighting those bastards?
0DI0010961	Ugh, Crocker will have a field day with this. He'll want to establish diplomatic relations with them, for pete's sake.
0DI0010962	But we've got more important matters to attend to. The president is due to arrive soon, and we're sure the Legion won't waste such an opportunity.
0DI0010963	I want you to assist the security detail we've prepared for the president. His safety is critical to maintaining the mens' fighting spirit.
0DI0010964	Go up to the visitor center and speak to Ranger Grant. He's in charge of security during the president's visit. Dismissed.
0DI0010965	Good, his death could have had a major impact on morale. This whole affair was ill-advised from the start, and I for one am glad it's over.
0DI0010966	While you were out, General Oliver arrived and briefed all senior officers regarding a change in our strategy.
0DI0010967	I'm not at liberty to divulge what was said, but I've been instructed to send you to him immediately.
0DI0010968	He's set up his camp in the office area at the south end of this power plant.
0DI0010970	Damn it! The timing couldn't be any worse. I tried to warn those buffoons, but they insisted on this little show.
0DI0010971	We'll be lucky if the men don't throw down their guns and surrender as the Legion approaches. I guess there's nothing to be done about it now.
0DI0010972	Then what the hell are you doing down here? Get back topside and protect the president!
0DI0010973	This is no time for questions! Get back topside and protect the president!
0DI0010974	Hmm.
0DI0010975	I think that you should be able to divert the flow of the water into the generator turbines. That would grind them up like hamburger.
0DI0010976	The computer to activate it is just ahead, but you may need to go outside to activate the manual override. That system hasn't been used in a while.
0DI0010977	Ok, be careful out there.
0DI0010978	Good luck. I'm going to find a place to not get shot.
0DI0010979	I think they'll probably end up killing you. I trained them myself. But, if you do win somehow, the mongrels will at least get honorable deaths.
0DI0010980	I thought something was wrong. We usually have to pull them off any visitors to the Fort.
0DI0010981	Well, that's no fun. Take the bear. I'll find them something else to chew on.
0DI0010982	Take the bear. I can't believe I let some of my best dogs get killed over this stupid thing.
0DI0010983	Your stuff is in the crate next to the arena entrance. Leave it there too long and we'll dump it in the lake.
0DI0010984	Huh. I could've sworn I had that stupid bear on me. Well, tough luck for you, I guess.
0DI0010985	You do that.
0DI0010986	Good luck - you'll need it.
0DI0010987	Lupa? Yes, she's the mother of a lot of our best dogs. She's getting old, but she's still a tough old bitch. Aren't you, girl?
0DI0010988	Antony took Sergeant Teddy away and gave him to the stinky dogs. I want him back!
0DI0010989	He's a toy. I'm not a baby, you know.
0DI0010990	I kept him secret, but I think somebody told on me.
0DI0010991	Oh, okay.
0DI0010995	But... I don't have anything. I thought you were my friend!
0DI0010996	Sergeant Teddy!
0DI0010998	Light armor and machetes only. The challenger - the one who asks to enter the arena - may be pitted against one or more opponents.
0DI0010999	All matches continue until one side is dead. No exceptions.
0DI0011000	Most of the time it's some young Legionary trying to make a name for himself, hoping to get noticed by Caesar or the Praetorians.
0DI0011001	We pit slaves or prisoners against each other once in awhile, but it's not much of a show. They're usually too reluctant to kill each other.
0DI0011002	I set up the fights, keep track of prisoners available, and make sure the arena's cleaned up.
0DI0011003	Remember the rules: light armor and machetes only. And, of course, to the death.
0DI0011006	All right. Did you want something else?
0DI0011007	Careful in there - he's tougher than he looks.
0DI0011008	Watch out for her - she's one of the deadliest fighters I've ever seen.
0DI0011009	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some healing powder every day, but you'd have to be a friend of the Legion.
0DI0011010	For sale? I'm a slave, not a merchant. I could give you some supplies every day, though - you are, after all, a friend of the Legion.
0DI0011011	[SUCCEEDED] Oh - I've been using two roots per flower. Thanks to you, I'll be able to create twice as much healing powder per day.
0DI0011012	[FAILED] I'd rather not go experimenting. Some of these wasteland plants are toxic.
0DI0011013	Was there something else?
0DI0011014	Good gracious! The Legion is using the intake tunnels to storm their way into the dam, someone has to stop them.
0DI0011015	Caravan companies are probably your best bet. Smaller traders aren't likely to have anything that esoteric.
0DI0011016	The clamor of our bloodthirsty crowds reaches every corner of The Wasteland, but I'll pretend that your ignorance doesn't offend me, stranger.
0DI0011017	This is The Thorn! Here's where the strong make a name for themselves and the weak are fed to the jaws of hell.
0DI0011018	You can bet on the contenders or, if you have what it takes, be one of the contenders.
0DI0011019	Be warned, The Thorn demands respect. Break the rules, or offend me in any way, and I'll gut you open for all to see.
0DI0011025	You've, indeed, become the greatest hunter The Thorn has ever seen, the best I've ever seen.
0DI0011026	You've earned the honor of being part of this sacred ground. Come to me often and I'll share with you the wealth of The Thorn.
0DI0011028	Ask and you might get an answer.
0DI0011032	We've got a pair of Giant Mantises ready to bleed.
0DI0011033	Radscorpions. The crowd loves those.
0DI0011034	We're lucky to have some Cazadores in the next match.
0DI0011035	Giant Radscorpions are about to battle in The Thorn.
0DI0011036	Deadly NightStalkers will now fight for our pleasure.
0DI0011037	The strongest Geckos you'll ever see are ready to fight.
0DI0011038	The deadliest beast of all! You've never seen anything like this before.
0DI0011039	Deathclaws will bleed this sacred ground red! Make your bets, stranger, before it's too late.
0DI0011040	Fiend prisoners will fight for their lives against Night Stalkers.
0DI0011041	Radscorpions against Fiends.
0DI0011042	We've got three fiends ready for our Cazadores.
0DI0011043	A rare fight, Deathclaw against Fire Geckos.
0DI0011044	Giant Radscorpions against two Deathclaws.
0DI0011045	Even if I trusted you I'd not share my secrets just for your pretty face, stranger.
0DI0011046	The Thorn's a sacred ground, a source of awe. Here we truly rule over the forces of nature, for once.
0DI0011047	These beasts are slaves to their instincts and hunger for blood. That's good enough an answer for everyone, and it'll do for you too.
0DI0011049	And I won't stop you, stranger.
0DI0011050	What's the name of your deathwish?
0DI0011051	Let's test your mettle.
0DI0011052	On how many can you take, stranger?
0DI0011055	My deadly Cazadores will test your limits.
0DI0011057	Be warned, my Geckos are the toughest you'll ever face.
0DI0011059	Now you're talking! I'll be impressed if you make it out alive, stranger.
0DI0011060	Having seen what you're capable of, I think you'd fight a horde of them and not bat an eye.
0DI0011061	But The Thorn honors balance, not foolish sacrifice. I'll only allow one Deathclaw against you.
0DI0011085	The rules are simple. My creatures fight for our pleasure. You can bet on a contender and earn double if you chose the victor.
0DI0011086	But you can get a bigger share if you risk your skin in The Thorn. Win a fight and I'll give you a meaty cut of the earnings.
0DI0011087	I won't tolerate anyone that interferes with the fights. Offend me, and your blood will be the next to spill. Other than that, anything goes.
0DI0011097	Giant Radscorpions make deadly opponents.
0DI0011098	On how many can you take?
0DI0011105	You've proven yourself, stranger. Your blood hungers for glory and I'll placate its thirst.
0DI0011106	Name your challenge.
0DI0011113	Prepare yourself, these Night Stalkers are hungry for blood.
0DI0011121	You are paying for it. What'll bleed today in The Thorn, stranger?
0DI0011122	My creatures are expensive to find, expensive to raise, and expensive to maintain.
0DI0011123	If your pleasure is to see them bleed at your will, I'll oblige only after my costs are covered, stranger.
0DI0011124	Those costs will change depending on your choice of fighters. Also, I'll only allow fair fights in The Thorn.
0DI0011125	I'll help you set up good matches. You pay, you bet, and I bring you the most delightful spectacle on this world. Are we clear?
0DI0011225	It ain't like we came to Nipton to play it! Me and my crew had it worked out to kidnap some NCR troopers who come to town to get laid.
0DI0011226	Had it all worked out with the scumbag mayor. We were gonna ransom them off, keep their weapons for ourselves, a nice score.
0DI0011227	They must have run straight back to camp. I bet they didn't even stop and say thanks.
0DI0011228	The NCR could use someone like you. Stop by our camps if you're looking for work.
0DI0011229	Can you hurry? I know those Legion bastards are tough but my friends won't last long with all the radiation in there.
0DI0011230	Were? What do you mean were?
0DI0011231	Legion bastards. They'll pay for that.
0DI0011232	I was worried Alexus had already thrown them down a mineshaft. I'll run by camp and see how they're doing when I get a chance. Thanks for the help.
0DI0011233	What? Why on earth would you think you can walk in here and make troop deployment recommendations to me?
0DI0011234	I appreciate your concern for Bitter Springs. You've already been quite helpful to the NCR, I suppose it's only right to return the favor.
0DI0011235	Well, you have been a great help here, and with the saboteur dealt with... Yes, I think we can spare a few men. Consider it done.
0DI0011236	Who the hell are you, coming in here and asking me if I can "spare any?" I don't hand out NCR troopers to anybody who wanders out of the Wasteland!
0DI0011237	Hey, you're a damn fine soldier, and word on the grapevine is that you're already some kind of hero. You got yourself a deal.
0DI0011238	After what you did getting my misfits whipped into shape? Yeah, I can spare a couple of boys for Bitter Springs. I'll issue the dispatch orders.
0DI0011239	Sorry, I'm not in the habit of letting random civilians dictate my troop deployment schedule.
0DI0011240	I'll be honest, the Legion has me worried here, but I think I can spare some soldiers. Consider your request granted.
0DI0011241	You handled yourself well against the Legion, and that took some of the pressure off of us. I'll send a couple of troops out there right now.
0DI0011242	Well, keep those eyes up and turning - or I'll set 'em spinning.
0DI0011243	Got no time for gawkers... or anyone looking for something I ain't selling.
0DI0011244	Your business, huh? Now there's a store worth tending.
0DI0011245	You run along now... judging by that busted pilot light expression you're fixed with, "business" ain't so good.
0DI0011246	Got no time or answers for you. Ask a drifter in need of a few caps, they'll give you all the answers you need.
0DI0011247	This is the place. We got sent from Camp Golf, looking for some Khans who'd been making trouble with one of our settlements.
0DI0011248	I guess one of the settlers was connected, because we sent everything we had. We figured this was a gang hideout, but... they'd led us to their home.
0DI0011249	There's a ridge called Coyote Tail on the south side. That's where we set up.
0DI0011250	Christ. They put the graveyard here.
0DI0011251	Canyon 37. That's what the NCR calls the pass down there.
0DI0011252	It was the Khans' only escape, so we set up here to guard it while the main force attacked from the front.
0DI0011253	Standing orders were to shoot on sight.
0DI0011254	Yeah. Always. Even when I sleep.
0DI0011255	I don't think so. It won't change anything. And that's a memory I don't want refreshed.
0DI0011256	Nothing. Dream. Just tired of thinking about it.
0DI0011257	I hope this isn't a mistake.
0DI0011258	Yeah. Yeah, I guess not. Forget I brought it up.
0DI0011259	You're the one who suggested it.
0DI0011260	Fine. If I'm on my own I'm on my own. But I'm gonna go.
0DI0011261	Good working with you.
0DI0011262	All right. Let's head out, then.
0DI0011263	In trade for what?
0DI0011264	What do you want to trade for?
0DI0011265	How many tags worth?
0DI0011266	What type of ammo?
0DI0011267	Firearms of what kind?
0DI0011268	What sort of armor?
0DI0011269	Grecks is a bit cracked, but mostly harmless. Just don't mention anything about his lazy eye.
0DI0011270	He owes 138 caps and should still be around Freeside.
0DI0011271	Lady Jane fancies herself a high roller, but she's just another dirtbag NCR prospector. I'm not sure where to find her.
0DI0011272	I hear she's run goods for the Followers of the Apocalypse in the past, but other locals might know more. She owes us 250 caps.
0DI0011273	Santiago is a suave son of a bitch, but a total pansy when it comes to fisticuffs. He owes 212 caps and should be around Freeside as well.
0DI0011274	Anything else you need?
0DI0011275	I don't know. The NCR's stretched thin as it is. I've put in requests at Camp Golf, Forlorn Hope, McCarran - but things are no better there.
0DI0011276	Maybe if their situations improved, they'd have men to spare. Or maybe they'd listen to someone with a reputation for helping the NCR.
0DI0011277	Food, blankets, clothes, tools. The army used to ship out caches of supplies regularly, but with the Legion so active we haven't gotten any in months.
0DI0011278	You'll want to talk to Lieutenant Markland about that, he's our medical officer. He should be down at the medical tent now.
0DI0011279	It started about six months ago. At first it was just supplies going missing - we figured it was refugees. Then people started dying.
0DI0011280	Always a single bullet to the head, always from extreme range. We've lost eight refugees and three soldiers to this son of a bitch.
0DI0011281	We know he must be hiding out in one of the caves up in the mountains, but I don't have enough men to send out looking for him!
0DI0011282	Okay, but make it quick - I'm very busy here.
0DI0011283	The Legion happened. What the fuck's it look like?
0DI0011284	Luck, that's how! I'm just that fucking lucky!
0DI0011285	You're looking at the second place winner of the Nipton lottery! That asshole Swanick took first place, so him they let walk!
0DI0011286	I dunno, I just love it here. What the fuck do you think, asshole?
0DI0011287	Prize for second place was I got to live, but they beat my fucking legs with hammers. I'm fucking crippled, get it?
0DI0011288	Where did you get these? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. These will be a tremendous help.
0DI0011289	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't completely solve our problems, but it goes a long way.
0DI0011290	Again, thank you, this is a huge help.
0DI0011291	I'm an Army field medic. I can treat bullet wounds, shrapnel, trenchfoot, no problem.
0DI0011292	But this - the kids and the psychological trauma and all the rest - is out of my league.
0DI0011293	Thank you. Any help you can give would be a godsend.
0DI0011294	Yeah? Hey, sure, that would be fantastic!
0DI0011295	Where did you get this? You know what, it doesn't even matter. Thank you. This will be a tremendous help.
0DI0011296	[SUCCEEDED] We do have some spare Rad-X in the supply tent. That might work. Thank you.
0DI0011297	[FAILED] You know, I appreciate the help but... we'll pass on those. Thanks.
0DI0011298	Well enough. Be on your way.
0DI0011299	Of course I'm aware. It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
0DI0011300	It's a distress call. This camp is in bad shape, and if we don't get relief soon, I don't know what will happen.
0DI0011301	Hey, if you can help, I'll take whatever I can get. Doctor's Bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
0DI0011302	I'm not trained to deal with major psychological trauma, and we've got a lot of kids in this camp.
0DI0011303	What I really need are medical texts - books on psychology or pediatrics, specifically.
0DI0011304	What I really need is a book on psychology. Something for post-traumatic stress.
0DI0011305	What I really need is a book on pediatric medicine. We've got a lot of sick and injured kids here.
0DI0011306	Doctor's bags would be a huge help, but what I really need are medical texts.
0DI0011308	Both of them? Wow, that's very resourceful. Thank you.
0DI0011309	That's great! Thank you. I'm sure this will go a long way toward making things better here.
0DI0011310	This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thank you.
0DI0011311	At this point, I'll take anything you can give me. We need more troops, fresh supplies, and medical relief.
0DI0011312	As if that wasn't enough, someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
0DI0011314	Someone's been coming out of the mountains at night, stealing supplies and picking off my people.
0DI0011315	This is the Bitter Springs refugee camp. We've been maintaining it for a few years now, ever since Caesar's Legion started seriously pushing west.
0DI0011316	Most of the people here were displaced by the Legion's advance. At first there weren't many, but lately it's been more than we can handle.
0DI0011317	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. I can't offer you much of a reward, but know that the NCR is very grateful.
0DI0011318	Thanks to your help, I think Bitter Springs has a real shot at surviving. Thank you again.
0DI0011319	Yeah. What they do to women... that's worse than death. There was no choice in what I did.
0DI0011320	It was more like... being forced to watch something you can't stop.
0DI0011321	All this was only ever going to play out one way. It still is. I don't have any say. All I can do is wait for it to be done with me.
0DI0011322	There was never any saving her. They'd have taken her where I couldn't follow. What I did... that was the only rescue.
0DI0011323	There was no decision. I was meant to pull that trigger. It was a mistake to think I could escape it.
0DI0011324	You take out a debt, it's only a matter of time before someone comes collecting. Things just finally caught up with me.
0DI0011325	It was gonna be something. If I'd never met Carla, it would've been something else. I should've never gotten close to her.
0DI0011326	I've got bad things coming to me. You'd better keep your distance, too.
0DI0011327	Because fair is fair.
0DI0011328	Better that you don't.
0DI0011330	No. Sorry.
0DI0011331	I was in a lot of places with First Recon. I don't really remember.
0DI0011332	That part of my life is over now. So is this discussion.
0DI0011333	We won.
0DI0011334	There was a... miscommunication.
0DI0011335	Look, we've done some traveling together, but we're not exactly comrades-in-arms. I'm not ready to swap war stories.
0DI0011336	Maybe some other time.
0DI0011337	Your enemies, or mine?
0DI0011338	True. It's a start.
0DI0011339	I don't know. Couldn't hurt.
0DI0011340	Yeah. I guess that'd be the word.
0DI0011341	We did what we were there to do. Lot of people got killed. That's war.
0DI0011342	Maybe looking back you'd do things differently, but that's not how it works.
0DI0011343	In the field, you hesitate, you or someone you care about will die. They teach that from day one.
0DI0011344	Yeah, well. That's how they wrote it up in the report.
0DI0011345	Not as much as you'd think.
0DI0011346	You don't come out of a tour of duty without regrets. It's best just not to think about it.
0DI0011347	It doesn't lead anywhere that does any good. I know that much.
0DI0011348	Not much hope either way, is there?
0DI0011349	Life has a way of punishing you for the mistakes you make.
0DI0011350	Big enough mistake, punishment can take a while.
0DI0011351	Mine's not over.
0DI0011352	A murderer who does good deeds is still a murderer. And he'll still get his judgment.
0DI0011353	I left the NCR when my tour was up. Had enough of war. Decided I was gonna start over.
0DI0011354	None of it made a difference in the end.
0DI0011355	That's what they tell you in the casinos, too. Because it's the only way to get you to buy back in.
0DI0011356	If people knew the truth, that something's watching you, waiting to take it all away from you, and it never loses...
0DI0011357	That's all it's doing now. Waiting for me to buy back in.
0DI0011358	Yeah, that's what I thought, too.
0DI0011359	But it's not so easy when you know it's coming for you.
0DI0011360	Because I'm still alive.
0DI0011361	I heard, we'll be needing those guns. Word on the street is you handled those Fiend freaks like a real pro.
0DI0011362	Yeah, I heard. I wasn't sold on the whole gas thing. He's the expert though. It sounds like this chlorine thing is going to work out real well.
0DI0011363	I heard you did some good work for us. Thank you. Here's a little cash from us to you. Try not to spend it all in one place.
0DI0011364	How do you know? Did you find proof?
0DI0011365	Those sick bastards - can't say I'll shed any tears for them. Here, you've earned this.
0DI0011366	All right. Maybe Dermot's got something, as well.
0DI0011367	All right. Maybe Saint James has something connected to the refugees as well.
0DI0011368	We know there's a connection with the refugees, but we need to know where they could be found. There could be more evidence in Dermot's room.
0DI0011369	We need a direct connection to the refugees, now that we've got an idea of what happened to them. Saint James could have something in his room.
0DI0011370	Let's see... a bear. Yes, this belonged to the little girl, so that's a direct connection to the missing people.
0DI0011371	And this ledger - I know these names. Nephi and Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
0DI0011372	Thank you for your help - I'll make sure those sick bastards get what's coming to them. Here, you've earned this.
0DI0011373	You got no right asking me that. Drop it.
0DI0011374	That goes both ways. I joined up with you to kill legionaries. Sooner we get back to that, sooner we can have an understanding.
0DI0011375	You don't know what you're asking. Just... let it go for now.
0DI0011376	The Legion's the only thing I want on my mind right now.
0DI0011377	It's just something I'm not ready to discuss. With you or anybody.
0DI0011378	I don't see what this helps. She's dead.
0DI0011379	Fine. How do I know she's dead? Here it is.
0DI0011380	She... I tracked her down. Southeast, near the river. They were selling her. Saw it through my scope.
0DI0011381	Whole place swarming with Legion. Hundreds of them. Bidding for things no man has a right to.
0DI0011382	I just had my rifle with me. Just me, against all of them, so... I took the shot.
0DI0011384	Yeah, fuck off.
0DI0011385	Yeah, well, I must've heard rumors, and, uh... fuck you! You got nothing on me and Dermot.
0DI0011386	The killing of Profligates should never go unrewarded. I'll pay you a small sum per tag.
0DI0011387	[SUCCEEDED] Go see Decanus Severus when you have tags, in that case. He watches over our stores.
0DI0011388	[FAILED] Nothing on this Earth could make you worthy to wear the armor of a Centurion. Do not ask again.
0DI0011389	Yes, stop wasting my time.
0DI0011390	Killing one Profligate is the work of a child.
0DI0011391	Just two?
0DI0011392	So you're getting some exercise.
0DI0011393	A good bit of hunting. Here's your payment.
0DI0011394	Hardly a day's work, but then again, you're not Legion.
0DI0011395	Was there something else you wanted to bother me with?
0DI0011396	The trip will take a few hours. Take your place on the boat.
0DI0011397	That bad huh? Well at least I tried. The actual idea is better. It's a Legion hunt. Whoever kills the most wins. How about it?
0DI0011398	Straight to the point. I like that. What I propose is a Legion hunt. Troopers kill them anyway so why not make it a game. What do you say?
0DI0011399	Alright fine. Is there anything you do care about?
0DI0011400	Alright calm down buddy. I don't wanna provoke you. I'll let you ask the questions.
0DI0011401	Yeah it was bad. I'll leave the comedy alone. So how about it?
0DI0011402	Yep. Been waiting for a chance to use it. So can I count you in?
0DI0011403	Great! Don't be surprised if you're already last when you return. If I'm right, the troopers will use any excuse to slaughter Legion scum.
0DI0011404	Can I help you with anything else?
0DI0011405	That's a shame. Well if you change your mind, let me know. Need anything else?
0DI0011406	Well don't let me stop you then.
0DI0011407	Know what? I'm going to sign you up anyway. If you don't mind being last then there's not much else I can say. Any questions?
0DI0011408	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, well, you see anybody wearing Legion crimson or a lot of sports equipment, you just let me know.
0DI0011409	You still haven't answered my question.
0DI0011410	[FAILED] Drop it. Now why the hell are you here?
0DI0011411	You sure you want it to go down this way? You're going to have every Omerta in this place jumping down your throat.
0DI0011412	All right, this is going to be fun.
0DI0011413	Sorry, we don't have any hotel rooms available right now, but feel free to gamble or help yourself to our other services.
0DI0011415	Feel free to head to our club, Brimstone, or you can see our gorgeous courtyard out behind the casino.
0DI0011417	The fuck? I knew there had to be someone higher up helping you. Nero, you backstabbing, two-timing motherfucker. I knew this day would come.
0DI0011418	It's a long story. Let's just say whiskey makes you do strange things to impress a girl.
0DI0011419	But it also leads to some of my best competition ideas. Wanna hear one?
0DI0011421	I haven't the time to speak to commoners such as yourself.
0DI0011422	Where would I go? My caravan is lost and I haven't the caps to do much else.
0DI0011423	Great. I'll have the medical supplies for you by the time you come back.
0DI0011424	Here, take this packet sniffer. It will allow us to intercept data on Mr. House's network.
0DI0011425	You might have to manually remove the encryption from his data network, but hopefully you won't have too much trouble. Good luck!
0DI0011426	I'm afraid that's all I can offer. Well, I won't keep you any longer.
0DI0011427	Let me know if you change your mind. The offer for medical supplies will still be good.
0DI0011429	Do you mind if I ask why?
0DI0011430	Well... I guess that makes some sense. After all, you're the first person who's set foot in there in over two hundred years.
0DI0011431	Let me know if you change your mind. I'll be around here or in Vault 21.
0DI0011432	Great. You and every other asshole around here. If you grow a heart anytime soon, I'll be around.
0DI0011433	Oh... okay. I'll be around if you change your mind.
0DI0011434	[SUCCEEDED] Ah. I see. I suppose I can give you some medical supplies for your efforts. I assure you they will be worth plenty of caps.
0DI0011435	[FAILED] Oh. No that wasn't really what we had in mind. We were hoping you would just, you know, help us. To be helpful.
0DI0011436	Um... I help take care of the Brahmin. I sometimes bring water and food to people. Um... that's it.
0DI0011439	Nope, strictly independent. Well... kind of independent.
0DI0011440	To vend anything here on the Strip, you got to register with one of those police robots and sign a franchisee agreement.
0DI0011441	At the end of each day, you keep half of what you made. The rest, you hand over to those bots - and they know if you're cheating.
0DI0011442	Yep, he makes the rules. It's steep, but it sure beats living in North Vegas. Here on the Strip I can afford to eat, and no one tries to kill me.
0DI0011443	Best booze in Vegas, baby. What'll it be?
0DI0011444	Suit yourself. Gambling's thirsty work - I'll be here if you change your mind.
0DI0011445	What starts in misery tends to stay there. Freeside wasn't Freeside until six or seven years ago.
0DI0011446	That's when Mr. House's robots rolled out of the Lucky 38 and started pushing everyone who wouldn't join him off the Strip.
0DI0011447	Lots of folks died. Some scattered to the winds. The rest wound up in Freeside and seem never to lose the habit of living like refugees.
0DI0011448	What about them? Pretty much the sort of gang you'd find anywhere else, just with better clothes.
0DI0011449	The King himself, though? He's got that something special you can't put a finger on. Too bad he likes girls with skin.
0DI0011451	I reckon they care about getting water and electricity from the dam, and that's where it ends.
0DI0011452	The locals here are just an inconvenience to them, something to step over or stomp down. They're here for the resources, plain and simple.
0DI0011453	Before or after the human race shot itself in the foot? I been around long enough to have both opinions, see.
0DI0011454	Before the war, Mr. House was a famous captain of industry - robotics, to be specific. Seemed charming in interviews, until he became a recluse.
0DI0011455	Since the war, though? Didn't make a peep for near two hundred years - but when he came back, he came back strong and killed a lot of people.
0DI0011456	I don't know how they do it. They're like saints, those Followers.
0DI0011457	If they didn't charge for their services, I'd think they was crazy. But no, they're just naive. Warms your heart.
0DI0011458	A couple of Radscorpions, those two. Gloria is the stable one, but she'd slit your throat if there's a profit in it.
0DI0011459	Or rather she'd tell her brother to do it for her. Jean Baptiste is one of the sicker humans I've had the displeasure of observing.
0DI0011460	I've escorted my share of idiot tourists around Freeside. Too much trouble for what it pays.
0DI0011461	I'm all boot knives and leather, friend - and a ghoul, besides. What kind of weirdo wants what I've got?
0DI0011462	Weirdos into bullwhips and necrosis, eh? Doesn't sound half-bad...
0DI0011463	What am I thinking? I'm no whore, and I ain't about to hand my ass over to some penny-ante hustler like he owns me.
0DI0011464	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. They do have a damn good selection of hooch over at the Wrangler.
0DI0011465	If I get to choose my customers, if I get to be a little rough with them, if my cut is fair, and if I get that discount? That just might work.
0DI0011466	Tell the Garrets I'll stop by to work out terms.
0DI0011467	[FAILED] Take your best shot, sweetheart. That's all the action I need.
0DI0011468	Then, what do you want?
0DI0011469	What's the difference?! Once you start working for the man, you gotta buy nice things to wear.
0DI0011470	Then, you gotta make more money to afford the nice things. Seems like a right vicious cycle to get into.
0DI0011471	Not saying there wouldn't be advantages, especially if it'd let me start saving up my caps...
0DI0011472	Absinthe?! I haven't had a taste of that in decades!
0DI0011473	If they keep bottles stocked at the Wrangler, you can count me in. I'll head that way and talk to Mr. Garret.
0DI0011475	Please, find them soon. I can already feel the withdrawal effects taking hold.
0DI0011477	Sure. Just tell me the author and what you want it to say.
0DI0011478	Not a problem. I occasionally do business with the Van Graffs, so I have a sample of Mr. Cutting's handwriting around here somewhere.
0DI0011479	What would you like it to say?
0DI0011480	Like to live dangerously, do we? No problem. And... here you go.
0DI0011481	This is important enough to the Followers that we scraped together the caps required for the credit check.
0DI0011482	And I'm staying at Vault 21, which is pretty cheap. For the Strip, anyway.
0DI0011484	Just doing my job, okay? Jeesh.
0DI0011485	Like he helped the envoy we sent? No thanks.
0DI0011486	It's not something I'm willing to discuss. Now if you'll excuse me, there are other people waiting.
0DI0011487	You won't regret it. At least until an hour or so from now.
0DI0011489	Typically, I find it goes down better if I leave people guessing. So what do you say, want some?
0DI0011490	Only a little. A friend of mine, Major Elizabeth Kieran, has been handing out supplies to the poor a little west of here. What about it?
0DI0011491	I know something's got them riled up, but I've been too busy with other matters to really look into it.
0DI0011492	If you're looking into the matter, talk to Elizabeth. She's in charge of the operations here in Freeside, though she won't open up to you right away.
0DI0011493	If Elizabeth holds out on you, tell her that I sent you. She should be a little more forthcoming if you mention my name.
0DI0011494	Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
0DI0011495	Okay, what did you want to talk about?
0DI0011496	Good. I like that enthusiasm. Return when you have some information we can use.
0DI0011497	Good. Return here when you've found something.
0DI0011498	Bunch of soldier boys, huh? They usually don't come around these parts since their big base is on the other side of the Strip.
0DI0011499	If they're comin' over here now, it's got to be for a reason. I didn't want to believe the rumors that they're looking to take over Vegas, but now...
0DI0011500	If something big is going down, I'm sure rumors of it will have spread. Ask around, particularly in the squatter areas where the NCR folk hang.
0DI0011501	You might also mosey on over to the Mormon Fort and chat Julie Farkas up. The Followers tend to be in the know about these things.
0DI0011502	Just don't ask her what to do about it. She'll probably ask you to hug someone or somethin'.
0DI0011503	Then there's no sense in us talkin' about it.
0DI0011504	Go ahead. Throw some questions at me.
0DI0011505	Ah, that would explain the goons. They're here to keep people like my friends away from the food. That ain't something I support. No sir.
0DI0011506	Keep at it. Those boys are here for a reason.
0DI0011507	Sure can. What did you want to know?
0DI0011508	Nothing's innocent in Freeside. You should know that by now.
0DI0011509	No, I'm guessing they're doing something they know will cause a row, like keep the food all to themselves.
0DI0011511	I'm gonna see that those supplies are distributed a little m- what the hell?
0DI0011512	Wait a minute, wait a minute. They said what?
0DI0011513	Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anything uncalled for.
0DI0011514	Huh, that would explain why they're all riled at us. Seems like we have a big misunderst- what the hell?
0DI0011515	What is that fool doing? I need you to head out there and try to defuse the situation. Tell them I'm willing to cooperate.
0DI0011516	You there! Keep your hands where we can see them! Draw a weapon and we will fire!
0DI0011517	Put your weapon away or we will fire!
0DI0011518	Here comes a winner. I'll let you handle this one.
0DI0011519	Settle in. You've got some hours left before your shift ends.
0DI0011520	Heck Gunderson, you are under arrest for the murder of Ted Gunderson.
0DI0011521	What in blazes? That's my son you're talking about! He ain't dead. I'm looking for him.
0DI0011522	It is my duty to inform you that murder is a serious crime.
0DI0011523	As a murderer you should be feeling emotions such as guilt, sorrow, and shame.
0DI0011524	If not, you may wish to consult a mental health professional.
0DI0011525	Where's my son? What'd you do with my boy?
0DI0011526	I hope this experience has taught you an important lesson about the value of human life.
0DI0011527	You can't do this to me! This is a mistake!
0DI0011528	Dead or alive, you're coming with me.
0DI0011529	Please allow me to escort you to the nearest criminal processing facility.
0DI0011530	The hell I will.
0DI0011531	Stand back, citizens. Deceased bodies are a known source of illness, and a potential tripping hazard.
0DI0011532	Wonderful. You have come through with flying colors. On behalf of my colleagues, allow me to extend my thanks.
0DI0011533	I know what a terrible sacrifice this must've been for you.
0DI0011534	King, we've got problems!
0DI0011535	Lay it on me. What's going on?
0DI0011536	There's a shootout going down near the train station. It's Pacer and some strangers. Might be NCR.
0DI0011537	Hey there, I heard that NCR soldier lady told you some wild story about them sending a messenger to us to work out some deal.
0DI0011538	That's bullshit, and it's nothing to bother the King with. More like they sent someone to spy on us and he wasn't tough enough to last in Freeside.
0DI0011539	So do everyone a favor and keep your mouth shut about it, okay?
0DI0011540	It's no problem, just something I'd rather not think about. Now, I should get to the other customers.
0DI0011541	No, I'm afraid we don't. Do you have a friend you wanted to bring in?
0DI0011542	Like I said before, we don't. And I'm not inclined to discuss why.
0DI0011543	You were right, but here, take another helping for your friend. It'll be our secret.
0DI0011544	Well, now you know. Enjoy the food.
0DI0011545	That's not really a pleasant topic of conversation. Let's just say we have our reasons.
0DI0011546	You know Julie? Not everyone in the NCR sees eye-to-eye with the Followers, but they're okay in my book, mostly because of her.
0DI0011547	If you really want to know, we sent an envoy to the King offering to coordinate the relief effort.
0DI0011548	In a manner of speaking. Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
0DI0011549	I managed to get clearance to carry out the mission anyway, but with greatly reduced support.
0DI0011550	Now there's not enough supplies to go around even if I wanted to serve the rest of Freeside, which I don't.
0DI0011551	But that's all in the past now. I should get back to work. Say hi to Julie for me.
0DI0011552	Our envoy was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
0DI0011553	The man was brutally beaten, and only barely survived. My superiors ordered the relief mission scrapped.
0DI0011554	Wh-? Guards!
0DI0011555	Then he should watch his back. We know for a fact that the envoy made it to their headquarters.
0DI0011556	Still, if the King's willing to deal with us, perhaps we can work something out. I'll tell my men to stand down.
0DI0011557	You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, this should do it.
0DI0011558	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, here's some more, but you better keep you mouth shut! I'm out of here. Got some important business to take care of.
0DI0011559	[FAILED] That's all you get. Now keep your mouth shut. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
0DI0011560	Good, see that it stays that way. Now if you'll pardon me, I got some important business to take care of.
0DI0011561	That's a shame. Well, do what you want. Just don't expect it to matter.
0DI0011562	Exactly. Seeing that we're of one mind on this, I'll head out. I got business to take care of.
0DI0011563	Why you lit- You're just lucky I got something important to take care of. We'll settle this later.
0DI0011564	Sorry, but I can't tell you that. Trade secret.
0DI0011565	He's the reason the Strip shines like a star at night. Mike's imagined and built every sign, billboard and light you'll see around here.
0DI0011566	Then go bother someone else. I got shit to do.
0DI0011567	Yeah, you can blame Glory for that mess. She had some fun with the little prick and it ended badly.
0DI0011568	Now he goes around spreading lies about my sister, which pisses me off. One of these days I'm going to piss in his skull, you watch.
0DI0011569	Ha, he's a jet junkie? He'll go crazy when he finds it gone. I like it.
0DI0011570	I'll tell you what. When you hit the stash, leave him this note from me. If the punk really has it bad, he'll come running straight here.
0DI0011571	His gang won't be able to say shit if he comes storming this place himself.
0DI0011572	We could do that, but then we'd have to kill his four hundred friends too, and that'd just get tiring.
0DI0011573	Some day he'll make a mistake, though, and his friends won't be around to back him up, and then he'll be mine.
0DI0011574	Our family comes from Redding, to the west. We deal weapons mostly, but trade other commodities, like gold, if there's cash in it.
0DI0011575	Our mother's been running the show for longer than most of us have been alive, but she stays at the home office.
0DI0011576	We've got branches all over the place, which are run by my brothers and sisters.
0DI0011577	Momma's real popular with the menfolk, both for her money and her looks, which is why there's ten of us kids in total, all by different fathers.
0DI0011578	We're a wild bunch. There's my sister Frieda, who used to run this branch but took off to pursue "the opportunity of a lifetime", as she put it.
0DI0011579	The rest are all long stories, and I don't got the time to tell them.
0DI0011580	I used to be a doctor back in California, but a few years back I got suckered into doing military work because it was my "patriotic duty."
0DI0011581	Back then, I, like many idealistic men before me, thought it was a great idea and was excited about making the world a better place with the NCR.
0DI0011582	Now... I just want to get back home. I've had enough fighting and fixing up soldiers just to send them right back out to die to last a lifetime.
0DI0011583	[SUCCEEDED] Excessive use causes dilated eyes, an increased heart rate and blood pressure, massive sweating, you know... the usual.
0DI0011584	[FAILED] Good god, no. Look, don't worry about symptoms, just ask around and see if anyone has noticed anything suspicious.
0DI0011585	Quite a bit actually. I was stationed nearby during the first battle of Hoover Dam four years ago. I saw a lot of what happened firsthand.
0DI0011586	My take? I try not to think about it, I got enough on my hands here.
0DI0011587	The Legion attacked in full force. Chief Hanlon had the troopers fall back pulling the enemy in, before entrenching into secure positions.
0DI0011588	The Legion got bogged down and Rangers and 1st Recon sharpshooters started taking out the Legion officers.
0DI0011589	They sent their best men to stop the Rangers and 1st Recon, but the Rangers pulled them into a trap at Boulder City and blew them all to hell.
0DI0011590	After that the Legion's forces were in disarray and tried to retreat. However, our forces advanced rapidly and routed them. And that was that.
0DI0011591	You have no idea. It was a fierce battle. Lots of people died.
0DI0011592	Anyone with medical training had their hands full for weeks after the battle was finally over.
0DI0011593	During that time I saw quite a few things I wouldn't mind forgetting about.
0DI0011597	I'm not going to argue with you there. Thanks, I appreciate this.
0DI0011598	Holy shit! How the hell did you find that?
0DI0011599	Look, I can explain everything! Really, just give me a chance to explain!
0DI0011600	I do what now? Uhh... I mean, yeah, I sometimes need to... stretch my legs. Helps me... uh... think.
0DI0011601	[SUCCEEDED] Well... sometimes I sneak into the medical tent at night and "borrow" some of the medical supplies.
0DI0011602	But it's not what you think. I can explain everything. Just hear me out.
0DI0011603	[FAILED] Nothing's going on, so just mind your own business.
0DI0011604	Yeah, nothing strange about a late night stroll. Everybody does it.
0DI0011605	I don't care what you believe. Now unless there's something else, why don't you just buzz off.
0DI0011606	No, I didn't. You might hear that kind of nonsense from a drunk trooper on the Strip, but not from me. The Legion doesn't have Super Mutants.
0DI0011607	That patrol was wiped out by its own incompetence - a couple of the troopers were fooling around with a grenade when it went off.
0DI0011608	Keeping watch on the river and looking for anyone trying to cross it. The Legion likes to send infiltration teams over on rafts.
0DI0011609	Maybe. I'd like to know who I'm dealing with, first.
0DI0011610	My squad was ambushed by a Legion party lead by that bastard Alexus.
0DI0011611	He was taking us into the mine up ahead, but I managed to get away. I need help to get them out.
0DI0011612	That's already more than I was expecting. I'll keep watch to make sure no more Legion come up the road. Good Luck.
0DI0011613	There's a slim chance. But if the Legion wanted us dead, our heads would already be on pikes.
0DI0011614	[SUCCEEDED] I understand. Here's what I have on me. Now go before it's too late.
0DI0011615	[FAILED] This is an emergency. How can you be asking for payment?
0DI0011616	There's no way I can take on the Legion by myself. I'll be here if you change your mind.
0DI0011617	Really? I can't thank you enough. I'll wait here and watch the road. Good luck in there.
0DI0011618	That should only take a few seconds if you've got the caps.
0DI0011619	There you go. Anything else?
0DI0011620	Stitching up lacerations and treating wounds will take some time. I'm going to need caps to get started.
0DI0011621	You look fine to me. I hope this isn't drug-seeking behavior... though I've never seen anyone get addicted to Stimpaks.
0DI0011622	How have you been using the bathroom with your arms that messed up? Oh, forget I asked... phew.
0DI0011623	I'm amazed you managed to limp here with your legs like that.
0DI0011624	I didn't think red, purple, and swollen was your natural eye color. I can fix that right up.
0DI0011625	Did a super mutant use your torso as a punching bag or something? I'm going to need more gauze...
0DI0011626	Okay. This shouldn't take long, but I'm going to need some caps to cover supplies.
0DI0011627	You might want to brace yourself. This might get a bit painful.
0DI0011629	A shot of Med-X for the pain, and you shouldn't feel... well some of what I need to do.
0DI0011631	This could take a while. Did you bring caps?
0DI0011634	Besides the gratitude of the Legion? Don't worry, you'll be paid in coin or caps.
0DI0011635	I prefer to handle these matters through intermediaries such as yourself.
0DI0011636	Good. Martina frequents the Vault 21 Gift Shop, on the Strip. Hurry along, and she still may be in one piece by the time you get there.
0DI0011637	If you have to. I really don't see what there is to consider.
0DI0011638	Made me a special arrangement with the hotel. They want to do business with me, they got to play by my rules.
0DI0011639	Lot of people out there resent success, might wanna take a swipe at me. This makes them think twice.
0DI0011640	If I'd have been thinking, though, I'd have had him watching my boy instead. Then none of this would've happened.
0DI0011641	I don't have that many supplies left, so I can't offer my services freely, but I can help you.
0DI0011642	Well, go somewhere else. You're not welcome here.
0DI0011643	You look fine to me. Well, as fine as anyone else around here.
0DI0011644	I've seen worse, but I should be able to fix you up pretty easily.
0DI0011645	Yeah, that looks pretty nasty.
0DI0011646	This might take a miracle, and a lot of money.
0DI0011647	You and me both, but let's worry about you first. I can fix you up, if you know what I mean.
0DI0011648	Sure can. The sooner the better if you ask me, unless you want a third arm.
0DI0011649	Sorry. I'm low on supplies as it is and I don't have any to spare.
0DI0011650	Okay, now this might hurt a bit...
0DI0011651	Well, let me know if you get some money before that third arm comes in.
0DI0011652	Your loss, not mine. Let me know if your hair starts falling out.
0DI0011653	Thanks, I'll fix you up right away.
0DI0011654	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. Think about that next time you get high.
0DI0011655	Good luck to you then, junkie.
0DI0011656	Excellent, just let me grab my scalpel and a body bag, and we'll get started.
0DI0011658	Okay then. Just try not to bleed all over the place, okay?
0DI0011659	Okay then.
0DI0011660	I don't have any supplies to spare, but I've got caps if you have anything you don't need.
0DI0011661	I don't have any supplies to spare for someone with your spotted reputation, but buy your stuff for half the going rate.
0DI0011662	You have no idea who you're messing with!
0DI0011663	[SUCCEEDED] Shit. Look, we're just following orders. We, uh, need to take this up with the boss.
0DI0011664	[FAILED] Fuck the Legion. The NCR's got troops between us and them.
0DI0011665	Omerta business. Now fuck off, or else.
0DI0011666	Deal.
0DI0011667	Everything your little heart desires, that's what. You like gambling? Boom. Either one of the main hallways has cards, slots, you name it.
0DI0011668	Hungry? Thirsty? The restaurant just off the left-hand hallway has the best food and booze in Vegas.
0DI0011669	Or maybe you'd rather take in a show? The Aces Theater upstairs always has hot acts raring to go. Check it out.
0DI0011670	Relax, baby, they're safe as houses. We'll keep them locked up in the bank upstairs, right next to the money. It's serious protection.
0DI0011671	My orders are to hold Nelson. So far the enemy north of here has been too frightened to move against us. Why should it concern you?
0DI0011672	Not all of us have the luxury of coming and going as we please. Here, we stay put.
0DI0011673	What stalemate? It is Caesar's will that I hold this position - that I not advance.
0DI0011674	If you're so eager to see Camp Forlorn Hope fall, why don't you go attack it all by yourself? Well?
0DI0011675	You have license to go where you please, at my will. True to Caesar.
0DI0011676	I have attacked the enemy. I led the assault on Nelson with two contubernia against twice our number.
0DI0011677	It is Caesar's wish that we hold this position. Our mere presence this side of the Colorado humiliates and demoralizes the enemy.
0DI0011678	I do not question Caesar's will! I do not second-guess!
0DI0011679	I butchered this town. Those who weren't hacked limb from limb were forced to throw themselves from the cliffs. Three more, I have just crucified.
0DI0011680	All this, in full view of the enemy's spotters to the north. Yes, our presence here demoralizes the enemy.
0DI0011681	That remains to be seen.
0DI0011682	You are not my Centurion! You aren't even Legion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
0DI0011684	Even if you are Legion, you are not my Centurion! I do not "carry on" at your command.
0DI0011688	A vow without action is breath across the lips, nothing more. True to Caesar.
0DI0011689	A glorious victory. You must be very satisfied.
0DI0011690	I'll send word of your achievement. Perhaps Caesar will see fit to send another contubernium to occupy the Camp.
0DI0011691	Here - take this, my blade. It was a gift from my Centurion upon the defeat of the Sun Dog tribe.
0DI0011692	Then there's nothing for us to talk about. True to Caesar.
0DI0011694	That blade has split the heads of...  The only reason I give it to you is to force myself to earn another. True to Caesar.
0DI0011695	You don't understand. I'll have to distinguish myself in battle to earn another. True to Caesar.
0DI0011696	You'll get these back on your way out.
0DI0011698	Then get the fuck out of here.
0DI0011700	Okay, I got clothes I can use for that. When you give the word, I'll let the other girls know and we'll meet you at the lobby.
0DI0011701	I'm ready. Just give the word and we'll meet you at the lobby, in an hour.
0DI0011702	It's not a good time right now, hon. It's got to be around midnight.
0DI0011703	We're ready. Let's get the hell out of here before they recognize us.
0DI0011704	Okay. See you soon.
0DI0011705	It's now or never, let's go.
0DI0011706	Whatever you've got to do, do it quick!
0DI0011713	Security, baby. Can't make the bread if the bakers are full of lead, you dig it? Don't worry, you're safe as houses in here, courtesy of Mr. House.
0DI0011714	Them's the breaks. You want in, you don't bring the guns.
0DI0011715	Buddy, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
0DI0011716	Lady, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
0DI0011717	I've been placed in charge of morale. It's difficult trying to keep spirits up with the Legion nearby.
0DI0011718	In fact, there's more hope in wrangling Brahmin with my grandmother's stocking than inspiring these troopers.
0DI0011719	Ironic isn't it?
0DI0011720	But it's understandable. The constant skirmishes take their toll on everyone in the end.
0DI0011721	I'd call that an understatement.
0DI0011722	But I can't complain. I'm not in the field as much as the others. I just stay here most of the day coming up with activities to occupy the camp.
0DI0011723	Which reminds me of something I've been meaning to try. A killer competition to boost morale. Interested?
0DI0011724	Great. Since the camp is threatened by Legion, I propose a hunt. Kill any you encounter and bring me the Legion's ear as proof.
0DI0011725	You get it? Legion ear?
0DI0011726	Come on. Lend me your ear. I bet you'll be good at it.
0DI0011727	Woah boy! This puts you far ahead of everyone else. I think I'll have to declare you the winner of the competition.
0DI0011728	It's not much, but here's a little something I scraped together for the winner of the contest. Good job, you earned it.
0DI0011729	Oh man! Awesome! The competition is still going strong. Keep it up!
0DI0011731	No complaints. My assignment isn't easy but it's vital in keeping the troopers going.
0DI0011732	In fact I have a new idea I'm confident will help morale. But if I told the troopers, it would likely fall on deaf ears.
0DI0011733	I'd have better luck with the Legion's ears. Heh, get it? Legion ears?
0DI0011734	Haven't started it yet. Are you interested to hear about it now?
0DI0011735	You ready to participate?
0DI0011736	About the shortage of Hydra right? We all have our own ways to deal with this place. Me, I sometimes walk at night. Calms the nerves.
0DI0011737	I think Private Stone does the same thing.
0DI0011740	Yeah it was a crazy idea. Did you need anything else?
0DI0011741	The best it's been since the camp started. All because of you. So thanks, buddy!
0DI0011742	It's showing improvement. Troopers aren't showing up late to their posts anymore.
0DI0011743	Lower than a Feral Ghoul's IQ.
0DI0011744	I sometimes see him wandering around the camp. Though he seems to need more time to himself. His cot's still empty when I return after midnight.
0DI0011746	Glad to help.
0DI0011747	Okay, what level of care do you require?
0DI0011749	Hey, no one but Omertas are allowed to carry guns into Gomorrah! Check your weapons with me.
0DI0011750	Welcome back to Gomorrah. I know you're good for it, but you're still gonna have to leave your weapons with me.
0DI0011751	[SUCCEEDED] Very well... five times your delivery bonus - not one cap more.
0DI0011752	[FAILED] Is that an attempt at... humor?
0DI0011753	I've always taken business negotiations seriously. I advise you to do the same.
0DI0011754	You can't - but the Chip can. The hatch will recognize the Platinum Chip and "open sesame."
0DI0011755	You'll need a disguise, then. Or overwhelming firepower. Whatever works.
0DI0011756	Sorry for the inconvenience, but it can't be helped. This is too important.
0DI0011757	Then look harder.
0DI0011758	I don't employ you to uncover evidence. This isn't a court of law.
0DI0011759	If the Omertas pose a threat to the physical or economic security of the Vegas Strip, I want you to do whatever it takes to neutralize that threat.
0DI0011760	Well done. They won't be causing any trouble, then.
0DI0011761	The Legion has nothing left to wait for. Their assault on the dam could begin at any moment.
0DI0011762	Before that happens, I'll ask you to complete one other task. It may seem trivial, but that's far from the case.
0DI0011763	Well done. The Boomers' firepower may prove an advantage when the battle for Hoover Dam comes around.
0DI0011764	It seems diplomacy is not your forte.
0DI0011765	Given the strength of your past performance, I think we can let this go without further comment. I'm pulling you on to a new assignment.
0DI0011766	There's more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes. Or went, that is - cats being extinct.
0DI0011767	I don't promote political assassination as a first option, but it has a long and storied history. I'll consider the Boomers neutralized.
0DI0011768	Singlehandedly destroying a Brotherhood of Steel bunker is quite an accomplishment. Platoons of NCR troops have died, trying to do the same.
0DI0011769	This welcome news comes just in time, as events in the wider world are coming to a head...
0DI0011770	Not surprising. Also not acceptable.
0DI0011771	I didn't ask you to tell me what they were planning, I asked you to kill them. This was a waste of time.
0DI0011772	Go back to the bunker and destroy it. My directions have been clear from the start.
0DI0011773	This is no time to be droll...
0DI0011774	Your "accident" has jeopardized the success of this entire concern.
0DI0011775	Up to this point, your efforts yielded near-perfect results. But now I'm forced to fumble in the dark - to gamble.
0DI0011776	Light must be brought to this darkness.
0DI0011777	Your impulsivity has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
0DI0011778	Your incompetence has jeopardized the success of this entire concern!
0DI0011779	Every step of my plan has been precisely calculated and was, until now, well-executed.
0DI0011780	I'll be happy to satisfy your every curiosity once the Platinum Chip has been delivered.
0DI0011781	This is not the time for Q&A. Kindly hand over the Chip.
0DI0011782	Fine - give me the Chip, and I'll pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
0DI0011783	How do you suggest Santiago does this?
0DI0011784	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. We need you to hunt down another person.
0DI0011785	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
0DI0011786	No one steals from the Garret Twins! If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
0DI0011787	I don't care how you handled those lumps of human refuse, but you got the job done. For helping us out, we would like to set you up with a room.
0DI0011788	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's.
0DI0011789	Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
0DI0011796	I'm sorry, but I can't give you meds for nothing. There are too many people who need these supplies.
0DI0011798	Like I always say, a polite society is an armed society.
0DI0011799	Caesar has taught us that over-reliance on firearms can only weaken us in the long run. It's why we train heavily with our blades and our fists.
0DI0011800	Unlike an NCR trooper, a Legionary is always ready to fight regardless of the circumstance he finds himself in.
0DI0011801	We're property. If you're too young or too old, the men usually leave you alone. Usually.
0DI0011803	You ought to be careful, yourself. I overheard some of the Legionaries talking about "trying you out."
0DI0011804	I suppose you have a few questions.
0DI0011805	Their commander is down! Kill the rest!
0DI0011806	I trust you find everything acceptable?
0DI0011807	Everything seems to be in order. Caesar will not soon forget this.
0DI0011808	No, I imagine he won't.
0DI0011809	They're taking an awfully long time inspecting the weapons. I'm beginning to think they're doing it just to unnerve us.
0DI0011810	Don't let them rattle you, though. The deal's almost done. There's just one last piece of business left.
0DI0011811	Speaking of which, I need you to listen to me very carefully. Things are about to get a little crazy. When I give the signal, follow my lead, okay?
0DI0011812	It's a trap! Fall back!
0DI0011813	Mmm. Yes. He was none too pleased when he discovered who we took. The boy is in the freezer, back through the kitchen.
0DI0011814	The dumpster? That's filthy!
0DI0011815	I can't tell you how much that turns me on. Takes me back to my youth when I used to fool around with the help at our estate.
0DI0011816	I shouldn't... but... it's been so long. And when is this ever gonna happen to me again? Okay, you're on. Don't keep me waiting, gorgeous.
0DI0011817	Yeah? What about?
0DI0011818	It's been stiff lately. Since I was attacked I've been afraid to sleep in my bed. I know it's irrational.
0DI0011819	Now I can't hardly sleep at all. I just nod off from time to time. I'm so tired.
0DI0011820	Oh that feels nice. I can already feel myself rela...
0DI0011821	Really? Is that some kind of ancient Chinese secret or something? Well, what the hell. I'll try anything once. Here goes...
0DI0011822	Ouch! What the hell? I don't think that did any-
0DI0011823	Are they back?
0DI0011825	That obvious, huh? Yeah I'm not from around here. But where I'm from, they don't want me, so that's just as well.
0DI0011826	Really with my reputation, there aren't many places I can go that'll have me. My own family's blackballed me, and they've got a lot of clout.
0DI0011828	Oh, sure. That's all I need. Someone telling people around here about my reputation. I'll be run out of here before dawn. Forget it.
0DI0011829	I've heard of them. Ultra-Luxe, right? Yeah, that'd be a step in the right direction. They'd never have me, though.
0DI0011830	Yeah? Okay, maybe I will. Hell, anything's better than this. Thanks.
0DI0011831	Splendid, splendid. The boy is being held in the kitchen beneath the Gourmand. Here are some keys that will allow you access to him.
0DI0011832	The elder Gunderson is staying in our penthouse. I understand he's hired security, so be careful if you go up there.
0DI0011833	And our Mr. St. Clair resides to the north. He rarely strays far from his house, and he's surrounded it with booby traps.
0DI0011834	Not this one. Empty. I don't believe it's seen use since before the war.
0DI0011835	And what would the point be, really? Who would pick up his trash if he used it?
0DI0011836	But for our purposes, it should keep his body safe and hidden until my cohorts can recover it.
0DI0011837	Just as I asked. What a magnificent relief! By now, barring any more bungling, my underlings should have him on his way here.
0DI0011838	Of his own volition? My goodness, you are very professional, aren't you? Well, he's sure to be a hit at our next banquet.
0DI0011839	Drat! He was our best chance at a fresh and healthy entree.
0DI0011840	Without a replacement, I'll have to push back the whole affair. I can just see my rivals sneering at me.
0DI0011841	What about Joana?
0DI0011842	She'll have to go disguised. Gomorrah's packed around midnight and the bouncers won't notice just another patron leaving the joint.
0DI0011843	I'll be near the entrance but I need to keep out of sight. The Omertas have contacts, and they're still looking for me.
0DI0011844	All right! See you soon.
0DI0011846	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, uh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
0DI0011848	I take care of my debts. How can I repay you, friend?
0DI0011850	Are you leaving... just like that?
0DI0011851	Okay, friend, I hope to see you again, far away from this place.
0DI0011852	Really, you're one of a kind.
0DI0011854	[SUCCEEDED] We have a deal, then.
0DI0011856	[FAILED] No deal, we agreed on less than that.
0DI0011858	What, you think I can just waltz in there and take her away? She's their doll now, okay?
0DI0011859	Besides, I step in Gomorrah and I'm as good as dead, you hear? You don't just leave the Omertas unless it's in a body bag.
0DI0011860	Whose doesn't, huh? Look, see Joana safely to Freeside and you'll cash in this favor, big time.
0DI0011861	Deal! Come back with news soon, you hear?
0DI0011862	No... Joana! It can't be! She didn't deserve this, she didn't, you hear?
0DI0011863	It should've been me, not her... They will pay, right now! Out of my way!
0DI0011864	What mission, what are you talking about?
0DI0011865	Surrender. You don't seriously think that you can take on my crew, do you?
0DI0011866	Profit? What sort of profit do you have in mind that would compensate for your lives.
0DI0011869	[SUCCEEDED] All the dough!? Cachino once said this traitor flipped with thousands off the record. But, why wasn't I informed?
0DI0011870	[SUCCEEDED] I see, yeah... he knows what we usually do to traitors. But all that profit is well worth sparing his miserable life.
0DI0011871	Okay, carry on. And, we've never been here, you understand? Boss doesn't need to know about this.
0DI0011872	[FAILED] You think me a fool? We wouldn't hire an outsider to deal with a traitor.
0DI0011876	[SUCCEEDED] They're not... are they? Okay, I'll deal with them later, after I deal with you by myself!
0DI0011877	[SUCCEEDED] I... I've got to make sure our boss hears about this! Otherwise you'd be dead.
0DI0011878	[FAILED] Time to die!
0DI0011880	[SUCCEEDED] That much, huh? You're right, we could use a tribute to our... I mean, our family's coffers.
0DI0011882	[FAILED] Sorry, no deal. Our loyalty to the family is not for sale.
0DI0011885	[FAILED] Do you think us inferior men, willing to sell their soul for scraps! Enough of this.
0DI0011887	Hahaha! Yeeeehaw! Now, that's something I thought I'd never hear.
0DI0011888	All right, I'm going to get Ethel far away from this damned city and head back home. There's a worthy life waiting for us there.
0DI0011889	People like Heck are rotten, kid, plenty of them in the Wasteland. They'll shoot you, kidnap your family, or drive NCR troops through your lands.
0DI0011890	Whatever it takes to step over us honest folk is good enough in their book. Heck has bought NCR senators left and right, and then is even worse.
0DI0011891	You have? What are you waiting for, kid? Spill the beans!
0DI0011893	This deserves a good compensation, kid. How does that sound?
0DI0011894	Good work. I'm sorry that stupid mail-order cowboy ended like that but his father's misery makes it well worthy.
0DI0011896	Both Gundersons, gone? I'll be damned, you are one of a kind!
0DI0011898	[SUCCEEDED] You'll leave me drier than tumbleweed, kid, but I reckon anything I can do to get back at Heck is well worth the expense.
0DI0011899	I'm a man of my word. Here's your money. You've earned it.
0DI0011900	[FAILED] Cut that in half and we got a clean deal, kid.
0DI0011902	You don't want anything in return? That's rare in these times, got to say.
0DI0011903	All right, kid! I appreciate it. I hope to see you soon.
0DI0011923	That's what we said. So, do we have a deal?
0DI0011927	I don't have time to explain now. Just do as you're told and we'll all be rich.
0DI0011928	That's what I like about you. You follow orders, for the most part. Just remember to wait for the signal.
0DI0011929	Not if we don't screw this up. I'm counting on you to do your part. Just wait for the signal. You'll know what to do.
0DI0011930	You're welcome here any time.
0DI0011931	We made a lot of money, that's what. The Legion paid us to deliver weapons, and the NCR paid us to deliver the Legion. Or some of them, anyway.
0DI0011932	Oh, I do. They're a bunch of corrupt, bullying fools who think they can tell everyone how to live their lives, and my family's fought them for years.
0DI0011933	But that's just it. Do you know how large the NCR army is? If they wanted to, they could have beaten us a dozen times over.
0DI0011934	Do you know why they haven't? Money. Every time things have gotten too tense, we've paid them off and laid low for a while.
0DI0011935	They're an enemy we can live with. This Caesar, on the other hand, is a different animal.
0DI0011936	We've heard reports for years from our agents to the east. He doesn't tolerate his enemies, he makes examples of them.
0DI0011937	And he doesn't have friends. Only servants. And the Van Graffs serve no one but themselves.
0DI0011938	Given that, the choice was rather simple.
0DI0011939	Caesar has been making overtures to prominent suppliers for some time now. Usually, they're too scared of him to cross him and just pay or flee.
0DI0011940	I saw an opportunity and negotiated a deal with the NCR - I help draw some of their enemy's troops into a trap and they agree to buy from me.
0DI0011941	Normally, those stuck-up bastards wouldn't have anything to do with us, but their situation is precarious, and this chance was too tempting.
0DI0011942	Well... not exactly. The deal wasn't exactly sanctioned by my mother, but she'll come around when she hears about the profit I made.
0DI0011943	If she's smart, and she is, believe me, she'll turn this to her own advantage and make a bundle off our new "connections" in the NCR.
0DI0011944	Hardly. They've got a lot of soldiers, and slaves. But they don't come close to having the amount of wealth the NCR has.
0DI0011945	When I said we were going to be rich, I meant it. The deal I brokered with the NCR netted me fives times what Caesar paid.
0DI0011946	Keeping Caesar's money was just a bonus.
0DI0011947	It'll be all I can do to supply the NCR with the amount of weapons they want, so I'll be pretty busy for the foreseeable future.
0DI0011948	Oh, you're probably wondering if you still have a job! I don't have anything open at the moment, sadly.
0DI0011949	But we're going to need all the help we can get transporting guns to the NCR, so stop by every now and then and I might have a delivery job for you.
0DI0011950	And before I forget, here's your share of the take from the warehouse job. You can keep the armor. Thanks again for all your help.
0DI0011951	Wait... what? Why would he do that?
0DI0011952	Whatever the Chief had in mind, I'm sure it was the right thing to do - even if it did end up scaring a lot of people in the process.
0DI0011953	The Chief should've known that the NCR is too stubborn to back down from anything, even when it's for the best.
0DI0011954	While I'm glad it wasn't an enemy who was spreading lies and killing morale, I'm disappointed that a legend like the Chief felt he had to do it.
0DI0011955	Dirty job, but I'm glad you did it. I'm not authorized to reward contract pay, but here's a little something for you.
0DI0011956	And I'll let everyone know you did the right thing. Some people might not like it, but no one who matters. At least not as far as I'm concerned.
0DI0011957	I have to admit, I didn't think you could do it. Guess that makes me the sap and you the hero.
0DI0011958	I'm not authorized to pay for contract work, but here's something for the effort. And I'll make sure everyone hears about what you did. Thanks.
0DI0011959	Then head back down into that camp and deal with the hostages.
0DI0011961	Hey, hold on. Just so you know, if you go down into that camp, one of two things is gonna happen.
0DI0011962	Either that little head of yours is gonna sail into the Colorado courtesy of a Legion machete or they're gonna try to make friends with you.
0DI0011963	And if I find out you're friends with the Legion, I'll put a lump of lead through your skull soon as you pop it back up over the ridge. Are we clear?
0DI0011964	This should have you cleaned up in no time.
0DI0011965	This should help with the pain.
0DI0011966	This should flush those rads out quickly.
0DI0011967	Yeah, Clanden will be hard to replace but not impossible. We'll find contractors just like him without breaking a sweat.
0DI0011968	[SUCCEEDED] Are you shitting me? You didn't even know what the plan was? Yeah, as a last request I guess we can give you that courtesy.
0DI0011969	[FAILED] Sorry, but you're going to have to die ignorant.
0DI0011970	Caesar asked us to provide a distraction on the Strip. So when he gives the word we're going to launch an all out assault on the Strip.
0DI0011971	First we're going to blow the Embassy, then we're going to use soldiers to kill every last motherfucker on the Strip. Then we'll run this joint.
0DI0011972	That'll teach Not-At-Home what can go on while he sits in his fucking ivory tower lording down from on high.
0DI0011973	Okay, lay down and I'll take care of you.
0DI0011974	All right, honey. What do you want to know?
0DI0011975	Stay for a while, hon. Jump in bed and let me do the rest.
0DI0011977	Imagine that! What's his name and when's he start?
0DI0011978	A she, huh? Well... I guess the customer who made that request can't get everything he wants.
0DI0011979	Hell, who knows? He might not even notice the difference.
0DI0011988	The tribe calling themselves the Boomers is obsessed with such weapons, I've been told. You can probably find a spare firing mechanism there.
0DI0011989	The trader, Dale Barton, salvaged it from a military base in Arizona. Yuma, I believe.
0DI0011990	The best marksman of the NCR are usually at the rear of any battle. The gun will allow us to strike at them.
0DI0011991	Non-alcoholic beverages and snack foods. The casinos get to sell booze. No one else does.
0DI0011992	Take your pick.
0DI0011993	Of course! I've got a special discount for special people, like you.
0DI0011994	A friend of The Strip's a friend of mine.
0DI0011995	Don't get me wrong, I appreciate your business, but dealing with you carries extra costs.
0DI0011996	I'll sell to you, if only to get you out of sight as soon as possible.
0DI0011997	It's the most amazing place in the world, don't you think? This must be what it was like to live a thousand years ago!
0DI0011998	There are three casinos open for business - Gomorrah, The Tops, and the Ultra-Luxe. They get nicer in that order.
0DI0011999	This here's the monorail station leading in from Camp McCarran. Most of my business is with soldiers coming and going on furlough.
0DI0012001	See you soon, friend!
0DI0012002	Yeah, don't cause me any trouble, okay?
0DI0012003	Follow me, hon.
0DI0012004	And who would that be?
0DI0012005	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch? Fine. At least he'll have to shut up occasionally.
0DI0012006	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
0DI0012009	Those pretty lips of his are going to see more traffiic than a Brahmin trail in low summer!
0DI0012015	That honey-mouthed sonofabitch owes me a scad of caps! He'll feel like a Brahmin hitching post by the time he's worked off his debt!
0DI0012022	Bill Ronte installed that pump a few years ago, back when he was sober. It was a major improvement for the community.
0DI0012023	But lately The Kings have started charging locals to use it - and NCR squatters twice as much. That'll come to no good.
0DI0012024	They've been Freeside's gang for the past five years or so, ever since Mr. House and his Three Families pushed everyone else out of Vegas.
0DI0012025	They've done a lot of good for the community - but that seems to be changing. The flood of NCR squatters has been an affront to them.
0DI0012026	I guess that explains the situation with the water pump. Usually The King wouldn't let his crew bully folks around like that.
0DI0012027	I know they sell a lot of guns - as if that's what Freeside needs. I hear Mick handles the guns. No idea what Ralph does.
0DI0012028	Oh, them. They sell energy weapons, which are very popular with better-heeled prospectors looking to explore the wastes.
0DI0012029	Stay clear of them. Brother and sister are both psychopaths, though at least Gloria is rational. Jean-Baptiste likes killing.
0DI0012030	A den of iniquity. The Garrets do more than their share to keep the locals drunk or high enough to stay lazy.
0DI0012031	Their thugs, on the other hand, they keep wired on chems to stay dangerous. What is it with Freeside and brother-sister psychopath teams?
0DI0012032	All right. What did you want to know?
0DI0012034	If you haven't heard of The King, you must have been living under a rock or something.
0DI0012035	The King has his boys all over Freeside. He controls the water pump and is essentially the go-to guy for what goes around here.
0DI0012036	They are the local energy weapon dealers in Freeside. When it comes to lasers and plasma, they're the only game in town and they keep it that way.
0DI0012037	Gloria's men are the best armed in Freeside and ruthless to boot, but her brother, Jean-Baptiste Cutting, puts them all to shame.
0DI0012038	Their joint is the only place in Freeside to get it all under one roof. They've got gambling, booze, chems, and whores.
0DI0012039	They're good folks, just don't cross them. They're known for tidying up loose ends with a bullet to the brain box.
0DI0012040	Hadrian, the insult comic! "Did I stutter, fucktard?
0DI0012041	See, I'm using insults to promote the act. That was my idea!
0DI0012042	One-liners! The epi-tome of comedy! Little nuggets of hilarity irresistibly bringing forth laughter!
0DI0012043	You know, like "is that your face, or is a bowl of puke stuck in your collar?" I tell you, you gotta see this show!
0DI0012044	At the coolest, hippest, swinging-est joint on the Strip, that's where! The Tops, baby - don't miss it!
0DI0012045	No need to be rude, pal. Just trying to bring the joy of entertainment into your life!
0DI0012046	Way I hear it, he's some whack job who used to spend his nights sitting around a campfire and howling to himself.
0DI0012047	"Who wants to hear songs that make you wanna cry?" I try to tell them. But hey, they don't pay me to ask questions.
0DI0012048	Do me a favor - go see the show. Otherwise they'll think I didn't do my job.
0DI0012049	A velvety-voiced cool cat fresh out of New Reno, that's who! When Bruce sings, his smokey, dulcet tones will transport you to another world!
0DI0012050	The Tops casino, my friend! If you're in the mood to knock back a few and frolic the night away, ain't no better place on Earth!
0DI0012051	This will help with the pain.
0DI0012052	Yeah, they were here a while ago. Gave them all I could, which wasn't much. But as many problems as we're having here, I know they've got it worse.
0DI0012053	I've seen soldiers get assigned there. It's like they got told they were gonna die. I wouldn't wish it on anybody.
0DI0012054	If you're trying to track them down, we put a GPS marker in the supply crate. You can track it with your Pip-Boy. Good luck.
0DI0012055	You've done the right thing, citizen. Reporting struggles, scuffles, and tussles is the civic duty of every man, woman, and child.
0DI0012056	Thanks to you, we can all sleep in our beds a little sounder, knowing that swift justice awaits those who take moral shortcuts for personal gain.
0DI0012057	Rest assured, I will apprehend the perpetrator and see him or her punished. Even though, in some ways, evil is its own punishment.
0DI0012058	Ah, yes, I've heard that one too. Jealous people say such nasty things. I feel sorry for them.
0DI0012059	Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
0DI0012060	[SUCCEEDED] Good. Then you know what it is to be discreet in matters of... nutrition. Perhaps you can help me.
0DI0012061	[FAILED] Please, you're embarrassing yourself. I must request that you change the subject.
0DI0012062	I can assure you that the only thing the White Glove Society is guilty of is preparing the tastiest cuisine you'll ever sample.
0DI0012063	That is, of course, if you can afford it.
0DI0012064	Indeed. Let's.
0DI0012065	No, not from the likes of you, I'm afraid. I don't think you'd have the stomach for it. Better look elsewhere.
0DI0012066	I do, but I need someone I know I can rely on. And I haven't heard a thing about you.
0DI0012067	Perhaps if you made more of a name for yourself around the Strip, we could talk. But not before.
0DI0012068	Yes, I'm glad you asked. I've heard about you, you know. You strike me as just the sort of person who can help me.
0DI0012069	I'm in a bind. I've been planning an exquisite Society dinner, but there's a bit of a problem with the main course.
0DI0012070	He's got a powerful and temperamental father.
0DI0012071	Yes. The wrong person. We scouted the right one for weeks. The heir to a mercantile empire. Sort of a black sheep.
0DI0012072	He cut ties with his family and left their estate to wander. He was ideal. Corn-fed and well-to-do, but no one to miss him if he were to disappear.
0DI0012073	Unfortunately the trap my subordinates set for him failed. And as he escaped, he saw their faces. Now he's wary.
0DI0012074	You barbarous cur.
0DI0012075	Perhaps I do. Forget I mentioned it.
0DI0012076	I asked for a last-minute replacement. And they stole the son of the most dangerous Brahmin baron in New Vegas while he stayed at this very hotel.
0DI0012077	Needless to say, this could be a disaster if things aren't put back the way they should be. And I still need somebody reputable to serve for dinner.
0DI0012078	Strictly speaking, we're no longer allowed to eat people. But I'm hoping the right person and preparation might sway Marjorie to see things my way.
0DI0012079	I need a replacement, and I need the boy taken care of. The replacement must be healthy and well-bred. One can't very well make steak from gristle.
0DI0012080	With so little time, we'll have go after our original choice, Carlyle St. Clair. He lives in a shack north of here. For freshness, we need him alive.
0DI0012081	If you could send him here or knock him out with this and drag him into the dumpster next to his house, we can do the rest.
0DI0012082	Ted Gunderson is his name. It would be simplest if you could convince him this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding.
0DI0012083	But if he won't listen, we can't very well let him go. He'll have to be slaughtered and served. Then we wouldn't need the replacement.
0DI0012084	But you would need to deal with his father, Heck. Perhaps if you could smear some of Ted's blood around his father's hotel room, you could frame him.
0DI0012088	Very well, but I'll need to know soon or I'll be forced to make other plans.
0DI0012089	Which one?
0DI0012090	Hmm. He's a little thin, but he looks like he comes from good stock with that strong jaw and upright posture.
0DI0012091	Perhaps a little rugged, a little gamey. But he is in good shape and looks healthy.
0DI0012092	From the smell of her I'd say we can skip the whiskey marinade. But other than her liver she seems to be in working order.
0DI0012093	Her skin has a certain supple quality to it, doesn't it? She's kept it well. How mouth-watering.
0DI0012094	I'm sorry, but it absolutely must be a human. Former doesn't count.
0DI0012095	I assume you're joking.
0DI0012096	Very well. If you're able to convince young Mr. Gunderson to return to his father, replace him in the freezer with your friend and we'll have a deal.
0DI0012097	So the baron has slaughtered his last Brahmin. How delightful. He was a pox on our business.
0DI0012098	He would've driven the price of beef down to the point where any poor wretch could afford it. Can you imagine?
0DI0012099	But now we can price it even higher, create a new luxury market. Not for you, of course. You'll get a special discount.
0DI0012100	We'll know after tonight's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
0DI0012101	That way, they will all have crossed the same silly taboo. They'll have to reconsider it. Even Marjorie.
0DI0012102	It's all image with her, anyway. She just needs to realize the only difference between savage and sophisticated is the proper seasoning.
0DI0012103	We'll know after tomorrow night's banquet at 7 o'clock. I'll only be telling everyone what they've eaten after they've eaten it.
0DI0012106	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the Gunderson boy.
0DI0012107	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of the late Mr. St. Clair.
0DI0012108	I certainly did. Philippe created an extraordinary amuse bouche from the flesh of your former travel partner.
0DI0012109	Everyone at the banquet loved it! I told them what it was and the room was quiet for a moment, but then we all had a hearty laugh.
0DI0012110	I see. Keep me in the know.
0DI0012111	You have done very well in keeping this business low-key. I appreciate your discretion. I'll be sure to drop your name during our functions.
0DI0012112	I hope you understand what a tremendous boon this will be to your standing in society.
0DI0012113	Good. Having his father's attention cast upon me was the last thing I needed.
0DI0012114	Now if you can lure Mr. St. Clair out of his home and into captivity, and he's still disease-free, I shall breathe a sigh of relief.
0DI0012115	I see. Well this could get out of hand very quickly unless something is done to keep the elder Gunderson in check.
0DI0012116	You mustn't kill him, though. The publicity would be a disaster. I need you to handle this quietly, like we discussed.
0DI0012117	A little blood in his suite should do the trick. And if you have a Securitron arrest him, our involvement will appear nonexistent.
0DI0012118	No. Everyone he meets, he tells the same story. That his son disappeared from the casino, not from his room. He'll look guilty.
0DI0012119	You made it past his guards, then? Excellent. Send a Securitron up to his room. It's programmed to investigate anything suspicious.
0DI0012120	[SUCCEEDED] My daddy's got a lot of enemies. It don't make no sense that the White Pants Society would kidnap me. He's here to do business with them.
0DI0012121	Well, you got a point. But if you don't know who it is, my daddy's gonna be awful mad he ain't got anyone to shoot over this.
0DI0012122	All right. Let's get out of here.
0DI0012123	[FAILED] Who gives a rat's patoot if they're sorry? Sorry's what they'll be when they're strung up and lynched by my daddy's posse.
0DI0012124	These White Knuckles got hell to pay, I'll see to that when I get outta here.
0DI0012125	What did you say...? I mean, Joana sent you?
0DI0012126	Please, tell me! Is she all right? When did you see her? What does she have to say?
0DI0012127	Then she has to know! I'm ready to help her escape, once and for all.
0DI0012128	Why am I even scared of Cachino and all those fuckers? Joana and I are dead anyway if we don't get the hell out of here.
0DI0012129	Dammit! You're going to leave me hanging, huh? Don't know how else I can get her back.
0DI0012130	Until next round.
0DI0012131	Questions can wait, Joana can't.
0DI0012134	Okay, you try that and let me know. How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
0DI0012136	Depends on why you're asking.
0DI0012137	Let's just say it had something to do with the beards, and leave it at that.
0DI0012139	We'll take care of Carlitos, don't worry.
0DI0012140	I see. Well, he can count on Little Beard and me for an assist. Tell us where and when, and we'll be there.
0DI0012141	So you said. All Little Beard and me need to know is the when and where.
0DI0012143	The Beards will be there.
0DI0012144	You saw our front sign, didn't you? This is where all the beautiful signs of the Strip become a reality.
0DI0012145	It all comes from Michael Angelo's imagination. We do a little work here and there too, sure, but he's the real artist.
0DI0012147	Check out the back of the shop, he's usually working there.
0DI0012150	I've been here over a year now. Though I'm not one to get tied for long.
0DI0012151	I plan to roam the Wasteland once I'm ready. The people need light and kindness, there's too much fear and pain out there already.
0DI0012152	Perfect. We're still getting everything together, but I can always find a use for idle hands in the meantime.
0DI0012153	Once we're settled, we'll head out to the rendezvous point.
0DI0012154	That's okay, I still need some time to get everything together. The logistics of an order like this are headache inducing.
0DI0012155	We won't need to head out for a while yet, so stop back when you have the time.
0DI0012156	I thought so. Come back when you've got a backbone.
0DI0012157	Her name's Rose of Sharon Cassidy. That's some fancy shit, right? Don't know what her mother was thinking with a name like that.
0DI0012158	But this girl and I, we need to have a discussion. Find her, bring her here, so I can talk to her, one-on-one.
0DI0012159	Find her, bring her back here so we can talk. Needless to say, there's some good money in it for you.
0DI0012160	You already agreed to take the job, asshole. There's no backing out now.
0DI0012161	<Jean-Baptiste just stares at you.>
0DI0012162	Guess I don't have to worry about talking with her, then. About fucking time. Any longer and I was gonna track you both down.
0DI0012163	Anyway, Glory's been antsy lately because that big deal she's been working on is finally going down.
0DI0012164	If this thing goes down, we'll have it made. Fucking made, I tell you! Talk to her about it. I'm sure she'll want you along.
0DI0012165	And don't think I forgot your pay. A job well done is its own reward, but it doesn't pay for pussy at the local brothel, does it?
0DI0012166	Well work fucking faster. I don't like thinking there's someone out there that hates me more than I hate them.
0DI0012167	Do you have what we requested?
0DI0012168	Don't play games with me. The question was just a formality. Now do you have what we requested?
0DI0012169	I don't think so. My men watched you head straight for this location. Now do you have what we requested?
0DI0012170	We were told there would be no questions. Do you have what we requested or not?
0DI0012171	Ah, then our business is concluded. Tell your superiors that we will contact them shortly.
0DI0012172	I wasn't informed there was to be an exchange on my part. What are you talking about?
0DI0012173	[SUCCEEDED] Such a thing is possible. I've been out in the field for some time. Fine, this should cover your grievance.
0DI0012174	Now, the package, if you will.
0DI0012175	[FAILED] I've heard no such report. I'd have to check with my contacts before agreeing to such an exchange, and there's no time for that.
0DI0012177	Fine, now do you have the package or not?
0DI0012178	That you would have something for me. Now do you or not?
0DI0012179	Maybe, but the situation around here calls for it. You gonna help or not?
0DI0012180	I can spare a few moments, make it quick.
0DI0012181	Things are looking good. With the new resources and support, morale is at the highest it's ever been around here.
0DI0012182	Well, things have been improving lately. More supplies, more troops. We might actually be able to turn things around.
0DI0012183	We're hanging in there. Things wouldn't be so bad if we could actually get some reinforcements or supplies, but we'll just have to survive for now.
0DI0012184	Not good. We still haven't gotten any support from the rest of the NCR and the Legion is kicking our ass right now.
0DI0012185	It's no picnic, I'll tell you that much. My troops are out here every day dying for the NCR, but they've left us out to dry.
0DI0012186	We have no men or supplies and we're stretched too thin trying to guard the entire river.
0DI0012187	If the brass back home could get their heads out of their asses long enough to send support, we could turn this all around.
0DI0012189	We don't have many troops, so we can only attack from one direction. Where should we focus the attack?
0DI0012190	Make it quick, we don't want to lose the element of surprise.
0DI0012191	North it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
0DI0012192	Our main target is the Legion leader at Nelson. Intel has the commander as one Dead Sea. I've uploaded his last known location to your Pip-Boy.
0DI0012193	Let's move out!
0DI0012194	Our main targets are the Legion leaders at Nelson. I've uploaded their last known locations to your Pip-Boy.
0DI0012195	East it is. Reports also say that they might have some NCR hostages. If that's true we need to do what we can to save them. So stay sharp.
0DI0012199	Okay, I admit it, I ain't exactly rolling in caps here, but whaddya want? I'm under contract, I can't get out.
0DI0012200	Eesh... say, you wouldn't happen to have been my manager in a past life, would you? You've got all his money-smarts.
0DI0012201	Heh, good luck. Garret's a tough, mean sonofabitch, he's not likely to give up. Let me know if you make any headway.
0DI0012202	Ain't my mind needs changing, kid, it's Garret's.
0DI0012203	It's great to be here at the Tops, folks. The room I'm in has a lovely little closet. A nail.
0DI0012204	Thank you everybody, you've been a great audience, good night.
0DI0012205	It's hard to sleep in this place, I tell you. Last night some girl was pounding on my door all night. Finally I had to let her out.
0DI0012206	They really care about your privacy here at the Tops. Even room service has an unlisted number!
0DI0012207	My hotel room is so small, when I put the key in the lock, I broke the window!
0DI0012208	How about that suit Benny wears? If I had a suit like that, the ladies would be all over me. What, you expect a punchline? This guy pays my salary!
0DI0012209	I told my wife she was good-looking for a ghoul. It's just too bad she's not a ghoul.
0DI0012210	I love these robots with the friendly little policeman's faces. Sure, they still rough you up, but they look so happy!
0DI0012211	My cousin and his wife are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous.
0DI0012212	I know a guy, his motto is Love Thy Neighbor. He lives next door to a brothel.
0DI0012213	I try to be frank and earnest with women. In New Reno, I'm Frank and in the Boneyard I'm Ernest.
0DI0012214	I've been married for 17 years. Where did I go wrong?
0DI0012215	I've been in love with the same woman for 17 years. If my wife ever finds out, she'll kill me!
0DI0012216	My wife and I know the secret to a happy marriage. Two times a week, we go to a nice restaurant. She goes Mondays, I go Fridays.
0DI0012217	I take my wife everywhere, but somehow she keeps finding her way back.
0DI0012218	I bought my wife a little car here in New Vegas. An Omerta. It has a hood under the hood.
0DI0012219	People say it's hard to survive the Wasteland - how hard can it be, the water glows in the dark!
0DI0012220	So I hear Mr. House runs the Strip. He took it over from the last guy, Mr. Mob-Infested Hellhole.
0DI0012221	I had dinner at the Ultra-Luxe the other night. I told them my steak tasted funny. They said it was a clown.
0DI0012222	I hear James Garret drove 5,000 head of Brahmin to New Reno. No bodies, just the heads.
0DI0012223	A ghoul goes to a doctor and he says "Doctor, Doctor, I have this horrible rash!" The Doctor says "Son, that's called your face."
0DI0012224	It's great to be up here, looking down at all your smiling faces. That won't last long.
0DI0012225	Hey, look at this guy! I didn't know they let Brahmin into this joint!
0DI0012226	Hey, look at this gal! I didn't know they let Brahmin into this joint!
0DI0012227	Hey, look at this guy! Those muscles are unreal - I mean it, they're imaginary!
0DI0012228	Hey, look at this gal! Those muscles are unreal - I mean it, they're imaginary!
0DI0012229	This guy's so sharp-eyed, he cuts himself every time he blinks!
0DI0012230	This gal's so sharp-eyed, she cuts herself every time she blinks!
0DI0012231	I tell ya, you've got great eyes. You could spot a Super mutant at three paces.
0DI0012232	Buddy, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
0DI0012233	Sister, you look tough enough to drink a pint of glowing water. Why don't you do us all a favor and try it?
0DI0012234	Whoa, you don't look too healthy. Maybe you should see a doctor. Or an undertaker.
0DI0012235	I hear you've got a ready wit. Tell me when it's ready.
0DI0012236	My friend, you've got style, grace, and charm - the style of a feral Ghoul, the grace of a Super mutant, and the charm of a Deathclaw.
0DI0012237	Somebody told me the other day you were bright - I wasn't sure if he meant smart, or radioactive.
0DI0012238	The way I hear it, you've got brains to spare. Looks to me like a 7-10 split.
0DI0012239	And talk about your quick reflexes, this guy is so fast he beat me to the punchline.
0DI0012240	And talk about your quick reflexes, this gal is so fast she beat me to the punchline.
0DI0012241	Boy, you're clumsy. You're so clumsy when you slip in the shower, you fall up.
0DI0012242	This guy right here, he's got an angel looking over his shoulder. If I were him, I'd get a restraining order.
0DI0012243	This gal right here, she's got an angel looking over her shoulder. If I were her, I'd get a restraining order.
0DI0012244	You know, some people have all the luck. Some people, not you.
0DI0012245	Was that suit made to order? It was? And where were you at the time?
0DI0012246	If you had your life to live over again, let me make a suggestion: Play in traffic.
0DI0012247	Look at you, you look like a talent scout for a cemetery.
0DI0012248	The more I think of you, the less I think of you.
0DI0012249	How about a hand for the Rad Pack, the band that inspired that great saying, "Stop the music!"
0DI0012250	Swank is here, ladies and gentlemen. Make yourself at home, Swank - hit somebody!
0DI0012251	Now, you see, you should have opened with that. I'll sell you his contract, but it will cost you.
0DI0012252	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose you've got a point. Plenty of Brahmin on the prairie, and all that. Fine, I'll cut him loose. He's all yours.
0DI0012253	[FAILED] That's the stupidest argument I've ever heard. I'm not letting my star performer go without some guarantee of new incomes.
0DI0012254	[SUCCEEDED] I admit that thought had crossed my mind. Maybe you're right - maybe I'd do better with a human act. He's all yours.
0DI0012255	[FAILED] That may be the case, but I can't risk that kind of cash-flow. You'll have to do better than that.
0DI0012256	Ah. I suppose that's a very... compelling negotiating stance. Fine. The contract is yours. I hope you choke on it.
0DI0012257	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I see there's no fooling you in a horse trade. Fine - you've got a deal.
0DI0012258	[FAILED] No, no I don't think you will. The deal is final.
0DI0012260	Take your time - the ghoul's not going anywhere.
0DI0012263	They run the place as a center for all their dirty scams and extortions. Gambling, sex, drugs, they'll use whatever works to exploit your weaknesses.
0DI0012264	Hooker, customer, it doesn't matter. Everyone here's a pawn to the Omertas, playing and dying by their rules.
0DI0012265	Nero's the pack leader and Big Sal's his right hand. What Nero wants, Big Sal does. Then there's... Cachino.
0DI0012266	What? Have you seen him? Have you talked to him?
0DI0012268	I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
0DI0012269	He... does? Wait, this changes everything. I can't leave my girls here... and, where would we go even if we escape?
0DI0012270	No. It's too risky, we'll all end up dead.
0DI0012272	But the Omertas will want us dead. What are we going to do about that?
0DI0012273	Let Carlitos know that we'll be ready when you are.
0DI0012275	[FAILED] I'm not, but questions bore me, hon.
0DI0012276	[SUCCEEDED] I... look, we can't talk here. If you think you can help me, follow me to my room, please.
0DI0012277	[SUCCEEDED] I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
0DI0012278	I'm afraid I won't make it out of here, not without Carlitos. If the Med-X doesn't kill me first, Cachino or another Omerta will.
0DI0012279	Ha, I look pathetic, huh? The great Joana and now... I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
0DI0012281	[SUCCEEDED] I... I didn't think it showed. I guess that it's worse than I thought.
0DI0012284	[SUCCEEDED] You sound so sure. Damn it all, you better not make me regret this later.
0DI0012286	[FAILED] Sorry, I can't risk our lives without more guarantees than that.
0DI0012287	[SUCCEEDED] To be free and with Carlitos again... Tell him that I still, I - never mind.
0DI0012289	Thank you so much for your help.
0DI0012291	He's a filthy monster. I've been with perverted men but Cachino's done things... to me, that -
0DI0012292	Even other Omertas would also want to kill him if they knew what he does. He's broken so many of their rules that I don't know how he still breathes.
0DI0012293	I'm... I don't know what's happening to me. I can't feel a goddamn thing anymore, empty and poisoned like the Wasteland.
0DI0012296	As I told you, Carlitos was the only thing that kept me alive in this place. Now, I just don't know what'll happen.
0DI0012297	He was an Omerta that... fell in love with me. They don't ever mix with people outside the "family," you know?
0DI0012298	He was planning to escape with me but Cachino found out about us. So he did something, talked, I don't know, and Carlitos disappeared.
0DI0012299	Cachino doesn't give a shit about rules, only cares to feed his perversions. He lusted for me, he's done things to me.
0DI0012300	Look... I'm stuck here, I know that. Carlitos is the only thing that kept me going, and now I don't have anything left.
0DI0012302	Damn shame. Anything else I can do for you?
0DI0012303	What? Carlitos is alive? Please, tell him that I still love him, that I want to escape with him... please.
0DI0012304	If he's alive he's long gone. The Omertas want him dead, now.
0DI0012305	If you meet him, anywhere... I'd do anything to get him back and escape this hell, although I'm not keeping my hopes up.
0DI0012306	Hon, nobody's given me a free thing before. What's it going to be for you, caps, sex, straps, what?
0DI0012307	What? Are you... serious? Well, I'm not complaining, hon.
0DI0012309	That sounds good, hon. I hope to see you soon.
0DI0012310	Yes... I know what you want. And I know how to give it to you, right now.
0DI0012313	There were tales once, of a cannibal tribe near Vegas, one that hid itself in a cavern far below ground, hunting men as prey above.
0DI0012314	The scouts I occasionally sent west many years ago reported these tales, but never had contact. Well, except the ones who went missing, perhaps.
0DI0012315	There are rumors that the White Gloves might be this lost tribe. Maybe you can help them find themselves.
0DI0012316	Culture is an odd thing. Sometimes a tribe grows tired of its identity, grabs for an opportunity to reimagine itself.
0DI0012317	The tribe becomes its own antithesis. Everything flips to the opposite polarity.
0DI0012318	Dialectics tells us that this can't last. There has to be a synthesis, a final sorting out.
0DI0012319	I'll hand it to that piece of shit, he was determined. He used some kind of Old-World stealth device to get across the river in a Legion boat.
0DI0012320	Seems the device ran out of juice once he got here, but he was dressed like a Legionary. He was caught just outside the weather station.
0DI0012321	See, thing is, he didn't change his hairstyle. To go through all that effort and fail because you're too vain to muss your hair...
0DI0012322	He was brought before me, along with the Platinum Chip. That's how I knew he wasn't some kind of Profligate infiltrator.
0DI0012323	Benny tried to sell me a story, but Lucius has a way coaxing the truth out of captives. Everything just comes spilling out.
0DI0012324	Do you want my opinion as a former citizen, or future conqueror? Actually, my opinion's the same either way.
0DI0012325	As a young man I was taught to venerate President Tandi of Shady Sands. "The Founding Mother of the New California Republic."
0DI0012326	Did you know her Presidency lasted 52 years? And that her father, Aradesh, was the Republic's first President?
0DI0012327	Does that sound like democracy to you, or a hereditary dictatorship?
0DI0012328	Because the council didn't dare oppose her. She was too popular. She had the people's love.
0DI0012329	So things ran smoothly, more or less. And as soon as she was gone, as soon as there really could be "democracy" - what happened then?
0DI0012330	Ever since losing its queen, the NCR has been weaker, more diffuse. Democracy has been its weakness, not its strength.
0DI0012331	Greed runs rampant. The government is corrupt, accepting bribes from Brahmin barons and landowners, to the detriment of citizens.
0DI0012332	The NCR is a loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves. It's lost virtue. No one cares about the collective, the greater good.
0DI0012333	It's not built to last. I'm just hastening the inevitable.
0DI0012334	Of course. The most powerful my Legion has faced. Also the first to which I am ideologically opposed.
0DI0012335	Until now, every tribe I've conquered has been so backwards and stunted, enslavement has been a gift bestowed upon them.
0DI0012336	My conquest of the Mojave will be a glorious triumph, marking the transition of the Legion from a basically nomadic tribe to a genuine empire.
0DI0012337	Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul before he crossed the Rubicon, so have I campaigned, and will cross the Colorado.
0DI0012338	I know he's a coward, hiding behind an army of robots, ensconced in that tower of his like a wizard in one of those Grognak comic books.
0DI0012339	Some say he's a man, others, a machine. I don't care. He's in the way.
0DI0012340	I know he's dead. I know he's no longer a factor. That's all I need to know.
0DI0012341	Losers don't matter in the history books. He's a fucking footnote.
0DI0012342	I've analyzed the region's tribes to determine how they might be useful. I may tell you more at a later time, if it suits me.
0DI0012343	Here, this document has clear instructions on what to do next.
0DI0012344	Here, these written orders make it plain.
0DI0012345	These written orders will tell you what to do next.
0DI0012346	See Vulpes for details about your next mission.
0DI0012347	For further instructions, see Vulpes.
0DI0012348	Go see Vulpes. He'll brief you.
0DI0012349	Go see Lucius for details about your next mission.
0DI0012350	For further instructions, see Lucius.
0DI0012351	Go see Lucius. He'll brief you.
0DI0012352	Ironically, I was born a Profligate myself, a citizen of the NCR.
0DI0012353	My family lived not far from the great Boneyard. After Raiders killed my father, my mother sought the Followers' protection. I was two years old.
0DI0012354	She found work at their Library, cooking and cleaning. I learned how to read and soon I was taking courses, free of charge.
0DI0012355	Oh yes, raised in that tradition. And the teaching stuck. I was taught it was my responsibility to bring the torch of knowledge to the wastes.
0DI0012356	I may have taken the torch part more literally than they intended.
0DI0012357	When I was 20, the Followers sent me East to Grand Canyon. It was my first expedition, just me and a physician named Calhoun.
0DI0012358	As an anthropologist and linguist, my assignment was to learn the dialects of the Grand Canyon tribes. What a fucking waste of time!
0DI0012359	If you think it's worthwhile to make smart people learn how to talk like backward savages, you're a Follower of the Apocalypse... or an idiot.
0DI0012360	Anyway, we met up with a Mormon missionary who already knew a bunch of dialects - Joshua Graham. He was supposed to teach me.
0DI0012361	But before that went too far, the Blackfoot tribe captured us, to hold us for ransom.
0DI0012362	They were a backward bunch. But the real problem was, they didn't know how to fight.
0DI0012363	The Blackfoot were at war with seven other tribes, each just as pissant as they were. But outnumbered like that, they weren't going to last long.
0DI0012364	It's one thing to be taken hostage, another to be lashed to a sinking ship. So over Calhoun's objections, I decided to take certain steps.
0DI0012365	I taught them how to use the guns they already had - how to strip and clean them, how to breathe when pulling a trigger, how to reload ammunition.
0DI0012366	They looked at me like I was some kind of a sorcerer. So I taught them how to make explosives, and started drilling them on small unit tactics.
0DI0012367	If there's anything I learned as a Follower of the Apocalypse, it's that there's a lot of good information in old books.
0DI0012368	Divide et impera - divide and conquer. I led the Blackfoot against the Ridgers, their weakest enemy.
0DI0012369	When they refused to surrender, I ordered every man, woman, and child killed. When next we surrounded the Kaibabs and they likewise refused...
0DI0012370	I took one of their envoys to the Ridgers' village and showed him the corpse piles.
0DI0012371	This was new for the tribes, you see. They played at war, raiding each other, a little rape and pillage here, a little ransoming there.
0DI0012372	I showed them total warfare. Like I said, there's a lot you can learn from old books.
0DI0012373	The Kaibabs joined me, and the Fredonians after that - all the pissant tribes, with names that should be forgotten.
0DI0012374	I knew from the start I'd need to eradicate this plague of tribal identities, replacing them with a monolithic culture, a uniform identity.
0DI0012375	So that's what I did, once my confederation of tribes was large enough. I crowned myself Caesar and created a single Great Tribe - my Legion.
0DI0012376	I sent Calhoun, the Follower captured with me, back West with a message that I should not be interfered with.
0DI0012377	Joshua Graham, the Mormon interpreter, stayed with me and served as my first Legatus.
0DI0012378	That's right. Decades of warfare, absorbing lesser tribes, gathering power. Forging the dross into a vast, razor-sharp scythe.
0DI0012379	My Legion's expansion has never ceased. Much of the Utah and Colorado, and all of Arizona and New Mexico, are mine.
0DI0012380	We have cities of our own, but nothing compared to Vegas. Finally, my Legion will have its Rome.
0DI0012381	I used imperial Rome as the model for my Legion precisely because it was so foreign, so alien.
0DI0012382	I'd seen what had become of the NCR's attempts to emulate the culture of Pre-War America - the in-fighting, the corruption.
0DI0012383	Rome was a highly militarized autocracy that effectively integrated the foreign cultures it conquered.
0DI0012384	It dedicated its citizens to something higher than themselves - to the idea of Rome itself.
0DI0012385	In Rome I found a template for a society equal to the challenges of the post-apocalyptic world - a society that could and would survive.
0DI0012386	A society that could prevent mankind from fracturing and destroying itself in this new world, by establishing a new Pax Romana.
0DI0012387	It means a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogenous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers.
0DI0012388	Long-term stability at all costs. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war, or production.
0DI0012389	No, I'll destroy it because it's inevitable that it be destroyed. It's Hegelian Dialectics, not personal animosity.
0DI0012390	How do I put this basically enough? It's a philosophical theory, the kind you might encounter if you took time to read some books.
0DI0012391	The fundamental premise is to envision history as a sequence of "dialectical" conflicts. Each dialectic begins with a proposition, a thesis...
0DI0012392	...which inherently contains, or creates, its opposite - an antithesis. Thesis and antithesis. The conflict is inevitable.
0DI0012393	But the resolution of the conflict yields something new - a synthesis - eliminating the flaws in each, leaving behind common elements and ideas.
0DI0012394	The bombs wiped the slate clean. Human civilization descended to a level of ignorance that effectively set our cultural progress back to zero.
0DI0012395	The NCR has all of the problems of the ancient Roman Republic - extreme bureaucracy, corruption, extensive senatorial infighting.
0DI0012396	Just as with the ancient Republic, it is natural that a military force should conquer and transform the NCR into a military dictatorship.
0DI0012397	Thesis and antithesis. The Colorado River is my Rubicon. The NCR council will be eradicated, but the new synthesis will change the Legion as well...
0DI0012398	...from a basically nomadic army to a standing military force that protects its citizens, and the power of its dictator.
0DI0012400	Sorry, it's not my business to get involved.
0DI0012401	All right. At Gomorrah, the bar is always open.
0DI0012402	Oh did you now? What business is that of yours, and why the fuck should I care?
0DI0012403	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, already? I figured it would be a couple days. Well, let's go meet the lucky lady.
0DI0012404	[FAILED] I don't care much about your tastes. Get lost and leave me alone.
0DI0012405	Well, look at you! It's so rare I get a volunteer. Yes, let's head to my special room. Follow me, we'll talk there.
0DI0012406	Alright, but you're starting to get on my nerves.
0DI0012408	I think I should kill you before you have a chance to show those tapes to anyone. What do I have to lose?
0DI0012409	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, give me the tapes and I'll leave.
0DI0012410	I'm going a long way away from Vegas, but you better hope that you and I never see each other again.
0DI0012411	[FAILED] Sorry, but there's no fucking way I'm going anywhere if those tapes aren't with me.
0DI0012412	I guess you've made your choice then. Time to die.
0DI0012413	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, confident. I like that.
0DI0012414	So, what do you want to do with what you've got?
0DI0012415	[FAILED] Haha, not too bright, huh? It takes caps, honey, lots of them.
0DI0012419	You'd best hold your tongue... friend, or someone here will take care of it, for good.
0DI0012420	What do you want to know about those sons of bitches?
0DI0012421	I'll see you soon, I'm sure.
0DI0012427	[FAILED] Honey, I've had better than just "good." And you were being so amusing...
0DI0012428	Okay, we can have more fun together, but it's not going to be free, hon.
0DI0012429	[SUCCEEDED] Oh my, aren't you something else...!? I guess you'll have to see for yourself what I can do, huh?
0DI0012430	Consider it "on the house," honey.
0DI0012433	Fine. Are you ready?
0DI0012434	Well... ladies are always a welcome change.
0DI0012438	Oh, nothing special, hon. I'm the best lay in Gomorrah, and that's all you need to know.
0DI0012439	I like that you're here, doesn't that make you happy?
0DI0012440	It's your paradise on this desolate earth, hon. Your troubles are gone, your pain forgotten, and your dreams come true.
0DI0012441	Everyone wants a piece of their own personal heaven. So, they come here, for hours... and hours, hon.
0DI0012442	Military men, NCR ranchers, wandering travelers... they're all the same without their clothes on. What they want, the Omertas provide.
0DI0012443	So you've followed the call of your desires... all the way to the arms of Joana, moi. Now that you've found me, I wonder, do you have what it takes?
0DI0012448	Look, I can't right now. I just want to leave this place and be with Carlitos.
0DI0012449	Our terms were clear. Now that you have the Chip in your possession, any attempt to "re-negotiate" payment would be tantamount to blackmail.
0DI0012450	Hmm... How shall I put this?
0DI0012451	Delivery of the Platinum Chip is non-negotiable.
0DI0012452	I invite you to think carefully about what you do next... standing alone before me, surrounded by my heavily-armed Securitron guards.
0DI0012453	By the time I was 30 years old, I was a billionaire 30 times over. I founded and ran a vast economic empire.
0DI0012454	Do you really think I'm going to let an upstart come into my home and ransom my property to me?
0DI0012455	I spent two centuries searching for the Platinum Chip. It's my invention, my property - mine. Now be a good courier and deliver it!
0DI0012456	Why, thank you so much. You played that very poorly, you realize?
0DI0012457	You're fortunate that I have a certain tolerance for greed. I expect my business partners to be self-interested - but smartly so.
0DI0012458	You needn't be afraid of me. It's my Securitrons that are going to kill you.
0DI0012459	Not if you've been invited. You realize that you've made quite a splash here in New Vegas?
0DI0012460	I can predict with a high degree of confidence that you'll receive an official summons from Caesar. If you haven't already, that is.
0DI0012461	I want you to open a hatch in the basement of the derelict weather station atop Fortification Hill.
0DI0012462	You'll recognize it on sight. The hatch bears the logo of the Lucky 38, same as the Platinum Chip.
0DI0012463	I'm not surprised. The Legion has spies on the Strip.
0DI0012464	You have? So you have the means to gain entry?
0DI0012465	If you find Caesar's Legion so frightening at this remove, imagine them rampaging across the Strip.
0DI0012466	We have a chance to see them detroyed, to see New Vegas become the harbinger of a new age.
0DI0012469	I'm not offering you an incentive as crude as money - though there'll be plenty of that.
0DI0012470	What I'm offering you is a ground-floor opportunity in the most important enterprise on Earth.
0DI0012471	What I'm offering is a future - for you, and for what remains of the human race.
0DI0012472	Well enough. We can put the past behind us, I think.
0DI0012473	Then this is a waste of time.
0DI0012474	A great deal shall be happening - a cascade of events, with you taking a central role.
0DI0012475	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level. You'll understand soon enough...
0DI0012477	At the moment, however, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level.
0DI0012478	What you see there will help you understand the significance of what you accomplished at the Fort.
0DI0012479	Yes, so far as you've seen, all it does is change the picture on the Securitrons' face screens from policemen to soldiers. But as you'll see...
0DI0012480	Some things are more easily shown than told. Take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level, and you'll see what I mean.
0DI0012481	Don't worry, you'll like what you see. We have much to accomplish, you and I...
0DI0012482	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you that the Platinum Chip does more than change the pictures on the Securitrons' face screens.
0DI0012483	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role. To get started, all you need do is take the elevator all the way down...
0DI0012484	I must insist that you stay long for me to show you what the Chip does. I promise you'll like what you see...
0DI0012485	Events of great import are about to unfold, with you taking a central role.
0DI0012486	To get started, all you need to do is take the elevator all the way down to the bottom level...
0DI0012487	I'm surprised you can still underestimate me after everything you've seen.
0DI0012488	I haven't shown my hand - I've shown one card. I've given my enemies a single, provocative datum upon which to fixate.
0DI0012489	They have no idea what other cards I'm holding. It's a strong hand, believe me - I dealt it to myself.
0DI0012490	Why would I want to go to war against the NCR? They're my best customers.
0DI0012491	If their leaders weren't scheming to steal Vegas out from under me, I'd have no troubles with the NCR at all.
0DI0012492	No no no, you'll want to hear this out...
0DI0012493	Disappointing. In the extreme.
0DI0012494	The next step will require you to infiltrate Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
0DI0012495	You'll have to return to Caesar's camp at Fortification Hill.
0DI0012496	Do you have any idea how prodigious is the opportunity you're casting aside here?
0DI0012497	Here, take the Platinum Chip again. You will need it.
0DI0012498	Upon arrival at the Fort, it's likely that you'll be searched and the Chip taken from you. Don't worry - it will come back to you.
0DI0012499	I expect that if Benny doesn't have the Chip, Caesar will make sure you get it. More on that later. Be off.
0DI0012500	Something very important. I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise - so don't bother asking.
0DI0012501	That's because he ceased to be relevant when you recovered the Platinum Chip. Revenge doesn't interest me, progress does.
0DI0012502	Sorry to deny you a moment of primate triumph, but you'll have to go elsewhere to sound your barbaric yawp.
0DI0012503	I'll give you time to think over the consequences of what you're saying. I urge you to reconsider.
0DI0012504	Feed a man for free, and he'll be back asking for more.
0DI0012505	Feed a man a bullet. You won't hear from him again.
0DI0012506	Good, bad... The guy with the gun makes the rules.
0DI0012507	Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted time.
0DI0012508	The only thing I know for certain is that I don't know nothing.
0DI0012509	Longing makes the heart grow fonder, but I've always been a fan of hog-tying my lovers to make sure they can't escape.
0DI0012510	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking. I suppose I could sleaze it up a bit for their customers if it means I have a non-stop supply of drink.
0DI0012511	Tell the Garrets I'm in. I'll make my way there shortly.
0DI0012512	[FAILED] I don't need caps that bad. A hard day's labor pays well enough.
0DI0012513	I've never been much of a showboat, or cared about being a public figure. I'm plenty content with caps for an honest hard day's work.
0DI0012515	I've been around a while. Currently working for the Followers as a gun for hire, but it's getting rather dull.
0DI0012516	Aside from protecting them from the occasional thug looking to intercept supply shipments, there isn't much to do around here.
0DI0012517	The one researcher I liked who I could chat up about liquor got transferred, and the rest of the docs are pretty uptight about my kind of fun.
0DI0012518	And I may have answers.
0DI0012519	I joined up looking for a decent-paying job. Granted, the pay is all right, but they won't let me kick back and slog a brew at the end of the day.
0DI0012520	They're worried the filthy drunkies in detox seeing me drink will cause an immediate relapse. I say their rehab effort here is just a revolving door.
0DI0012521	I've been around long enough to observe patterns of human behavior. Physical and mental anguish are especially exciting to explore.
0DI0012522	I'm available, sweetie - but you'll have to do as I say.
0DI0012523	Then you'll need to get a room first, sweetie. You're going to want the privacy.
0DI0012524	Meet me upstairs. I'll try to leave you in one piece.
0DI0012525	Suit yourself. Anything else on your mind?
0DI0012527	I'm honored they would consider me. I'll start immediately.
0DI0012528	Santiago is here to please, my prarie flower. Just a few caps and I'm yours.
0DI0012529	Santiago is sorry, but you must have a room first. Please see Ms. Garret to procure lodging.
0DI0012530	I'll meet you upstairs in a moment, darling.
0DI0012531	I will require a hardware and software upgrade to offer enhanced services.
0DI0012532	Have a look, baby.
0DI0012533	Thank God! I thought I was going to die if you didn't come back soon.
0DI0012534	I'm going to head to the Followers' fort to get some rest and detox. You've saved my life, friend.
0DI0012537	[SUCCEEDED] I think you're right. I've been through worse. I'll go to the fort and see if the Followers can watch over me while I recover.
0DI0012538	[FAILED] Get the hell out of here. Think you're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse or something?
0DI0012539	So far the Crimson Caravan won't cut us a deal. If you can convince them or some other merchant to work with us, I'll discount supplies to you.
0DI0012540	You might ask around at Mick and Ralph's - or go see the Garrets, though I suspect they're too busy poisoning Freeside to help it out.
0DI0012541	All right. You'll get them at a discounted rate, thanks to all the supplies you've donated.
0DI0012542	What seems to be the problem?
0DI0012544	That would be a godsend, but so far we've had no luck working out a deal with the Crimson Caravan or any other local merchants.
0DI0012545	If you could manage to find someone willing to work with us, I'd gladly offer medical supplies at a discount.
0DI0012547	Good to hear! Oh, by the way. I got a shipment of magazines from home I'd be willing to sell if you're interested.
0DI0012548	It looks like you took care of our short term supply issues. In thanks, you can have a discount on medical services with me.
0DI0012549	Also, I would like to extend an invitation to join the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0012550	Your work here in the Old Mormon Fort has been invaluable, and I can't think of a more worthy recruit. Will you join us?
0DI0012551	Good to hear! What do you have to donate?
0DI0012552	It looks like we've got enough Med-X for the moment, but it always helps to be prepared with a backup supply. How much do you have to donate?
0DI0012553	How much do you have to donate?
0DI0012555	We have a good stock of Rad-Away at this point, but every extra bit helps. How much do you have to donate?
0DI0012558	With your help, we now have a small overstock of Fixer, however, it never hurts to have extra. How much do you have to donate?
0DI0012561	A common enough problem here in Freeside.
0DI0012562	You don't show any signs of physical dependency. Nothing I can do for psychological dependency, I'm afraid.
0DI0012563	That's easy enough to clear up.
0DI0012564	Who hasn't? But your rad level is nothing dangerous.
0DI0012565	This will help you kick the habit.
0DI0012567	Hold still. The Rad-Away burns a little.
0DI0012568	Thanks! Anything else?
0DI0012577	Thanks for the donation. Every bit goes toward helping Freeside.
0DI0012578	I'm honestly pleasantly surprised they would help us out, but I can see Garret isn't doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
0DI0012579	Well, it looks like you've earned yourself a discount on supplies now that we'll be fully covered. This supply deal will aid our work immensely.
0DI0012580	We're pretty short-handed as it is, but I suppose I could spare a few items.
0DI0012581	We don't have a lot right now, but this is what I can offer for sale.
0DI0012585	If we let everyone run amok, the damn NCR would shut us down. Gotta have some way to regulate usage.
0DI0012586	Just a few caps for a good long swig.
0DI0012587	You already paid, bub. Get a drink then come back and see me if you still want more.
0DI0012589	Don't get wise. We charge per use, so make that first drink worth the caps.
0DI0012590	Anything else you want?
0DI0012591	Why, do you work for one of the casinos?
0DI0012592	[SUCCEEDED] In that case, yes I do.
0DI0012594	[FAILED] All of my guns are special. If anything catches your eye, let me know.
0DI0012595	No Vegas-banned items here, buddy. Just high quality standard stock.
0DI0012596	Are they looking to buy guns?
0DI0012597	Then talk to my partner Ralph.
0DI0012598	Let's see you stop me, then. Guys, let's teach these soldier boys a lesson.
0DI0012599	Not anymore it isn't. He's not in his right mind if he's even thinking about making a deal with this scum.
0DI0012600	What the f-? Get the others! Now!
0DI0012601	[SUCCEEDED] I... No. We would never survive. We need to stick together.
0DI0012602	I'll go with whatever the King decides, but I'll be watching these NCR scumbags like a hawk. If they try anything...
0DI0012603	[FAILED] No, I won't even consider this. We'll show the NCR they can't bully us!
0DI0012604	You're going to have to deal with me whether you like it or not. Get them!
0DI0012605	We don't have the stills and equipment to supply the amount of meds they're looking to purchase.
0DI0012606	You could check with other wasteland merchants, but I think your best bet would be the Atomic Wrangler.
0DI0012607	They've got a bunch of stills and a seemingly endless supply of grain alcohol, which could be used as anesthetic or disinfectant.
0DI0012608	Then I'm afraid we're going to have ourselves a tussle. Now say what you came to say or get out.
0DI0012609	That doesn't sound half bad... what's the catch?
0DI0012610	Hmmm, people around here *would* be a lot less ornery if there were more supplies to go around. It'd be rough at first, but I think we could manage.
0DI0012611	Tell you what. I'll agree to those terms. But the Kings won't lift a finger until we see the first of those supplies.
0DI0012612	That's not so bad. I might have to make an example of a few of the more hotheaded guys, but otherwise, that sounds fair.
0DI0012614	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, but I think I can make an exception in your case. I'll have one of the guys spread the word.
0DI0012615	From this day forward, you're one of us, and no one in Freeside will mess with you if they know what's good for them.
0DI0012616	In addition, if you want to do something about that hair of yours, talk to Sergio. I'll let him know you're coming.
0DI0012617	Perhaps more importantly, you've earned the right to wear something a little more stylish. Here, wear it proudly.
0DI0012618	Normally, we don't let outsiders join, and you'd be the first female King ever, but I think I can make an exception in your case.
0DI0012622	Sure can. I have a friend who has just what you're looking for, has a shop over yonder by the east gate, named Mick & Ralph's.
0DI0012623	Just tell Ralph that I sent you and he'll get you squared away.
0DI0012624	Caps are a little tight these days, but with our guards making more and those supplies comin' in I reckon I can spare some.
0DI0012625	That's a good idea. I don't give out favors everyday, so you probably shouldn't rush to pick something.
0DI0012626	Tumble it around in your mind and come back when you know what you want. I'll be here.
0DI0012627	Fine by me, just remember I owe you one. Now what did you want to talk about?
0DI0012628	Whoa... that's a doozy. Truth be told, I don't even know if I can pull something like that off.
0DI0012629	I'll give it my best. You've earned that much. But this makes us even, you hear?
0DI0012630	Damn straight they will. It's some of the other locals that I'm worried about.
0DI0012631	On second thought, if I can whip this band of hooligans into obedience, a stray tough guy or two shouldn't be a problem.
0DI0012632	Okay, you've got a deal. No more violence against the NCR on my watch. But this makes us even, you hear?
0DI0012633	Hold on now, I didn't say I couldn't do it, just that I couldn't guarantee it, and even that's probably stretching the truth a little.
0DI0012634	Just leave everything to me. I'll see that the violence stops. But this makes us even, you hear?
0DI0012635	Is that so? That's a mighty tall order for someone I barely know. Now, if you were to help me out some, that might change my mind.
0DI0012637	I'd like to help you out, especially considering all you've done, but that's a pretty big favor you're asking for, and you've already used yours.
0DI0012638	Was there anything else you wanted?
0DI0012639	Whoa, there. Not just anyone can be a King. First of all, we usually only accept people native to the area.
0DI0012640	Second, I have to approve. And I don't. You haven't shown me you've got what it takes to be a King yet.
0DI0012641	But if you're fixin' to join something fierce, stick around, and if you play your cards right, things might change.
0DI0012642	There you go, all patched up. Anything else I can do for you?
0DI0012643	I bet you do, but you won't be getting them from me. I heard about the crap you've been pulling, and I'll not risk my rep for you.
0DI0012644	Maybe you didn't hear me the first time. No service for scumbags!
0DI0012646	I can give you something that should help. I need to see some caps for treatment.
0DI0012647	If you were a trooper, I'd tell you to walk it off, but they're your caps.
0DI0012648	Yep, you appear to be pretty cut up, but nothing some stitches and pain pills won't cure.
0DI0012649	Do you have the caps to cover the pills and treatment?
0DI0012650	Hot damn you got whooped good! This could take a while.
0DI0012651	I will also require some caps to cover my supplies.
0DI0012652	I can take care of that quick and easy, if you've got the caps.
0DI0012656	Then what do you need?
0DI0012657	Okay. A couple rounds of Rad-Away should do it.
0DI0012666	Oh? Such things are common in Denver, but I didn't know that other cities had them as well.
0DI0012667	I see. That's very strange.
0DI0012668	I ask because Caesar once had a similar pet, but it was lost during a battle.
0DI0012670	When I was a boy, the Legion conquered my tribe. I was chosen for training as a Legionary.
0DI0012671	I fought in many battles for the Legion. Eventually, Caesar chose me to lead his Praetorian Guard. It was a great honor.
0DI0012672	The girls and women were enslaved, and many of the men and boys were also chosen to become Legionaries. The rest were killed.
0DI0012673	We were savages. The Legion raised us up, made us better than what we were.
0DI0012674	What did you want to talk about?
0DI0012675	The NCR Rangers are the biggest threat. Without them, the NCR is nothing.
0DI0012676	We had the numbers, but not the tactics. I know - I was there at Boulder City when we were defeated.
0DI0012677	We relied too much on veteran Legionaries for direction and leadership, and the Rangers exploited our weakness by killing our best from afar.
0DI0012678	[SUCCEEDED] I guess that's okay. Um, if you're a friend, can you help me?
0DI0012679	[FAILED] I'm not allowed to talk to you. Bye.
0DI0012680	Okay. Um... do you think you could help me?
0DI0012681	Murder? What kind of Murder? Do you have any proof?
0DI0012682	Okay, this is a very serious accusation. Please be sure to bring me something concrete.
0DI0012683	Well that's something, but I can't go in there without proof of foul play.
0DI0012684	These are terrifying. Do you have any idea who the man is speaking on this tape?
0DI0012685	Well come back here when you can. I'd like to take care of this as soon as possible.
0DI0012686	Come back here as soon as you do, I'd like to see this asshole behind bars.
0DI0012687	Clanden? Okay, I'll send some troops over there to bring him in.
0DI0012688	All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
0DI0012689	Ok, ask away.
0DI0012690	Ha! Are you some kind of machine fetishist or something?
0DI0012691	Heh. Well, the only place I know of locally would be Cerulean Robotics, but that place has been overrun by vermin for years.
0DI0012692	If you want to check the place out, you can find it on the west side of Freeside. The entrance is on the back side of the building.
0DI0012693	Just watch out for thugs. The rats aren't the only vermin you need to worry about.
0DI0012695	I don't know of any, but if you give me a few days and some caps, I think I could probably make one on my terminal.
0DI0012696	Just stop back and see me if you need one made. Anything else I can help you with?
0DI0012697	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Come back in a couple days and I should have it ready for you.
0DI0012698	[FAILED] I don't think so. I've got a business to run here, buddy.
0DI0012700	[FAILED] That is just an insult to my expertise. My work is worth more than that.
0DI0012702	Not yet. Come back later and it should be ready to go.
0DI0012703	Yep, here you go. You'll need to use a terminal to upload the data to the robot.
0DI0012706	Then I must refuse. The people here have the right to do what they want and are beholden to none. I won't take that away from them.
0DI0012707	And whose job is it to stop it? Yours? Mine? Who are we to tell people what to do? No man has that right.
0DI0012708	Says the one with a squad of armed soldiers behind them. No, I don't think a peaceful solution is possible. Not anymore.
0DI0012709	That I don't want to sign away my freedom and that of all the people I'm responsible for at gunpoint? Yeah, I'm sure.
0DI0012710	[SUCCEEDED] Honestly, I hadn't thought it through that far. I'd guess someone would come and take over this place.
0DI0012711	And you can be damn sure they won't run it like the King, baby. They might run everyone out, or enslave them, or worse.
0DI0012712	I guess I have no choice. Tell your NCR masters that I accept their terms. I'll see that violence against their people is dealt with.
0DI0012713	Now take these fools and get out of here before they start a riot.
0DI0012714	[FAILED] My momma didn't raise no quitter, and I stand by my beliefs. The answer is no.
0DI0012715	And I'm trying to protect mine. If the NCR wants peace so much, the first step would be to get these soldiers out of here.
0DI0012716	An offer, huh? All right, let's hear it.
0DI0012717	Wrong, huh? And I suppose they sent all of these soldiers just to make nice. Lucky me.
0DI0012718	Then I suggest you make your way back outside. My men have orders to shoot anyone caught sneaking around in sensitive areas.
0DI0012719	You say Crocker sent you? Let me see... I just received a memo regarding him recently and haven't had a chance to read it in detail.
0DI0012720	Ah, the matter with the so-called Kings. Crocker's been wringing his hands while good people die for too long, and now the matter's fallen to me.
0DI0012721	Unlike the good ambassador, I don't intend to blink. Tell the leader of this gang to stand down or face annihilation.
0DI0012722	That is his choice. If he chooses the latter, a squad of my men will be there to back you up. Any questions?
0DI0012723	You know, I just received the strangest memo about Freeside. It said that Colonel Hsu has already dispatched a squad to take care of the problem.
0DI0012724	I'll let Hsu's men deal with things, but the good ambassador is going to learn a harsh lesson regarding protocol.
0DI0012725	I trust you can find your own way out.
0DI0012726	Good. When the task is done, report back to Crocker. My men have other orders and will return here on their own to make their report.
0DI0012728	Do you have any idea what our current situation is? As we speak there is a huge army of madmen not ten miles from here waiting to kill us all.
0DI0012729	We don't have the luxury of long-term diplomacy any longer. Anyone that could prove a hindrance in the battle to come must be dealt with swiftly.
0DI0012730	You have your orders. I expect you to carry them out.
0DI0012732	Not exactly. Give them the chance to do the right thing at least. Personally, I doubt they'll do it.
0DI0012733	Crocker's been making overtures to these savages for months and gotten nowhere. Expect a fight, but don't look for one.
0DI0012736	We breed them, mostly, but sometimes we get some good ones from Denver. That whole city is overrun with them.
0DI0012738	Been doing it since I was a boy. The mongrels know to listen up when I start talking to them.
0DI0012739	Piss off, kid. We've got no more business to conduct.
0DI0012740	Everything. Up until recently, this man was an employee of mine. He's quite handsome, don't you think?
0DI0012741	I know I did. We became... close. I warned him that I was a very jealous woman, and he said he understood.
0DI0012742	Apparently he didn't. Last week, I chanced upon him in Gomorrah, being serviced by one of their two-cap whores. I was not pleased.
0DI0012743	I tell you all this because I want you to know that this man means a great deal to me.
0DI0012744	Let me guess. The NCR couldn't get me to dance to their tune so now they're asking again a little less nicely, right?
0DI0012745	We'll deal with that should the time come, Pace. Now I'm sure these gentlemen are as anxious to get out of here as we are to see them go.
0DI0012747	Sounds like he's not going to cooperate, men. Open fire!
0DI0012748	And you. Bringing these assholes in here like you're doing us some kind of favor.
0DI0012749	You can take your new friends and get the hell out of here, because the answer is no. The Kings will never deal with trash from the NCR.
0DI0012750	I can't believe what I'm hearing. You're actually going to make a deal with these guys?
0DI0012751	Pace, this is an opportunity we can't pass up. They're finally recognizing us. This is what we've been fighting for.
0DI0012752	Like hell it is. This goes against everything we stand for. Everything you supposedly stand for.
0DI0012753	I'm not going to listen to them just because they throw a few crumbs my way, and a lot of the guys feel the same way.
0DI0012754	Please leave me alone. I have nothing more to give.
0DI0012755	It's just about closing time. Let's go see the boss about getting paid.
0DI0012756	Oh, I'm going to need the rifle and armor back. Boss's orders.
0DI0012757	Good. Look around and get a feel for where customers and risks can enter and exit the area while I get your gear ready.
0DI0012758	Mr. Soren, please get to the point. The second half of your payment is late and I want to know why.
0DI0012759	Ms. Van Graff, my associates and I have decided that we wish to renegotiate the terms of our deal.
0DI0012760	Might I ask for what reason? The shipment was delivered. The guns were tested before leaving this facility.
0DI0012761	Regardless, we feel that the quality of the weapons is below expectation, and hoped to adjust the price accordingly.
0DI0012762	Ah, I think I understand what the issue here is. Excuse me for a moment, would you?
0DI0012763	Jean-Baptiste, could you bring out the volunteer?
0DI0012764	W-What is this, Ms. Van Graff?
0DI0012765	This is a lesson, Mr. Soren. A lesson in faith.
0DI0012766	I don't understand. Who is this man? What does this have to do with our deal?
0DI0012767	Do it.
0DI0012768	Never break faith with the Van Graffs, Mr. Soren.
0DI0012769	I expect you'll have the rest of our payment ready tomorrow morning.
0DI0012770	Okay everyone, show's over. Back to work!
0DI0012772	Ha ha, I think he wet himself before he left. That was pretty good making up that part about sleeping with Jacob.
0DI0012773	You did make that part up, right, Glory?
0DI0012774	Damn it, girl, what has mama always said about tipping the help? I thought this was about him stealing money from us.
0DI0012775	He was stealing money, though he could have kept it for all I cared. God knows he earned it.
0DI0012776	The pump is property of The King. You'll need to pay if you want a drink.
0DI0012777	Who isn't in trouble in New Vegas, uh? Sooner or later, you hit the bottom of the barrel - I just happened to fall harder than most, is all.
0DI0012778	I am just one more loser that got the evil-eye from Lady Luck - hard fall. Now I lay at the bottom and keep to myself.
0DI0012779	All right. About what do you want to know?
0DI0012780	From the top! Where else, uh? I am Carlitos - my fingers work the magic and my hands deal the luck!
0DI0012781	There was no player who'd stood a chance, no wiseguy who didn't fear me, and no doll who could resist me. Gomorrah was my kingdom, Carlitos' turf!
0DI0012782	Yeah, I could've ended buried in the sands with just my head sticking out. Ants love that - a riot, know what I mean?
0DI0012783	This place has come a long way. Sarah takes care of it and she lets me stay, for now.
0DI0012785	This place has come a long way, but ever since Sarah's death it is not the same.
0DI0012786	All right. What do you want to know?
0DI0012787	If you're smart, the Strip's all flash and noise. If not, luck's your dame, your hot date, until you find she's a cheap whore high on Jet.
0DI0012788	Ha! There's only one important player in town, and that's Mr. House. Everyone keeps clean around him, the families, the barons - fuck, even the NCR.
0DI0012789	My recommendation, get the fuck out of town while you can. It'll leave you hanging in the wind or, worse, add your body to a concrete wall, okay?
0DI0012790	Hey, you're smart. Okay, it was like finding diamonds in your vodka and showgirls under your card-table. You want it, Gomorrah has it.
0DI0012791	It was heaven - until you find that all the glitter is made of broken dreams and all the praise hides a knife pointing at your ribs.
0DI0012792	I didn't just spend time there, I lived there, okay? I was family. All I wanted, I had. Caps, booze, drugs, women, power, you name it.
0DI0012794	Now, if you have to ask, you probably don't know shit about who you're dealing with, huh? Listen up - watch out for Cachino, that's all I'm saying.
0DI0012795	I'd recommend you save your caps and your skin. Check The Tops - no big time wiseguys there. Freeside's also fun, you know?
0DI0012796	There's too much shit and despair at Gomorrah already. I don't want anybody making it worse for Jo... for the girls, you know?
0DI0012797	What doesn't she do, huh? Sarah makes this hole look like a palace - damn nice pair of gams on her too. She never walks outside, though.
0DI0012798	Because Mr. House ripped this place to shreds before filling it with concrete. Hey, I was untouchable once, but Mr. House's a god - you got that?
0DI0012799	I... Okay, it's Joana. She... works at Gomorrah. But it's all my fault! I met her at the Atomic Wrangler - beautiful doesn't even come close.
0DI0012800	I moved her into Gomorrah. I was in love, okay? Then Cachino, backstabbing snake, got me out of the way so that he could have my girl.
0DI0012801	No dice. I already opened my trap more than I should. Walls have ears even all the way down in this hole, you know? Can't trust nobody.
0DI0012802	You know - straightening up bets, Gomorrah, success, women, all that shiny stuff.
0DI0012807	[FAILED] Ha ha ha! Okay, okay... stop or I'll choke, I swear. Listen, kid - I'll cut you some slack because nothing else in this town will, you hear?
0DI0012810	He's a cunning bastard, Cachino. Told Nero and Big Sal he caught me spring cleaning my tributes to the family - can't do nothing against that viper.
0DI0012811	Don't know... She's a dream to me now... If I, I mean if I could have her again I'd be a made man.
0DI0012814	Have you made up your mind?
0DI0012817	Okay - you try that and let me know, okay? How she looks, what she's wearing, she's safe, anything - I'll pay you, you hear?
0DI0012823	Hey, that's great. What's going on?
0DI0012824	That won't do... at all. Listen, it can't be the jet, Cachino's got her scared shitless.
0DI0012825	Find a way to make this work... please.
0DI0012826	She is...? Listen, no time to waste. Help her get to Freeside, that's our ticket out of this fucking city.
0DI0012827	I'll meet you there between midnight and dawn, though we could use some backup. We only got one chance to get this right, you hear?
0DI0012828	These guys in Freeside, good shots, right? They owe me big time. Tell'em that Carlitos' back to collect his chips, they'll know what do.
0DI0012830	Clanden, under the authority of the New California Republic, I place you under arrest for murder.
0DI0012831	What? Are you fucking kidding me? You can't do this, the Omertas aren't going to stand by and let you arrest me.
0DI0012832	The Omertas have no say in this matter. This is a legal matter now. You'll have to come with us.
0DI0012833	Alright. I'll come quietly, but this fucked.
0DI0012834	What the fuck are you trying to pull here? Where is my girl? Now I'm gonna have to kill your sorry ass.
0DI0012835	Ok little lady, let's get started. You look like a tough piece of meat, I'm going to enjoy tenderizing you.
0DI0012842	He's got his reasons. And when that man gets a notion stuck in his head, he's like a Bighorner bull that's seen red.
0DI0012843	And if it means Heck Gunderson's involved, then you better step aside before the stampede tramples you over.
0DI0012844	It's not my place to say much, Walter thinks this is a man's job. I swear, I won't see the day he'll get over that Heck Gunderson.
0DI0012845	Oh, a good ways west of here, in a place you've never been. Far as we concerned, only name it ever had was "Phebus Ranch."
0DI0012846	That was before we lost some land to Heck Gunderson. The bank demanded payment in full the day after the Stockmen's Association bailed it out.
0DI0012847	If that's what you want to talk about, go see Walter. He'll talk your ear off.
0DI0012848	Everything he says about the evils of Heck Gunderson is true, but I've never held the notion that fighting evil with evil carries the world forward.
0DI0012849	I'm done talking about that man. If that's what you want, step on over to Walter.
0DI0012850	A good life if you don't mind hard work. The only real fuss is the constant bother with varmints.
0DI0012851	Fail to catch Molerats early in their breeding, and you'll have three or four head breaking their ankles in Molerat holes every day.
0DI0012852	Of course, the worst varmint at all is a Brahmin Baron with his hands in the pockets of a Republic senator.
0DI0012853	That's a problem you can't solve with a Varmint Rifle, though I fear my husband's apt to try. He's got Heck Gunderson in his sights right now.
0DI0012855	That's very kind of you. Maybe this'll be the dawn of a new day.
0DI0012856	I'm not surprised. You don't see folks rushing to help each other around here.
0DI0012857	I don't suppose you have the magic powers necessary to bring my husband to his senses, do you?
0DI0012858	He swears he won't leave this godforsaken city until he's seen Heck suffer. So far as I can see, we're the only ones in pain.
0DI0012859	As I was saying, I'd be grateful if you could convince Walter to give up this doomed crusade of his.
0DI0012860	[SUCCEEDED] Sharp eyes on you, all right. We've gone through a heap of trouble to get in town. Ethel says I just need to wet my throat.
0DI0012861	A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
0DI0012862	[FAILED] A drink? Nonsense. All I need right now is to settle a score. We didn't come a long ways just to stroll our best clothes around.
0DI0012863	I got some time - what's eating you?
0DI0012864	All right, kid! Be good.
0DI0012865	Okay. What'd you want know?
0DI0012866	I know it better than my wife's corset! What about it, kid?
0DI0012867	I hear you. What's on your mind?
0DI0012868	There's a long list of grievances that Heck Gunderson's got to answer for, kid. I'm here to make sure that "rancher" stops stealing our lands.
0DI0012869	If he ain't chiseling behind your back, he just sends his men, ready for a fight. Then you either "sell" your ranch for a penny or you're dead.
0DI0012870	I'm tired of being trampled over, kid, and I got a good mind to stop Heck once and for all.
0DI0012871	I came to take care of Heck Gunderson. That bastard's taking over any ranch he spots in The Wasteland.
0DI0012873	Steeling our pure-breed resolve, that's how! We've faced the Wasteland right in the old mug and told her to shove it!
0DI0012874	Listen, we own these lands, and I'll be damned if the NCR, those Legion bastards, or anyone else tries to walk all over us.
0DI0012876	A ransom? I doubt that snake's got enough soul to care that much for his own youngin. Besides, what's to stop him after his son's returned?
0DI0012877	Nah, Heck only knows greed and pain, kid. It's high time he got paid back in kind. His life, or his son's, either way I win.
0DI0012878	[SUCCEEDED] I'll pay that much and die a happy man when my time comes. So, we got a deal?
0DI0012881	Darn far it is, our ranch. Ethel would be happy to yap about that - I got more important things in mind, kid.
0DI0012882	Bighorners' my trade since I was a youngin. I confess it's hard living these days, kid. The Wasteland ain't the same anymore.
0DI0012883	What more you want? He's a slithering snake, what he is. One of the biggest landowners this side of the Colorado and it's all stolen, I tell you.
0DI0012884	All that money buys him any NCR senators he wants - scoundrels, like Heck. There's just no way for us small folks to get by, much less prosper, kid.
0DI0012885	Sure, kid, and I still hump like a buck in Spring. That Gunderson's a liar and born of a viper, I swear.
0DI0012886	I have no illusions that he'll ever stop his plundering. So I'm just going to make him suffer, that's what I'm going to do.
0DI0012887	Here, in town, he's got few of his armed men to protect him. I just got to find out what's he up to and then I'll know where to hit him hard.
0DI0012888	Like I said, kid. Someone's got to rein that greedy son of a gun.
0DI0012889	I'll be damned! You mean the young Gunderson? That's a shave tail if I ever saw one - he's got less sense than a Brahmin at a crossroads.
0DI0012890	I'd not be one to complain if he got lost for good, kid... If it makes Heck suffer then I'm all for it.
0DI0012891	Where I come from, we appreciate good intentions. I reckon you could help me figure out what's he doing in town.
0DI0012892	Tell you what, that chiseler's blowing hot air at that over there fancy casino - The Ultra-Luxe. Find out what's his story here, will you?
0DI0012897	[SUCCEEDED] All right, kid! I'm taking a liking to you. It's a deal.
0DI0012900	That's okay, kid. I understand - let me know if you change your mind, will you?
0DI0012903	We are honest folk out there, damn hard to make a living in the desert, kid. Heck's a different breed, goddamn thief he is.
0DI0012904	Scaring us into giving away our lands is all he's done to strike it flush - comes packing iron and none can hold a candle to his men - bad blood.
0DI0012905	Ethel's going to be madder than a wet hen but you reap what you sow, kid, and Heck's earned every ounce of misery he gets. So, we have a deal?
0DI0012910	I won't hold it against you, kid. You got to do your clean thing, I respect that.
0DI0012915	Kid, look around you, there's poison and death everywhere, and people like Heck are responsible for the misery we suffer.
0DI0012916	What right do they have to continue with their mischief and killing, huh?
0DI0012927	So, Ted's nowhere to be found and Heck's quite unprotected while looking for him, huh?
0DI0012928	Hell, it sounds like the perfect time to get even. Heck won't know what hit him, what do you say?
0DI0012936	[FAILED] Same, the right of might, kid. The Gundersons will pay for all their crimes and that's final.
0DI0012937	[SUCCEEDED] Hell, a good thrashing is what I want to give them but I see your point, kid. Things will never change without us good folks.
0DI0012939	Thanks for your help, kid. So long!
0DI0012940	It just so happens a position opened up recently. It's not much, but it'll be a good way for me to gauge your potential for future assignments.
0DI0012941	It just so happens a position opened up recently. We currently need another body to guard the entrance outside. Think you can handle that?
0DI0012942	Ran out of caps, eh? The job's still available, if you're interested.
0DI0012943	You're in luck. We've interviewed a few people for the courier position, but they all seem so... untrustworthy. Ready to make some money?
0DI0012944	And? Don't leave me in suspense. What was their reaction?
0DI0012945	Wonderful. I already have a man outside who can show you the ropes and get you set up. His name is Simon.
0DI0012946	He's been with the family for years, so listen to what he says, and follow his instructions.
0DI0012947	Suit yourself. Was there anything else you wanted?
0DI0012948	Not at all.
0DI0012949	Yes it is. My brother and I run this particular branch, but our family has operations all over, particularly in California.
0DI0012950	Look around, and you'll notice two things.
0DI0012951	First, we don't lack for security. I'm not worried about anyone breaking in here or stealing our goods.
0DI0012952	Not that we don't occasionally have attempts, but even those prove useful. Do you know how much target dummies cost?
0DI0012953	Back to my point, the second thing you'll notice is that we do not sell cheap merchandise. Everything here is second-to-none.
0DI0012954	People who buy Van Graff goods typically don't care where they have to go to get them.
0DI0012955	This place is certainly lively, that's for sure. Did you want to know something specific about it?
0DI0012956	Oh, there's not much to tell. I was born into a big family and don't get along with my parents, so here I am. As far away from them as possible.
0DI0012957	Unfortunately, I found someone else with a little more experience, and he'll take over the position starting tomorrow.
0DI0012958	However, another task has come up that I could use some help with, assuming you're still interested in making some money?
0DI0012959	You basically let every jackass off the street march in here. That doesn't say much for your judgement.
0DI0012960	Still, you did manage to prevent that psychopath from blowing this place up. That deserves some reward, at least.
0DI0012961	Then you robbed me of my revenge on that prancing asshole of a King. For that alone, I should kill you.
0DI0012962	You kept away the undesirables, patted down the rest for weapons, and kept your cool.
0DI0012963	That is to say, you performed as instructed. Simon was impressed, and so am I. So you get a small bonus with your normal pay.
0DI0012964	You had a little bit of a hard time following instructions, but didn't do too bad overall. Here's your pay.
0DI0012965	There's a deal that we've been working on for a while now and the buyer would like a sample of our weapons.
0DI0012966	I need you to run a package out to a discrete location that the client has chosen. Sound good?
0DI0012967	Well, look who doesn't need my money any more. When you find your pockets a little lighter, stop back.
0DI0012968	It's a courier job, so it should be easy caps.
0DI0012969	Good, here's the package. I'll mark the location on your map. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while so there's no rush.
0DI0012970	That said, try not to dawdle. This client could mean big money for us, which naturally means big money for you.
0DI0012971	Very well. Let me know if you change your mind. The buyer said they'd be in town for quite a while, so there's no rush.
0DI0012972	My men have their hands full with our other operations, so unless I can find another courier, the job will still be available.
0DI0012973	Good... good. Here's your payment. If you'll excuse me, I have some thinking to do.
0DI0012974	Oh, Jean-Baptiste was talking about a matter earlier that he needs help with. I volunteered you. See him for the details.
0DI0012975	It's better if you don't ask. Now I believe I asked you a question. What was their reaction?
0DI0012976	All right then. If we're going to work together, there's only one thing you need to know about me. I like things simple.
0DI0012977	Recently Glory negotiated a deal between us and a big time player. We're talking more caps than you'd probably see in a lifetime.
0DI0012978	Your part in this is simple. To finalize this deal, I need to tie up a loose end. To do that, there's a girl I need you to find.
0DI0012979	No, no, no. That's not how it works. You don't get to weigh the options. You're either in or you're out.
0DI0012980	Yeah, sure fucking thing. I'll be waiting with baited breath for your schedule to clear up, ha ha.
0DI0012981	Well, no time for pleasantries. I've got your gear right here, but let's see if you can follow instructions.
0DI0012982	You'll be covering the other side of the door there. Take your position while I get your stuff out.
0DI0012983	You can always tell a rookie. You look too eager. Give the job a few hours, and the shine'll come right off.
0DI0012984	I've been paired with worse, I guess. Anyway, let's see if you can follow instructions.
0DI0012985	Good choice. I prefer laser-based weapons myself, but the boss lady said she wants at least one guard using a plasma rifle.
0DI0012986	Says the lightning bits draw in more people. Whatever.
0DI0012987	Now that you're equipped, a quick word on the job at hand. In a nutshell, we're here to keep the riff-raff away.
0DI0012988	Drunks, punks, and capless vermin are to be turned away. Potential customers are to be permitted normal entrance.
0DI0012989	That is, after we pat them down for weapons. An unarmed man is a lot less likely to try to steal something with several armed guards around.
0DI0012990	Don't start any fights. I don't care if some Jet junkie just insulted your mother, we're here to promote violence elsewhere, not start it here.
0DI0012991	Lastly, don't abandon your post. We're getting paid to stand next to this door, not talk to someone down the street or head to the casino.
0DI0012992	That goes double for any thoughts of splitting with that gear. Every now and then some young punk thinks he can run off with Van Graff property.
0DI0012993	Trust me, the rifle and armor are nice, but they're not worth your life.
0DI0012994	Other than that, relax. There's usually some eye candy coming and going from the Wrangler over there at some point, so the view's not too bad.
0DI0012995	Other than that, relax. Who knows, you might attract a high roller from the Wrangler over there and never have to pull a gig like this again!
0DI0012996	Nothing wrong with going plasma. Just make sure you hit what you're aiming at.
0DI0012997	Lasers have a high rate of fire, but not a lot of stopping power. Plasma on the other hand is slow as a mule, but with a kick to match.
0DI0012998	So what'll it be?
0DI0012999	I'm inclined to agree, but it's a slum with NCR citizens in it, and as such it falls under my jurisdiction.
0DI0013004	You'd remember this one. It's a pit where people are robbed, murdered, or simply go to die.
0DI0013005	Good. Our men have come up with two different plans for seeing an end to the violence.
0DI0013006	First, our sources have tracked most of the attacks back to a King named Pacer. The consensus is that the violence will stop if he's removed.
0DI0013007	The problem is that we can't simply kill him. In the current climate, the NCR would likely be blamed for his death.
0DI0013008	There is an alternative option, but my sources feel that getting rid of this Pacer fellow is our best shot.
0DI0013009	That's too bad. Come back if you change your mind. I'm sure you can see yourself out.
0DI0013010	Make it look like an accident, or pin the deed on someone else. Look into this guy's affairs, and I'm sure you'll find something you can use.
0DI0013011	Either kill Pacer in a way that doesn't lead back to us, or talk the King into quelling the violence. It's not really that hard to remember.
0DI0013012	In any case, I expect to hear good news about this in the future. Keep me informed of your progress.
0DI0013013	See, that's exactly the type of information we can use. In fact, that's perfect. Those fancy weapons the Van Graffs peddle aren't exactly common.
0DI0013014	It goes without saying that actually getting the Van Graffs to do the deed would be the ideal solution.
0DI0013015	However, if Pacer were killed with either a laser or plasma-based weapon, everyone would automatically assume the Van Graffs did it.
0DI0013016	Still, unless you want several dozen armed men at your throat, you'd have to kill him without being seen. Be careful.
0DI0013017	I'll leave the method up to you. However, there is an alternative if you'd rather try to handle things without bloodshed.
0DI0013018	That could be useful, but I'm afraid I don't have the background to know how to take advantage of that knowledge.
0DI0013019	[SUCCEEDED] Remind me never to get on your bad side. If that's true, then yes, that would be a suitable way to get rid of him.
0DI0013020	However, it would involve gaining access to his personal drug stash and tampering with it unseen, which might pose a challenge.
0DI0013021	[FAILED] I doubt it. I've seen junkies live for decades on the stuff. You'd be better off asking someone who knows about these things.
0DI0013022	Damn it, I'm an ambassador, not a doctor. You'll have to find some other way.
0DI0013023	I'm afraid I can't be much help in this matter. My specialty is people and politics, not medicine.
0DI0013024	In that case, we can take a different tack, but one that I at least have more experience with - diplomacy.
0DI0013025	If we can't go after the man responsible, we'll simply appeal to the man above him.
0DI0013026	The Kings, including our friend Pacer, report to the leader of their gang, a man who calls himself the King.
0DI0013027	I'm sure something will turn up. If you think you've found something but are unsure, report back and I'll let you know if it's something we can use.
0DI0013028	It may be tough to find a way to completely throw off suspicion, however.
0DI0013029	I'm not a violent man myself, so I had our guys come up with an alternate solution on the off chance that our agent-to-be shared my sentiments.
0DI0013030	Reward? You want a reward for setting our diplomatic efforts back a year?
0DI0013031	Oh, I see. You're proud of your efforts, eh? Bah! Thankfully, it looks like we won't be working together any longer.
0DI0013032	At least you've got the sense to know you've screwed up. I'll probably be cleaning toilets by the end of the week. But you'll be busy, too.
0DI0013033	If it will get you out of my hair, this is a small price to pay. At least I won't have to put up with you any longer.
0DI0013034	That's an understatement. Still, there's nothing to be done about it now. Maybe the violence may die down once things settle.
0DI0013035	Here, take this. It's not what I was planning to give you, but you deserve some sort of payment for your efforts. Oh, and one other thing.
0DI0013036	You better believe I'm mad. You've waged a one man campaign to drag our good name through the mud and I'll be held accountable!
0DI0013037	You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. Gah! This is what I get for hiring an idiot to do such an important job.
0DI0013038	Here, just take this and go. I have damage control to do.
0DI0013039	Wait, I'm supposed to send you to Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam, though why she wants to see an imbecile like you is beyond me.
0DI0013040	So go to Hoover Dam and see Colonel Moore. Got it? Hoover Dam. Colonel Moore. Maybe it's time to retire.
0DI0013047	As I told you before, that could be useful information, but I don't know how to take advantage of it.
0DI0013048	Killing two birds with one stone. Excellent. You've done a great service for the NCR.
0DI0013049	Now, you're probably wondering about your reward. This has been something of a hot button topic, so I was able to secure this for you.
0DI0013050	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I don't officially have access to any more funds, but here. This is from me personally. There's more coming your way, too.
0DI0013051	[FAILED] I'm sorry, but those are the only funds I was able to allocate. You'll have to make due with it. Besides, you may have other tasks soon.
0DI0013052	Good show. With the conditions there, no one will suspect anything other than bad drugs to be the culprit. You've done a great service for the NCR.
0DI0013054	How unexpected! I was sure a direct confrontation would lead to more fighting, but I'm delighted to be proven wrong.
0DI0013055	I wouldn't be surprised if you had something to do with the situation not flaring up, either. Here, I'm sure you deserve every one of these caps.
0DI0013056	Also, Colonel Moore has requested your presence at Hoover Dam again. No doubt she has further work for an individual with your skillset.
0DI0013057	I'm afraid I don't have any further assignments that would suit you, so you should probably go see her at your earliest convenience.
0DI0013058	I've received a message from Colonel Moore up at Hoover Dam. She's been following your exploits and has requested that you meet with her.
0DI0013059	You're not officially in the employ of the NCR, so there's nothing forcing you to go, but I'd go see her sooner rather than later.
0DI0013060	The Colonel is not someone you want to keep waiting.
0DI0013061	I would, but I'm afraid the rest of the work in my queue pertains to matters I'll have to deal with personally. You do have another option, however.
0DI0013062	That's great to hear. He's got a lot of sway in Freeside, so we can expect a dramatic drop in violence soon.
0DI0013064	That's most unfortunate. In this circumstance I've been instructed to send you along to Colonel Moore over at Hoover Dam for further orders.
0DI0013065	The Colonel will likely send you back to Freeside with a squad of armed men, for all the good that will do.
0DI0013066	I understand. Sometimes these things take time.
0DI0013067	Remember, do what you can to gain the man's trust. Then you'll have your chance.
0DI0013068	Oh, I like the Colonel just fine. She's a good soldier, one of the best. I just don't think her general approach to things is a good fit here.
0DI0013069	See, the Colonel likes to solve things neatly, quickly, and efficiently, through a show of force if possible, and through actual force if necessary.
0DI0013070	That won't work here. Unless she plans on killing half the population of Freeside, sending soldiers to the area will only make things worse.
0DI0013071	More like instigate a mass riot. People there already think the NCR is trying to take this place over. We'd only be confirming their fears.
0DI0013072	I completely agree. Even if a riot didn't immediately break out, a line will have been crossed, and we'll have made that many more enemies.
0DI0013073	I'd suggest you speak to Colonel Hsu over at Camp McCarran. He's much more level-headed about this sort of thing.
0DI0013074	He's also in a better position to bargain with the people of Freeside, seeing as how he's in charge of water and power distribution in the area.
0DI0013075	Still, I'm only mentioning it as an option. My official orders are to direct you to Colonel Moore. Godspeed.
0DI0013076	Wait a moment, if you would. While sending you to Colonel Moore is what I'm officially supposed to do, I'd like to propose an alternative.
0DI0013077	Is it that obvious? You must understand that while Colonel Moore's job is to get things done, my job is to represent the NCR's best interests.
0DI0013078	I was afraid this would happen. Freeside will be a little more dangerous for a while, but eventually things will die down.
0DI0013079	I expect few people will purposely target NCR citizens for some time to come, which is a relief.
0DI0013080	However, the NCR's reputation has taken a huge blow because of this. People are beginning to see not much difference between us and the Legion.
0DI0013081	I've been authorized to give you this for your efforts. It's not much, but most of the funds for this operation are now going toward damage control.
0DI0013082	Good, good. Hsu's a man you can count on to handle a crisis. I'm just glad that things didn't end in violence.
0DI0013083	Here, this is what remains of the funds initially allocated for this operation.
0DI0013084	Also, I've been directed to send you on to Colonel Moore at Hoover Dam. She's been following my reports on your exploits with some interest.
0DI0013085	As I don't have any further assignments for you, I'd recommend going to see her if you need more work.
0DI0013086	That's terrible. I suppose the violence against our people will stop, though.
0DI0013087	I'll have to spend much of the remaining funds for the operation on damage control, but I can spare this much as compensation for your efforts.
0DI0013088	If that's what you prefer, I won't stop you. Just remember to try to find a way to do it that doesn't lead back to the NCR.
0DI0013089	If it just doesn't look possible to make the kill without drawing attention, don't forget there's always the diplomatic approach.
0DI0013091	It looks like you have things well in hand, so I'll leave you to it.
0DI0013095	No doubt Colonel Moore's approach will produce results. Just be ready to duck when the bullets start flying.
0DI0013096	He's caucasian, in his mid-30s, and extremely charismatic. It's that last part that we're counting on.
0DI0013097	The Kings are a bunch of young hoodlums who aren't inclined to listen to anyone, except him. Get him on our side, and the rest will fall in line.
0DI0013098	Go and talk to the King, try to convince him to put an end to this violence. Pacer's a punk, but he won't likely disobey a direct order.
0DI0013099	The King might not be open to the idea at first, so you may have to ingratiate yourself with him. Do whatever it takes.
0DI0013100	When it's done, one way or the other, report back here and we'll take it from there.
0DI0013101	I wish you luck. If you run into some difficulty and think you'd rather just take the shot with Pacer, that's fine too.
0DI0013102	I trust that Hsu will deal with the matter thoughtfully. Regardless, stay on your toes. There's no telling what will happen.
0DI0013103	Well then don't waste any more time here. Get going!
0DI0013104	Hey! Be careful, I don't like people hurting my patients.
0DI0013105	Enough! You were supposed to be helping them. It's best if you just leave now.
0DI0013106	You killed him! What kind of Doctor are you? Get out of here now!
0DI0013107	With business booming like it is and considering I'm the only person with medical experience in the camp, I could perhaps use a hand.
0DI0013108	Do you have any medical experience?
0DI0013109	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing my medical supplies. You have my thanks.
0DI0013110	Are you willing to look into this for me?
0DI0013111	So you've found out what's happening with the supplies?
0DI0013113	Excellent job. Where did you learn how to do all that? I don't think that I could have done much better myself. Very impressive.
0DI0013114	As for the men, they'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
0DI0013115	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Once again, you have my sincerest thanks.
0DI0013116	Not too bad, at least you didn't kill anyone.
0DI0013117	They'll recover soon and be back on the front lines in no time. Ahh... the circle of life.
0DI0013118	I'll send word to Major Polatli about your work here. Thanks.
0DI0013119	[SUCCEEDED] Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
0DI0013120	Since you have some medical experience I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
0DI0013121	Excellent. As you can see, we have a lot of injured troopers here and I haven't had time to look at all of them yet.
0DI0013122	Since you have some medical experience, I'd like you to examine them and see what you can do to treat them.
0DI0013123	Without any medical experience, you're not going to be much use to me in here.
0DI0013124	However, you can take this status report back to Major Polatli. It's a very important task and I think I can count on you.
0DI0013125	Is that so! I'll have to talk to Major Polatli about this right away.
0DI0013126	I appreciate you doing this for me. Here's a little something for your trouble, it's not much, but it's all I can spare.
0DI0013127	Let me know when you do find something out.
0DI0013128	That's too bad. These men really needed those supplies.
0DI0013129	Thanks for looking into this, I appreciate it even though you didn't find anything.
0DI0013130	That's too bad, but at least you didn't start hacking and slashing with a knife. I don't think Major Polatli could handle two doctors like that.
0DI0013131	I'll send word to Major Polatli.
0DI0013132	Thanks for your help. I'll take it from here.
0DI0013133	I'll send Major Polatli word about the situation here.
0DI0013134	You weren't much help, but thanks anyway... I guess.
0DI0013136	[FAILED] Ahh... I see. Unfortunately you're experience with "medicology" isn't going to be any use to me here.
0DI0013137	Just take this status report back to Major Polatli. That's all I need from you.
0DI0013138	With the Legion defeated, things are great now.
0DI0013139	Things are better now that the Legion at Nelson have been defeated.
0DI0013140	We're doing okay for the time being. Not as many serious injuries lately.
0DI0013141	If I was a mortician, business would be booming. As a Doctor, business is hard. Too many injuries that I can't do anything about.
0DI0013142	The Legion has been hitting us pretty hard lately. Lots of casualties, not many people I can save.
0DI0013144	Men have waged war on each other for countless centuries. Now is no different.
0DI0013145	People fight and die for what they believe in. I'm just here to patch them up so they can go on their merry way. Do no harm and all that.
0DI0013146	Someone with medical experience, I take it? It's not the best, but it does the job.
0DI0013147	I just wish I had the equipment and supplies to handle the number of injuries we have here.
0DI0013148	To make things worse, I think someone might be stealing my supplies.
0DI0013149	I'm doing the best I can considering the poor situation I find myself in.
0DI0013150	There's barely enough equipment or medicine to handle the number of injuries we have.
0DI0013152	Sometimes it does feel that way. I feel more like a mortician than a doctor.
0DI0013153	Often I just don't have the resources to handle the number of injuries here.
0DI0013155	The simple fact that I no longer have as many supplies as I should. I've been careful with them and I should have more than what remains.
0DI0013156	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured soldiers.
0DI0013157	Anything is possible, but that's unlikely.
0DI0013158	Unfortunately, I don't have the time to go searching for the missing supplies since I have my hands full with injured troopers.
0DI0013159	I may have my hands full here, but I'm anything but careless.
0DI0013161	That's an odd response if I've ever heard one.
0DI0013163	That would definitely be appreciated. You might want to ask around and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
0DI0013164	I store a variety of drugs here, but it looks like my supply of Hydra is diminishing rather quickly.
0DI0013165	Locked in a cabinet, here in the medical tent. I'm around most of the time, but I can't keep a constant watch on them.
0DI0013166	I remember coming in one morning and noticing that my supplies were lower than they should have been.
0DI0013167	I thought it might have been a mistake, but another morning I noticed the same thing.
0DI0013168	The camp is pretty dead at night, especially at 0200 hours when the guard shift changes. That'd be a good place to start looking.
0DI0013169	Perhaps you can come back and help me when you have more time.
0DI0013170	Okay then, what would you like to talk about?
0DI0013171	So the Major has you running errands for him. Well, we're short on personnel as well as supplies so we'll take all the help we can get.
0DI0013172	Not good. If we don't get more supplies, we're going to have to start using dirt for food and sticks and rocks for weapons.
0DI0013173	Hey, how'd you like to do something for me?
0DI0013174	Better now that all those Legion troops in Nelson are dead. The NCR might actually have a chance of kicking their asses after all.
0DI0013175	Things are still pretty damn rough, but we're keeping it together.
0DI0013176	I take it my men were dead. It's a high price to pay, but these supplies will save a few lives here.
0DI0013177	Thanks for finding these. You should check in with the Major, he'll want to know about this.
0DI0013178	Damn it all... I sent some men out to get these supplies, but they never returned. I guess the Legion got them on their way back.
0DI0013179	At least we have the supplies. It's not much, but every little bit counts.
0DI0013181	Me? I've been doing this shit for far too long and have been in too many battles to remember.
0DI0013182	Still... this has got to be one of the worst situations I've been in. Not too much I can do about it but do my job and do it right.
0DI0013183	Have you changed your mind? Are you willing to help me out with something real simple?
0DI0013184	I want you to collect NCR dogtags from our fallen troopers. That way I can keep track of who's gone and how to reallocate our supplies.
0DI0013185	Suit yourself. Let me know if you change your mind.
0DI0013186	Hey, you've been a big help. I wanted to give you something for helping me out. It's not much, but here you go.
0DI0013187	Good work. If you find any more, you know where to find me.
0DI0013188	It's easy. Just bring back any NCR dogtags you find and I'll try to make it worth your while.
0DI0013190	Bad? I've been doing this a long time and I haven't been in many places that were worse than this.
0DI0013191	We've been out here on the front lines for a long time without any reinforcements or resupplies. That's what I need your help for.
0DI0013192	I sent some troops out to find more supplies, but they never returned. I need you to track them down and help them bring back the supplies.
0DI0013193	Is that a joke? Have you looked around? Massive casualties, constant raids, barely any food or equipment... does that sound alright to you?
0DI0013194	Shit, we haven't had a proper resupply since god knows when. Last time I sent troops out to find supplies, they never returned.
0DI0013195	The Major sent you because we don't have any men to spare. So why don't you make yourself useful and find those troops and supplies for me.
0DI0013196	The Major let me send out some troops to gather supplies, but unfortunately they never returned. I'm guessing they ran into some trouble on the way.
0DI0013197	You can help by finding the troops and assisting them in bringing back any supplies they found.
0DI0013198	I sent them to HELIOS One to see if they had any supplies they could spare. They've got to be somewhere between here and there.
0DI0013199	I'd try searching the main road, or checking with the men at HELIOS One to see if they know anything.
0DI0013200	It's dangerous, but not as bad now that we've taken back Nelson from the Legion.
0DI0013201	Of course it's dangerous! Damn Legion raiding parties have been giving us hell ever since they took over Nelson.
0DI0013202	Hell, my men probably got ambushed by a raiding party! But we need those supplies, and we need them badly.
0DI0013203	Make it quick, I don't have time to stand around talking all day long.
0DI0013204	We really need those supplies, so don't take your sweet time finding them.
0DI0013205	No, can't say I do. I've got my own problems to worry about.
0DI0013206	I'm short staffed and I don't have the time to take care of some issues around the camp.
0DI0013207	I need someone to talk to a few of the officers and help them resolve some of the problems around here.
0DI0013208	I've got the Legion at Nelson breathing down my neck and not enough men or supplies to get this camp into fighting shape so we can strike back.
0DI0013210	If I can get this place in order, then I can focus our efforts on taking back Nelson from the Legion.
0DI0013211	And the more that gets done around here, the more resources I'll be able to put into assaulting Nelson.
0DI0013212	Good, let's not waste time then. Our biggest problems right now are supplies and troops, and the Legion is draining us of both.
0DI0013213	Quartermaster Mayes has been complaining to me nonstop about the lack of supplies, but unfortunately we aren't getting a resupply any time soon.
0DI0013214	I want you speak with him and see if there's anything you can do for him.
0DI0013215	I'll be here if you change your mind.
0DI0013216	Not really, but we don't have much choice. If you help out more around the camp I could spare some additional men for the battle.
0DI0013217	We have a decent amount of men, but it'll be a close battle. If you help out more around the camp, I could probably spare some additional troops.
0DI0013218	We've been reinforced fairly well, thanks to your help. I'd say the odds are in our favor.
0DI0013219	However, if you help out a little more around the camp, we'd be in a good enough position to send our best men to help retake Nelson.
0DI0013220	Thanks to your help, we have more than enough men to take those Legion bastards.
0DI0013221	Well, with that over with and the Legion forces at Nelson defeated, we finally have some breathing room.
0DI0013222	Now we can actually try to strengthen our forces along the river and prepare for the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam.
0DI0013223	With the help you've given us, we're doing a little bit better, but we still have the Legion forces at Nelson to deal with.
0DI0013224	If we can retake Nelson, that will be a huge help to our efforts in this area and give us an advantage at Hoover Dam.
0DI0013225	The Legion forces have been reinforced and are looking pretty strong. It's going to be a tough fight.
0DI0013226	The Legion forces are hurting pretty bad, actually. This is the perfect opportunity for us.
0DI0013227	Reports have the Legion forces at Nelson sizable, but not insurmountable.
0DI0013228	I heard. The extra supplies will help for a short time, but that only solves one of our problems.
0DI0013229	With all the Legion raids lately, we're running low on troops that can still fight. Some are injured, but even more are dead.
0DI0013230	I want you to check in with Dr. Richards and see if he needs any help getting our troops back on the front line.
0DI0013231	I heard from Dr. Richards. Too bad you weren't able to help him with anything, but we all can't be doctors.
0DI0013232	I heard from Dr. Richards and I wouldn't call what you did helping. We need all the men we can get on the frontline.
0DI0013233	I heard from Dr. Richards. I'm glad you were at least some use to him.
0DI0013234	Dr. Richards said you did a good job in there. That's mighty high praise coming from him.
0DI0013235	Excellent. Killing the Legion commanders in Nelson will severely cripple the Legion forces and allow us to take back the city.
0DI0013236	Meet up with Sergeant Cooper just outside Nelson. He will assist you in reclaiming Nelson.
0DI0013237	Come back when you're ready.
0DI0013239	The initial reports have come back already. Excellent work. This will buy us a lot of breathing room to get back on our feet here.
0DI0013241	You have my thanks, we owe you a lot.
0DI0013242	I'd like to give you something to thank you for helping us.
0DI0013243	Missing medical supplies? No, uhh... I don't know anything about that.
0DI0013244	My problem? My problem is we're all going to die.
0DI0013245	The Legion may be gone from Nelson, but there's still a whole fucking army of them out there.
0DI0013246	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die in this war.
0DI0013247	So why don't you just leave me alone.
0DI0013249	We're out of food, we're out of men, and we're out of time. The Legion is right outside waiting to kill us all.
0DI0013250	Today... tomorrow... it doesn't matter, we're all going to die here.
0DI0013252	You kidding me, man? How are things? They're all fucked up, that's how things are!
0DI0013253	Everyone is either starving or dying out here. Left out to dry by the rest of the NCR. Fuck this place.
0DI0013254	I'd rather be anywhere else but here.
0DI0013255	Here you go. Thanks, I owe you big time.
0DI0013256	Fine. Be like that.
0DI0013257	[SUCCEEDED] What?! Oh shit... how the fuck?! Oh man, I'm in some deep shit now.
0DI0013259	[FAILED] No, no that's not necessary. I'm fine. Just a little stressed out, that's all.
0DI0013260	Uh... look, it's not what you think. I can explain everything, if you'll just hear me out.
0DI0013261	Uh... yeah, sure, no problem.
0DI0013262	Have you looked around? Have you seen what's going on here? What we're going through?
0DI0013263	This place is hell. I've seen my all my friends butchered by the Legion in front of my very eyes. I can still hear their screams at night.
0DI0013264	All I wanted was a little escape, so I took some drugs to help me do that. Is that so bad?
0DI0013265	Hey look, I just wanted to forget about all this stuff happening around here for a little while, that's all!
0DI0013266	What happens now?
0DI0013267	But it sure as hell is going to make me feel better for a little while, and that's all I wanted.
0DI0013268	So what happens now?
0DI0013269	I... uh... I never... I never thought about that.
0DI0013270	But look, I needed this. I needed to escape for just a little while. I needed this...
0DI0013272	Yeah, see... I just needed to escape for a little while. To not think about all this stuff going on here.
0DI0013274	I knew you wouldn't understand! You haven't been here! You haven't been through all the horrors that we go through every day!
0DI0013275	So what are you going to do about it?
0DI0013276	Haven't you heard anything I've said?! Don't you understand?!
0DI0013277	Hey, maybe I can change your mind. I still have some drugs left over. They're all yours if you let me go.
0DI0013278	What? You want me to turn myself in?
0DI0013279	Why the hell should I do that?
0DI0013280	Alright. Here, I'll give you some of what I stole, just don't mention this to anyone.
0DI0013281	What? Hey sure! You got a deal. Thanks, I owe you big time.
0DI0013282	[FAILED] No. That's not going to happen.
0DI0013283	The Chief? But, he's a legend! I guess if he's got a plan behind it all, who am I to question it? I won't say a word about it to anyone else.
0DI0013284	What, you mean you're not part of the act? Heh. Sorry. Thought you were the heckler Garret hired to spice up the shows.
0DI0013285	Whoa Nelly! There's insult comedy and then there's psycho comedy! I guess you aren't the heckler Garret hired to spice up my show. What do you want?
0DI0013286	Come on, stay in character! You're supposed to be heckling me!
0DI0013287	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, not bad! Your timing's terrible and you got no style, but you might make it as a professional heckler.
0DI0013288	[FAILED] That doesn't even make any sense! You're not the heckler Garret hired to spice up the show, are you?
0DI0013289	So, what do you want, then?
0DI0013290	Yeah, no, we were hoping to find someone who was actually... what's the word... funny? What do you want, kid?
0DI0013291	I'm not suirprised, he's a stubborn, greedy bastard.
0DI0013293	Hell, what ain't the trouble with the Legion? This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up
0DI0013294	Captured a bunch of gear and took the town. Couple of troopers too. Got 'em crucified down near the center of town.
0DI0013295	You're one of them "special" folks, ain't you? They ain't... real snakes, see? They're Legion soldiers.
0DI0013296	I just called 'em snakes because they're low down and sneaky. Like a snake.
0DI0013297	Anyway, we always have trouble with the Legion 'round here. This time, they jumped the camp in Nelson while the troopers were setting up.
0DI0013299	Eesh, is my act that bad, or are you just that dumb? Yeah, that's right - got me a nice, juicy contract with the management.
0DI0013300	Either you need to get your eyes checked or that "fame is fleeting" thing is true - and since I happen to be world famous, you must be going blind.
0DI0013301	Name's Hadrian. Bet you never saw a ghoul in a suit before, huh? Course, you don't exactly strike me as the worldly type.
0DI0013302	Too bad I got this ironclad contract with the Garrets. They'll never let me out of it.
0DI0013303	Like I told you, I can't go anywhere without getting out of my contract with Garret first. Talk to him, maybe he'll cut me loose if you ask nice.
0DI0013304	Really? You mean I'm finally out of this shithole? That's great! Thank you!
0DI0013305	Sure, why not? Nothing left for me here since Garret's dead.
0DI0013307	Jeez, some people....
0DI0013308	All right, but make it snappy, this isn't exactly a lucrative career enterprise here.
0DI0013309	If you believe my mother, since she first laid eyes on me. First thing she said was "Boy! That's a funny-looking kid!"
0DI0013310	I guess I got a face only a mother could love, because nobody else would give me the time of day.
0DI0013311	Maybe you can help me, see, I can never tell when it's lunchtime.
0DI0013312	Yeah? Hey, you're all right! Tell him I'll do it for a hundred a night! No! Fifty! No, twenty! Ten!
0DI0013313	Just don't rob me, and I'll do it!
0DI0013314	Hey, I'm just happy to get any kind of work I can.
0DI0013315	That's exactly my point, kid. Exactly my point.
0DI0013316	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic fella I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
0DI0013317	As the bar!
0DI0013318	Woof! If you're not the most sarcastic dame I ever met, your standards are so low they could use you at the Annual Gomorrah Saucy Limbo Competition.
0DI0013320	A break's better than a shot - less chance of lead poisoning. Hey, if you know any gigs hiring, I'll work cheap. Real cheap. I'll take peanuts!
0DI0013321	Hey, now, come on! I prefer the term "outdoor entertainment bonanza." Besides, have you seen the caps whores make in this town? I should be so lucky!
0DI0013322	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, geez, what was I thinking? You're right, I oughta go in there with a cool head, tell him how much I'm really worth.
0DI0013323	[FAILED] Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but you don't know what it's like.
0DI0013324	They offer me a roof over my head and half a Fancy Lad and I'll fold like a classy napkin.
0DI0013325	Sweet daisies, here I come!
0DI0013326	Hey, okay, but don't take too long, I don't want to miss this!
0DI0013327	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's your cut.
0DI0013328	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking! Now take your cut and stop being crazy.
0DI0013329	Any day, baby, any day.
0DI0013333	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle.
0DI0013334	[SUCCEEDED] All right, you drive a hard bargain, baby. Tell you what, I'll bump him up to 3,000. That's fair. Here's the difference for your cut.
0DI0013335	[FAILED] Baby, you have got to be joking!
0DI0013336	Oh, well, that's all just a big misunderstanding, see.
0DI0013337	Mr. Bishop, well, he owed me a lot of money, and, y'know, he's a busy guy, so I sort of figured I'd just...take it off his hands.
0DI0013338	You don't know Mr. Bishop. He's not like the other bosses up there. He knows the Wasteland like the back of his hand, and he likes to wander it.
0DI0013339	I knew if I didn't get way the hell away from New Reno, he'd run me down like a dog.
0DI0013340	They already have that pig McCaffery working for them. Do they need another guard?
0DI0013341	Still trying to convince me, huh?
0DI0013342	Are you uncomfortable? My servos may require adjustment.
0DI0013343	Excellent. Awaiting further orders.
0DI0013344	Numbness will subside in several minutes. Awaiting further orders.
0DI0013345	That will be 10 caps, please.
0DI0013346	I am sorry, but you must procure a room first. Please return when you have lodging arranged.
0DI0013347	Thank you. I will meet you in your room.
0DI0013348	Servos active!
0DI0013349	Very well. Please return if you require further service.
0DI0013350	You did? Hot damn! I been looking for one of those for years!
0DI0013351	For my customers, I mean... I'm not into that kind of shit.
0DI0013352	It is? It will? My god! Imagine the possibilities!
0DI0013353	It didn't happen to come with an owner's manual, did it? Aw, forget it - trial and error should do it.
0DI0013362	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, I'm amazed you even found the thing in the first place.
0DI0013363	Here is double for your trouble. Those freaky fetishists ought to be satisfied now.
0DI0013366	[FAILED] I don't think so. We agreed to a price, and that's what you're getting.
0DI0013367	[SUCCEEDED] You're right, you're right! Something like this, it's worth a little extra because it's going to keep on satisfying you...
0DI0013368	Those disgusting fetishists, I mean. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
0DI0013371	[FAILED] Believe me - these things is a mess of trouble to keep maintained! They wear out on you, at the worst possible moment!
0DI0013372	So say those disgusting fetishists, anyway. Something wrong with someone if they got to fuck a machine.
0DI0013374	No, sir. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
0DI0013375	No, ma'am. I'm an independent trader from Arizona.
0DI0013376	Not at all - they're my best customers. As long as you don't try to sell 'em chems or alcohol, they treat you fair.
0DI0013377	Hell, I don't even need to travel with guards most of the time in Legion territory. All the bandits are dead or run off.
0DI0013378	Between having to hire protection and getting slapped with taxes, it's more profitable to stick to Arizona and New Mexico.
0DI0013379	But, I do cross the river from time to time when an opportunity comes along.
0DI0013382	Three years and counting. If I could just get across the river, I'd be free. Not that I'd try it - I've seen what happens when you get caught.
0DI0013384	A small town in New Mexico. The Legion burned it a few years back - that's how I ended up here.
0DI0013385	Routine active. Please return later.
0DI0013386	Exterminate!
0DI0013387	The Legion's got a major crossing point down at Cottonwood Cove, so we keep an eye on them from up here.
0DI0013388	If McCarran would send us some more men, we could do more than watch.
0DI0013389	Sorry, it's just... you look like his type, y'know? You got that hard-ass wasteland explorer thing going on.
0DI0013390	Please, no!
0DI0013391	"Robbed" is such an ugly word. It's more like I took care of a payroll problem for him.
0DI0013392	Also, I might have... umm... sort of... plowed his daughter. A little.
0DI0013393	I figured it might take him a while to understand his accounting error and cool down a little.
0DI0013396	Thanks, but if Bishop finds me and I don't have his money, my balls are going to be on his trophy wall.
0DI0013397	I guess I don't. That's why I'm here.
0DI0013399	You'd do that? Great! I really appreciate that!
0DI0013400	Son, where I come from, a man doesn't just walk up to another man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
0DI0013401	Darling, where I come from, a lady doesn't just walk up to a man and offer him a job without even knowing him. What's your game?
0DI0013402	Like I said, I got no reason to take your charity. Not till I know you better.
0DI0013403	Hmm.... Maybe it's time to give these tired old bones a rest. All right, show me what you've got.
0DI0013404	Yeah this is Clanden, this guy is one sick motherfucker. The way I see it you have a few options.
0DI0013405	Maybe you could use what's on these tapes to get him by himself, or maybe you could use them to leverage him out of the casino.
0DI0013406	I figured you might have that problem. That guy is pretty much a mystery. I did some asking around about him, on the down-low of course.
0DI0013407	Turns out the bosses' plans are right fucked without him. Killing him would probably work wonders, just don't let anyone see you do it.
0DI0013408	Cachino? Yeah I've heard the name. Not sure why he'd send you to me, is he helping out with room service or something?
0DI0013409	All kinds of business, most of it is ours.
0DI0013410	I'll show you what I have, but if it doesn't rock my world then we're going to have a long talk.
0DI0013411	Hunting and killing, plain and simple.
0DI0013412	Bingo. Now if you're done asking stupid questions, I have more important things to do.
0DI0013413	Yes, sir. Fisto reporting for duty.
0DI0013414	Please assume the position.
0DI0013415	Yes, ma'am. Fisto reporting for duty.
0DI0013417	I am programmed for your pleasure. Please assume the position.
0DI0013418	Fisto will report to the Atomic Wrangler for further orders.
0DI0013421	Yes, ma'am!
0DI0013422	Allright! I won't turn down a freebie. Shit, these days I almost can't pay my own in this two-faced, goddamn city any more.
0DI0013423	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha! - damn straight! This is about the last place in this fucking city where I can burrow without having to look over my shoulder.
0DI0013424	[FAILED] Shit, not even down this rat-hole can I drink in peace? I don't need no friends. I just need you to get the fuck out of my sight.
0DI0013425	And I want a cute patron of this shit-hole to blow me over the pool-table, but that ain't happening either, is it?
0DI0013426	I'm in - ask.
0DI0013429	[SUCCEEDED] Hey... I'm just worked up, okay. You're tough, right? You won't care about my stupid rambling then?
0DI0013430	Uh-huh. Sorry stranger, just not sure I trust that kind of charity from somebody I don't even know.
0DI0013431	Well, at least you're honest, I guess. Sorry, I just don't take charity from strangers.
0DI0013432	Much obliged to you, friend.
0DI0013433	[SUCCEEDED] I suppose it's only right you get a little something for your troubles. Here - my daddy left me this gun. Guess I don't need it no more.
0DI0013434	[FAILED] I'm sure Mr. Torini already took care of your fee. Maybe you ought to talk to him. Much obliged for the opportunity, friend. See you around.
0DI0013435	No apologies needed, friend - I'm sure there's somebody out there'll appreciate my singing.
0DI0013436	Just about my whole life, ever since my daddy left ma and me and went off to roam the wastes.
0DI0013437	Long time ago, now. I never even knew him. Ma always said he was a mysterious feller, always traveling on in secret.
0DI0013438	Looking for a story, huh? All right, what can I tell you?
0DI0013439	Well, I was born in a little town out Montana way. Me and Ma didn't have much, ever since my pa up and left.
0DI0013440	Anything else you'd like to know?
0DI0013441	That he did. Never did know why. Ma always said he was a real mysterious feller, even when he was with her. Like he was a stranger sometimes.
0DI0013442	Maybe that's how you was raised, but where I come from a man does right by his wife and child or he ain't no kinda man at all.
0DI0013443	No sir, I'm 28. Why?
0DI0013444	Maybe. Maybe I just never felt like I belonged back home.
0DI0013445	Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that don't change the fact that it wasn't right.
0DI0013446	It sure wasn't easy. Ma worked her fingers to the bone to make sure we had enough to survive, and I worked the coal mines from when I was fifteen.
0DI0013447	After Ma died, I guess I wanted to find my Pa and get some answers from him. Been out here looking ever since, but he ain't an easy man to find.
0DI0013448	I suppose there's that, but a man oughta know his own Pa, and a woman oughtn't have to work herself to an early grave to provide for her family.
0DI0013450	Can't say as I really know. Maybe I'll just ask him why. Maybe I'll punch him right in the mouth.
0DI0013451	Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
0DI0013452	Maybe I will. Or maybe I'll just ask him why he left. Hell, the more I talk about it, the more the whole damn thing sounds like a dumb idea.
0DI0013453	Maybe I should. Don't suppose you know anyplace a feller with a guitar might find a job, huh?
0DI0013454	Ah well. It was worth a shot.
0DI0013455	There's an intruder in the dish hut! Get over there and kill whoever it is, you fools!
0DI0013456	Two of the players, Troike and Clanden, have some problems that need to be solved. Ask them what they need.
0DI0013457	We have two contractors, a guy named Troike and one named Clanden. They've both been running into some issues.
0DI0013458	The plan is called Racket, but that's all the info you're going to get out of me right now.
0DI0013459	We call it Racket, and it is going to show Not-At-Home and every other fucker in our business just what the Family can do.
0DI0013461	Okay, let's chat.
0DI0013462	Alright, come back any time.
0DI0013463	Come find me when you have something you need to say.
0DI0013467	As one of our captains, Cachino was kind of like a project manager. He made sure people had what they needed to get their jobs done.
0DI0013468	Cachino was my Man Friday. He took care of what needed to be taken care of. Had no idea what a dumb son of a bitch he was.
0DI0013469	A little bit of this, and a little bit of that.
0DI0013470	I'm a close friend of some of the Family around here. I do some independent contracting around the casino, and they set me up with this great room.
0DI0013471	Oh, that's great. I could sure use some help. You see, I do explosives, and they have a special need for some big explosions.
0DI0013472	Problem is, there's no way I can get enough explosives to do the type of damage they're looking to do, much less get it all deployed.
0DI0013473	Blowing shit up, of course. Thing is, they don't need things to blow up, they need people to die in a fairly large area in a fairly small timeframe.
0DI0013474	There are other ways to kill people with bombs aside from explosions, if you know what I mean.
0DI0013475	Well, since I can't hope to get all the killing done that they need to get done with bombs, I've been thinking about some alternatives.
0DI0013476	[SUCCEEDED] Spot on, you're a bright one.
0DI0013477	[FAILED] Yeah, I could  build a nuke, but I'm not looking to turn the Mojave into a giant mirror.
0DI0013478	No, I was thinking something more subtle.
0DI0013479	I figure chlorine gas is the way to go. It's toxic, and I can rig it up to do a whole lot of killing in a fairly short timeframe.
0DI0013480	Yeah, of course. Ask away.
0DI0013481	Okay, come find me whenever you want to chat.
0DI0013482	I'm not sure exactly. There is a swimming pool at The Ultra-Luxe, so they probably have some, although I doubt they'd appreciate you taking it.
0DI0013483	But they must get it from somewhere, maybe try out in Freeside somewhere.
0DI0013484	Hey, you know what I need, find it or I'll find another way to get it. You're the one that offered.
0DI0013485	Great. Yeah, this is just what I needed.
0DI0013486	Yeah, I heard you might be coming. I appreciate the help, I'm in kind of a fix.
0DI0013487	I help the Omertas get guns without the NCR catching wind of it. I need someone to cover my ass with the last shipment.
0DI0013488	The Fiends, a group of raiders freaked out on chems, stole my last shipment before I could get it into Vegas.
0DI0013489	I could sure use some help getting it from them.
0DI0013490	I'm pretty proud of myself. It's a stroke of genius, if I can be so modest.
0DI0013491	The whole arrangement starts with an old buddy of mine in the Republic. He's responsible for packing and shipping supplies to the NCR on the Strip.
0DI0013492	He marks some containers as food and medical and packs them with guns and other shit.
0DI0013493	From there it just took a couple greased palms to get someone to let me cherry pick a container or two out of every shipment. Easy as pie.
0DI0013498	Sorry, that's my business and no one else's.
0DI0013499	What the hell? You got this from the Fiends already? Hot damn, you really are good. Thanks, this is exactly what I needed.
0DI0013500	Great, thanks.
0DI0013501	Okay, what do you need to know?
0DI0013503	Alright, you know where to find me.
0DI0013504	Well, hot shit. Thank you. Must have been a real bitch getting it from the Fiends, thanks.
0DI0013505	Those fools are from NCR. I love seeing those squatters in agony.
0DI0013506	We were doing just fine before those shits came here and made a mess of things. We don't need NCR eggheads wandering around confusing things.
0DI0013507	[SUCCEEDED] Um... I think that sounds reasonable... As long as you aren't going to do anything dangerous with it, I guess I can spare some.
0DI0013508	[FAILED] I don't know much about biology, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't make a damn bit of sense.
0DI0013509	Funny you should mention that, I do have a bit of chlorine here.
0DI0013510	Normally I wouldn't sell that to just anyone, but you were so helpful getting us Omerta business again, I'll set some aside for you to buy.
0DI0013511	I do, but that's some dangerous stuff. I don't sell it to just anyone, I have to be a responsible businessman.
0DI0013512	You're the boss, boss.
0DI0013513	Easy as a heart transplant.
0DI0013516	I buy that.
0DI0013519	Makes sense to me.
0DI0013520	I hear you.
0DI0013522	No need to get bossy, dear. Grandma can hear you.
0DI0013523	Just like you said five minutes ago. Don't worry, boss, I got it.
0DI0013524	Understood. I won't hesitate.
0DI0013525	Shoot first, poke bodies later. Got it, boss.
0DI0013526	I'm already doing that.
0DI0013527	Good. Makes things simple.
0DI0013528	You mean like, even more?
0DI0013529	Beats waiting till they shoot me first.
0DI0013534	I'll do like I'm doing then - except I'll try to smile less.
0DI0013535	What, was I not doing it right before?
0DI0013536	Got a habit of repeating yourself.
0DI0013537	Never get tired of hearing that.
0DI0013538	Now we're talking.
0DI0013539	With a smile.
0DI0013540	You can keep repeating yourself all day, dearie, but I remember what you said.
0DI0013541	That's eactly what Leo told me to do!
0DI0013543	That's sounding dangerously close to a plan, boss.
0DI0013544	I'm hardly a whirlwind of death when left to my own devices, but all right.
0DI0013546	I'll follow your lead.
0DI0013548	I like this plan where you're the decoy.
0DI0013549	What a coincidence! I've been doing that all this time!
0DI0013550	[Rex is already waiting for you to attack enemies first.]
0DI0013552	Thought I was already holding back.
0DI0013553	Heard you the first time, no need to repeat yourself.
0DI0013554	Guess it's leftovers for me.
0DI0013555	Slim pickings, but all right.
0DI0013556	Yes, dearie, that's what grandma's been doing. And Leo isn't happy about it, either.
0DI0013557	Ohh, Leo's not going to like that....
0DI0013558	No! I won't let you have my Raul!
0DI0013559	Family, the fucking Omertas. Are you new around here or what?
0DI0013560	Zoara is our club. The Family club. If you got business with the bosses, you can go upstairs to talk to them.
0DI0013561	What business is that?
0DI0013562	Good, get lost.
0DI0013563	Yeah, give me what you got.
0DI0013564	What the fuck? Oh shit. Yeah, go talk to Nero or Big Sal upstairs. They'll want to see this. I'll send Cachino to the office as well.
0DI0013565	It's my fucking job, and no one sees the bosses unless I give the okay.
0DI0013566	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, calm down. I'm just doing my job. Go talk to the bosses, one of them should be upstairs. Look for Big Sal or Nero.
0DI0013567	I'll tell Cachino to head upstairs.
0DI0013568	[FAILED] I don't know who the fuck you think you are, but this is my gate and I'm the gatekeeper.
0DI0013569	Do you now? Let's see it.
0DI0013570	Like hell you do, show me what you have or get the fuck out of my face.
0DI0013571	Here, now give it over.
0DI0013572	What the fuck is this shit? Cachino, you dumb motherfucker. Yeah, we are going to have some words with Cachino. Meet me in my office.
0DI0013573	[SUCCEEDED] Ok, that sounds fair.
0DI0013574	[FAILED] You're real funny. Man, I haven't had a laugh like that in days. Thanks. Now, let's get real here.
0DI0013575	[SUCCEEDED] This'll be worth your while. I wouldn't be here talking to you otherwise.
0DI0013576	[FAILED] I'm not sure if you're funny or just stupid, but I'm not amused. Make me a real offer and we can talk.
0DI0013577	Make it snappy.
0DI0013578	Thanks for wasting my time.
0DI0013579	He'll be handled in the way the Family handles these situations. I want you there for this, come meet me in my office.
0DI0013580	Come to my office and you'll see.
0DI0013581	Did he now? Funny that, more backstabbing. Yeah, we got something big planned. I was actually hoping to jaw at you about that.
0DI0013582	Now that Cachino is gone, we need some help wrapping some things up, and you seem like the resourceful type.
0DI0013584	Why didn't Victor intervene sooner, you mean?
0DI0013585	Goodsprings is a bit too far away for me to reliably control a Securitron agent by remote. I can send and receive packets of data, at best.
0DI0013586	Victor's combat algorithms determined the proper course of action. Benny and his thugs were more than a match for a lone Securitron.
0DI0013587	When he alerted me, I instructed him to approach the site after Benny and the others had departed.
0DI0013588	To achieve my aims, I require a capable human agent to perform certain... tasks.
0DI0013589	I knew Benny was ambitious, even ruthless. But I believed he would do the job, so long as he was incentivized appropriately.
0DI0013590	Obviously, I miscalculated his drive for supremacy. But in any case, you've come along - a more-than-suitable replacement.
0DI0013591	I have to think that he found out about the Platinum Chip and mistakenly convinced himself that he could use it to his own ends.
0DI0013592	One of the problems of a tribal work force, I'm afraid. No intuitive understanding of how complex technologies can be.
0DI0013593	That's simply not true.
0DI0013594	I am the only person to hold any rights pertaining to the Chip. I designed it, and I paid for it - dearly.
0DI0013595	To develop that Chip, I spent a sum of U.S. dollars - not the bottle caps that pass as currency these days - but a sum beyond counting.
0DI0013596	For decades, I paid salvagers to comb the ruins for it.  And when it was finally discovered, tens of thousands of caps spent to have it brought here.
0DI0013597	We know how that turned out. Complete your contract and it will be the last time I pay for the Chip. Save your questions for then.
0DI0013598	You realize you were just one of many couriers, the rest of them dummies, so to speak?
0DI0013599	Add to that many thousands of caps worth of mercenary protection to screen your avenue of approach.
0DI0013600	Had I used an armed caravan to transport the Chip, I might as well have been announcing to the world "this is important. Attack this!"
0DI0013601	I didn't want to attract the attention of groups like the Great Khans or the Brotherhood of Steel. Alas, the real threat was closer to home.
0DI0013602	Frontal assaults on casinos? Not good for business.
0DI0013603	In any case, Benny would see it coming. And all he'd have to do is hold the Chip up and point a pistol at it.
0DI0013604	Our foremost advantage is that Benny doesn't know that I know he has the Chip - let's not squander it.
0DI0013605	Then Vegas shall be lost, and with it, mankind's best hope for long-term survival.
0DI0013606	To your untrained eyes, it may look as though mankind is making a comeback. In the NCR, you have something that remsembles a nation state.
0DI0013607	Savage as it is, in Caesar's Legion, you have an organized society. But neither of these offer a future. They're regurgitations of the past.
0DI0013608	Bring me the Platinum Chip, and in ten years you'll hardly recognize this city.
0DI0013609	It won't be easy... Benny is always surrounded by at least four bodyguards - except when he's in his private suite on the 13th floor of the Tops...
0DI0013610	If you were to approach Benny in public, you might be able to leverage his fear of exposure to make him agree to meet with you in private.
0DI0013611	Sneaking into Benny's suite on the 13th floor would be very difficult... but not impossible.
0DI0013612	There might be guards. Certainly there'd be a sturdy lock on his front door.
0DI0013613	It's more complicated than that. The Chairmen share what you might call a... tribal affinity.
0DI0013614	Look for a man named Swank, Benny's second-in-command. He's always been a reliable, if unimaginative, employee.
0DI0013615	Do your best to convince him that you're working under my auspices. If you have evidence of Benny's crimes, show it to him.
0DI0013616	By contract, Securitrons are to enter the casinos only when invited by the Three Families or if other extraordinary circumstances arise.
0DI0013617	The moment I send one into the Tops, Benny will know I'm on to him.
0DI0013618	We can discuss this in greater detail at another time. Suffice it to say that when my Securitrons detected NCR scouts at Hoover Dam, I took action.
0DI0013619	I recruited a tribal force to supplement my Securitrons and renovated the Strip just in time to welcome the NCR as it marched into the region.
0DI0013620	Instead of war, a treaty was negotiated. And the money started to pour in.
0DI0013621	Tribals, nothing special. Spend some time in the casinos and you'll catch the gist of each Family.
0DI0013622	The only requirement was that the tribals agree to follow my directions. Some, like the Khans and the Kings, did not - and suffered for it.
0DI0013623	<growl...>
0DI0013624	Santiago knows not of what you speak.
0DI0013625	Wait! Here is a full refund! Don't kill me!
0DI0013627	I'm kidding, ha ha! There is no discount. Sorry!... Please don't kill me.
0DI0013628	I can give you this tip, though. I have seen a few people go to the pawn shop then somehow get through the south gate to Vegas without caps.
0DI0013629	Coincidence? I think not. Ralph and Mick have something going on there, but they refuse to let me in on it.
0DI0013630	I appologize, friend, but that is absurd given the value of this information.
0DI0013631	[SUCCEEDED] 25 caps will do. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'. He will set you up.
0DI0013632	[FAILED] Sorry, my friend. 50 caps is the price to be a VIP.
0DI0013633	Sir, Santiago told you. Santiago has no debts.
0DI0013634	No! Don't!
0DI0013635	You won't! I'll be clean as a whistle!
0DI0013636	[SUCCEEDED] Here, I'll pay you back extra! I'm sorry!
0DI0013638	[FAILED] I don't have any more than that to give! I'm sorry!
0DI0013639	If I had two caps to scrape together I'd buy the materials to make my own, but my damn hands won't stop shaking.
0DI0013640	This guy named Dixon. Something about him seems sketchy, but I can't stop now. Last time I stopped, I felt like I was going to turn inside out.
0DI0013641	At this point, I'm mostly buying his stuff just so I don't feel sick. Speaking of which, do you have any spare caps?
0DI0013642	We've got the basics covered, but now that you mention it, we have had unusual requests from some of our wealthier customers.
0DI0013643	If you can recruit escorts to match these customers'... proclivities... I'd be willing to pay you finder's fees.
0DI0013644	I still need those escorts if you're interested.
0DI0013645	Our wealthiest client has a thing for ghouls, and a thing for cowboys. He wants an escort who can satisfy both fetishes.
0DI0013646	Plenty of customers have said they'd be willing to pay extra for a suave talker, someone who can fake the "boyfriend experience" real good.
0DI0013647	And then there's these disgusting robot fetishists you may have heard about? Well, those creeps want a sexbot.
0DI0013648	Have you ever run across a sexbot? Not that I'd ever want one within 100 feet of me - but I gotta be a businessman about it.
0DI0013649	Come on back and see me if you change your mind.
0DI0013650	Just direct them to the Wrangler. I'll pay you when they show up.
0DI0013651	Oh, I'd still be the pimp - you'd just be my pissant recruiter is all. Let me know if you change your mind.
0DI0013652	Just don't rough up the merchandise before delivery - you break it, you bought it.
0DI0013653	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you've got yourself a deal. Find escorts to fill the positions and I'll pay double.
0DI0013654	[FAILED] Sorry, double is out of the question.
0DI0013656	[FAILED] Sorry, but that is the best I can do.
0DI0013659	You aren't the first poor sucker who's come in here saying that. We don't do discounts here.
0DI0013660	Sounds like you were ripped off. I'd go get your money back from Santiago.
0DI0013661	Then the King has no interest in seeing you.
0DI0013662	[SUCCEEDED] You know what? I like you. Half of the people around here, they forget who runs this place.
0DI0013663	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin miss him.
0DI0013664	[FAILED] No, trust me, the King will want to see you if I want you to see him. Come back when you figure out how the world works.
0DI0013665	Really? Oh, I wasn't expecting you to agree so easily. That's great!
0DI0013668	Okay. No rush, but the sooner the Followers can learn about Mr. House's technology, the better.
0DI0013669	Good to hear, but it looks like the bug was deactivated a few minutes after it went online.
0DI0013670	It looks like House has some kind of countermeasure in place to prevent evesdropping on his network. We'll get through eventually, just not today.
0DI0013671	Here are those medical supplies I promised. Hopefully you won't need to use them. Take care.
0DI0013672	It looks like we've started getting reports from the tower's network! I'm sure the others will be able to make some sense of this.
0DI0013673	Oh what the hell? The bug went offline! Dammit!
0DI0013674	I swear to God that old man has thought of everything. Well, it looks like this was all for nothing, but you did your best. I appreciate the help.
0DI0013675	We haven't received any information yet from the bug.  Please report back when you've found a way into House's network.
0DI0013676	But what about those nasty critters?
0DI0013677	But, what about the R O U S's?
0DI0013678	Very well, but please do be careful.
0DI0013679	I will be returning to California to start anew. If anything is left of the caravan, please keep it as a show of thanks for your kindness.
0DI0013680	It is so rare to meet good friendly people in the wastes. Here is the last location of the caravan. Good luck.
0DI0013681	Oh I assure you, sir, they are very real and very large. Please do be careful.
0DI0013684	[SUCCEEDED] I'm short 90 caps or so, but I have a few cartons of cigarettes and some sensor modules I could put toward my debt.
0DI0013685	At this point I'll have to return to California to start anew. I haven't got a cap to my name.
0DI0013686	[FAILED] I don't even have enough caps to get a new caravan up and running. What makes you think I have enough to afford anything else of value?
0DI0013687	[SUCCEEDED] Damn. I didn't want to hand over all of my caps because I won't have enough to get home to California.
0DI0013688	Here, take it all. I'll find my way home one way or another.
0DI0013689	[SUCCEEDED] Oh you charming wonderful hunk of man. I agree, I cannot risk my reputation on such a paltry sum.
0DI0013690	Here is what I owe, paid in full. I may scrape a bit to get home to California, but I'm a resourceful woman.
0DI0013691	Here is the last known location of my caravan if you feel like looking for it. Until we meet again, handsome.
0DI0013692	Oh, that makes me so happy! You are too much!
0DI0013693	Yeah, I've got a few ideas that I'm working on. Maybe I'll let you in on it once I have something.
0DI0013694	Yeah, I know. That's why I'm not really going to do it.
0DI0013695	You are the first person to step foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. It was not an invitation I made lightly.
0DI0013696	We have a serious matter to discuss, concerning a contract you have yet to fulfill.
0DI0013697	You have an "interest" in this, whether you like it or not. You signed a contract to deliver the Platinum Chip to me.
0DI0013698	Now, I could stop you from leaving, but what would that accomplish? If you want to go, go.
0DI0013699	See what the Strip I built - the Strip I own - has to offer. Think about what I could offer you. I expect we'll have occasion to talk again.
0DI0013701	Rex? It breaks my heart every time I see him. He's such a good dog.
0DI0013702	No, Rex's condition is way beyond anything we can handle. He requires brain surgery, and some sophisticated cybernetics work, too.
0DI0013703	Yes, a few months ago. We had to tell him there was nothing we could do.
0DI0013704	I didn't say that. While no one here has that kind of expertise, I do know of one man who might fit the bill.
0DI0013705	There's an old scientist named Dr. Henry who reportedly specializes in this sort of procedure. He'd probably be your best bet.
0DI0013706	Last I heard, he was living up in Jacobstown, far to the northwest.
0DI0013707	Consider me your personal welcome wagon! Now hear this - the head honcho of New Vegas, Mr. House, is itching to make your acquaintance.
0DI0013708	Just head for the Lucky 38. It's the big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner.
0DI0013709	The place to get started is the Lucky 38. See that big ol' tower shaped like a roulette spinner?
0DI0013710	That's where you'll find Mr. House, New Vegas's head honcho. And he's itching to make your acquaintance.
0DI0013711	Sorry, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
0DI0013712	Mr. House, the head honcho of New Vegas, is itching to make your acquaintance. He'll help you serve that cold dish of yours extra-chilly.
0DI0013713	Sure you are, rambler. I know you're fixing to serve up some vengeance, but I'm gonna have to point you to the Lucky 38 first.
0DI0013715	Well now, it was Mr. House who made Securitrons like me. Seems the least I could do is pass on his message. Don't dawdle. He'll be waiting.
0DI0013716	Yeehaw, pardner! That's the spirit. He'll be waiting for you.
0DI0013717	Don't you dawdle, little doggie! Mr. House isn't someone you want to go about snubbing. He'll be waiting.
0DI0013718	Bad idea, pardner! That man you're chasing, he's a bad penny all right - a rattlesnake of a man. Think of Mr. House as anti-venom.
0DI0013719	It's some kind of data storage device, dig? So it's the data on the Chip that's platinum, not the Chip itself.
0DI0013720	Trouble is, the Chip don't fit any computer I've found. Must require special hardware.
0DI0013721	It has something to do with the Securitrons, I know that much. Upgrades their hitting power, gives them heft.
0DI0013722	Might be slightly useful, if you're looking to defend the Strip from Caesar's Legion or the NCR. Or maybe both?
0DI0013723	You help me, and before long the Chairmen will rule all of Vegas, dig? With enough robot muscle to back it up.
0DI0013724	You'll get a sweet, juicy cut of that action. But until that day comes, I'll keep you on retainer, and pay bonuses for "special missions."
0DI0013725	How's that sound?
0DI0013726	A magician don't explain his tricks. I get it.
0DI0013727	Look at me, a big-leaguer or so I claim, making all the mistakes of an original loser...
0DI0013728	Looks like I should think about quitting...
0DI0013729	To think I deemed that flintbox my lucky charm. Oh, the irony...
0DI0013730	You really weren't supposed to talk to him...
0DI0013731	All right, so he used to be a Securitron on patrol. Square as the rest, until I gave him a mickey in the shape of pulse grenade.
0DI0013732	Once he was on the nod, I yanked some wires and dragged him up to the workshop. I had... some help, you see.
0DI0013733	Gal named Emily, one of the Followers over in Freeside, a real whiz when it comes to things technical. She programmed his personality.
0DI0013734	Once Yes Man was hooked back in to House's data network, I started learning a lot more about what he was up to, dig? Like where and when to find you.
0DI0013735	Guess I shoulda seen that coming.
0DI0013736	Baby, ease off the gas. The Chip belongs in the hands of someone who can use it. As in me, not you.
0DI0013737	You'll get a piece of the action, and a sweet one. But the Chip sticks with me.
0DI0013738	Jackpot, baby! I knew we'd see eye to eye!
0DI0013739	Here's a start on your retainer - don't spend it all in one place. And the Prez is yours for as long as you want it.
0DI0013740	When you're ready to saddle up, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll plan the next step of this caper.
0DI0013741	Ring-a-ding, baby! Ta-ta!
0DI0013743	Here's a start on your retainer. And as a signing bonus, take the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house!
0DI0013745	Now if you'll excuse me, I need a moment to collect myself.
0DI0013746	Baby, do you not understand the level of game here?
0DI0013747	What I did to you was rotten, but if you think House, the NCR or Caesar won't kill to put Vegas in their pocket, I really did blow out your brains.
0DI0013748	Not the point I was aiming for but, well, let's see this through.
0DI0013749	It's a game, and games have winners and losers. I prefer the former, how about you?
0DI0013750	Was a time I would've agreed with you. But this... it's too big, it affects too many people. I can't get hung up on those details.
0DI0013751	A good cat to swing with. Or was - until he stopped mewing.
0DI0013752	It was House's big idea to resurrect the Strip. He recruited the Three Families as muscle, showed us how to set up casinos, negotiated with the NCR.
0DI0013753	None of this in person, mind you. Did all his talking through those Securitrons of his. But lately? The silence is deafening.
0DI0013754	The robots collect House's share of the take every week and life goes on. Ain't exactly what I'd call leadership.
0DI0013755	We're the definition of cool, baby. We know how to swing. Folks come to us to learn how to enjoy themselves.
0DI0013756	Of the three families, we're the only ones with the heart and savoir-faire to run the Strip on our own.
0DI0013757	A nation of meddlers, trying to muscle in on our action. Well, we got muscles too, and smarts besides.
0DI0013758	Only reason the NCR hasn't busted up our scene is they're a little afraid of Mr. House, and a lot afraid of Caesar.
0DI0013759	If the NCR beats the Legion at Hoover Dam, they'll turn on us and claim the Strip. And we don't have the muscle to beat them - not yet.
0DI0013760	Meanwhile, they're all that's keeping Caesar's Legion at bay. Plus NCR soldiers and citizens are out best customers. It's complicated.
0DI0013761	Worst of the worst! A tribe of degenerate losers led by a creep. They crucify people for kicks! Slaughter whole towns!
0DI0013762	The NCR beat them at the dam three years ago, but that didn't stop them. They've spent the meanwhile gathering strength.
0DI0013763	They're gonna try to take the dam again, real soon. And if they do, Vegas as we know it will cease to exist.
0DI0013764	I know, you figure me for a creep. It's your prerogative.
0DI0013765	If you change your mind, come find me on the casino floor. In the meantime, the Presidential is yours whenever you want it. Adios.
0DI0013766	I know, you figure me for a creep. And you done me a solid already, just by not shooting at me.
0DI0013767	As a token of appreciation, this here's the key to the Presidential - best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like, free of charge.
0DI0013768	If you change your mind, come find me down on the casino floor and we'll work out the next step of this caper. Adios.
0DI0013769	You forgive me? After what I done? Baby, are you trying to make me cry?
0DI0013770	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. The least I can do is comp you the Presidential for as long as you want it.
0DI0013771	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby - all the way.
0DI0013773	I don't know what to say. Words don't begin. Here, take the key to the Presidential - the best suite in the house. Stay as long as you like.
0DI0013774	This spirit of forgiveness you're showing me... it's enough to make a player rethink what it means to win. You're 18 karat, baby. Catch you later.
0DI0013775	We gotta problem, boys!
0DI0013776	Baby, the odds may look long, but that's just because we ain't done rigging them. I won't toss the dice until we are.
0DI0013777	I've gleaned a lot, working with Mr. House. He was a good cat to swing with. I still got more to learn, but it's... it's coming together.
0DI0013779	A tribe of finks. Every single one of them is a degenerate.
0DI0013780	Mark my words - they're playing an angle. How do I know? They always are.
0DI0013781	Personally? They give me the heebie-jeebies. There's such a thing as being too polite, "if I may" this and "my pleasure" that.
0DI0013782	Don't get me wrong - that resort of theirs is strictly ring-a-ding. But my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
0DI0013783	Yeah, Cachino is a creep. I'll give you a key for some caps... Hazard pay.
0DI0013785	No skin off my back.
0DI0013786	Fine, here you go. If anyone asks you ain't never seen me before.
0DI0013788	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like a deal to me.
0DI0013789	[FAILED] Yeah, but come back when you have the money.
0DI0013790	[FAILED] I bet it does, but free ain't gonna work.
0DI0013791	[SUCCEEDED] Really? That was his idea? Alright, he can go. Hopefully he finds us some good deals out there.
0DI0013792	[FAILED] You're really funny. I like you. But no. We still have business for Troike.
0DI0013793	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I see where you're coming from. Okay, tell Troike he can hit the road.
0DI0013794	[FAILED] Nah, I don't think so. We've still got some work for him to do.
0DI0013795	I bet he does. That's from hookers and chems. His work for us is the most restful part of his day.
0DI0013796	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, you've done some good work for us. I'll do this as a favor for you.
0DI0013797	[FAILED] Yeah, I'm sure they enjoy the cash flow, but that doesn't mean dick to me.
0DI0013798	[SUCCEEDED] We don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Alright, we'll give them a little bit of extra business.
0DI0013799	[FAILED] They're small timers, I could give a fuck what they would enjoy.
0DI0013800	Sorry, but I don't know you from Adam, and you don't have any business getting in our business.
0DI0013801	Well you've been a real thorn in our side. We've got business plans. You set us back a little bit, I'll admit that.
0DI0013802	However, we wanted you to know that nothing you did made a shit bit of difference, and you're going to die a failure.
0DI0013803	Yeah, we lost some guns you little weasel. However, we can get more guns. You slowed us down but you can't stop us.
0DI0013804	You're gonna die a failure.
0DI0013805	Alright, let's dance.
0DI0013806	Cachino? What the fu...
0DI0013807	You better get outside for a little bit. I'm sure they are going to look for the infamous courier when things go to hell.
0DI0013808	Yeah, poor fucker got himself caught after he melted all the guns. Bastard mentioned your name before they shot him in the head.
0DI0013809	Now the bosses want to see you.
0DI0013810	Whoa, you managed to pull that off? Solid work. That ought to gum up the bosses' plans.
0DI0013811	Well, what the fuck are you talking to me for? Go destroy the damn guns so we can move on.
0DI0013812	Yeah, we saw the troopers come through. I can't imagine things are going to work out well for him.
0DI0013813	Oh, is that right? Well I guess if he's gone, he's gone. I don't need to know anything more than that.
0DI0013814	Oh, is that right? Was that your handiwork? Well I can't say I'm sad to see him go, he gave me the fucking creeps.
0DI0013815	Alright, let's have them.
0DI0013816	Now we cut off the head of the serpent. Big Sal and Nero have to die.
0DI0013817	As long as they're alive, they can start up their plans again. All you've managed to do is stall them. I guarantee you they have contingencies.
0DI0013818	They're a little bit upset about what's been done to muck up their plans. They tasked me to find out who's responsible.
0DI0013819	There isn't going to be another chance to get both of them together in the same room. I'll slip you a gun and we can take them out.
0DI0013820	When they're gone I'm gonna run this joint. Don't worry, I'll take care of the place.
0DI0013821	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I'll take care of them. Just give me the word when to start shooting.
0DI0013822	[FAILED] If you aren't a good shot then we're fucked anyways. No, I think you're going to have to do it.
0DI0013823	Hurry and get ready. I'll give you a gun when you get to the room.
0DI0013824	Hurry and get ready. I'll be waiting for you there when you're ready.
0DI0013827	Holy shit, really? Okay, I'll help you, but I'm getting the hell out of here first chance I get.
0DI0013829	It's one of the biggest sources of electrical power in the region, so the NCR's fortified the place pretty heavily.
0DI0013830	When President Kimball shows up on his inspection tour, I'm sure he'll be confident that the Dam is safe and secure.
0DI0013831	They're an outlaw group, primarily trafficking in drugs and other contraband. They usually stay out of NCR territory, though.
0DI0013832	Camp McCarran is the headquarters for the NCR military in this region. It occupies the old airport next to New Vegas.
0DI0013833	It's probably just a political thing - you know, give a few speeches, shake hands with the troops, boost morale.
0DI0013834	Destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam a couple of years ago. The town was set up as a trap for Caesar's Legion.
0DI0013835	The sharpshooters in the Rangers picked off the Legion's veterans from a distance, and the rest of the Legion just rushed on in. Then - boom!
0DI0013836	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, Julie... I've really screwed things up.
0DI0013837	I'll head over to the fort and get some rest. This has gone on too long.
0DI0013838	[FAILED] Sissy?! Real men can hold their liquor, and I'm double-clutching mine!
0DI0013839	[SUCCEEDED] Never thought about using that combination before. Should be able to get through this with that.
0DI0013840	[FAILED] No way, the withdrawal symptoms will kill me if I don't have Fixer to flush out the chems.
0DI0013841	[SUCCEEDED] Man, you're one hell of an egghead. If you think it'll work, I'll give it a shot.
0DI0013842	[FAILED] Oh, I'll be vomiting plenty if you don't get me Fixer. You're worse than that damn dealer.
0DI0013843	What do you want to talk about?
0DI0013844	Sure, let's see what you've got.
0DI0013845	[SUCCEEDED] Er, noticed that, did you? I keenly aimed one of the shots through some soft tissue of one of them to hit the man behind him.
0DI0013846	[FAILED] You're imagining things. It's just the rush of adrenaline caused by your near brush with death.
0DI0013847	Luckily for you, I was here, so there's no reason to get out of sorts.
0DI0013848	Call it a hunch. You do this job for long enough, and you learn to trust your instincts.
0DI0013849	My thoughts exactly. Time is money, after all.
0DI0013850	That's an interesting theory you've got there. I'd suggest you keep it to yourself. Let's get moving.
0DI0013851	Stay close. I wouldn't want something to happen to you.
0DI0013852	[SUCCEEDED] I ought to take my chances and kill you right here, but you may be right. Here, take this.
0DI0013853	Don't think this is over, though. I'll have that money back, out of your hide if I have to.
0DI0013854	[FAILED] I think I'll keep my money thanks. You take that fanciful tale of yours wherever you'd like. Now let's go. I have a job to finish.
0DI0013855	So it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
0DI0013856	Even though you lack subtlety, you've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
0DI0013857	Convinced him, huh? I could use more men with your powers of persuasion.
0DI0013858	You've shown me you can get the job done, so maybe you can help me with something more important.
0DI0013859	Oh! Well, I heard... I mean, we heard... we meaning the Followers of the Apocalypse... that you had been in there. The Lucky 38, I mean.
0DI0013860	And we were wondering if you could help us. If it's not too much trouble, of course.
0DI0013861	Oh. Great! The Followers of the Apocalypse, well some of us, anyway, have been interested in Mr. House's technology, how he stays alive.
0DI0013862	Of course, no one is allowed inside the Lucky 38, so no one knows what's going on. Well, except for you.
0DI0013863	Right. We just want to find out what sort of technology Mr. House has used to stay alive for all these years.
0DI0013864	It could be of great benefit to the people we try to help, many of whom suffer from hard to diagnose illnesses.
0DI0013865	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, who says I can't fix that? You bring me those boom-suits too, okay?
0DI0013866	[FAILED] Do I look like a seamstress to you? Those boomsters can stay in their nowhereville until the sun runs out of gas, for all I care. No deal.
0DI0013871	So you're saying Orris isn't available?
0DI0013872	That's right. But I'm available. And I'm cheaper.
0DI0013873	But I always hire Orris! How do I know you're not trying to steal my business from him?
0DI0013874	Look, the Kings clubbed him from behind and dragged him away. I don't think missing your commission is his number one concern right now.
0DI0013875	Fine, then. I guess I'll hire you.
0DI0013878	Ah, my little friend has come at last. Not me, darling, though you were doing just fine.
0DI0013879	Ladies, take five. I need to talk to my friend here.
0DI0013881	You have entered a restricted area!  Exit the gate area or you will be fired upon!
0DI0013882	You have been warned! Extermination imminent!
0DI0013883	Vaporization subroutine initiated!
0DI0013884	Unauthorized entry detected!
0DI0013885	Have a nice day!
0DI0013887	All right, well, might want to get a move on, is all I'm saying.
0DI0013888	He's what? Ah jeez... jeez, this is really bad. What are you going to do?
0DI0013889	Yeah? That's ballsy. Good luck with that.
0DI0013890	Sure, whatcha need?
0DI0013891	Sure, kid, see ya.
0DI0013892	He's trying to escape!
0DI0013893	You're not getting away!
0DI0013894	You aren't allowed up there!
0DI0013895	I strongly suggest you take your leave.
0DI0013896	Members only.
0DI0013897	This is your last warning.
0DI0013898	You're trying to help him escape!
0DI0013899	Well be a dear and lend a hand upstairs in the banquet hall, if you can. They're in need of more able bodies.
0DI0013900	You need to turn around and leave right now, or I shall be forced to draw my cane.
0DI0013901	[FAILED] With our dinner in tow? I think not.
0DI0013902	[SUCCEEDED] Curse it all. Your timing couldn't be more atrocious. Just make it quick, all right?
0DI0013903	[SUCCEEDED] First he's too trusting, now he doesn't trust any of us. It addles the senses.
0DI0013904	I suppose caution is the desirable course at this point. It's all of our necks if something goes afoul.
0DI0013905	[FAILED] That has to be the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. You're not taking our main course.
0DI0013906	[FAILED] I don't know who you are, but you need to return to the Gourmand this instant!
0DI0013908	[FAILED] If you're a building inspector, I am the secret identity of Mr. House. Kindly remove yourself.
0DI0013910	Those are all members of the White Glove Society. Our founder, Marjorie, gave us all a dress code. There's only one rule to it.
0DI0013911	In her words, we must dress in such a way that no one can be said to have dressed better than us.
0DI0013912	As for the masks, I'm not allowed to tell you. We're sworn to secrecy.
0DI0013913	Actually that's not true. That's just what we're supposed to say.
0DI0013914	I think Marjorie likes them for the mystery they create. And the way they make it clear that we're different from everyone else.
0DI0013915	But you didn't hear that from me.
0DI0013916	Hmm. Must've forgotten to put it on. How embarrassing.
0DI0013917	Go ahead.
0DI0013918	My, such a popular question. I suppose it is only natural to see us and wonder what it is that makes us special.
0DI0013919	The White Glove Society has only just made itself known to the public, of course, but our pedigree was established over generations.
0DI0013920	Were we always so refined? I'd be lying if I said yes. But I've always felt we were destined for a place atop modern society. And now, here we are.
0DI0013921	Not everyone can wear the finest clothes and eat the finest foods, obviously. That's just the reality we live in.
0DI0013922	But surely we can agree that the most tasteful, sophisticated people are the most deserving. That's what the White Glove Society is all about.
0DI0013923	If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
0DI0013924	So I assume you know why we called you here?
0DI0013925	Is this you asking for a last request?
0DI0013926	Cachino, you've really disappointed me.
0DI0013927	Cachino, we've been friends for a long time. A real long time, but this time you really fucked up.
0DI0013928	I'm sorry boss... Sometimes I just can't control myself. I dunno what's wrong with me. I swear, I can turn this around. Just gimme another chance.
0DI0013929	I know boss, and I know it is going to be hard for you to trust me again. But are you going to take the word of this outsider over mine?
0DI0013930	You've been with the Family long enough to know how this goes. I'm sorry you had to fuck this up. Goodbye, you were a real benefit to the business.
0DI0013931	I don't wanna fucking hear it. You've lost the trust of the family. Goodbye, I hope Hell isn't too hot for you.
0DI0013936	Hey, here is that gun I promised you. I suggest using it while they are talking, I'm pretty sure they're going to kill you after they've talked.
0DI0013937	Hey, I'll take care of them when you're ready, just say the word. I suggest doing it while they're talking to get the drop on them.
0DI0013938	Let's have some words. Take a seat on the couch so we can get to talking.
0DI0013939	Please, have a seat. Let's have a bit of a pow-wow.
0DI0013941	To the northeast is a settlement, the locals here call them "Boomers." They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
0DI0013942	I'd like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
0DI0013943	Unfortunately, the Boomers keep to themselves and are, let's say, hostile to all outsiders. That is why I need someone like you.
0DI0013944	Someone with your background and reputation would have a better chance of reaching them than anyone I have available.
0DI0013945	In exchange for your help, you would receive complete amnesty for any past crimes against the NCR, as well as additional benefits and perks.
0DI0013946	Do you think you would be able to do this for me?
0DI0013947	I'm sorry that you think so. However, if you do happen to change your mind, you can find me here at the embassy.
0DI0013948	Any injury, illness, or death gets radioed to Ranger HQ at Camp Golf.
0DI0013949	Chief Hanlon and his aides compile the reports and assign reinforcements as needed, and they're not needed here.
0DI0013950	Do a fucking headcount, then. Everybody's right where they're supposed to be.
0DI0013951	We're here to make sure the Legion doesn't try to sneak around Lake Mead and come at NCR from another direction.
0DI0013953	What? Chief Hanlon. The man's a war hero? Why would he...? That just doesn't make sense. This is awful...
0DI0013954	I knew it. I'm glad you and the Chief were able to put a stop to this.
0DI0013955	<bark!><bark!>
0DI0013956	All right! Please, follow me. We'll head into the vault right away.
0DI0013957	This bunker protects the entrance to the vault - solid stone outside and thick steel on the inside!
0DI0013958	Above us there's the control center for this level of the vault's life-support systems, electric grid, radioactive shields and all that jazz.
0DI0013959	Don't get lost! My vault has many corridors and rooms - although it is no longer symmetrical, after Mr. House threw us out.
0DI0013960	This is the main game-hall. Here we settled the big disputes among the vault's levels.
0DI0013961	Chosen representatives gambled against each other here. The winner earned the right to settle the dispute as wished by the collective.
0DI0013962	We used to have such parties in this diner! A bitch to clean later... but well worth it!
0DI0013963	This hall leads to our guest rooms. You can use the first room on our left. But no snooping next door! That's my room, always was.
0DI0013964	Down there is the game room! Each side of the vault had one... but the other is filled with concrete now. Okay, that wraps it up. I'll see you soon!
0DI0013965	Well that motherfucker. What the hell. Damn, thanks for finding this.
0DI0013966	This should be plenty of proof to cover my ass if they try to rat me out to any authorities.
0DI0013967	Okay, try and be fast about it.
0DI0013972	Okay, here's the Thermite and a key to the room where the guns are stored. Place the Thermite on the crates in the room.
0DI0013973	I rigged the light switch outside the room to kick off a spark big enough to hold the Thermite. That should turn that shit into molten slag.
0DI0013974	As soon as we're done talking I'm going to make myself like a ghost. I don't want to be anywhere near here when the bosses find out.
0DI0013975	Alright, let's.
0DI0013976	Okay, cool.
0DI0013977	I've made lots of contacts over the years. I have some friends back in California that can get their hands on just about anything.
0DI0013978	Mostly I've been calling in every last favor I have.
0DI0013979	[SUCCEEDED] Hey, fuck you.
0DI0013980	Alright, I'll place the fucking Thermite myself. You get out of the casino for a bit. I'll take care of it while you're gone.
0DI0013981	[FAILED] Nothing you could threaten me with holds a candle to what the Omertas would do to me if they caught me.
0DI0013982	Thermite is a mix of rust and aluminum dust. If you add a little heat, a massive amount of heat is spit out.
0DI0013983	It gives off enough heat to melt through just about anything. It should make short work of the weapons.
0DI0013984	As a little pet project I've been making some thermite. Thermite burns as hot as the devil's asshole and can melt through just about anything.
0DI0013985	I've been keeping it so if the Family betrays me I can hopefully do some damage before I end up dead or in jail.
0DI0013986	Okay, I know the stuff inside and out. What do you want to know?
0DI0013987	Do what you got to do, baby, and let the chips fall as they may. You know where to find me.
0DI0013988	Oh, now it's on.
0DI0013989	It commemorates the Battle of Hoover Dam. The rangers lured the best of Caesar's Legion into Boulder City, then blew the whole town up.
0DI0013990	The NCR still lost a bunch of troops in the fighting, though. My older brother sacrificed himself so they could evacuate some of the wounded.
0DI0013992	Don't worry about it.
0DI0013993	[SUCCEEDED] All right, apology accepted. Don't let it happen again.
0DI0013994	[FAILED] Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm done with you.
0DI0013995	Camp McCarran, but I'm on leave at the moment - heading back to California to see my folks.
0DI0013996	I'm supposed to join up with a caravan that's heading that way up at the 188, but they're not due to arrive for awhile yet.
0DI0013997	Just get the fuck away from here, already.
0DI0013998	Oh, that's it. Your ass is mine!
0DI0014000	Please let me know if anything catches your eye.
0DI0014001	Hey, you want the best, you have to pay for it.
0DI0014002	In that case, some of the things I need handled will be right up your alley.
0DI0014003	I beg your pardon, then. I'll let you get about your business.
0DI0014004	Oh, yeah, sure!
0DI0014005	Okay - I got these great lunchboxes, they are super! What else? Oh! Look at these toasters! You like toasts, right? If they are crunchy even better!
0DI0014006	What about a vintage Vault-Tec toy car? Or-
0DI0014007	Okay, I do, but who wants a lame sensor module, or a nitrogen canister, anyway?
0DI0014008	All the popular stuff has been sold - especially the vault suits. I need to find more because people buy them like hot cakes.
0DI0014009	Leather suits are good times! Thinking about that just blows my top!
0DI0014010	You would? You really would?
0DI0014011	That would help me, a lot!
0DI0014014	I'll pay you good money per each suit.
0DI0014015	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Well... Ha! I don't even know what to say to that!
0DI0014016	Cool it, smarty-pants! I don't have to take that shit from anybody, you know? Get out! Don't come back until you learn how to get along.
0DI0014017	Okay. Anything else I can do for you?
0DI0014018	[FAILED] Oh yeah? I bet you spend most of the time thinking lines rather than putting them to use. That vault merchandise is not on your menu! Next!
0DI0014019	Thank you so much!
0DI0014020	You are an angel. I can't wait to see you again!
0DI0014022	[FAILED] Oh, don't floor it... There's a lot more to this than a classy chassis, you know?
0DI0014023	Anyway, what do you say about my proposal?
0DI0014024	If you could bring me vault suits, I would so make it worth your while... I mean, really! But it has to be good leather, okay!?
0DI0014028	My vault is pure New Vegas. Everyone has a chance and lady luck smiles if you play your odds right!... Okay, it was like that before we had to leave.
0DI0014029	Vault 21 had very smart ways to help people get along. All arguments and fights got solved through gambling.
0DI0014030	I'll give you a quick tour of my home! Oh, yeah, if you like.
0DI0014034	Sure I have! I made the scene in The Strip. It is just that I really like it here - Vault 21 is a kick!
0DI0014035	[SUCCEEDED] Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
0DI0014036	Okay - you're right. I hate going outside. It's almost impossible for me to step out of here. Still, I love my vault. It's my pad!
0DI0014037	[FAILED] I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
0DI0014038	I don't know! Maybe he didn't want anybody sneaking around down there.
0DI0014039	My vault runs deep and wide! It's filled with corridors and rooms that go far.
0DI0014040	What gives him the right to screw us with the royal shaft, anyway? So, he saved New Vegas. Wohooo! Now scram and let us go on with our lives! Sheesh!
0DI0014041	Mr. House has everything to do with Vault 21. He tried to get us out before he filled it with concrete.
0DI0014042	I almost went ape! So, we convinced him - okay, Sheldon and I, right? We convinced him to leave the top level mostly intact!
0DI0014044	Yeah - and you got to dig what I did with it! Looking as good as it should... almost.
0DI0014045	Righty-o, daddy-o. Let's do it!
0DI0014046	Sure! The place's packed... usually.
0DI0014047	We get loads of NCR cubes these days, a stray Brahmin baron once in a while, and recently circled couples shining big rocks on their fingers.
0DI0014048	It was bustling with activity! We all knew each other so well - you see, the vault kept us all even. It's all symmetry and windows down there.
0DI0014049	We solved any quarrels through gambling! Lady luck casts no eyeballs, you know? So, nobody shafted anyone else!
0DI0014050	Yeah... I miss those days!
0DI0014052	[SUCCEEDED] Ha ha ha! Okay - why don't you help me out and in the meantime I will think about where to... take advantage of your skills.
0DI0014054	All right! What would you like to know?
0DI0014055	I see. Okay, your move.
0DI0014056	I take care of it but I suppose you could say that it belongs to Mr. House.
0DI0014057	Howdy, pardner! You've come a far piece, haven't you? Welcome to New Vegas!
0DI0014058	More than you ever dreamed, baby.
0DI0014059	The time for talk has passed, honey baby. These mouths of ours have appointments to be elsewhere.
0DI0014060	You tramp! Like I needed another social disease anyhow!
0DI0014061	To start, I'll comp you the Presidential - best suite in the house. You deserve a taste of the VIP lifestyle.
0DI0014062	I'll hang out down here for a while to make everything look business-as-usual, then come to you. Any questions you got, I'll answer - guaranteed.
0DI0014063	Why would I do that, baby? I want to talk to you as much as you want to talk to me.
0DI0014064	And you dig this is just first base, right? You and me have a future together, and it's big league and open all night.
0DI0014065	Here's this key to the Prez. I'll see you there in two shakes. Ta-ta.
0DI0014066	[SUCCEEDED] Where's my manners? Here's some cash up front. There'll be more where that came from.
0DI0014067	Wait for me in the Presidential suite. We got a future together, you and me. It's time we got started.
0DI0014068	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Johnny-come-lately.
0DI0014069	[FAILED] This operation has cost me plenty. I ain't about to get shaken down by some Janey-come-lately.
0DI0014070	There's a first-class offer on the table. The rest is up to you.
0DI0014072	[SUCCEEDED] If that's what it takes to win your trust, that's what it takes. Follow me.
0DI0014073	[FAILED] You tracked me across the desert, Sugar Plum. Finding the Presidential? Easy pickings.
0DI0014074	Then this is endsville, baby - may the best man win.
0DI0014075	Baby, you're the boss. All you gotta do is whistle.
0DI0014076	In the meantime, enjoy the high life. Room service is on me. I'll send up a bottle of the good stuff. Ta-ta.
0DI0014078	Here, take some chips and see how you do at the tables. Ta-ta.
0DI0014079	See ya around.
0DI0014081	They seem to have it in for me. Go figure. While they waste all their bullets trying to get me, you head in and waste 'em.
0DI0014082	Take these assholes out, what else? Now go!
0DI0014083	[SUCCEEDED] You're a bastard after my own heart. Here, it's all I got.
0DI0014084	Now get in there and waste those guys!
0DI0014085	[FAILED] What the hell? I ain't got that kind of money!
0DI0014086	Take those guys out and I'm sure the King will reward you just fine.
0DI0014087	Please return when you have sufficient caps or a passport.
0DI0014088	Ambassador Crocker can be found in his office through the door to my right at the end of the hall.
0DI0014089	The Embassy offices are to your left while the barracks and living quarters are to the right.
0DI0014090	If you're looking for a history lesson, I suggest you talk to Ambassador Crocker.
0DI0014091	I don't have time to give my life story to everyone that passes through. Is there something I can actually help you with?
0DI0014092	Us troopers mostly come to the Strip for our R&R. We blow off some steam by gambling, drinking, partying, or fighting.
0DI0014093	If you're looking for a good time, I'd suggest hitting up Gomorrah. The girls there are pretty nice, if you know what I mean.
0DI0014094	What have you heard? I know people think I'm a little on the wild side, but I'm just trying to have fun, you know?
0DI0014095	Just because I happen to get into fights and like to pull pranks doesn't mean anything.
0DI0014096	He's a little stiff and stuffy. Doesn't leave the office that much, always surrounds himself with papers and reports.
0DI0014097	I've always wanted to play a prank on him, but there's no way I could ever pull that off without getting in trouble from Captain Pappas.
0DI0014098	Sorry. I don't know much about him. We run in different circles, you know?
0DI0014099	She may be a bit of a hardass, but she's the best damn Captain we've had here. I'd be careful around her. You don't want to get on her bad side.
0DI0014100	If you're digging for dirt on the Captain, you're digging in the wrong place.
0DI0014101	More of the usual. We're keeping an eye on the troopers to make sure they don't do anything stupid.
0DI0014102	The only stupid one we've had lately is Private Erwin. He's starting to cause me more trouble than he's worth.
0DI0014103	None of your business. You better keep your nose clean because I'll be watching you.
0DI0014104	People drink, gamble, and fight. What do you think happens on the Strip? Any other intelligent questions?
0DI0014105	How the hell did a brahmin get loose on the Strip? If this is another one of Private Erwin's pranks, I'll make him regret it.
0DI0014106	I've got to deal with drunk troopers making fools of themselves and embarassing all of the NCR with their behavior, so it's just another day here.
0DI0014107	Some idiot decided it would be funny to put up graffiti all over the Strip. If I find out it was one of my men, they'll be locked up for a month.
0DI0014108	Some fool troopers think they can lounge around on the rooftops instead of doing their job. If I catch them, they'll have KP duty for a year.
0DI0014109	Some drunk girls thought it would be fun to play in the fountain in front of the Ultra-Luxe. Now I need to clean up the mess.
0DI0014110	Not much to tell. Keeping the troopers in line and monitoring the Strip keeps me busy. It's my job and I'm going to do it well.
0DI0014111	Now if that's all, I've got work to do.
0DI0014112	Look, I don't know you at all and I'm not really interested in small talk. If you have something important to say, do so quickly.
0DI0014113	Crocker isn't too bad. He mostly stays in his office now. If you have any questions about the Embassy you should ask him. He'll talk your ear off.
0DI0014114	If you want to know more about the Ambassador, go talk to him yourself.
0DI0014115	Private Erwin... he's starting to get a thick file here with all his troublemaking.
0DI0014116	My troopers are my business. Stay out of it.
0DI0014117	I hit what I was aiming for. Guess you had brains to spare. Or are you just thick-skulled?
0DI0014118	Either way, baby, this is good news. Maybe I can finally sleep at night, knowing you didn't die.
0DI0014119	Cash me outta this mess!
0DI0014120	I can't do that, baby, and you know it. There's a lot of angles to this caper - complexities aplenty.
0DI0014121	But plenty of action, too - enough for both of us. But we don't jabber about that out here in public.
0DI0014122	You making a pass at me, sister? Because I'm out of your league.
0DI0014123	Did those bullets scramble your egg? Or have you always been a naughty broad...?
0DI0014124	You're one sick pussycat, baby. There's quins and then there's... I don't even know what to call you.
0DI0014125	I hear "dig" from you, babe, and all I can think of is a shovel. How can this be? This ain't forgiveness, it's something... wrong.
0DI0014126	All right, honey baby, this is all kinds of wrong, but to my suite it is. Thirteenth floor. Don't keep me waiting.
0DI0014127	Wow-ee wow wow, girl. This is all kinds of wrong, but I'm in for a dozen.
0DI0014131	Anyhow, baby, you didn't come here for vengeance. You came to get clued in.
0DI0014132	You've got a crazy drop on me here, baby, that's for sure. If killing's what you came for, this would be the time.
0DI0014133	But baby - you'd be disappointing me. All the trouble you went through to arrange this shin-dig? Must be something more you're after...?
0DI0014134	Cachino? Get out of my face.
0DI0014135	I bet you say that to all the girls. Yeah, head over to Brimstone, he'll find you there.
0DI0014136	Gorgeous, you can have anything you want from me. Cachino is in Brimstone.
0DI0014137	Well thank you, gorgeous. Yeah, look for Cachino in Brimstone.
0DI0014139	Whoa, simmer down! Head over to Brimstone. I'll have him find you there.
0DI0014140	Ah, Troike? What's he want? Some more Jet, a fresh batch of girls? Maybe a guy or two this time?
0DI0014141	My associate Big Sal deals with Troike and his business. When my shift down here is done you can talk to him.
0DI0014142	We run a hotel. What do you think our business is?
0DI0014143	Why would I want to do that?
0DI0014144	What? That he's a murdering Jet-head? Not a new story around here.
0DI0014146	Damn right you're sorry.
0DI0014147	I don't see how that's your business. I'm just a guest here, having a little fun.
0DI0014148	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, buddy.
0DI0014149	Hey man, I don't know nothing. Let me have some peace here, lady.
0DI0014150	I keep a little switchblade tucked away with me. You never know when you might find some trouble.
0DI0014151	Cachino... Cachino what? Are you kidding me? He must be trying to get me killed.
0DI0014152	They're keeping them in a little utility section down off the basement.
0DI0014153	I don't know what they're arming themselves for, but I know it isn't for the good of mankind.
0DI0014154	Oh man, I don't even like to think about it. All that goddamn blood. It was just in the hotel like any other night.
0DI0014155	I took some chems with the girl I was with, but I never black out. I did this time though.
0DI0014156	Next thing I knew I woke up and she was lying next to me stabbed dead. There was a knife next to the bed and I was covered in her blood.
0DI0014157	That night? Mostly buffout, I like to cut it with a little bit of jet, and wash it down with some whiskey. That was my standard Saturday night...
0DI0014158	When I saw the body I started screaming, a few seconds some of their soldiers were in there cleaning up the room.
0DI0014159	They offered to keep silent about what happened if I agreed to help them get their hands on large quantities of guns, at deep discounts.
0DI0014160	Like I said, pretty standard for me. I can handle my shit.
0DI0014161	[SUCCEEDED] What? Yeah, you're right. I wonder what was up with that.
0DI0014162	[FAILED] I've done much more than that in a single night and lived to tell the tale.
0DI0014163	Alright, have at it.
0DI0014164	What do you wanna talk about?
0DI0014166	You'd do that? For me? I'm not sure what can be done, but you'd be doing me a solid if you would. I've been talking to Big Sal mostly.
0DI0014167	Yeah? Well fuck that. The bosses have my number, and I'm a company man while they've got the goods on me.
0DI0014168	More power to you if you can, but keep me out of it. I've been doing business with Big Sal, so he's going to be your man.
0DI0014169	[SUCCEEDED] Great. So I'm fucked either way. I guess I don't have any choice but to help you. Just try not to get me killed here.
0DI0014170	[FAILED] Nothing you could do scares me as much as the Omertas.
0DI0014171	[SUCCEEDED] I guess if Cachino trusts you I can tell you a little of what happened. It all started with a prostitute in here.
0DI0014172	[FAILED] No way, man. I don't want to think about it, much less talk about it.
0DI0014173	Withdrawal could kill me if I don't get them soon.
0DI0014174	Fine. If you really care so much, then get me some shots of Fixer to calm down these shakes.
0DI0014175	I'm gonna need at least ten shots to get me through the week. From there the Followers should be able to help.
0DI0014177	Julie is a saint, but I don't need help. I feel young and strong, as long as I get my chems.
0DI0014178	Why stop? I feel great!
0DI0014179	No worries. My guy will be here soon enough, just wait.
0DI0014180	What?! I need a fix now!
0DI0014181	I saw them. Thank you so much for helping them. This means a lot to the Followers of the Apocalypse. You have our thanks.
0DI0014182	If you need some medical supplies, come see me. With Jacob working with us, we should be able to spare a stim or fixer once a day.
0DI0014183	I saw Bill, but found Jacob Dead. His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
0DI0014184	Thank you for helping Bill. At least he will help repair things around here.
0DI0014185	I saw Jacob, but found Bill dead... His death will be a big loss for Freeside.
0DI0014187	No you didn't! They're both dead!
0DI0014188	I don't know what you're pulling here, but this is not the way to win us over.
0DI0014189	Sure. Would you like a Stimpak, Fixer, or Rad-Away?
0DI0014190	Well, now that Jacob is dead, we don't have the extra resources to make a surplus of medical supplies. Sorry, but we cannot spare anything now.
0DI0014191	You'll need to wait another 24 hours for us to get more made. We need everything else we currently have.
0DI0014194	Admission to the Strip requires an official passport or proof that you are carrying the required minimum balance.
0DI0014195	These policies prevent less-reputable persons from entering and ensure a good time will be had by all who enter the Strip.
0DI0014196	Thank you, sir. You may proceed.
0DI0014197	Thank you, madam. You may proceed.
0DI0014198	I'm sorry, but your balance does not meet the minimum balance.
0DI0014203	[SUCCEEDED] <Various buzzing and clicking noises>
0DI0014204	Thank you, sir.  You may proceed.
0DI0014206	Thank you, madam.  You may proceed.
0DI0014207	[FAILED] Please submit to a credit check or present a passport.
0DI0014208	If you are unable to meet the minimum balance requirement, an official passport is an acceptable alternative.
0DI0014209	Charge? Ha ha. Pace must be at it again. What did he take you for?
0DI0014210	Maybe so. Maybe so. You look like you might be able to handle yourself. Tell you what.
0DI0014211	You do me a favor, and I'll have some more work for you when it's done. Sound good?
0DI0014212	I did have something, but some friends of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
0DI0014213	I did have something, but a close friend of mine got whacked and now I got nothing for ya. Sorry about that.
0DI0014218	No, silly! Of course it wasn't always a hotel.
0DI0014219	I have all sorts of things. Vault souvenirs, vault wares, vault machines, vault mementos and vault suits! And, well, lots of other vault things, too.
0DI0014220	Hey, you there! I have a message for you.
0DI0014221	It's from Ambassador Crocker. Very important. Here you go.
0DI0014222	I see you brought a friend! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
0DI0014223	I see you brought some friends! Sorry, pardner, but they're gonna have to stay outside.
0DI0014225	Enjoy your visit!
0DI0014226	Of course you haven't. Vegas always was one of a kind.
0DI0014227	What you see down on the Strip is just a fraction of the city's former glory, and yet... more than an echo. I preserved its spirit.
0DI0014228	Or perhaps you were referring to the Lucky 38? The years haven't been kind to her, but still she manages to impress.
0DI0014229	Oh, come now - don't play the fool. Vegas has fools enough, a superfluity of them. They're what makes it so profitable.
0DI0014230	They come to Vegas chasing penny-ante dreams of high-living, to feel like they're big shots, like they're winners.
0DI0014231	You see that you and I are of a different stripe, don't you? We don't have to dream that we're important. We are.
0DI0014232	You aren't going to ramble on about the virtues of life out in the wastes, are you? It's a desert, you do realize?
0DI0014233	A radioactive desert where humans subsist in a barbaric state? Difficult to glorify convincingly. They are, however, aptly named.
0DI0014234	For that's what you'd be out there - wasted. Here on the Strip, your talents can be put to use.
0DI0014235	Oh, by all means - yes. That's refreshing.
0DI0014236	The business is this. One of my employees has stolen an item of extraordinary value from me, and I want it recovered.
0DI0014237	Simple enough?
0DI0014238	You're ready to move forward, then?
0DI0014239	Oh, don't be coy. You've been playing a high-stakes game ever since Victor dug you out of the ground. Don't be afraid to admit it.
0DI0014240	I've resurrected Vegas, spirit intact. What I need now is the ability to enforce my rightful claim.
0DI0014241	Not just against Caesar's Legion, by the way. In fact, the NCR is a more present and insidious threat.
0DI0014242	To enforce, one must have force - a position of strength.
0DI0014243	Years ago, when I detected NCR scouts roaming the Mojave, I could tell from their uniforms that these were no mere tribesmen.
0DI0014244	I knew it was only a matter of time before an army appeared, to take control of the dam. And I knew my Securitrons wouldn't be enough to oppose them.
0DI0014245	And so I recruited the Three Families. Vegas belongs to me because I mustered enough strength to bring the NCR to the bargaining table.
0DI0014246	Indeed it was - and still is. But not without taking significant casualties.
0DI0014247	Would Kimball and Oliver have traded the lives of hundreds of soldiers for absolute control of Hoover Dam? Oh yes.
0DI0014248	They weren't afraid of me, they were afraid of Caesar - that attacking me would leave them vulnerable to a Legion offensive.
0DI0014249	And so they negotiated. Not out of the kindness of their hearts, as they try to make it seem. Because the calculus of power left no other choice.
0DI0014250	NCR forces were permitted to occupy Hoover Dam and establish a military base at McCarran Airport. Well, it used to be one.
0DI0014251	They recognized my sovereignty over the Vegas Strip and agreed to supply electricity and water once their engineers repaired the dam.
0DI0014252	Written into the treaty were provisions that the NCR do nothing to prevent its soldiers and civilians from visiting the Strip.
0DI0014253	That's how I harnessed the NCR to my endeavor. Their occupation has been the engine of my growing economy.
0DI0014254	The salient issue is that they will go to war with me, if given the chance.
0DI0014255	There's just one reason why the NCR hasn't contrived some outrage to justify invading the Strip - Caesar's Legion.
0DI0014256	The final battle between those two armies is fast approaching. I can't afford to let either side win on their terms.
0DI0014257	New Vegas is more than a city - it's the remedy to mankind's derailment.
0DI0014258	The city's economy is a blast furnace in which can be forged the steel of a new rail line, running straight to a new horizon.
0DI0014259	What is the NCR? A society of people desperate to experience comfort, ease, luxury... A society of customers.
0DI0014260	With all that money pouring in? Give me 20 years, and I'll reignite the high technology development sectors. 50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.
0DI0014261	100 years, and my colony ships will be heading for the stars, to search for planets unpolluted by the wrath and folly of a bygone generation.
0DI0014262	I prefer the term "autocrat."
0DI0014263	I would rule as a chief executive. I would not answer to a board of directors or any other entity.
0DI0014264	Nothing to impede progress. If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows.
0DI0014265	My judgement.
0DI0014266	I have no interest in abusing others, just as I have no interest in legislating or otherwise dictating what people do in their private time.
0DI0014267	Nor have I any interest in being worshipped as some kind of machine god messiah. I am impervious to such corrupting ambitions.
0DI0014268	But autocracy? Firm control in the hands of a technological and economic visionary? Yes, that Vegas shall have.
0DI0014269	Well enough.  Return to me when you have the Platinum Chip in your possession. Any final matters for us to discuss?
0DI0014270	My only concern is the recovery of the Platinum Chip. What happens to Benny, I leave to your discretion.
0DI0014271	When you bring the Chip to me, I will pay you four times the delivery bonus stipulated in your contract. How's that?
0DI0014272	As I said before, Benny's fate is yours to decide. Once you've delivered the Chip, I will pay you the amount agreed-upon.
0DI0014273	Benny has led the Chairmen ever since I recruited his tribe seven years ago.
0DI0014274	Until his recent misbehavior, I'd planned to make him my protege. Maybe if I'd begun grooming him sooner, none of this would've happened...
0DI0014275	My offer far exceeds the original terms of your contract, which, I will remind you, already obligate you to deliver the Chip.
0DI0014276	[SUCCEEDED] Very well, five times the bonus. Not one cap more.
0DI0014278	I've always taken business negotiations very seriously. I advise you to do the same.
0DI0014279	It's a very special item. There's nothing else like it in the entire world. It was lost a long time, and difficult to find.
0DI0014280	That's all you need to know about it, for this stage of our enterprise. Fulfill your contract, deliver the Chip, and good things will come your way.
0DI0014281	Benny was the leader of the Chairmen for seven years, ever since I recruited the tribe. I considered him something of a protege.
0DI0014282	I am Robert Edwin House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip.
0DI0014284	Before the Great War of 2077, I was the founder, President and CEO of RobCo Industries, a vast computer and robotics corporation.
0DI0014285	It's understandable that you'd be curious about this topic, but we'll hold off until the Platinum Chip has been recovered.
0DI0014286	[SUCCEEDED] You might keep an eye out for any computers that Benny's been using. Maybe even a computer lab of some sort...
0DI0014287	[FAILED] You have a contract to fulfill, a delivery to make.
0DI0014288	If you can't hold to a contract, simply for the ethic of holding to a contract, you're worthless to me.
0DI0014289	Don't let the video screens and computer terminals fool you. I'm flesh and blood, not silicon.
0DI0014290	[SUCCEEDED] I see you've made a study of the topic. My knowledge of the science of longevity would fill several text books...
0DI0014291	Perhaps, after a decade or two of economic reconstruction, I can commercialize these technologies and offer to others, such as yourself.
0DI0014292	[FAILED] No. While brains demonstrated some use as organic processors in the robots produced by General Atomics International...
0DI0014293	They never retained personality once removed from the human body.
0DI0014294	Let's just say it was very... costly. But I was willing to make the sacrifices longevity entailed, financial and otherwise.
0DI0014295	Until then.
0DI0014296	So you've said before. You're making a habit of wasting my time.
0DI0014297	You signed a contract in good faith to deliver that Chip. You're going to have a hard time on the Strip if you are so incautious of making enemies...
0DI0014298	Please focus on the task at hand - for both our sakes.
0DI0014299	No, you haven't.
0DI0014300	This is the second time you've promised to deliver the Platinum Chip. Even if you don't hold yourself to your promises, I will.
0DI0014301	Most of the town is rubble - destroyed during the Battle of Hoover Dam - and the only other thing around here is the concrete mixing yard.
0DI0014302	The NCR has been constructing bunkers up and down the river. From what I've heard, it's a little late for that.
0DI0014303	Travelers over at the 188 - just up the road - said that the Legion has overrun a couple of towns to the south.
0DI0014304	You think you can take me, punk?
0DI0014305	Normally, I'd turn you down since I have no idea who you are, but considering that the hostages are as good as dead when we attack...
0DI0014306	All right, I'm going to give you a chance to talk to the Great Khans. Their leader is a man named Jessup.
0DI0014307	If we hear shooting, we'll be coming in, but it'll probably be late for you.
0DI0014308	As soon as you free them, the rest of my squad will move in and provide covering fire.
0DI0014309	You should wait until it's darker so that you have the best chance to pull this off.
0DI0014310	You should go now, while it's still dark. That way, you'll have the best chance to pull this off.
0DI0014312	"Acceptable casualties," I've been told. I don't like it, but the brass has their reasons.
0DI0014313	It was worth a try. I'll have to proceed with the attack as ordered, then.
0DI0014314	Julie? Ah, I love Julie. She's such a nice lady.
0DI0014315	One time, I was working on the water pump and she came over, put her hand on my shoulder, and told me I was doing a great job. Great job she says!
0DI0014316	I just choked up and didn't say nothing. Compliments are so rare these days.
0DI0014317	Drop drinking?! I've been drinking for a straight month!
0DI0014318	Listen, I've tried to stop, but the withdrawal symptoms are so bad I feel like I'm going to die. I can't stop now.
0DI0014319	Dixon sells me booze dirt cheap. It does the job, but it tastes like paint thinner and I feel like I'm going to die if I stop drinking for a day.
0DI0014320	I swear that guy is trying to kill me, but what can I do? Drinking other booze doesn't cure the sickness like his.
0DI0014321	What the hell? Why? I need alcohol, man!
0DI0014322	I'm gonna die if I don't get a drink!
0DI0014323	The only way you can help me now is a load of detox chems.
0DI0014324	At least a couple doses of Fixer, a bottle of whiskey, and Rad-Away.
0DI0014325	I can take doses of Fixer and Rad-Away to gradually flush my system over time while drinking decreasing shots of diluted whiskey.
0DI0014326	This shit better be worth it, man.
0DI0014327	I've felt like I was dying these past weeks off and on, but the worst is yet to come. In a few days though, I should be free.
0DI0014328	I'll head over to the Followers and see if they will help me through this.
0DI0014331	I'd rather not waste the ammo, kid. But, if you insist, draw.
0DI0014332	Now why the hell should I do that? You're below me, kid.
0DI0014333	I've been killing scum twice your size since before your mother squeezed you out.
0DI0014334	Piss off.
0DI0014335	If you think you've got the guts, I'd like to see you try.
0DI0014336	[SUCCEEDED] Well, that sounds like a bit of a bargain. I get to walk free with the Garrets thinking I'm dead.
0DI0014337	Sure, you can have my hat. I can always buy another with the caps I've got left.
0DI0014338	It would have been more fun fighting it out, though. See you later, kid.
0DI0014339	[FAILED] <Glare> Better get your ass moving before your mouth gets you into trouble, kid.
0DI0014340	Piss off, errand boy.
0DI0014341	Piss off, errand girl.
0DI0014342	Indeed, Santiago is a poet among pretenders. If you are here to collect for the Garrets, Santiago is debt free.
0DI0014343	Yes indeed, Santiago is very important. I even have a discount at Mick & Ralph's.
0DI0014344	Perhaps you could use Santiago's discount? For 50 caps, Santiago will tell you the super secret code word to get a discount with Mick.
0DI0014345	Santiago thanks you. Tell Mick Santiago sent you and the code word is 'extravaganza'.
0DI0014348	Sir, Santiago does not know what he has done to offend, but he can explain everything.
0DI0014349	Santiago is offended that you would opine such slander.
0DI0014350	Ow! Okay. Here! Take the caps, just don't hurt Santiago again!
0DI0014351	[SUCCEEDED] I didn't think she was upset enough to have me killed... Here are the caps I owe.
0DI0014352	I do the Santiago act to get out of paying for services every once in a while. I didn't think it could possibly get me killed.
0DI0014353	[FAILED]You think Santiago is susceptible to such idle threats? Santiago laughs at your silly bluff.
0DI0014354	[SUCCEEDED] When did this happen?! Hey, look. I only do the Santiago bit as a way of getting free stuff. I didn't think it would get me in trouble.
0DI0014355	Here is everything I have on me. Keep the extra for yourself! The last thing I need is a constant stream of bounty hunters after me.
0DI0014356	[FAILED] You are not a VIP. You do not tell Santiago what he needs to do.
0DI0014357	Leave me now. Santiago grows bored of this exchange.
0DI0014358	Here are the caps I owe! No need for violence!
0DI0014359	That all depends on who's asking.
0DI0014360	Ow! What the hell was that for?!
0DI0014361	Whoa, yeah. I guess the Garrets sent you after me? Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
0DI0014362	Ah crap. I was hoping they'd forget about my tab. Look, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
0DI0014363	Interest?! The Garrets said nothing about interest on their tabs. Look man, I've got the caps right here, just don't hurt me.
0DI0014364	[SUCCEEDED] Okay! Here. That's everything I've got except the clothes on my back. I'm sorry about this.
0DI0014365	[FAILED] Hey, I'm tapped out, man. I've got nothing left but the clothes on my back.
0DI0014366	I won't. Thanks for not killing me.
0DI0014367	Oh God! Help! Help!
0DI0014368	[SUCCEEDED] Anything, take it! Just don't kill me, man!
0DI0014369	[FAILED] You're freaking crazy. I'm not stripping for you. I'm already broke.
0DI0014370	What? Thank you Mr. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
0DI0014371	What? Thank you Mrs. Obvious. I haven't heard that in a while.
0DI0014372	<Twitches> My eye? A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one talks trash about my eye.
0DI0014373	That's it! No one insults the eye!
0DI0014374	<Twitches> A scum-humping water baron did this to me. No one trash-talks the eye.
0DI0014375	In that case, I suppose you're here to collect. I apologize, but I simply do not have enough caps on me to cover the debt.
0DI0014376	If someone were to recover my caravan from that cave, I could easily pay in full, but who would bother with such a mess?
0DI0014380	Hey, you don't need to kill me. I'm going back to California to start over.
0DI0014381	Just tell them you killed me and they won't be the wiser.
0DI0014382	Oh God, no!
0DI0014383	I swear they'll never see me again. After this experience, I want nothing to do with this hell hole.
0DI0014384	I'll get started now. The last thing I need is more bounty hunters trying to track me down.
0DI0014385	Santiago does not owe anyone. Santiago is a Freeside VIP.
0DI0014387	That son of a bitch McCaffery stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas. I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
0DI0014390	That son of a bitch, McCaffery, stole a ton of caps and ran off to Vegas.  I guess the fact that we farmed out his usual work to you pissed him off.
0DI0014391	No one steals from the Garret Twins!  If you can kill that bastard and bring back as much as you can, you'll be paid very well.
0DI0014410	Doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 388 caps...
0DI0014411	You're short. Come back when you have the rest.
0DI0014412	It doesn't look like it to me. I'm expecting 600 caps...
0DI0014417	See the King. I'm sure he could work something out to get you in. You'll need to prove you're worth his time, but it'll be well worth it.
0DI0014418	Good. Just stop on back when he's dead and you'll be rewarded handsomely. Bring his hat as proof of the kill.
0DI0014419	Just bring back his hat if you decide to take care of him for us. He stole 2,000 caps.
0DI0014420	I doubt much of that will be on him if you find him. If you kill him, keep whatever is on him, and I'll reward you for his hat.
0DI0014421	Yes! Where is his hat?!
0DI0014422	This is great news. No one screws with the Garret Twins and gets away with it. I need to find a place on the wall for this.
0DI0014423	And for your reward... Here's 150 caps. I trust there were also some valuables on McCaffery. Also, we would like to set you up with a room.
0DI0014424	You can have the corner room, rent free. It was McCaffery's. Now that he's dead, we're happy to let you use it. Thanks for helping us.
0DI0014425	Interesting... Well, you're going to need to speak with my brother James. He handles all of the trading contracts and general operations.
0DI0014426	Yeah, man. Those cats are out of their domes addicted to my shit. They can't get enough. Pretty hilarious to watch.
0DI0014427	Really? Aw, you're such a saint.
0DI0014428	You know what? I might be willing to stop if there is something in it for me.
0DI0014429	300 caps and I'll stop selling to them. Otherwise, it is just too much fun watching them spiral downward.
0DI0014430	Ooo, I always enjoy a good scrap!
0DI0014431	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mr. Moneybags.
0DI0014432	Good luck getting them healthy.  If they don't get a whole lot of fixer soon, withdrawal will kill them.
0DI0014433	Hey, nice doing business with you, Mrs. Moneybags.
0DI0014435	[SUCCEEDED] Wait, man! You can't go around saying shit like that!
0DI0014436	Okay, I get your point. You won't have to worry about me supplying those two any more.
0DI0014437	[FAILED] Wow, you really suck at this don't you? Go bully some molerats, jackass.
0DI0014438	Heh, you sorry sad sack.  Come back when you've got the caps.
0DI0014439	Really now? This is news. We could possibly supply what they need, but they would need to supply us in kind.
0DI0014440	They have the tech know-how to make our stills work more efficiently. Purer alcohol means we can get our customers drunk quicker.
0DI0014441	Getting our customers drunk quicker means more caps spent at the tables and stuffing slots if you know what I mean.
0DI0014442	Plus, the extra alcohol can serve as surgical disinfectant for their needs. The Followers are a good lot. They've stitched up our boys in the past.
0DI0014443	Good. We can supply them with all the Med-X they need. For the Fixer, we'll only be able to send over some basic drug components.
0DI0014444	We're not in the business of getting people off drugs, so we don't really dabble in that side of things.
0DI0014445	The Followers should be able to whip some up with what we have available, though.
0DI0014446	They just need to agree to fix up our stills and keep them maintained plus cover the cost for raw materials needed to make the alcohol.
0DI0014447	Sure. Take a look.
0DI0014448	Not for someone like you. My customers would shit a brick if they knew I sold anything to you.
0DI0014449	If you need help cleaning up your rep around Freeside, I might be able to help... for a price.
0DI0014450	Hey, that's great. We'll get some supplies sent over today as a show of good faith.
0DI0014451	Once our stills are upgraded, we'll never be short on liquor for our patrons. If Jacob Hoff is sober, we might even have a few new drinks on tap.
0DI0014452	Most might view us as drug dealing enablers around here, but honestly we care about our patrons. It's bad business for people to get addicted.
0DI0014453	We've got enough crime in Freeside without a bunch of strung-out junkies robbing traders and gamblers to afford their next fix.
0DI0014454	House may have boxed us out of the Strip, but we also don't have to deal with their bullshit.
0DI0014455	I think now that the Followers are working with us, we'll be able to shape up Freeside a bit more.
0DI0014456	With Jacob Hoff sobered up, there are new drinks are on the menu and sales are strong. People love the new Absinthe and Rum & Nuka.
0DI0014457	Well, I wasn't expecting the increased NCR presence after the bombing to improve things, but I've been pleasantly surprised.
0DI0014458	The off-duty chumps who have been wandering through have been stopping in to buy drinks and pay for strange. I appreciate the extra income.
0DI0014459	The build-up of tension around the dam isn't making things safe, but it sure is bringing in a lot of hotheads looking to drink their worries away.
0DI0014460	With the Kings dead, business is going a bit south. It's harder to get supplies into Freeside safely without their help.
0DI0014461	We ain't scraping to get by, if that's what you're asking.
0DI0014462	That's phenomenal! Who did you find?
0DI0014463	They supply Freeside with drugs and liquor. From my point of view they're just better-organized pushers.
0DI0014464	Upgrading their stills would increase their supply of liquor and chems. How does that help Freeside?
0DI0014465	True, we could help addicts, but the cycle of addiction, recover, and relapse would remain.
0DI0014466	Good point. We wouldn't be paying anything for their supplies, just a portion of our food waste to make ethanol.
0DI0014467	We get food from nearby wasteland farmers in exchange for medical services, so we could put our caps back into helping Freeside.
0DI0014468	Tell the Garrets we'll keep their stills running if they provide us with supplies. Thank you for arranging this. You've been a godsend.
0DI0014469	Yes, Old Bill Ronte and Jacob Hoff. They're not going to kick their habits on their own.
0DI0014470	Old Bill Ronte is an exceptionally skilled machinist. He could fix the problems we've been having with Freeside's water pump, if he sobered up.
0DI0014471	The Garrets hooked Jacob on chems when he was working for them. Ironic, since he used to homebrew detox chems. He's a natural chemist.
0DI0014472	The big man around here is The King. Not much happens in Freeside that he doesn't know about.
0DI0014473	He has the most influence locally, and some of his crew haven't helped the situation by harassing NCR citizens and charging double for water.
0DI0014474	Some NCR soldiers have been bringing in supplies, but none of it is going to Freeside locals. I've tried to speak to both sides to no avail.
0DI0014475	In Freeside, the drunks and drug addicts flock in and around the Atomic Wrangler. I'd start there.
0DI0014476	More than rough, it's a damn mess. Freeside townies are constantly picking fights with NCR civilians.
0DI0014477	Thugs and thieves are always looking for a victim, and the local families are just sitting back making caps on the mess.
0DI0014478	Freeside is in dire need, but no one has been man enough to step up. The Followers can only do so much to stem the tide.
0DI0014479	There is always something needing done. A few souls here in Freeside could be great assets to the community, if they'd kick their addictions.
0DI0014480	We need to get a regular supply of medicine organized, but the Crimson Caravan wants too many caps for what we need.
0DI0014481	Lastly, tensions between the townies and NCR tourists have been going downhill fast lately. A lot of innocent people will get hurt if things blow up.
0DI0014482	Sobering them up and putting them back to work would go a long way toward helping Freeside.
0DI0014484	Head on through.
0DI0014485	Then go someplace else.
0DI0014486	I guess you're not getting in here then, are you?
0DI0014487	Could be. Could be. That kind of information doesn't come cheap, though. I'll need at least 150 caps for this one.
0DI0014489	Much appreciated. The guys you're talking about have been spotted near the old train station in the northwest.
0DI0014490	There've been more and more Squatters heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
0DI0014491	[SUCCEEDED] You're a scoundrel. I'll let it go for 50, but no lower.
0DI0014492	[FAILED] How about 200 since you're such a smartass?
0DI0014494	There've been more and more Squatters from around here heading that way each night, too. Word is, there's a password to get into the building.
0DI0014495	Then I can't help you with that, but I do have lots of other tips that come much, much cheaper...
0DI0014496	It'll cost you 250 caps.
0DI0014497	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, fine. One hundred it is, but only because you're a good customer.
0DI0014498	[FAILED] I've got a business to run here, you know. The price is 250.
0DI0014501	Wow, I might have to head down to the Wrangler tonight with all these caps weighing me down.
0DI0014504	Handing out supplies? Like food and stuff? That ain't nothing to get ruffled over. You find anything else?
0DI0014505	I got Rex here from a salvager a few years ago. He was a little dinged up when I got him, but one of the Followers fixed him right up.
0DI0014506	He's been acting peculiar for some time now. I took him to the Followers and had him checked out, and they said his brain is bad or something.
0DI0014507	He goes through spells like this from time to time. The Followers said his brain is going bad or something.
0DI0014509	To understand Freeside, you have to look back a few years. Originally, we were all just tribes making a living in this area.
0DI0014510	That all changed when Mr. House came around. He made an offer to the three biggest tribes that were willing to listen to him.
0DI0014511	Today, everyone calls those tribes the Three Families, and they live in luxury and run their own casinos in the Strip.
0DI0014512	The rest of us were left to fight over the crumbs, living in the shadow of those more fortunate. Things got pretty nasty for a while.
0DI0014513	But we wanted more. A place of our own. A place where no one could tell us what to do. And we didn't want to go elsewhere to find it.
0DI0014514	So we took control of this place, and made it our own. And that's really all Freeside is, the best of a bad situation.
0DI0014515	We're different than other gangs, and not just because we dress better. We're not just a group of thugs looking for our next fight.
0DI0014516	The Kings are about an idea, you see? Where every man is free to follow his own path, do his own thing. Where every man is a king in his own right.
0DI0014517	No, they said they don't have the tools to help him.
0DI0014518	For now, but they said eventually he's going to get worse. I don't know what to do.
0DI0014519	I don't know. Maybe. If you found a way to help my poor Rex here, I'd be much obliged.
0DI0014520	Your best bet would be to talk to Julie Farkas over at the Old Mormon Fort north of here. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did.
0DI0014521	I can't thank you enough. Now, there's a few things you should know about ol' Rex here if you're going to be traveling together.
0DI0014522	First, he hates rats. Can't stand the things. Giant rats, molerats, doesn't matter. He catches a whiff of one and he's off like a shot after them.
0DI0014523	He's normally pretty obedient, but you might have to chase him some if he goes after one of the little varmints.
0DI0014524	Second, he doesn't like hats, or the people wearing them. Don't ask. I have no idea why. Maybe because it rhymes with "rats".
0DI0014525	That should be it, though. Other than the occasional bad spot when his brain starts hurting him, that is, but I'm hoping you'll see to that.
0DI0014526	I wish you both luck. Take care of my Rex now, y'hear?
0DI0014527	I completely understand. No reason you should take on someone else's problems. Let me know if you change your mind, though.
0DI0014528	Now, was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
0DI0014529	What about him?
0DI0014531	If the lock's too much for you to handle, reading through the magazine might give you the edge you need.
0DI0014532	You'll need those to pick the lock. Be careful, though - put too much pressure on them and they'll snap.
0DI0014533	Always happy to help someone down on their luck.
0DI0014534	Oh. Well, go ahead and keep the stuff I gave you, anyway. It'll be more useful to you than me.
0DI0014535	All right! We have an available room for you. That will be just 20 caps.
0DI0014536	A special room for a special client!
0DI0014537	For The Strip VIPs, like you, I've got just the right room - at half the price.
0DI0014538	My shop's open for you, but not my Vault. I don't need trouble-makers staying at my home, no thanks.
0DI0014539	Having you tonight is my pleasure. Your room is ready!
0DI0014541	I grew up in it. I love it - my favorite place in the world!
0DI0014542	Not that I know much of the world - I never left this place, come to think of it... but it is the most special vault, ever!
0DI0014544	Well... it is my vault, all right. I mean, yeah. That is, no.
0DI0014546	Take a look at this.
0DI0014549	You do? That's wonderful! Let's see what you brought.
0DI0014550	All right! That's going to net you lots of caps, my friend. Do you want to trade all your vault suits right now?
0DI0014551	Go all the way down to the Vault's main hub. Your room's in the hallway to the left. Enjoy your stay!
0DI0014553	Okay! How can I help you?
0DI0014554	[SUCCEEDED] Well. Sure! You seem pretty special. But that will be our secret, okay?
0DI0014555	[FAILED] What? A crappy... rat-hole!? My vault!? You are cruisin' for a bruisin', shuckster! The price stays.
0DI0014556	Okay. See you soon!
0DI0014557	Hey! Got any liquor on you?! I'm damn thirsty.
0DI0014558	Hey. Thanks for helping me out. Being back and working really saved my life.
0DI0014559	Here you go. I hope this helps.
0DI0014560	Those rat-bastard Garrets stopped offering tabs.  Now where the hell am I supposed to go for free drinks?
0DI0014561	Friggin' troll NCR squatters.  A bunch of mouth-breathing wastes of space, if you ask me.
0DI0014562	Got any chems, sir?  I need a hit quick!
0DI0014563	Can't talk. Much work to do at the Fort and Atomic Wrangler.
0DI0014564	I want you to back him up. See this through, and there'll be something good waiting for you when you get back.
0DI0014565	Pace, I want you to take some guys down there and seize half of those supplies.
0DI0014566	Rex, this is your new master. Protect him as you would me.
0DI0014567	Rex, this is your new master. Protect her as you would me.
0DI0014568	Excuse me, but a lady of my stature does not converse with those of low stock.
0DI0014569	Nothing to worry about. If you had hired one of those other hacks, you'd be up to your ass in lowlife right about now.
0DI0014570	To your left here is the Old Mormon Fort. You get roughed up, the Followers there will patch you right up. Not that I ever need their services.
0DI0014571	Up ahead on the next block is where the Kings hang out. Don't let them scare you, if they don't outnumber you five to one you'll be fine.
0DI0014572	Down to the right here is the fun part of town. You haven't seen Freeside till you've been to the Wrangler.
0DI0014573	It's regrettable, but it looks like I'm about to lose another customer.
0DI0014574	You idiot! What part of "play dead" do you not understand?
0DI0014575	Well, here we are. No worse for wear, are you? I trust that if you need to cross Freeside again, you'll know who to hire.
0DI0014576	Well, here we are. I trust you'll keep your mouth shut about the topic we were just discussing, or else.
0DI0014577	That was rather invigorating, wasn't it? Let's keep moving, it's only a little further to the gate.
0DI0014578	Gotcha! Thought you could ambush us, huh?
0DI0014579	Just so you know, heading out here breaks our contract. This is why I ask people to pay up front. See you around.
0DI0014580	You don't follow orders very well, do you? Oh well, more money for me.
0DI0014581	Leave them to me!
0DI0014582	Hmmm, I guess they were harmless after all. I'm not often mistaken, you know.
0DI0014583	I'll scout ahead. You follow at a distance.
0DI0014584	Hey, slow down. I don't like the look of some of those men ahead. Let's take a different way around.
0DI0014585	I've got a few guys already waiting to go.
0DI0014586	Hello, my friend.
0DI0014587	Okay, that's it. Orris isn't paying us enough to put up with this shit. Let's just kill this one and be done with it.
0DI0014588	Oh, boy, those clowns. Listen up, kid, and listen good, I don't care how many fancy Latin names he gives himself, a thug ain't nothin' but a thug.
0DI0014589	Warlords and emperors? Don't make me laugh. At least they got enough brains to stay the hell out of New Vegas - Mr. House'd clean their clocks.
0DI0014590	Sure, kid, like what?
0DI0014591	I know I'm not the scheduled speaker, but I have a few words, if I may.
0DI0014592	There was a time not so long ago when we were bound together not as members but as family. As a clan.
0DI0014593	And when Mr. House came to us with his proposal, we accepted, knowing we stood to gain much.
0DI0014594	Little did we know how much we'd lose in the process.
0DI0014595	As a society, we've endeavored to sample the finest food and drink the world has to offer. But we are living a lie.
0DI0014596	There is a meat sweeter than the most cornfed livestock. Most of you have tasted it. All of you have coveted it.
0DI0014597	Among us, it is a crime to discuss a return to the old ways that unified our people.
0DI0014598	Tonight, that all changes. The taboo ends. Let me finish, Marjorie.
0DI0014599	You don't know it yet, but you are all now guilty of a greater crime. One that ordinarily bears the harshest of punishments.
0DI0014600	Surely that you are all guilty warrants not only universal amnesty but also a renewed discussion.
0DI0014601	For our society to be truly elite, we must dine on the most delicious, the most exclusive food known to us.
0DI0014602	And tonight, for the first time as a society, you are sampling that very dish, the meat we are forbidden to taste, the way it was meant to be eaten!
0DI0014603	Fellow members of the White Glove Society, bon appetit!
0DI0014604	You get back here with our dinner!
0DI0014605	What the- ? You son of a- ! Goddamn motherf- ! Ugh! Let me out!
0DI0014606	Oh my god! Ted! Are you all right?
0DI0014607	Quit your hollering. I'm fine.
0DI0014608	Listen, Pa, we got to go after the White Shoes or whatever they're called. They're the ones responsible.
0DI0014609	That may be true, but I wouldn't recommend it. He's built a reputation, and it isn't for calmness and impartiality.
0DI0014610	He's not what he looks like. They call him "Hurricane Heck." The man built his empire by hiring mercenaries to drive off the competition.
0DI0014611	Lately he's been attacking our Brahmin suppliers so he can take over their business.
0DI0014612	He's the sort to pound in a nail with a wrecking ball. If you gave him the whole story on this he'd be liable to raze the entire hotel.
0DI0014613	And God knows what he'd do to the rest of the Strip.
0DI0014614	Right away.
0DI0014615	But no one is in their chairs yet. Surely we should wait until 7 when the dinner guests arrive.
0DI0014616	I'll be ready when you need me.
0DI0014617	At once.
0DI0014621	Confound it! I just don't know how I'm supposed to sleep knowing whoever done this got away.
0DI0014622	All right. Well, I promised you I'd make it worth your while, so here you are.
0DI0014623	Try not to lose it all at the same casino.
0DI0014624	Well that does it! None of them maniacs will ever do business with Heck Gunderson long as they live.
0DI0014625	Hell, I'll put me together a damn blockade. Hit 'em where it hurts.
0DI0014626	They control the food? Well there ain't gonna be no food. Not for anybody in this whole damn town.
0DI0014627	It's a goddamned monument to inhumanity. Let 'em starve. Biggest favor anyone's ever done this hellhole.
0DI0014628	You better be right. Cause I got me a mind to wipe this town off the map if some of the folks running it are to blame.
0DI0014629	Well who did this, if it wasn't the White Gloves?
0DI0014630	The heck I don't! It's their support that gives these bastards power.
0DI0014631	They all oughtta suffer for what they done. I just won't be satisfied with anything less. Wouldn't be enough.
0DI0014632	My mind's made up on this. I'm cutting off the food supply to the Strip. They gotta learn their lesson the hard way, looks like.
0DI0014633	[SUCCEEDED] I don't like this place. Whole Strip, really. Ever since I got here, the stink of it... it's flooded my nostrils.
0DI0014634	But you got a point. They're already hell-bent on depravity here. All I'd be doing is helping them along.
0DI0014635	Sometimes I got me so many ideas, it's a wonder they don't all just burst outta my head.
0DI0014636	This town's headed to perdition anyway. I'm just giving them a little push.
0DI0014637	[FAILED] No, that ain't enough. It ain't just him. It's this hotel. It's the whole damn Strip, and everybody who takes their money here.
0DI0014638	I sensed it when I got here. This place is evil, pure and simple. Everyone did their part. Ted getting taken was just a symptom of the disease.
0DI0014639	Why yes, of course. The White Glove Society is the most exclusive club in all of New Vegas. Perhaps the entire world.
0DI0014640	It's only natural that you'd need a sponsor from within the club who can vouch for your good name.
0DI0014641	Originally we didn't allow anyone else in, you see. Founding members only. We thought exclusivity would make us the envy of everyone who's anyone.
0DI0014642	And it has. But then I had the idea to allow honorary members. Lower in status, naturally, but it just makes people want to be us even more.
0DI0014643	And the right people could certainly do wonders for our image. Celebrities, philanthropists. We want only the very best.
0DI0014644	I'm afraid you are a relative unknown. Certainly not the caliber of person we would consider for such an honor. Not yet, anyway.
0DI0014645	If you had more notoriety or clout here on the Strip, things would be different. People need to have heard of you, and you must be well thought of.
0DI0014646	And you most definitely fit the bill. Given your deeds on the Strip alone, I can safely say that you would be a prized addition to our honorary ranks.
0DI0014647	Mmm. You'll have to look elsewhere, I'm afraid. The whole idea of "joining" the White Glove Society is pure hogwash.
0DI0014648	You're either in it, or you're not. There's no joining.
0DI0014649	This "honorary member" nonsense is just something Marjorie contrived because she's so preoccupied with image. But it's only a fad.
0DI0014650	Once it blows over the riff-raff we've temporarily inducted will be shown the door. So I wouldn't hold out hope if I were you.
0DI0014651	The answer is still no, I fear. You need to be the talk of the town, really. Think big! Your name should be on everyone's lips.
0DI0014652	Come back then, and we shall welcome you with open arms.
0DI0014653	Most definitely! You have become quite an impressive person in my estimation, and you are very well regarded here among those in the know.
0DI0014654	You have my full support, and you are welcome to join us at our nightly banquets in our special section of the Gourmand.
0DI0014655	I hope to see you there.
0DI0014656	Kidnapped? That's ridiculous! And who said anything about eating anyone?
0DI0014657	I know I didn't, because I hadn't gotten to that line of my speech yet. What remarkable timing you have.
0DI0014658	What are you- ? Why is he there? Who are we eating right now?
0DI0014659	Get them!
0DI0014662	No! These are lies! I never kidnapped anyone. And even if I did, there's no harm done. He's alive, after all.
0DI0014663	So be it. But we are all cannibals here. My death will be a constant reminder, and some day you will all remember.
0DI0014664	You're all hypocrites! How can you claim to be connoisseurs yet deny yourselves the greatest of all meats?
0DI0014665	I am ashamed to have once called everyone here family. This isn't over, though.
0DI0014666	I'll begin anew. The White Glove Society will never achieve the greatness of my new order.
0DI0014667	You'll all hear from me again.
0DI0014668	Don't make eye contact with me! Look at the floor. And get back to work!
0DI0014669	Oh really? So despite your filthy face and your vacant expression and your complete lack of human dignity, you're telling me you're not a server?
0DI0014670	Who do-? Who the fuck do you think I am? I'm the fucking god of New Vegas brahmin fusion cuisine, that's who.
0DI0014671	No. No. That doesn't even give me the credit I deserve. I fucking invented edible food!
0DI0014672	Do you like eating? Good. You owe me your entire goddamned garbage existence.
0DI0014673	I'll carve that stupid look off your inbred face!
0DI0014674	Now get the hell out of my sight, or I'll bathe your face in the deep fryer.
0DI0014675	Well then why the fuck are you still standing there like you aren't the lowest form of life ever to be flushed down the evolutionary toilet?
0DI0014676	[SUCCEEDED] What, me? The supreme ruler of the Nevada dining scene? Teach lowlife half-wits to make food that doesn't smell like burning excrement?
0DI0014677	Do you think it would sell?
0DI0014679	[FAILED] There's nothing I'd like more than to hand the deepest secrets of my artistry to some idiot in exchange for a dirty handful of caps.
0DI0014680	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around his precious feelings.
0DI0014681	[FAILED] Yeah. You know why? It gets worse every time some sniveling wet blanket cries about how I need to tiptoe around her precious feelings.
0DI0014682	[?] What kind of harebrained fucking psychobabble bullshit is that?
0DI0014683	I yell at people because I like yelling at people and because they fucking deserve it. Not because Mumsy and Daddy-kins didn't hug me enough.
0DI0014684	Well what do you want? I'm very busy here.
0DI0014685	[?] Oh. I see how it is. You think because my father walked out on us when I was five, now I have to yell at people.
0DI0014686	Or because my mother was a deranged chem fiend who regularly brought strange men home who told me to call them uncle.
0DI0014687	Or because my sisters would lock me in a shipping crate when they didn't want me around... and my brother...
0DI0014688	God, I'd forgotten about that. How could they do that to me?
0DI0014689	[SUCCEEDED] I... I can't stay here. I need to be alone.
0DI0014690	Forget about the fucking banquet. You know what? You can do it. You be the star chef. Take my recipes.
0DI0014691	It won't fill the hole, though. Just remember that. You'll always feel empty.
0DI0014692	How could they treat me like that?
0DI0014693	Well why don't you fucking try checking the serving table in the wine room, for fuck's sake? Circular room, two rooms down? Ring any bells? Christ!
0DI0014694	Now don't speak to me again or I swear I'll serve you as the main course.
0DI0014695	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Don't get me wrong, I love my job here, but they don't pay me what I'm worth. Too many people skimming off the top.
0DI0014696	Take these. Should be plenty for a book in there. That's all I'm giving. Don't expect me to write some fancy introduction.
0DI0014697	<grunts> You're pushing your luck. Here. I have a few copies on me. This better be good enough.
0DI0014698	We're going to have a real problem if this thing isn't a hit.
0DI0014701	A hundred caps? I have that much between the cushions of my day bed.
0DI0014702	Come back when you've got a serious offer.
0DI0014703	[SUCCEEDED] No! It'll ruin my ingredients!
0DI0014704	[FAILED] Now why the fuck would I do that? I don't have time for games. Stop wasting my time.
0DI0014705	My daddy sent you?
0DI0014706	Goddamn it, I almost died in here! What the hell took you so long? It's just one damn hotel.
0DI0014707	Who did this to me, anyway? They hit me over the head before I got a look at 'em.
0DI0014708	All right, fine. I'm right behind you.
0DI0014709	What in the sam hell? Eat me? What kind of sick bastards would eat a person?
0DI0014710	I'll tell you what. Soon as I'm out of here and my daddy knows the story, you can bet there ain't gonna be no White Hat Society no more.
0DI0014711	To hell with that. You've seen those freaks. They dress the same, talk the same. You can bet they all eat the same, too.
0DI0014712	They deserve what my daddy's gonna have coming for them.
0DI0014713	I never liked them White Shoes in the first place. We'd be doing the Strip a service.
0DI0014714	Let's go. I'll be right behind you.
0DI0014715	Damn right, I'm right.
0DI0014716	All right, let's get out while the getting's good.
0DI0014717	All right, all right. But there's gonna be some justice one way or another. I'll see to that.
0DI0014719	The hell you will.
0DI0014720	You're quite welcome. If you meet anyone who needs food or water in the area, please tell them about this place.
0DI0014721	Yes, I'm a major in the supply corps, which is where this food and water comes from.
0DI0014722	Interested in Politics, huh? Well, grab a seat and get comfortable.
0DI0014723	I've been in politics quite a while now. Always had the drive to do it, even when I was young. It's just something I was drawn to.
0DI0014724	I started my career over twenty years ago back in the NCR as the local mayor and worked my way up from there.
0DI0014725	I managed President Kimball's first run for a seat on the Council. I suppose that's why I have this ambassadorship.
0DI0014726	That's a conversation we might be able to have some day - once you've shown more respect for my country.
0DI0014727	I can provide a quick history lesson, if that's what you're looking for.
0DI0014728	In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam.
0DI0014729	Rangers and army scouts had confirmed that the dam was basically unoccupied and could be restored to an operable condition.
0DI0014730	Upon arriving at the dam, however, they discovered that a large force of tribals and robots had occupied it.
0DI0014731	This was our introduction to the Three Families, the Securitrons, and, of course, Mr. House.
0DI0014732	Using his Securitrons as intermediaries, Mr. House called for parlay.
0DI0014733	He claimed his forces had occupied Hoover Dam in order to safeguard it for our arrival.
0DI0014734	And that he was ready to turn it over to us, so long as we could agree to terms.
0DI0014735	Those terms became the Treaty of New Vegas.
0DI0014736	The Treaty recognized Mr. House's sovereignty over the Strip and granted us rights to establish military bases at the Dam and McCarran Airport.
0DI0014737	The NCR is legally permitted to send 95% of the electricity produced by the dam to our home states.
0DI0014738	The remaining 5% goes to the Strip.
0DI0014739	The treaty actually makes it illegal for the NCR to prevent its citizens, or troops on furlough, from visiting the Strip.
0DI0014740	Once on the Strip, our citizens are subject to arrest - or punishment - by House's Securitrons, though that's a rare occurrence.
0DI0014741	Our troops enjoy a different status. It's illegal for the Securitrons to take action against them.
0DI0014742	Of course, it's also illegal for our troops to carry firearms on the Strip, so there isn't much trouble they can get into.
0DI0014743	Our military police does an adequate job of keeping the troops on furlough in line. I don't envy them that task.
0DI0014744	The embassy was established a few weeks after the Treaty was signed.
0DI0014745	Basically Mr. House handed us a dumpy little building he had no interest in renovating.
0DI0014746	I'm the third ambassador to hold this post. And the first, I think, to accept its limitations.
0DI0014747	My predecessors had ambitions of engineering the annexation of the Mojave. They thought they'd convince Mr. House to join up.
0DI0014748	I've never even spoken to the man - or whatever he is. Maybe the situation will change once we've beaten the Legion once and for all.
0DI0014750	If that's all you came here to talk about, you're wasting my time. Get to the point, or get out of my office.
0DI0014751	I know you have a penchant for getting into trouble, but I'd recommend against that here. The Securitrons on the Strip aren't to be trifled with.
0DI0014752	Perhaps I'll have Captain Pappas keep an eye on you. For your own safety, of course.
0DI0014753	It's the same old stuff around here. Gambling, debauchery, drunkenness. It's all here. I'm getting a little old for it, however.
0DI0014754	If you want more information try talking to some of the other guys around here. I don't get out of the office much anymore.
0DI0014755	That's disappointing. They could have been a big help to us. I guess we'll just have to do without.
0DI0014756	I'm glad you could make it! I have something that I wanted to discuss with you.
0DI0014757	It's a very important matter, and I have a strong feeling that you're the perfect person for the job.
0DI0014758	You received my message, good. I realize that it may seem a little strange that I'm contacting you, considering your reputation...
0DI0014759	But I have a business proposition to discuss with you.
0DI0014760	Ah, I see you received my message. Good, good - I had something important to discuss with you.
0DI0014761	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible so we don't waste each other's time.
0DI0014762	The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that is going on with Mr. House and the Legion.
0DI0014763	And despite your reputation and previous actions with the NCR, we could use your help.
0DI0014764	I'm sure you've noticed that things are a little tense around here with all the issues between the NCR, the Legion, and Mr. House.
0DI0014765	It doesn't take a genius to see that something big is going to happen soon.
0DI0014766	To be honest with you, the NCR is in a tight spot. But... if we fail now, it's the people here that are going to suffer the most.
0DI0014767	I'm not willing to let that happen, and I don't think you're the kind of person that would either.
0DI0014768	Sorry to hear that. Do me a favor and give it some more thought. I'll be here if you change your mind.
0DI0014769	That's excellent news! So they'll help us?
0DI0014771	Excellent, come back after you've spoken to them. They should see the benefits of helping us in the long-term.
0DI0014772	Much appreciated. Once you've talked to them, let me know what they have to say.
0DI0014773	I'm going to keep this as simple as possible. The NCR is in a bit of a tight spot with all that's going on, and I need someone like you to help me.
0DI0014775	And if you prove to be a loyal and capable agent, well... let's just say there's a lot of work to be done, and the NCR is a good friend to have.
0DI0014776	To the Northeast is a settlement. The locals here call them Boomers. They are sitting on a munitions stockpile that would be invaluable to us.
0DI0014777	I would like you to get in contact with them, and then do whatever it takes to convince them to help us.
0DI0014779	Excellent work. I can't tell you how useful that will be.
0DI0014780	In any event, I have another assignment ready and waiting for you. But we can speak of it later.
0DI0014781	Rest up, and when you're ready, speak to me again.
0DI0014782	That's great. They're going to give us an advantage in the battle ahead.
0DI0014783	Let me know as soon as you have an answer from them.
0DI0014784	Oh... very well then. What else can I do for you?
0DI0014785	Now we mostly just keep track of the NCR citizens and troopers around and make sure they don't get in trouble, but that's Captain Pappas' job.
0DI0014786	I keep myself busy with paperwork and reports that get sent back to the NCR. It's mostly busy work, but every once in awhile, we make progress.
0DI0014787	I was elected to this post seven years ago. I'm the third NCR representative to serve here in Vegas.
0DI0014788	Now, I've had my share of ups and downs along the way, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
0DI0014789	That's it. Anything else you wished to know?
0DI0014790	Oh yes, sure sure. Ask away.
0DI0014791	This is the frontier of NCR territory, and we're the first line of defense. You won't find much in the way of civilization east of here.
0DI0014792	South of here is Camp Guardian, but they've been having radio trouble so they've been silent for awhile now.
0DI0014793	Ranger military outpost. We're keeping an eye on the Legion activities south of here at Cottonwood Cove.
0DI0014794	Nothing going on down there at the moment - just the usual slave trafficking. Poor bastards.
0DI0014795	Ring-a-ding! My card.
0DI0014796	All right, well, if you change your mind, just let me know.
0DI0014797	[SUCCEEDED] Well, now, you didn't hear this from Tommy, but Benny likes to go off on a bender now and then.
0DI0014798	Usually he's only gone a couple days, but this last time nobody saw him for almost a month!
0DI0014799	Ask me, I think he's got a dame from Gomorrah holed up in his suite, because nobody ever saw him leave it.
0DI0014800	[FAILED] Oh, uh, it ain't even a thing. Forget I even said it.
0DI0014801	Sure thing, baby. What can Tommy do for you?
0DI0014802	It's cool, baby. Tommy's a forgiving fella.
0DI0014803	Well, acts are a little bit thin on the ground right now, but every night from eight to midnight, we got the Rad Pack Revue!
0DI0014804	Songs, dancing, jokes, we got it all!
0DI0014805	Glad to hear it, baby! My card - pass it on if you see any good acts out there.
0DI0014806	You know it, baby!
0DI0014807	[SUCCEEDED] Ooh, a sharp customer! All right, all right, 5% it is.
0DI0014808	[FAILED] I'm guessing you don't really know how this business works, kid. My offer is very generous already. Think about it.
0DI0014809	Oh! He wants to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe.
0DI0014810	That should give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I just do what Benny tells me - easy-peasy!
0DI0014811	Oh! He wanted to kill Mr. House and use the Platinum Chip to copy my neuro-computational matrix onto the Lucky 38's mainframe!
0DI0014812	That would give me control over all of Mr. House's defenses, most prominently his Securitrons. And then I guess I just do as I'm told!
0DI0014813	Sure! Benny had me look at it a bunch of times!
0DI0014814	It's a data storage device, kind of like a holotape, but a lot more advanced! As for what's on it, well...
0DI0014815	Some of Mr. House's data transmissions made it sound like the Chip could upgrade his defenses somehow!
0DI0014816	That's just a guess, though! The Chip's a proprietary format! You'd need special hardware to read the data on it!
0DI0014817	There are two locations with non-standard hardware on the network - the Lucky 38 and an underground facility at Fortification Hill. I'd look there!
0DI0014823	Oh, he had some help - a lady friend of his! She said something about living in a Fort over in Freeside... but that's all I remember!
0DI0014824	This is Benny's workshop. When the Tops got renovated, he had this half of the floor blocked off for his own use.
0DI0014825	I guess you could say it's my entire world! I don't think I've ever left this room! But that's okay - I'm not complaining!
0DI0014826	It's what Benny always called me. Probably because I'm programmed to be so helpful!
0DI0014827	As I understand it, I used to be just like all those other Securitrons out on the Strip.
0DI0014828	But then my neuro-computational matrix was completely reprogrammed! To be nice! Very, very nice!
0DI0014829	I was programmed to be helpful and answer any questions I was asked. I guess nobody bothered to restrict who I answer questions for.
0DI0014830	That was probably pretty dumb, huh?
0DI0014831	Sure! If the Chip can be used to reset administrator privileges, it'll be super-easy!
0DI0014832	Benny? Ahh, he's an all right cat, you dig? He don't got much musical talent, but he knows how to run a business. When he's around, anyways.
0DI0014833	Well, apart from serving as talent manager, show scheduler, and all-around man in charge of this fine theater, I happen to be its headline act.
0DI0014834	Every night from eight till midnight, come on by to see the Rad Pack Revue live, only right here at the Aces Theater!
0DI0014835	Now why would you want to go breaking Tommy's heart asking a question like that?
0DI0014836	Here I run the finest entertainment venue in all New Vegas, and you're asking me "what else is there?"
0DI0014837	Nothing close to what we got here at the Tops, that's for sure.
0DI0014838	The cowboy act? Yeah, he dropped on in here not too long before you. He's got chops, baby, real chops, and I ain't just talking about that mustache.
0DI0014839	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 3% of the cut comes to 100 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
0DI0014841	And like we agreed, here's your fee. 5% of the cut comes to 166 caps. Don't spend them all in one place now - unless it's right here!
0DI0014842	You talking about Mr. Isaac? Damn, baby, when you bring them in, you bring them *in!* That cat's gonna bring me money like you wouldn't believe.
0DI0014843	Here's your 3%, baby. You enjoy that.
0DI0014845	Here's your 5%, baby. You enjoy that.
0DI0014846	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 3%.
0DI0014847	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he practically begged me to hire him. Didn't even haggle. Here's your 5%.
0DI0014848	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 3%.
0DI0014849	That comedian you mean? Yeah, he was a hell of a haggler. Cost me a pretty cap - hope he's worth it. Here's your 5%.
0DI0014850	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 3%.
0DI0014851	That ugly mug with the razor tongue? Dig it baby, he'll be one hell of a novelty act. Just like Tommy promised, here's your 5%.
0DI0014852	Well, it was my idea - well, me and the rest of the Rad Pack boys. We took it to Benny, and he thought it was a good idea.
0DI0014853	A few years later, here we are - the best show in New Vegas!
0DI0014854	Sure, baby, sure. Tommy's always looking for new talent to bring to the Aces.
0DI0014855	Tell you what, you see any good acts while you're out wandering, give them my card. If they work out, I'll give you a 3% cut of the door.
0DI0014856	Just swing back by as you recruit folks, I'll get you your bread.
0DI0014857	Okay, 50 caps to make you scream.
0DI0014859	Your loss.
0DI0014860	Get the fuck away from me. Don't ask me about Cachino.
0DI0014861	Then leave.
0DI0014862	I can pay you for it, of course. I also have some information about the Family's business that you might find interesting.
0DI0014863	Between you and I we can break up what they're planning, maybe save some lives... Mine included, of course.
0DI0014864	Oh, here are some caps. Now give me the journal. Right, there we go. So let me tell you what I know about the Family's business.
0DI0014865	The Bosses, Big Sal and Nero, have been working for a while on this. They're arming themselves like an army, using this new guy, Troike.
0DI0014866	They also brought in a specialist named Clanden. At least that's what they introduced him as.
0DI0014867	I can't stop you, but that's gonna mean my death. I can make it worth your while to give it to me though.
0DI0014868	Plus, if you go to the bosses I can't help you stop what they've been doing.
0DI0014869	All right, all right.  I can't stop you, but I think we can help each other out.
0DI0014870	I know Not-At-Home and the NCR would be happy to get some dirt on the Family. I can help you get that dirt, and you got me by the short hairs.
0DI0014871	[SUCCEEDED] Okay, you got me by the balls. Here's a couple hundred caps, maybe that'll buy your friendship.
0DI0014872	[FAILED] Do I look like some kind of fool? I'm not paying you so you can double deal on me.
0DI0014873	You wanna come into a back room and give me a chance? Didn't think so.
0DI0014874	Much as I'd love to put my fist through your neck, Mr. House frowns on that kind of behavior, so it'd get me killed just as quick as that book.
0DI0014875	Oh? Is that so, well I can't say that I'm sad to see that fucker gone.
0DI0014876	I got no fucking idea. They let him have the run of the place though. He seems like a nice guy, but he makes nervous.
0DI0014877	He's a little arrogant, but he's too nice. Too open, I've never seen him fucking or gambling. Everyone has a vice, but this guy seems like the Pope.
0DI0014878	He's a skittish little fucker. Spends half the day pumping his body full of chems and the other half pumping hookers with his willy.
0DI0014879	He has some kind of connections, so he's able to smuggle huge shipments of weapons into the strip.
0DI0014880	The bosses got him by the short hairs. We covered up a hooker he killed while flying on some psycho, so he gets us guns in exchange for not ratting.
0DI0014881	You took care of Troike already, you don't need to worry about him.
0DI0014882	No, just that it involves guns and muscle. Also that it's big. Very big. Only Nero and Big Sal know everything, and they ain't telling.
0DI0014883	Okay. You can find me here, or upstairs in my room. I'll let the muscle know you're a friend of mine, that should let you get around a little easier.
0DI0014884	Okay toss 'em at me.
0DI0014885	Knowing the Khans, they were probably drugged up to hell and back.
0DI0014886	We'll take it from here and sort things out. Thanks for trying to help us out.
0DI0014887	Right... probably just bad luck.
0DI0014888	You were supposed to negotiate for the safety of my troopers, damn it.
0DI0014889	I don't really know what else I can add. They were a bunch of guys. Better dressed than most Freesiders, I guess. That help?
0DI0014890	I don't know, man! Maybe you're with the guys who attacked us and want to know if we can ID them.
0DI0014891	Nah, they'd probably just come over here and kick our asses again.
0DI0014892	Well, I don't know anything else. Sorry.
0DI0014893	Sorry I couldn't help more, especially since you're being so nice.
0DI0014894	Hey wait! I just remembered something. I might of heard one of the guys that attacked us call another by name.
0DI0014895	We had just about had it when one of them said "Hey Lou, we gotta go." At least I think he said Lou. It might have been something else.
0DI0014896	Now that I think of it, he said Lou-something. Something with a "T". Tenant! That's what he called him. Lou Tenant.
0DI0014897	Oh. That's different then. How can I help? I'll do anything to get the bastards that did this.
0DI0014898	Well, it happened at night. Around eleven. We had recently made some caps off a bit of scrap we found, and wanted to invest it wisely.
0DI0014899	As we were leaving the Wrangler, we must've taken a wrong turn, and ended up in the Squatter side of town.
0DI0014900	From out of nowhere, these big guys show up and start barking questions at us. Wanted to know if we were locals.
0DI0014901	The kid there's about as proud as a local around here gets, and started yelling back at them. Then all hell broke loose.
0DI0014902	Kid got the worst of it, sad to say.
0DI0014903	They were big guys. Young, too. No old geezers like me. Hell, none of them looked even half my age.
0DI0014904	I was mostly face down in the dirt, begging for my life when it happened, so I only got a quick look at them.
0DI0014905	I hope you find the bastards that did this. If you want, try asking my friend Wayne over there about them. He saw more than I did.
0DI0014906	Just look around. People here are as like to stab you as say hello. That is, if I weren't at your side.
0DI0014907	Two hundred caps gets you my watchful eye for a trip to the south gate.
0DI0014908	Sorry, but all the people with real money are heading for the Strip, so that's the way I go. You want to go somewhere else, hire one of these losers.
0DI0014909	I'm sure Freeside will disabuse you of that notion soon enough. Farewell.
0DI0014910	Done and done. I want to mention a few things up front. In order to ensure your safety, I need you to follow my instructions to the letter.
0DI0014911	We'll be heading down the main street here the whole way down. No detours. You go off sightseeing and I go off to find another customer.
0DI0014912	I'll keep a brisk pace, so try not to fall behind. Now let's head out.
0DI0014913	One of his boys stopped in and said you had won the King's favor. You've done right by this town and deserve a pass. Here you go.
0DI0014915	Stop back in if you need anything.
0DI0014916	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Yeah, I've got a little side business going, but what I'm about to share with you does not leave this room, eh?
0DI0014917	Over the years, I've gradually perfected my craft to the point of perfection. No one can distinguish between my work and the real thing.
0DI0014918	What I'm referring to is passports. If you've got the caps, I can whip up a Strip passport which will fool even the most well-trained eye.
0DI0014919	[FAILED] Wow, you're a real wordsmith there, bub. Sorry, talk to the leaders of Freeside if you want the deal.
0DI0014920	Hey, if you're interested and have the caps, they go for 500. Any less and it ain't worth the risk of getting caught.
0DI0014921	What do you say? You game?
0DI0014922	No problem. If you need one later, just stop in.
0DI0014925	[SUCCEEDED]Hah! I like your style, kid, but the best I can do is meet you halfway. 375 caps, and we can call it a deal.
0DI0014926	[FAILED]Heh, who are you shitting?
0DI0014927	I appreciate your brass, but 500 is the price. Take it or leave it.
0DI0014928	500 caps and it's yours.
0DI0014929	375 caps and it's yours.
0DI0014930	You're kidding me, right? No, from the look in your eye I can tell you're not kidding. Wow, you should really be more careful with your money.
0DI0014931	Here, this should cover it. So there's no hard feelings.
0DI0014932	Now, I'm guessing you really wanted to talk business if you were willing to drop that much cash to see me.
0DI0014933	Now, what can I do for you?
0DI0014934	You're modest. I respect that. So what can I do for you?
0DI0014935	Pace must be losing his touch. Either that or you're a smooth one. So what can I do for you?
0DI0014936	I might just be able to help you with that. But it's not something I do easily, or often. You'd have to earn it. You willing to do that?
0DI0014937	I'll start you off with something easy. Did you notice the bodyguards for hire near the gates when you entered Freeside?
0DI0014938	Then I wish you luck. But know that there are only two ways in there, me or those robots. Good luck working things out with the tin cans.
0DI0014939	It's good money if you can stay alive long enough. Freeside's not as safe as it used to be, so the money is well earned.
0DI0014940	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards, fella named Orris, is making a little too much money.
0DI0014941	He's making a killing in repeat business. Once someone hires him they never want anyone else. I want you to find out why.
0DI0014942	Specifically, I want you to hire him. Play the part of an innocent tourist and follow his lead.
0DI0014943	If nothing happens, so be it. But I'm guessing things won't go so smoothly. Call it a hunch. So what do you say?
0DI0014945	Usually well earned, that is. Recently my men tell me that one of those bodyguards is getting a suspiciously large amount of business.
0DI0014946	The man's name is Orris, and everyone who hires him specifically requests him when they return. I want you to find out why.
0DI0014947	Specifically, I want you to hire him. He's usually covering the northern gate. Then I want you to head for the southern gate.
0DI0014949	Okay, then. Once you part ways, return here. I'll look forward to hearing your report. Oh, and take this to cover the hiring cost.
0DI0014950	You may have noticed that some of those guards out there are Kings, too. I'm just looking out for my men.
0DI0014951	I'm not trying to get some kind of unfair advantage. I just want a level playing field for my boys. So what do you say?
0DI0014952	I've tried, but he can smell a King a mile away. Probably knows all our faces by now. He's not a stupid man, I'll give him that.
0DI0014953	What I need is someone he won't recognize, which makes you perfect.
0DI0014954	So are you going to take the job or what?
0DI0014955	That's too bad. We could have helped each other out. If you change your mind, stop back. The job might still be waiting for you.
0DI0014956	So that's how it happens... Okay, then. I'll have some guys pull him off the street when no one's looking.
0DI0014957	You've shown me something, so maybe you can help me with a matter that's a little more important.
0DI0014958	A lot of folks round these parts who've been here a while resent the sheer number of people that have come into the area since the Strip was built.
0DI0014959	In turn the newcomers, most of whom come from the NCR, have gotten ornery from being resented. Sometimes things get violent.
0DI0014960	This is one of those occasions. Recently, a few friends of mine were attacked, and I want you to find out who did it.
0DI0014961	Word's come that they just woke up over at the Old Mormon Fort just north of here. Head on over and see if they remember anything.
0DI0014962	Oh he did, did he? Well that just ain't good enough. Get back out there and hire him again. Hire him a hundred times if that's what it takes.
0DI0014963	And before you ask, I'm not gonna cover the cost this time. It's bad enough I'm giving the man *more* business.
0DI0014964	Ah, so it went down like that, huh? I guess it can't be helped now.
0DI0014965	You're not subtle, but you get the job done. That's good enough for me. Maybe you can help me with something more important.
0DI0014966	We've actually already met. It is good to see you again.
0DI0014967	It's a pleasure to meet you. I appreciate what you've done so far in the interest of peace in Freeside.
0DI0014968	Please bear in mind that there may be more to this situation than there seems. The reasons for these attacks are yet unknown.
0DI0014969	It may be possible to avoid further bloodshed if you discover the cause at the root of this recent outbreak of violence.
0DI0014970	Huh. Well, yeah, okay, these are Benny's brand, and they ain't too common. You got anything else?
0DI0014971	Yeah, that looks like Benny's lighter all right. Still, not exactly a ton of proof. Got anything else, kid?
0DI0014972	That's... pretty shady, yeah. Could be Benny's up to no good, could be this is somebody else altogether. What else you got?
0DI0014973	Creepy bunch of cats, you ask me. Oh, sure, they act all polite and civilized, but there's something off about them, you dig?
0DI0014974	Don't get me wrong, that resort of theirs is ring-a-ding, but my guts say, "don't go in the basement."
0DI0014975	I'll tell you what I think, I think I oughta go tell Benny about this right now - but I'll clam up for now.
0DI0014976	That's all I'm going to do, though, unless you can get me some more proof.
0DI0014977	I think you might just be onto something here, kid. Tell you what, I can't actively back your play, but I'll keep the Chairmen off your back.
0DI0014978	I'll tell the doormen you're cool to pack heat inside - trust me, you're gonna need it.
0DI0014979	You'll still have to deal with Benny's private goon squad, though. I got no play with those cats. You want more help, I'll need more proof.
0DI0014980	Jesus, kid, I think we got a real problem on our hands. Can't believe Benny's a no-good stinkin' punk. Trying to play House like that....
0DI0014981	Tell you what - I'll call Benny, keep him away from his suite. You go search the place. Here's the key, it's on the 13th floor.
0DI0014982	It's the room with the double doors, can't miss it. Maybe you'll find something we can show to Mr. House and get him arrested.
0DI0014983	Groovy. Here's your stuff back - in case you run into company, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
0DI0014984	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your left.
0DI0014985	Yeah, thought so. You're a smart kid, you know that?
0DI0014986	Take him out? Jesus... okay, well, if you think that's the best way to deal with this. I'll send him up to his room, you can ambush him there.
0DI0014987	And don't worry about the rest of the Chairmen - I'll keep them from getting involved. You'll still have to watch out for Benny's guards, though.
0DI0014988	Huh? What are you talking about?
0DI0014989	[SUCCEEDED] Huh? What are you talking about?
0DI0014990	[FAILED] Why you lousy no-good punk! Give me one reason why I shouldn't take this to Benny right now!
0DI0014991	Anybody ever tell you your sense of humor stinks? I'll let it go this time, but you watch your mouth from now on.
0DI0014992	Pal, you're gonna regret that for the rest of your very short life.
0DI0014993	That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
0DI0014994	[SUCCEEDED] That doesn't... why would he pull a stunt like that? Got anything else to offer?
0DI0014995	[FAILED] Kid, I think you really better shut up and stop making baseless accusations unless you got some proof. Well?
0DI0014996	He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
0DI0014997	[SUCCEEDED] He's trying to pull a fast one on the big man? Crazy bastard. You got any more?
0DI0014998	[FAILED] Kid, that doesn't even pretend to make sense. You want to try again?
0DI0014999	Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
0DI0015000	[SUCCEEDED] Jesus, I can't even believe it. After all House did to set us up with this swank joint. I don't suppose there's more?
0DI0015001	[FAILED] Now you're just talking crazy. No way Benny'd risk something like that. What else you got?
0DI0015002	Oh, they're a shifty pack of rats. If I were you, I'd keep one hand on my wallet and the other on my gun whenever they're around.
0DI0015003	House is an all-right kind of guy. Sure, he keeps a pretty tight grip on the reins, but Vegas is a wild horse, and you can't just give her her head.
0DI0015004	Without Mr. House, we'd still be wearing gecko skins, poking around the ruins with pointy sticks and scalping people for giggles.
0DI0015005	Baby, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
0DI0015006	Everybody loves the Chairmen, because we show them a simple good time, no strings attached.
0DI0015007	Man, we're only the coolest cats on the whole Strip. We been here the longest, we got the swankiest digs, and we got caps rolling in like the tide.
0DI0015009	You might have a jaw at Tommy Torini up in the Aces. He's always looking for talent scouts.
0DI0015010	Ooh, I dig the way you think, doll. Here, go treat yourself.
0DI0015011	Sure, whatever you want.
0DI0015013	Huh. Guess that makes me the boss. Ring-a-ding.
0DI0015014	I hope so, kid. Last thing we need is that punk running around out there.
0DI0015015	Yeah, sure. Take your stuff back - you'll need it.
0DI0015016	Go on then. Elevators are past the slot machines on your right.
0DI0015017	Here's your stuff back - in case Benny don't go quiet, you dig? I'll tell the boys to give you a pass to pack some heat.
0DI0015020	Okay. Just let me know when you're ready.
0DI0015021	Yeah, sure. I hope you know what you're doing, kid.
0DI0015022	You got it. Anything else?
0DI0015023	You don't know? <Sighs> Good. That's good. So they didn't send you after me.
0DI0015024	Where's the gentleman I'm supposed to meet?
0DI0015025	So was the man I'm supposed to be meeting here. Where is he?
0DI0015026	Matchbook? What about the man I gave it to?
0DI0015027	Oh my goodness me! They must know he was talking to someone on the inside.
0DI0015028	They'll be watching everyone closer now. I knew this was a mistake.
0DI0015029	The devil he did. He was supposed to meet me days ago. Are you in Mortimer's employ, then?
0DI0015031	Mortimer. If he realizes it was me the investigator was planning to meet, he'll have me killed.
0DI0015032	The girl. The one who disappeared. I know what happened to her.
0DI0015033	Yes. The White Glove Society strictly forbids eating humans. But we weren't always the White Glove Society.
0DI0015034	Mortimer and some of the others have... regressed... to the old ways.
0DI0015035	They've taken many people over the last few months. But always from Freeside or secluded places, where they wouldn't be missed.
0DI0015036	It wasn't enough. Lately they've gone for tourists here on the Strip. Even in the hotel.
0DI0015037	I guess that's the hazard of a cannibal becoming a gourmet - it's hard to please a refined palate.
0DI0015038	Because I distracted her fiancee while they took her. Well, I'm not proud of it! But I had to. They could see I was having second thoughts.
0DI0015039	Some of the White Gloves began meeting privately a while back. Started talking about how we'd lost our identity.
0DI0015040	I started attending because I thought it was about changing our politics.
0DI0015041	Then they started talking about returning to the old ways, and there was no way out. They'd kill me for the things I'd heard them say.
0DI0015042	He's alive, as far as I know. They're trying to keep him fresh. Mortimer has special plans for him.
0DI0015043	The White Glove Society has a banquet every night at 7. It's in our private section.
0DI0015044	Mortimer wants to reintroduce humans into our cuisine. Since eating people is a crime we punish by death, he's going to do it in secret.
0DI0015045	After everyone has eaten it he'll tell them.
0DI0015046	With no real way to punish everyone, in Mortimer's mind, anyway, their minds will be open to the idea of eating people as a delicacy.
0DI0015047	They might. But to him the legacy of returning to the old ways is worth his own life. I don't think he expects it, though. I don't, either.
0DI0015048	Nothing is more important to the Society than to be on the cutting edge of New Vegas cuisine. Mortimer's idea will appeal to that need.
0DI0015049	He just has to get them over the taboo.
0DI0015050	I don't know exactly. I wasn't in on it. I think some of them have stopped trusting me.
0DI0015051	But you can bet they're keeping him near the Gourmand. Our chef, Philippe, has an obsession with fresh ingredients.
0DI0015052	It'd be back in the members only section, so you'll have to be careful. Don't be seen, and more importantly, don't let them see Ted in the open.
0DI0015053	It's guarded both at the lobby entrance and in the access tunnels leading from the main restaurant.
0DI0015054	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. But I don't know that you've achieved the level of status that would gain the Society's approval.
0DI0015055	Perhaps if you were to gain some more notoriety on the Strip, we could get you in.
0DI0015056	I... could sponsor you as an honorary member. The White Gloves are always looking for people who can elevate their status.
0DI0015057	You'd certainly fit the bill with everything you've done around here.
0DI0015058	Otherwise, you'll have to find some way to get inside quietly. It won't be easy. And it'll be harder still to get him out.
0DI0015059	Hmm. Well, they'll all be sampling Pre-War wines before the meal. Maybe it's as simple as drugging them.
0DI0015060	Although... that wouldn't stop any future kidnappings. You'd have to expose Mortimer. But he's going to confess anyway...
0DI0015061	What if... what if his revelation were a lie? What if no one had eaten human flesh but him?
0DI0015062	If you could somehow replace Philippe in the kitchen and serve a convincing substitute instead...
0DI0015063	You could walk Ted right through the middle of that room after Mortimer speaks. And then he'd have some explaining to do.
0DI0015064	Philippe has been trying to approximate the taste of human flesh for years. He must have a recipe somewhere.
0DI0015065	What!? No, please! Here, take the caps but please don't hurt me!
0DI0015066	Most people don't, uh, understand what it means to grow up in a vault. Its corridors, its walls, radiate a warmth that feels, safe, honest.
0DI0015067	But here everything is huge and threatening - so empty that I think one of these days I'll just... snap.
0DI0015068	It's this place - my inspiration ebbs and I don't know how to stop it! I can't feel the warmth anymore...
0DI0015069	Well, I, uh, not much, really. Vault 21 was my home, my dear home. I left it to explore the outside world.
0DI0015070	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
0DI0015072	Wait a minute... Do you even know what I do here? Who are you, really?
0DI0015073	[FAILED]Sorry excuses?.. That's does it! Tell Mr. House to hire a better artist, if he can find one in this barren wasteland!
0DI0015074	You were, really? Okay. For a moment I thought you were going to tighten my screws - like everyone else around here.
0DI0015075	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I imagine that it takes a lot to fill the void of such a bottomless soul. Take the caps and leave me to my sorrows.
0DI0015076	[FAILED] What!? I don't get paid near enough to what my talent deserves!? A 150 caps is my final offer.
0DI0015079	Here. Now, please leave me be. I have had enough bullying for today.
0DI0015082	[SUCCEEDED] Ah, an educated fellow? Now that is almost as rare as artistry! So, how can you help me regain my inspiration?
0DI0015083	Maybe you are thinking of Agoraphobia? Yes, you are right. I need something to bring back my inspiration. Any ideas?
0DI0015084	Yes, I think so... But, please, uh, keep quiet about it. Without inspiration I am as good as a tumbleweed drifting in the barren wasteland.
0DI0015085	I feel haunted by something terrible. Working in such a huge workshop often makes me shiver... I can't even leave the Strip!
0DI0015086	Wouldn't that be great... No - Mr. House filled it with concrete. Only a few rooms and halls remain. My sister was able to turn them into a hotel.
0DI0015091	What? Are you serious? I am an artist! I need inspiration, not therapy.
0DI0015092	Stop right there!... I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with my brain. What I need is something that inspires ideas back into my work.
0DI0015093	I... what does this have to do with my - never mind! I just can't go outside, get it? There has to be another way.
0DI0015094	Thank you for the offer but I think I really can't go to see... wait a minute. I know! I don't have to necessarily be there to see it.
0DI0015095	Yes. Yes! That's it! I have a camera! It is old but it should work. Perhaps you could bring me images of inspiring landmarks?
0DI0015096	I always wanted to see the Dinosaur and its Thermometer sign at Novac. Then, there's the famous Bison Steve sign.
0DI0015097	The McCarran Airfield and the Helios One power station signs are of much interest to my work - like the Sunset Sarsaparrilla Headquarter's bottle.
0DI0015098	There's an opportunity for profit anywhere, uh? Even if it means preying on the helpless. Okay, you... shuckster - 150 caps each if they are good.
0DI0015100	Thank you! I really can't thank you enough for this. Please, get me all the pictures. I will compensate you accordingly.
0DI0015101	Oh, and if you need more camera film then just come back and I will get it for you. Again, thank you!
0DI0015102	Oh, that's wonderful! Just what I need. Thank you, brave one! Here's some compensation for your work.
0DI0015106	Now that you have all you care for, please... leave, and don't come back!
0DI0015107	Aaaaahhhhh - Help!
0DI0015108	I am Sheldon, from Vault 21, although here I go by my artistic name, "Michael Angelo."
0DI0015112	At first it was a marvel to behold. My inspiration flowed true and its works caught Mr. House's 'attention. That's how I ended up in this... place.
0DI0015113	That's great to hear, really great.
0DI0015116	You have earned it, my friend! Now I can finally unveil my masterpieces to the world, all thanks to you. Come visit me again sometime.
0DI0015118	Wayne, it's okay. The King sent 'em.
0DI0015119	Whoa, hey now, kid, that's some kind of serious charge you're dropping. You want to be real careful what you say next.
0DI0015120	Yeah? What else you got?
0DI0015121	Really? You got something to say about the big boss, huh? Well, why don't you say it to his face instead of yapping at me?
0DI0015122	I hear they got their act together out west - like a real old-time country, they tell me.
0DI0015123	Now, maybe that's true and maybe it ain't, but Vegas is a whole new scene. Those bear-flag boys better step light, unless they want a knuckle supper.
0DI0015124	The Tops? Yeah, sure, you want the nickel tour ol' Swank's happy to oblige.
0DI0015125	We got everything you could want - slot machines in the back, cards and roulette in the front, fine entertainment upstairs in the Aces Theater.
0DI0015126	And all with your security personally guaranteed by the Chairmen and Mr. House's own Securitron police. It's the Tops!
0DI0015127	Sure, kid, sure. What can I tell you?
0DI0015128	Joana? That bitch spreading lies about me? I've got a lesson to teach her about loose lips.
0DI0015129	Business? What the fuck do you mean business? You looking to get yourself burned?
0DI0015130	Now you start talking real clear, and I mean fucking crystal clear, because I'm about to lose my patience.
0DI0015131	I banged Lot's wife and licked her salty ass. The fuck do I look like? I'm the one asking the questions here.
0DI0015132	Now tell me why you been dropping my name before I get some muscle over here and we find a private place to talk.
0DI0015133	I don't give half a dick what you've heard. Now get the fuck out of my face before I burn your sorry ass.
0DI0015134	Where the fuck did you get that?  Okay, listen buddy... That's some dangerous shit you got there.
0DI0015135	That book could get me killed, if the wrong people see it. Let's talk, what do you want? What can I do for you?
0DI0015136	Yeah. I hope you're looking to do some business with me. I think it could be mutually beneficial.
0DI0015137	My hands are tied. I can't go against orders... can I?
0DI0015138	You cut a deal with the Khans? Damn it. Attacking them now doesn't feel right, but orders are orders.
0DI0015141	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Good selection from traders and the Van Graffs keep things running.
0DI0015142	Things were better when the Omertas were buying, but we get by. Van Graffs getting killed is making a mess of things, but we have other customers.
0DI0015143	That's the thing, I have no idea. They just stopped buying guns all of a sudden.
0DI0015144	If you hear anything, let me know.
0DI0015146	Really? What did you learn?
0DI0015147	Well, that would explain why they stopped buying. Them not telling me why leads me to think I'd rather not know the particulars.
0DI0015148	Thanks for digging that up for me. If there is any way you could convince them to reestablish, I have a few extra special items you can have.
0DI0015149	They're too pricey for anyone around here to afford, but getting the Omerta's sales back would be a worthy trade.
0DI0015150	Outstanding! You have no idea how much this means to me, but I think this little beauty will give you an idea.
0DI0015151	Take a gander.
0DI0015152	I only offer services if The King gives the okay. Impress him and we can talk.
0DI0015155	Sure, kid, sure - I can spare a couple. What can I do for you?
0DI0015156	Ouch! Come on, baby, don't be that way. You don't know what you're missing.
0DI0015157	Very well. Keep me updated.
0DI0015158	You've got a mouth on you, kid. If I weren't busy working for the Garrets, I might give you a few lessons in common courtesy. Get lost.
0DI0015159	Caps up front. We don't do tabs here.
0DI0015160	Since you're new, I'll lay out the rules for you. The prostitutes here aren't slaves. They decide who they service.
0DI0015161	You best make a good first impression if you want what they have to offer.
0DI0015162	Rooms are just a few caps a night. Your choice of company is extra, assuming anyone's taken a liking to you.
0DI0015164	Great. There are three people who need to be tracked down, a real mixed basket of fruits. Their names are Grecks, Santiago, and Lady Jane.
0DI0015165	James tells me you already handled Santiago by getting him to work for us. We'll just garnish his wages.
0DI0015167	Just a few caps and it's yours.
0DI0015168	You already own the corner room. You don't need to rent another.
0DI0015169	You're already renting a room. Sorry, but you can only rent one room at a time.
0DI0015170	Up the steps, last room on the left. If you leave the Wrangler, we'll assume you're checking out.
0DI0015172	Alright. What can I get you, then?
0DI0015173	I have some work I need handled. Back before we instituted the caps up front rule, we used to allow customers tabs.
0DI0015174	Well, needless to say, a few customers snuck out without paying their bills. We need someone to collect. The job would pay a percentage.
0DI0015175	Well, with Caleb McCaffery dead, it looks like we could use a new bounty hunter.
0DI0015178	I'd prefer you not kill anyone with a debt. It's a bit difficult to collect on a corpse.
0DI0015179	Just get the caps from them. After that, I couldn't care less what happens to those deadbeats.
0DI0015180	If you bring all of their debts back, we'll give you a cut of each. 25% is more than fair. It would add up to 150 caps if you bring them all in.
0DI0015181	Fair enough. Anything else you need? I'm a busy woman.
0DI0015187	Who's the King? You believe this asshole, man?
0DI0015188	In Freeside, the Kings rule. And the King rules the Kings. Got it?
0DI0015189	Anything's possible, I suppose. How much is it worth to you to meet the big man?
0DI0015191	What, do I look like a beggar to you? Take a hike, cheapskate.
0DI0015192	You know what? I think you and the King have some business to discuss.
0DI0015193	Head on through. The King's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
0DI0015194	Whoa. I mean, yeah, that should do. The King will see you now.
0DI0015195	Head on through. He's the bored-looking guy by the stage. Can't fuckin' miss him.
0DI0015196	Sounds about right.
0DI0015197	That's Pace for you. He means well, but he doesn't like strangers. Here, to make amends.
0DI0015199	My boy, Ted. He was right here. I didn't leave him but a minute. I told him to stay put while I talked some things over with the White Glove folks.
0DI0015200	He never was one to stay tied down to a spot, though. Gets that from his mother.
0DI0015201	Got most of my staff out looking for him now. I'd be out myself, but I keep hoping he'll show up back here.
0DI0015202	Course if he does that I'll whup him till his skinny hide turns to leather for putting me through this. But that don't mean I wouldn't be grateful.
0DI0015203	Yep, got a whole mess of brahmins to my name. Bighorners, too.
0DI0015204	Used to just have the one ranch, but land was easy to grab before the soldiers moved in.
0DI0015205	Before I knew it I was running one of the biggest ranching operations east of California.
0DI0015206	Now everywhere I go, folks I never even met shake my hand and call me "Mr. Gunderson." Don't know quite what to make of that.
0DI0015207	That's what they call themselves, the folk that run this place. They're the ones dressed all fancy with their bowties and shiny dresses.
0DI0015208	Some of 'em got masks, too. Real hard to trust folks like that. Couple of them show their faces and that's who I do my business with.
0DI0015209	I don't talk to none of the other ones.
0DI0015210	That's between me and the White Glove Society.
0DI0015211	But let's just say they control the food supply around here, and I got lots of food to give, but that ain't as welcome as you might think.
0DI0015212	What in Creation is the matter with you? Ain't you ever been a parent? Ain't you ever been worried you lost someone?
0DI0015213	You got a real sick sense of humor.
0DI0015214	You're dead right it's serious. I ain't seen my son in hours. Don't know where he went.
0DI0015215	Folks round here, some of 'em would kill you soon as look at you. His whole life I tried to keep him at the ranch, away from places like this.
0DI0015216	Now I take him here and what happens?
0DI0015217	This again? I thought all this was settled. I answered every one of that investigator's questions to his satisfaction and gave all the help I could.
0DI0015218	I know our reputation hasn't always been spotless, but that's all in the past now. How some people can't get over it is beyond me.
0DI0015219	For the last time, the White Glove Society has never and will never consume human flesh for any reason. It's written in the charter.
0DI0015220	Now didn't I already tell you that we don't do that sort of thing? We do not engage in cannibalism here under any circumstances.
0DI0015221	Though we haven't always been the White Glove Society. There was another time, a dark time, when we went by a different name.
0DI0015222	But that's all changed now! We've... evolved past such base impulses since settling into our new home. I've seen to it that those days are behind us.
0DI0015223	There was an investigator who came through here last week. He'd been hired by a young man whose bride-to-be went missing during their stay here.
0DI0015224	Well you can already guess what probably happened, can't you? It seems perfectly likely that she got cold feet and ran off.
0DI0015225	And that young groom just didn't have a clue, the poor dear.
0DI0015226	You disgust me. How dare you say such a filthy thing in my establishment? I ought to have you arrested.
0DI0015227	You'll kindly mind your tongue, or we shan't speak any further.
0DI0015230	Why yes, I think so. If he hasn't checked out yet, that is.
0DI0015231	I had our maitre d', Mortimer, offer him a complimentary room for as long as it took for him to be satisfied.
0DI0015232	You see? The White Glove Society remains the very picture of courtesy, even in the face of such impolite accusations. We have nothing to hide here.
0DI0015233	I do, but one can hardly call it work. I think of myself as a caretaker rather than a common laborer.
0DI0015234	I suppose it is a labor of love if it can be called labor at all.
0DI0015235	We at the White Glove Society are all responsible for maintaining the beauty and class of the Ultra-Luxe.
0DI0015236	And as its founder I suppose it falls to me to decide how we go about it.
0DI0015237	What else? Mr. Gunderson and I have been discussing his livestock.
0DI0015238	It's put us in rather a delicate position, you see, his coming here. Not that we aren't grateful for his generous offer.
0DI0015239	But our executive chef Philippe has transformed brahmin steak into a delicacy. He really is a genius.  Everyone wants it.
0DI0015240	But a delicacy is just that - delicate. If everyone can get it, it ceases to be a delicacy. It becomes a perfectly ordinary staple.
0DI0015241	And if the Gourmand served staples, it would no longer draw the caliber of people it deserves. It'd be a diner or a... a family restaurant.
0DI0015242	So as much as we'd all love for there to be enough steak for everyone, I'm afraid there are more important things to consider.
0DI0015243	Private investigator... Ah, yes. I remember the gentleman.
0DI0015244	This was about the missing bride. Such an awful thing. I do hope he finds her whereabouts.
0DI0015245	If I might pry, have you found something that will help his investigation?
0DI0015246	Of course, of course.
0DI0015247	Ordinarily, we don't give out guest information, but I think given the circumstances, he'll want to speak with you.
0DI0015248	Let's see... he hasn't checked out yet. If you head back to the hotel rooms, his will be one floor directly above you after you exit the lobby.
0DI0015249	I hope we can put this whole matter to rest at last.
0DI0015250	Good. I hope that young man gets some closure after all he's been through.
0DI0015251	You are? Nothing so grim as his investigation, I hope.
0DI0015252	Just the usual. Legion scouts try to slip across the river a couple times a week, but they always end up floating downriver with holes in their heads.
0DI0015253	We've got liquor, chems, and whores a plenty. Pick your fix and we'll oblige. Our only rule is no sampling the merchandise. Caps paid in advance.
0DI0015254	If you'd like to do a bit of gambling, we have an exchange at the back of the casino on the left.
0DI0015255	Say goodbye to the hostage, fucker.
0DI0015256	The NCR's coming for us! Waste the hostages!
0DI0015257	Be quick and quiet, and don't get dead.
0DI0015258	Do I look like a career counselor, kid? Get lost.
0DI0015259	Rates of injury and illness in Freeside are very high. Supplies don't last long.
0DI0015260	Med-X, Rad-Away, and Fixer are Freeside essentials. I can't pay you for any supplies you bring in, but I could discount the charge for our services.
0DI0015261	Just come see me when you've got some supplies to turn in.
0DI0015262	That's too bad. If you change your mind, let me know.
0DI0015263	<Sighs> Ain't nobody got one darned piece of news about my boy? Not one lousy speck of information?
0DI0015264	Ain't got one Brahmin unaccounted for across a dozen ranches, but I'm here for an hour and my own son just up and disappears on me.
0DI0015265	What? Oh, my God! Where?
0DI0015266	Wonderful. One thing up front - the moment you leave Freeside, our contract is done. That being said, please, after you.
0DI0015267	Come back when you have the caps, then. If you'll excuse me, I have more important people to talk to in the meantime.
0DI0015268	You've made the right choice. As long as you're in Freeside, I'm your man. No one will mess with you with me hanging around.
0DI0015269	However, once you head over to the Strip or enter the wasteland, I'm heading immediately back here to pick up another customer.
0DI0015270	So what do you say? Ready to head out?
0DI0015271	Oh, for the love of - get the hell out of here, then!
0DI0015272	You won't regret it, my friend! As long as you're in Freeside, I'll be right behind you, covering your back.
0DI0015273	Oh, I should mention that I don't go where I'm not invited, so don't count on me following you inside private property. Ready to get going?
0DI0015274	That is most regrettable, my friend. I wish you well in the meantime.
0DI0015275	Need a bodyguard?
0DI0015276	You got the caps, I got the guns!
0DI0015277	These guys couldn't keep fleas off a dog. Hire me!
0DI0015278	Protection services for hire over here!
0DI0015279	Safe travel through Freeside!
0DI0015280	You need the best. Hire me!
0DI0015281	Your safety guaranteed!
0DI0015282	Freeside's a dangerous place, my friend!
0DI0015283	Only I can keep you safe, my friend!
0DI0015284	It's your funeral. Come see me when you wise up.
0DI0015285	Are you sure? Well, don't say you weren't warned.
0DI0015286	I can't say I recommend that, but hopefully you'll change your mind. I'll be here if you do. Good luck!
0DI0015287	You could go without one, but you'd be up to your waist in vermin either begging for your caps or demanding it at knifepoint the whole time.
0DI0015288	I've got a reputation for shooting first and not really bothering to ask questions later. With me around, the vermin should keep their distance.
0DI0015289	So what'll it be? I've already spotted two other potential customers while we've been chatting.
0DI0015290	New to Freeside, are you? Trust me, you won't make it ten feet without being accosted by some of our more friendly residents.
0DI0015291	I happen to have an understanding with most of the local wildlife, however. With me by your side, they'll kindly find someone else to bother.
0DI0015292	So you want to run with the best or not?
0DI0015293	Ah, my friend, believe me when I tell you that this place, while quite nice when you know your way around, can be very, very dangerous.
0DI0015294	There are those who would hinder your every step with requests for your money, your business, or even your life.
0DI0015295	With your permission, however, I would be happy to stand between you and those people. How does that sound?
0DI0015296	I understand. Well, have a good day.
0DI0015297	The first thing you should know is that Freeside is run by a pack of yahoos that call themselves the Kings.
0DI0015298	Their leader, who oddly enough calls himself the King, currently has his hands full trying to prevent an all-out riot in Freeside.
0DI0015299	That's two tips, but what the hell. You're a new customer so the extra one's on me. Wanna hear another?
0DI0015300	Northwest of the big Freeside sign is a casino called the Atomic Wrangler.
0DI0015301	It's not as fancy as the ones on the Strip, but there's still plenty of excitement to be found there.
0DI0015302	At the northwest end of Fremont Street you'll find the Silver Rush. It's run by a rather scary family called the Van Graffs.
0DI0015303	Trust me, these are not people you want to mess with. But if lasers and such are your thing, the goods they sell are second to none.
0DI0015304	People in Freeside generally fall into one of two categories. Those who've been here all their lives call themselves Locals.
0DI0015305	When people from the NCR and other places started pouring in, the Locals began referring to them as Squatters, and the name stuck.
0DI0015306	The Locals blame the Squatters for the scarcity of resources in Freeside, and the Squatters blame any act of violence against them on the Locals.
0DI0015307	They're both right to some extent, and violent outbreaks between the two are all too common these days.
0DI0015308	If you've been around the Kings, you may have met one of them named Pacer. He's always stomping around trying show off his authority.
0DI0015309	Being new, you weren't around when it happened, but a few months ago Pacer pissed off the Van Graff family big time.
0DI0015310	No one knows what went down, but word is the Van Graffs still want him dead.
0DI0015311	Drugs are everywhere in Freeside, and even people you might not expect have become addicts.
0DI0015312	Jacob Hoff, for instance. That man was a brilliant chemist before he picked up the habit. Now, just another junkie.
0DI0015313	That King Pacer's a fan of Jet, too, though I heard one of the Followers talking about it being dangerous for him. Something about his heart.
0DI0015314	Do yourself a favor, and stay away from that stuff, okay?
0DI0015315	In the area between the north and east gates is the Old Mormon Fort, where the Followers of the Apocalypse have set themselves up.
0DI0015316	The Followers aren't a bad bunch, and provide healing and supplies to the people of Freeside as they can.
0DI0015317	I've heard the Garrets over at the Atomic Wrangler are having a hard time collecting some money owed to them.
0DI0015318	An enterprising person like yourself might be able to make some caps helping them with their little problem.
0DI0015319	Caught a rumor the other day that some of the clientele over at the Wrangler have been making some rather strange requests.
0DI0015320	Stuff like weirdos wanting the, ahem, services of ghouls and such. I almost have half a mind to volunteer myself, sexy beast that I am.
0DI0015321	Have you tried going to the Strip, only to be stopped by those big metal murder machines? Happens every day around here.
0DI0015322	But if you know the right people, you can get through the gate without being a rich man.
0DI0015323	I probably don't have to tell you that Freeside's dangerous, but you might want to think twice about hiring one of those guards at the gates.
0DI0015324	They're not all saints, is all I'm saying.
0DI0015325	Have you been to Mick & Ralph's yet? They run a store just down the street, and sell some things you might not expect.
0DI0015326	There's a guy out on the main drag who sells second hand adventuring gear. He's got an okay selection, but where does it come from?
0DI0015327	He might not look it, but Ralph from Mick & Ralph's is no slouch with a keyboard. I've heard he's helped reprogram several robots in his time.
0DI0015328	Saw a strange thing the other day. The King took that robo-dog of his over to the Old Mormon Fort.
0DI0015329	Weird thing was that the dog was flipping out, and had to be restrained by a few of the King's men. Hope he doesn't get loose.
0DI0015330	Things have generally been bad here for the Squatters, the people who came here hoping for a better life and just got stuck.
0DI0015331	But lately the mood has changed. The Squatters seem to be a bit more optimistic. I wonder what happened?
0DI0015332	Mention the NCR and people around here get a little on edge. There's talk that they're going to take over all of New Vegas.
0DI0015333	It doesn't help that they've got military camps all over the place, and more troops pour into the area daily.
0DI0015334	There's a rumor that a huge army is camped to the east, massing to attack the NCR. Like that'd ever happen.
0DI0015335	Who in the world could stand up to the NCR and win?
0DI0015336	While everyone knows Mr. House runs New Vegas, no one knows the first thing about him.
0DI0015337	He just sort of showed up a few years back, and everything you see around you is the result. Just who in the hell is he?
0DI0015338	The Strip is run by the Three Families, who owe their allegiance to Mr. House.
0DI0015339	When he first showed up, he gave the local tribes the choice of working with him or getting the hell out of his way.
0DI0015340	Given how things turned out, I know which way I'd have gone, but hindsight's twenty-twenty, right?
0DI0015341	The Omertas, one of Mr. House's Three Families, run a casino called Gomorrah on the Strip.
0DI0015342	If you thought the Wrangler was something, you owe it to yourself to go there.
0DI0015343	The Chairmen run a casino on the Strip called the Tops. It's a pretty classy place, by all reports.
0DI0015344	I haven't been there myself, but I hear security there is kinda tight. Don't expect to bring your weapons in there.
0DI0015345	There was a rumor a while back that the White Glove Society was really an all-ghoul gang, which is why they wear those weird masks of theirs.
0DI0015346	What do you think, would I look good in a mask? Maybe I'd make more caps...
0DI0015347	A traveler that passed through here not long ago told everyone he met that there's some kind of plant paradise to the west where food is abundant.
0DI0015348	All the people foolish enough to listen to him and head out that way never came back.
0DI0015349	Ever hear of the Gun Runners? They sell just about every kind of firearm you can imagine, and some you probably couldn't.
0DI0015350	I've heard people passing through mention some kind of underground fights pitting creatures of the waste against one another for sport.
0DI0015351	And when I say "underground," that's their word I'm using, not my own.
0DI0015352	East of Freeside there's an old air force base, judging by the road signs.
0DI0015353	No one knows for sure what's in there, though, on account of anyone approaching the place getting violently blown up.
0DI0015354	I heard something about a town south of here being attacked, but details are sketchy. All I know is there haven't been any refugees showing up here.
0DI0015355	Which means either the attack wasn't too bad, or it was very, very bad.
0DI0015356	Traders have been griping for a while now about the 15 being too dangerous to travel. I'd steer clear of it unless you're armed to the teeth.
0DI0015357	The NCR used to run a prison to the southwest, but something happened a little while back, and now all you'll get is hard looks if you ask about it.
0DI0015358	Ha ha ha, oh that's rich. You're not exactly my type, no offense. No, I meant I could give you a tip. Earn my money, so to speak.
0DI0015359	You look like you're new around here, so I'm sure I know all sorts of things you'd find useful. If not, well, it's only a cap.
0DI0015361	Oh. Well, you'd better not let any of the real troopers hear that - and, of course, they won't be hearing it from me, neither.
0DI0015362	So, what brings you to Boulder City? Not many people come here.
0DI0015363	The workers here don't much like the military. After too many fights and broken noses, the NCR doesn't allow troops to spend time here.
0DI0015364	That doesn't stop a few people like yourself, of course. Don't worry, I won't say a word.
0DI0015365	I've been trying to get someone to authorize this update - or at the least get field clearance to leave the camp and do this myself.
0DI0015366	But nobody takes me seriously - they just think I'm an incompetent desk jockey trying to glamorize the importance of my job.
0DI0015367	Less than a third of reported enemy sightings are getting intercepted. Either our intel is faulty, or our enemies are one step ahead of us.
0DI0015368	I see... well, if you change your mind and want to earn some caps, let me know.
0DI0015369	Yep, I'd say you're getting a little trigger happy there. Try to slow down a bit. Concentrate on hitting your target.
0DI0015370	Here. Go easy on it, now. Ammo can be hard to come by out here.
0DI0015371	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk. Preferably somewhere where I can get a stiff drink and Cheyenne can keep cool.
0DI0015372	Well let's just finish this first, all right? Then we can talk.
0DI0015375	There's too many!
0DI0015376	Get 'em off!
0DI0015377	Once the Great Khans have been killed or captured, you're welcome to retrieve any property they've taken from you.
0DI0015378	I ain't got much, but it'll do you more good out there than it will in here. Take what I got.
0DI0015379	Seems like wherever I go it's always the same. Folks just never leave each other alone.
0DI0015380	I'm not much good in a fight, with my bum leg. And my supplies are scarce. But I'll give you what I can spare.
0DI0015381	They were having some kind of argument about it, but the guy in the checkered coat kept shushing them.
0DI0015382	Sounded like they came in from the north through Quarry Junction. If that's the case I can't say I blame them for not wanting to go back.
0DI0015383	That whole area's overrun with the kind of critters that just get mad if you shoot 'em.
0DI0015384	Merchants avoid that whole stretch of I-15 like it's radioactive. Which it could be for all I know.
0DI0015385	I didn't hear exactly, but the leader was talking about the Strip.
0DI0015386	Fella wants to get there and avoid the 15, he'd have to go east. Take Highway 93 up.
0DI0015387	Chain gangs, really. The NCR brought them in from California to work on the rail lines.
0DI0015388	Problem is, it turns out that giving convicts a bunch of dynamite and blasting powder isn't the best idea.
0DI0015389	Was a big escape not too long ago. Some of 'em stuck together so they could make trouble. That's what we're dealing with now.
0DI0015390	Now just hold on! I meant it when I said I'd help you. I guess I must've dozed off. That's never happened before.
0DI0015391	Really? I must've dozed off. Although, that's never happened before.
0DI0015392	Didn't hear a thing. I guess I dozed off there for a minute.
0DI0015393	Override? That can't be right. Probably just a malfunctioning tube somewhere.
0DI0015394	I truly am sorry I couldn't help you, pardner. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?
0DI0015395	Never heard of it.
0DI0015397	That's a puzzle, all right. I'm sure it's nothing.
0DI0015399	This'll make you feel better.
0DI0015400	Those howitzers of ours aren't just for entertainment, child! Explosive ordnance is what keeps the savages at a distance.
0DI0015401	Except you! There's something special about you, child, and it was the howitzers that gave you a chance to show it!
0DI0015402	Prophecy? Do we look like a bunch of religious idiots?
0DI0015403	I just hoped a savage - outsider, sorry - would make it to our gates before one of those armies out there comes knocking.
0DI0015404	That's right, child. Mother Pearl knows a storm is gathering. Times are changing. May be time for us to change a little, too.
0DI0015405	As I said, she is our Eldest. Mother Pearl has lived at Nellis from the start, and has the wisdom of her age.
0DI0015406	She said this day would come, and that any savage to reach our gates should be brought to her.
0DI0015407	Unacceptable. You've made it this far, probed our defenses, seen our faces.
0DI0015408	Mother Pearl's invitation is mandatory, not optional.
0DI0015409	I told you, Mother Pearl's invitation is not optional.
0DI0015410	Confiscate your weapons? Certainly not! Personal armament is the foundation of social trust and responsibility.
0DI0015411	No time for strangers, huh? I should probably follow your example. That's the last time I pick up a straggler on the road, believe me.
0DI0015412	Excellent treatment. I hadn't thought of that!
0DI0015413	I thought that man was done for, but you brought him around.
0DI0015414	That was some fine doctoring. I could learn a thing or two from you!
0DI0015415	Ol' Festus is still holding. You go again, pardner.
0DI0015416	Ol' Festus thinks he's got this won. I'm holding.
0DI0015417	Ol' Festus is gonna draw.
0DI0015418	Looks like I got an ace, pardner.
0DI0015419	Looks like I got a two, pardner.
0DI0015420	Looks like I got a three, pardner.
0DI0015421	Looks like I got a four, pardner.
0DI0015422	Looks like I got a five, pardner.
0DI0015423	Looks like I got a six, pardner.
0DI0015424	Looks like I got a seven, pardner.
0DI0015425	Looks like I got a eight, pardner.
0DI0015426	Looks like I got a nine, pardner.
0DI0015427	Looks like I got a ten, pardner.
0DI0015428	Your turn, pardner. Draw, hold, or quit?
0DI0015429	Looks like I win, pardner. You did well, but ol' Festus did a bit better, hee hee.
0DI0015430	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you've had enough of ol' Festus' boots stompin all over ya, say "I'm done".
0DI0015431	Lucky horseshoes! I just nudged your total up one, pardner. No hard feelings, right?
0DI0015432	You're holding, so ol' Festus'll just go again.
0DI0015433	Drat, ol' Festus needs more than that to catch you.
0DI0015434	Tarnation, ol' Festus's seen three-legged cattle move faster than this hand!
0DI0015435	Let's see, you're at 21, so ol' Festus knows you want to hit. Just kidding, heh heh.
0DI0015436	See that? Ol' Festus is an old hand at this.
0DI0015437	Are you still there, pardner? Ol' Festus can hardly see you, you're so far behind!
0DI0015438	Twenty-one! Just where ol' Festus wants to be. Beat that, pardner!
0DI0015439	You're doing well, but ol' Festus isn't out of this yet.
0DI0015440	Ol' Festus must be getting old. You're leaving me in the dust.
0DI0015441	Well, I'll be. That makes twenty-one for you, pardner.
0DI0015442	You'll have to toss better than that, pardner!
0DI0015443	Ol' Festus doesn't like your chances, pardner.
0DI0015444	Ol' Festus is fine staying at twenty-one.
0DI0015445	Looks like you got an ace, pardner.
0DI0015446	Looks like you got a two, pardner.
0DI0015447	Looks like you got a three, pardner.
0DI0015448	Looks like you got a four, pardner.
0DI0015449	Looks like you got a five, pardner.
0DI0015450	Looks like you got a six, pardner.
0DI0015451	Looks like you got a seven, pardner.
0DI0015452	Looks like you got a eight, pardner.
0DI0015453	Looks like you got a nine, pardner.
0DI0015454	Looks like you got a ten, pardner.
0DI0015455	Looks like you win, pardner. Ol' Festus just couldn't match those keen skills of yours. Here's your reward.
0DI0015456	If you'd like to play again, say "Play again". If you're done humiliating poor ol' Festus at his own game, say "I'm done".
0DI0015457	Lucky horseshoes! You just nudged ol' Festus' total up one. Don't worry, I won't hold it against you, heh heh.
0DI0015458	If you hold now, pardner, I'll win! Let's pretend you drew, shall we?
0DI0015459	I'd hold on 21 too, heh heh. Looks like ol' Festus needs a miracle now, eh?
0DI0015460	Okay, pardner. Guess it's up to me to catch up.
0DI0015461	Sure. The elder's already given the okay. Unfortunately, you'll have to use your own weapons and ammo.
0DI0015462	Oh man, I told Watkins this wasn't going to work.
0DI0015463	Look, Watkins and I snuck out one day. She said it'd be a training exercise.
0DI0015464	Said she heard from a guy on one of the patrols that there was a gulch just southeast of here with scorpions in it, and that we had to check it out.
0DI0015465	There were scorpions out there, all right. We started using them for target practice, but before we knew it the damn things were all around us.
0DI0015466	So we made a run for it, and in all the commotion, I dropped my pistol. Watkins keeps urging me to go back and get it, but that's not gonna happen.
0DI0015467	You can go outside, though, can't you? You could return the pistol to Torres and clear this whole thing up for me.
0DI0015468	Oh thank god. Hardin was about to start an inquiry into the whole affair, and more than a few heads would have rolled as a result.
0DI0015469	Since you helped me, I'll tell you what. I work on some of our busted weapons in my spare time, so I have a few pieces that are kept off the books.
0DI0015470	Here, take this. I hope it comes in handy.
0DI0015471	Then we have nothing further to talk about.
0DI0015472	Follow me. It's just down to the southeast a short ways.
0DI0015473	Suit yourself. Hope this helped you some.
0DI0015474	Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes. Especially with two of us.
0DI0015475	Come with me.
0DI0015476	I don't blame you. They're good eating, but that's about it.
0DI0015477	Now, see those sarsaparilla bottles on that fence there? Take this and try to hit a couple of 'em.
0DI0015478	Okay, you're on. Go give 'em hell.
0DI0015479	That's the right idea. Look down the sight.
0DI0015480	Try crouching down and staying still. It'll help your aim.
0DI0015481	Nice shot.
0DI0015482	I did have what was left of the Crimson Caravan money, but I wasn't sure if it was my right to just give it away.
0DI0015483	I owe you more than that, though, so look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp up in New Vegas if you ever visit.
0DI0015484	[FAILED] Look, I don't know you, so what I'm doing here isn't any of your business.
0DI0015485	[SUCCEEDED] That is a pretty flimsy story, I guess. The real reason that I'm staying is because there's a group of men out to kill me.
0DI0015486	You're welcome. So, can I get you anything?
0DI0015487	Other than rolling around once in awhile, it doesn't do anything useful as far as I can tell.
0DI0015488	I don't know why it took an interest in you, but I'd be careful. It's never helped anyone before.
0DI0015489	It acts friendly enough, but I don't trust that whole "cheerful cowboy" act. I find it all very creepy.
0DI0015492	It was here when I took over the saloon seven years ago. Some people have said its owner lived here, but no one knows who it was.
0DI0015493	I'm a Securitron, RobCo security model 2060-B. If you ever see any of my brothers, tell them Victor says howdy.
0DI0015494	An impressive piece of work. I'll keep that in mind if jobs come up in the future.
0DI0015495	The Sunset Sarsaparilla Company has received a number of complaints regarding the prize awarded for handing in Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
0DI0015496	Therefore, we have seen fit to provide another prize that we feel will placate the most discriminating customer.
0DI0015497	Just head through the double doors and follow the hallway to your left to the very end. An attendant will be there to present your prize, directly.
0DI0015498	We at the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company would once again like to thank you for your patronage.
0DI0015507	I doubt it. Poindexter might have an idea for some kind of last-minute scheme. You should talk to him.
0DI0015508	Yeah, right. Bitch.
0DI0015509	Yeah, right. Dick.
0DI0015510	Oh, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
0DI0015511	Classified? Shit, it must be really big then.
0DI0015512	Are you serious? No way! I don't believe it!
0DI0015513	Some folks just ain't cut out for Army life, I guess.
0DI0015514	Oh, don't worry! I won't!
0DI0015515	Well that don't make no sense. We came all this way; why don't he want to stay? It's nice here.
0DI0015516	[SUCCEEDED] Of course. You been through a lot. Ain't much, but these'll do you right if the pain flares up.
0DI0015519	[FAILED] Sorry. I'm afraid I'm all out of lollipops.
0DI0015520	Well, I already told you I came from a vault. After that, was a traveling doctor for a spell.
0DI0015521	Seemed like a good idea at the time. Most folks out here ain't educated, so people with medical knowhow are hard to come by.
0DI0015522	Found that I could help a lot of people with what I knew, and that was all right with me.
0DI0015523	Eventually, I went back and married my childhood sweetheart and that was the end of my traveling days. Didn't miss it none then. Still don't.
0DI0015524	Well, there's a general store just up the road. Run by a fella named Chet. He don't got nothing fancy, but he's got your basics covered.
0DI0015525	If you're looking to wet your whistle, just past Chet's is the Prospector Saloon. The bartender there, Trudy, knows everyone in town.
0DI0015526	Other than that, there's not much to see. Just people trying to scratch out a living.
0DI0015530	This here's Goodsprings. Named after the water we got here, just down the road to the southeast. Goodsprings Source, they call it.
0DI0015531	It's a quiet town, and that's how we like it. We don't go looking for trouble, though occasionally it sees fit to come looking for us.
0DI0015532	That'd be Victor. Curious fella. Sort of odd. And I don't just mean 'cause he's a robot. I couldn't tell you much about him.
0DI0015533	He's real friendly, don't get me wrong. You just get the sense that ain't the whole picture. Just a feeling.
0DI0015534	Keeps to himself, mostly. You want to know more about him, you'll have to ask him yourself. He has a shack on the southern edge of town.
0DI0015535	I didn't see him or the men with him. You might ask around town, though. Could be someone saw which way they was headed.
0DI0015536	Your best bet would probably be Trudy, the bartender at the saloon up the road. If anyone saw anything, she'd know about it.
0DI0015538	It's all I've got with me, but if you look me up at the Crimson Caravan's main camp in New Vegas, I'll pay you in full.
0DI0015539	I've never stopped here until recently. You're better off asking one of the locals.
0DI0015540	It's been in business for a very long time, and is probably the biggest trading outfit in California.
0DI0015541	There's a branch up in New Vegas, but it hasn't been doing so well. Word is that the big boss herself, Alice McLafferty, is coming in to fix things.
0DI0015542	Happy trails!
0DI0015543	I was out for a stroll that night when I heard the commotion up at the old bone orchard. Saw what looked like a bunch of bad eggs so I laid low.
0DI0015544	Once they'd run off, I dug you up to see if you were still kicking. Turns out, you were, so I hauled you off to the Doc right quick.
0DI0015545	Can't say that I'm familiar with the rascals. Some of the fine folks in town might be able to help you out with that.
0DI0015546	I moseyed into town, oh, ten, fifteen years ago? Before that, I... hmmm, I can't quite seem to recall. Odd.
0DI0015547	Anyway, it's a right peaceful town and I reckon it's as fine a place to settle as any.
0DI0015548	I can patch you up in exchange for doses of Fixer.
0DI0015550	I can unburden you of that in exchange for doses of Rad-Away.
0DI0015552	I can help you in exchange for Stimpaks.
0DI0015554	You're going to feel a little pinch.
0DI0015555	Fair enough.
0DI0015556	Hold still. This'll burn for a moment.
0DI0015557	The symptoms of withdrawal will pass with time.
0DI0015559	Well, try to avoid further exposure.
0DI0015560	Well, I know the secret to get past. If you give me the caps, I'll tell you.
0DI0015561	If you make it back alive I'll double your money!
0DI0015562	Okay, here you go. That page has the details, but it's all in the timing as you move from building to building.
0DI0015563	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, there's 600 caps in it if you make it.
0DI0015564	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, I suppose I can cut you a deal, but not a cap lower. I gotta make a living here.
0DI0015566	I'll be here watching, so I'll know if you've made it to the gate or not. Remember, I'll pay double your wager if you make it back.
0DI0015567	[FAILED] No deal. My info, my price.
0DI0015568	[SUCCEEDED] Whoa, simmer down. I'll tell you. I'm a gambler and a scavenger.
0DI0015569	I've made some cash from gambling, and some cash from... reclaiming goods that are no longer being used. Now do you want my help or not?
0DI0015570	[FAILED] Who am I and what I am doing is my business. Now are you in the market for info or not?
0DI0015571	Yep, here are your caps.
0DI0015572	Sorry about that, poor memory. Here you go.
0DI0015574	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain. Here you go. Have a nice  day.
0DI0015575	[FAILED] No deal, here's what we agreed upon.
0DI0015577	Aren't you forgetting... nevermind. Goodbye.
0DI0015578	Okay, well let me know when you do.
0DI0015579	Thanks, this will just take a few moments...
0DI0015580	Okay, it looks like the valve from the cooker was a perfect fit. Here is the rebreather.
0DI0015581	[SUCCEEDED] That's a brilliant idea! I can put that together right now...
0DI0015582	Here you go, a new rebreather!
0DI0015583	[FAILED] Sorry, there is no way it would withstand submersion. Has to be watertight. Past few times I've tested it I've gotten a mouthful of water.
0DI0015584	A pressure cooker would have the gaskets and valving I need to seal it up.
0DI0015587	I guess you'll have to use hit and run tactics, and go see Doc Argyll if you need patching up. Good luck.
0DI0015588	Well, how about that! I'll have to check out your handywork.
0DI0015589	And here I thought we had them running as best we could before they broke down again. Thanks for getting those sorted for me.
0DI0015590	Well, how about that! Turns out you aren't completely useless, working with your hands.
0DI0015591	You want to hear it again? Of course! I did a good job the first time, huh?
0DI0015593	Excellent. Imagine - you're the first outsider ever to hear our tale! <clears throat>
0DI0015594	If you're interested in knowing more about us, it seems like you'd be pretty amazed by the mural. Is there something else?
0DI0015595	Several atomic warheads detonated here hundreds of years ago, leaving the base highly radioactive.
0DI0015596	The savages of the wastes, ignoramuses, all avoided Nellis by habit.
0DI0015597	Nellis is a completely self-sufficient community! We draw water from Lake Mead, solar arrays provide power, and we grow our own crops!
0DI0015598	So you know about the vaults! Yes, we lived in one of those. Ours was numbered 34.
0DI0015599	In our vault, everyone had guns - but the overseer wouldn't let you fire off any of the really fun ones.
0DI0015600	I guess all the little pops and bangs at the firing ranges just got boring after a while!
0DI0015601	You're right, they weren't here when we discovered Nellis! We found the guns at a huge weapon depot called Area 2, many miles from here!
0DI0015602	It took many weeks to drag the guns and their ammunition back to Nellis - and it was the last time any of us set foot beyond our homeland!
0DI0015603	Once we restored power, we learned that some elaborate chairs we'd been sleeping in were actually virtual reality simulators.
0DI0015604	We believe they were used to train combat pilots. We use them extensively. I alone have shot down over 500 Chinese Xian-85 fighters!
0DI0015605	Before you ask, I'm afraid there's no way you can be allowed to use the simulators. They are for our use only. Sorry.
0DI0015606	Loyal found a file somewhere on the base, with magazine articles, photographs, a map, even.
0DI0015607	It seems that a bomber, apparently the 29th of its kind, crashed in Lake Mead on July 21st, 1948. Just imagine - that's over 300 years ago!
0DI0015608	The photographs showed that it was basically intact, and the map tells us exactly where to find it. Except we haven't left Nellis in decades.
0DI0015609	All right. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?
0DI0015610	Gosh, there's a lot of folks. Argyll's our doctor - he could use help tending to any injured we got.
0DI0015611	Over at the workshop, Loyal and Jack are always building something - though Loyal may not be too happy to see your kind running around Nellis.
0DI0015612	Raquel's our Master-At-Arms. I'm sure you've met her. There was a problem with some giant ants a while ago. She might want you to look into it.
0DI0015613	And at Nellis, we found it. We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but otherwise it's do as you will!
0DI0015614	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly! We haven't detonated any atomic warheads since before I was born, but besides that, to heck with nitpicky restrictions!
0DI0015615	[FAILED] Um, that's nice, but it's not really the scale of explosion that interests us...
0DI0015616	Keep that opinion to yourself when visiting Nellis, outsider. It makes you sound ignorant.
0DI0015617	That's right! Our Geiger counter indicated that the base was radioactive, but not dangerously so. Enough time has passed.
0DI0015618	[SUCCEEDED] That's exactly right! You're very knowledgeable for a sav - an outsider!
0DI0015619	[FAILED] Uh... no. We'd just brought devices called Geiger counters with us from the vault, that's all. The radiation levels were safe.
0DI0015620	For your information, our people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault. The radiation levels here were within safe limits.
0DI0015621	Also for your information, Nellis is not a scrapheap! We repaired most of the damage here long ago. Nellis is comfy!
0DI0015622	Thank you. Our self-sufficiency is a point of pride.
0DI0015623	[SUCCEEDED] Indeed we do! Very impressive.
0DI0015624	[FAILED] We are certainly not cannibals! We're not savages, like some people!
0DI0015625	We supplement grains and green vegetables with soy and legumes - that's how we get our protein!
0DI0015626	Our nutrition is not deficient! We supplement our diet of grains and vegetables with soy and legumes for protein.
0DI0015627	Yes, there's just about nothing we won't do to get our hands on some explosive ordnance!
0DI0015628	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you so much! I'll be sure to pass that on.
0DI0015629	[FAILED] I think it would be an exaggeration to imply that our interest in explosive ordnance is at odds with our integrity...
0DI0015630	There's nothing wrong with our interest in explosive ordnance. It's kept the savages out. Until today, at least.
0DI0015631	Thank you for being so understanding.
0DI0015632	[SUCCEEDED] That's beautiful! Yes, it's exactly like that, so free, so... words can't do it justice.
0DI0015633	[FAILED] Your attempt at poetry, is... uh, beautiful, certainly. But it doesn't really work like that. Flying, I mean.
0DI0015634	I can see how you think that, since you don't know what you're talking about.
0DI0015635	It'll be spectacular, won't it? You should talk to Loyal. I bet you could help.
0DI0015636	[SUCCEEDED] Yes! In fact, that's exactly what Loyal has planned to do. You should go talk to him!
0DI0015637	[FAILED] I'm not a mechanic, but after 300 years I don't think those engines would just start up.
0DI0015638	As I said, repairing and flying the bomber is our destiny. It's that simple.
0DI0015639	Ages ago, long before I was born, we lived underground. Everyone had guns but the overseer wouldn't let us explode anything, not even a hand grenade.
0DI0015640	We left and wandered the wastes. There were savages with knives. We blew them up with frag mines and grenades, burned them with flamethrowers.
0DI0015641	It was neat, but there was a downside. For every 43.6 savages we killed, we lost one of our own. We needed a new home. We needed Nellis.
0DI0015642	Nellis, glittering like shrapnel in the desert sun. Nellis, bursting with missiles, warheads, and bombs. Nellis had waited. Just for us.
0DI0015643	Here, we have prospered and multiplied. Here, our mighty guns destroy any savages who might try to harm us before they can even reach our gates!
0DI0015644	Well, until... but... not saying you want to harm us or you're a savage, but... anyways.
0DI0015645	Nellis has revealed many secrets. It has taught us how to fly the bombers once based here. And it has taught us where to find one!
0DI0015646	And that is our story so far, for this last image is our future.
0DI0015647	To restore the bomber, to fly the open skies in armored safety, raining high-explosive ordnance upon ignorant savages - this is our destiny!
0DI0015648	I'm pleased that you listened to the entire story! Perhaps there are details you'd like to know more about? Let me know.
0DI0015649	Got yourself cut up pretty good, eh?
0DI0015650	Next time don't wait so long before you seek medical attention.
0DI0015651	It's a good thing you made it in when you did.
0DI0015652	You need to be more careful, you can really get hurt out there.
0DI0015653	After the help you gave us with the shooting range, we'll take any advice you've got. I'll line them up.
0DI0015655	[FAILED] I've got a bad feeling about this....
0DI0015656	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Easy enough. One... two... three!
0DI0015657	[SUCCEEDED] Solid arc, check. Lob 'em up and over, people!
0DI0015658	[FAILED] They're kind of heavy for that, but whatever you say....
0DI0015659	[SUCCEEDED] Hold the grenades for groups, squad! Hit them in clusters and send them running!
0DI0015660	[FAILED] What the... what the hell are you talking about?
0DI0015661	Yeah, I do. Thanks. I think we might survive this now.
0DI0015662	You've got a funny definition of "well," you know that? Whatever. Thanks for... whatever that was.
0DI0015663	While you're doing that, I'll be here waiting for my friends. Join up with us once you're done.
0DI0015664	Fuck you, then.
0DI0015665	There are too many places to hide around here. He'd see me coming and then "bam", I'm dead.
0DI0015666	He doesn't know you, though. He probably won't shoot right away.
0DI0015670	The next time you leave Nellis, keep an eye out for missiles. We're down to a five-year supply for our launchers.
0DI0015672	Come find me when you've got some to turn in.
0DI0015674	It's better than nothing.
0DI0015675	Thanks. Those'll last us a day.
0DI0015677	What kind of fool doesn't keep track of reserve ammunition? Don't waste my time.
0DI0015678	And to this day, you can get a Sunset Sarsaparilla and enjoy the refreshing taste of that very same drink.
0DI0015679	And sometimes, you can even find a blue star under the cap, just like that man did so many years ago.
0DI0015681	I see my services are required once more. It's about time.
0DI0015682	Oh my. This place is filthy.
0DI0015683	It's amazing how much dust collects if you leave things alone even for a short while.
0DI0015684	Really, someone should have called me earlier.
0DI0015685	This room is even worse than the last one.
0DI0015686	What have you savages been doing here?
0DI0015687	Ah, a job well done is it's own reward. Good riddance to this rubbish.
0DI0015688	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the man, people, get focused!
0DI0015689	[SUCCEEDED] You heard the lady, people, get focused!
0DI0015690	[FAILED] Okay... sure. Everybody shoot the hell out of the target!
0DI0015691	[SUCCEEDED] I've got the one at 11 o'clock! Razz, O'Hanrahan, take the two on the right! Poindexter, the center!
0DI0015692	[FAILED] Faster, people, faster! More lead in the air!
0DI0015693	[SUCCEEDED] Right. Exhale... squeeze. Focus on the shot.
0DI0015694	[FAILED] I'm really not sure that's how this works.
0DI0015695	Thanks for the help. I think the whole unit's doing a lot better now.
0DI0015696	That was... something. Thanks for trying, at any rate.
0DI0015697	The New California Republic. Bunch of settlers and soldiers coming in from the West, fixing on making Nevada their own.
0DI0015698	They can be right pushy, but the roads are safer 'cause of them, so I tend to let it go.
0DI0015699	Not that I got a choice.
0DI0015700	Looting the bodies isn't a priority to me, but you go right on ahead.
0DI0015701	You're right, we did. I just wish things had turned out better.
0DI0015702	Help! You there, please help me!
0DI0015703	He's crazy! Please help me!
0DI0015704	Some what? Never mind, I'm going to take a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Thank you again.
0DI0015705	No reason it should, I suppose. I need to be going. Thank you again.
0DI0015706	Er, no, I don't think so. Caps are caps, right?
0DI0015707	Look, I think I need a few moments to compose myself, then head out. Once again, thanks.
0DI0015708	Sucker.
0DI0015709	That's more like it. The people can pick up their extra ammo and leather armor when they're ready. Was there anything else?
0DI0015710	All right, I'm ready. I hope.
0DI0015711	All right. I'll just wait here until you come get me.
0DI0015712	All I've got left on me are a handful of caps, but you get me out of this, and I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays you back. You've got my word.
0DI0015713	I won't let you stick your neck out for free. I can't pay you back now, but I'll make sure the Crimson Caravan pays up. You've got my word.
0DI0015714	All right. Was there anything else you wanted to talk to me about?
0DI0015715	I'll stick around for a bit longer, but I'll be gone in a few days. If you ever visit New Vegas, look me up at the Crimson Caravan camp.
0DI0015716	At least six, Joe Cobb included. They look pretty mean.
0DI0015717	At least six. They look pretty mean.
0DI0015718	They're getting set up in cover, but it might not go well unless we get out there soon.
0DI0015719	Oh, Easy Pete came through with the dynamite. Here's your supply. I really hope I don't blow myself up.
0DI0015720	I'll be set up near the store. Let's hope that the gang doesn't manage to make it that far.
0DI0015721	At least his death was quick. Cobb's gang had much worse in mind for him.
0DI0015722	Okay, see ya!
0DI0015723	This is spiffy! Thanks!
0DI0015724	No way! Pearl said that stuff will get us sick!
0DI0015725	A rocket! Yay!  Vrooom!
0DI0015726	Ick! My big sister got super sick chewing that stuff!
0DI0015727	Bye then.
0DI0015728	I sure would! Thanks a billion!
0DI0015729	Nuh uh! That gum gets dinosaurs sick.
0DI0015732	No way, I hear that stuff rots your brain and stuff.
0DI0015734	You may pass!
0DI0015735	This toll only accepts toys, and that gum is gross.
0DI0015737	Great! I've been wanting a new toy!
0DI0015738	Red-Brick never touches chems! That stuff will tear you up!
0DI0015740	La Fantoma needs no rocket... But this one is pretty awesome!
0DI0015741	La Fantoma doesn't want to ge sick again! No nasty gum for her!
0DI0015743	No, none at all. We've been traveling together since I picked her up a few days ago, and she's been friendly this whole time.
0DI0015744	We'd actually been flirting a little when she suddenly pulled a gun out and began yelling at me to hand my caps over.
0DI0015745	Now that I think of it, though, she laughed when I threw her my money. I think what she really wanted was my lucky charm necklace.
0DI0015746	It has come to our attention that some of our loyal customers are less than pleased with the reward for their Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars.
0DI0015747	Our motto at Sunset Sarsaparilla is that the customer always comes first, so we have seen fit to provide an alternate reward for your Stars.
0DI0015748	Head through the double doors and take a left at the intersection. Follow the hallway all the way to its end, and you'll come to our prize vault.
0DI0015749	An attendant will be there to distribute your prize. We here at Sunset Sarsaparilla would like to thank you once again for your patronage.
0DI0015750	Lucky Horseshoes is played with cards numbered two through ten and aces, which have a value of one.
0DI0015751	You and ol' Festus will take turns drawing cards. Each time we draw a card, we add it to our total, trying to hit the magic number of twenty one.
0DI0015752	If either of us draws a card that brings our total up to the same number as the other, it pushes the other player's total up one.
0DI0015753	When this happens, it's called Lucky Horseshoes! Ol' Festus thought of the name himself, I'll have you know.
0DI0015754	When one of us is closer to twenty one and the other can't get any closer, either by going over or because he or she held, the closer player wins.
0DI0015755	Ol' Festus likes the game because there are no ties in Lucky Horseshoes. If someone's sitting pretty on twenty one, lady luck can still bump 'em off!
0DI0015756	But enough jawing. By now you're as eager as I am to get tossing.
0DI0015757	Looooong ago, people didn't really have many choices when it came to soft drinks. It was either water, or Nuka-cola.
0DI0015758	The next day, the man came downstairs to find a single bottle with a note beneath it on the bar.
0DI0015759	The man picked up the note, and found it contained a recipe for making a sarsaparilla-flavored drink, and was signed with a blue star.
0DI0015760	Opening the bottle, the man found the inside of the cap had the same blue star on it. He also found that the drink was delicious.
0DI0015761	That night, the local sheriff visited the saloon and reported that the stranger had been found on the side of the town road, murdered.
0DI0015762	He had apparently been attacked by bandits on his way to the saloon the previous day.
0DI0015763	Stunned by the news, the man told the sheriff about the note, bottle, and the deal he had with the stranger.
0DI0015764	The sheriff suggested that maybe the bandits, in a fit of remorse, delivered the items. After taking all of the stranger's money, of course.
0DI0015765	Now, I don't know about you, but old Festus here never met a bandit that felt anything akin to remorse.
0DI0015766	The man felt the same, and had his own idea about what had happened. He went on to become rich selling the sarsaparilla drink, and started a company.
0DI0015768	So one day a man, a saloon owner in a small town, decided to make a new type of soft drink, something that tasted far different than anything else.
0DI0015769	But the man was at a loss as to what kind of flavor to use. He asked all of his patrons for ideas, but they were no help at all.
0DI0015770	Then one day, a stranger walked into the saloon. When asked what he'd like, the stranger replied, "You got anything with sarsaparilla in it?"
0DI0015771	The man had never heard of a drink with sarsaparilla in it, and said so. The stranger told the man that he'd make a deal with him.
0DI0015772	If the man bought the ingredients, the stranger promised to meet him by sundown the next day and teach him how to make a sarsaparilla drink.
0DI0015773	The man happily agreed to the deal, and had the ingredients waiting the following day. But the sun came and went, and the stranger never came.
0DI0015774	The man figured he had been tricked and went to sleep, leaving the ingredients he had purchased down by the bar.
0DI0015775	All right, let's play, pardner! Press the blue button to draw a card, the red button to hold, or the yeller button to quit.
0DI0015776	I suppose so. Sorry, this isn't your problem, I shouldn't be going on to you about this.
0DI0015777	This is an unexpected variable. I had hoped to coast on an easy wave of mediocrity to a cushy government pension.
0DI0015778	Your insults are both unhelpful and unwanted. I'll thank you to keep them to yourself.
0DI0015779	And how would you propose accomplishing such a goal?
0DI0015780	Hmm... an intriguing proposition.
0DI0015781	Company readiness reports are logged on the computer systems at the Resort. If you hack the system, you could alter our records.
0DI0015782	Such an attempt, however, is likely to thwart efforts to motivate the squad to do actual work. If such is your goal, you should look elsewhere.
0DI0015783	Oh, that's right! Here, let me show you what I've got on hand.
0DI0015784	There's not much more to tell. Get enough stars and the treasure's yours. Just watch out for some of the other people collecting them.
0DI0015785	If you say so. Maybe we'll meet again.
0DI0015786	I am now. I was just minding my own business heading west when that psycho came out of nowhere and started shooting!
0DI0015787	He kept shouting about stars or something. Does that make any sense to you?
0DI0015788	< sniff >
0DI0015789	All right. I guess that about does it.
0DI0015790	Come with me. I'll see you out.
0DI0015791	House.
0DI0015797	Night.
0DI0015803	Enemy.
0DI0015804	Bandit.
0DI0015809	Light.
0DI0015815	Mother.
0DI0015821	Okay. Now I got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
0DI0015822	First one. "Conflict just ain't in my nature."
0DI0015823	Okay. Now I've got a few statements. I want you to tell me how much they sound like something you'd say.
0DI0015833	Hmm. Sometimes when you give tests like this, you learn more than you was hoping for, and I reckon that ain't always the best thing.
0DI0015834	But I guess maybe it explains a thing or two about your predicament.
0DI0015837	"I ain't given to relying on others for support."
0DI0015842	"I'm always fixing to be the center of attention."
0DI0015847	"I'm slow to embrace new ideas."
0DI0015852	"I charge in to deal with my problems head-on."
0DI0015857	Almost done here. What do you say you have a look at this? Tell me what you see.
0DI0015862	Okay. How about this one?
0DI0015867	Last one.
0DI0015871	Well, that's all she wrote.
0DI0015872	I don't have nothing to compare it to, so maybe you'd better just have a look at the results. See if it all seems right to you.
0DI0015873	Very interesting. Maybe a little disturbing, but interesting.
0DI0015881	Well, if you're heading back out there, you ought to have this.
0DI0015882	They call it a Pip-Boy. I grew up in one of them vaults they made before the war. We all got one.
0DI0015883	Ain't much use to me now, but you might want such a thing, after what you been through. I know what it's like, having something taken from you.
0DI0015884	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Was my wife's.
0DI0015885	I think she was about your size, and she hardly wore it after we left the vault. Felt it was too brazen.
0DI0015886	And put this on, too, so the locals don't pick on you for lacking modesty. Never was much my style anyway.
0DI0015887	You should talk to Sunny Smiles before you leave town. She can help you learn to fend for yourself in the desert. She'll likely be at the saloon.
0DI0015888	I reckon some of the other folks at the saloon might be able to help you out, too. And the metal fella, Victor, who pulled you outta your grave.
0DI0015889	Anyway, you ever get hurt out there, you come right back. I'll fix you up.
0DI0015890	But try not to get killed anymore.
0DI0015891	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped this off. Said they found it near where Victor found you, and guessed it might be yours.
0DI0015892	Oh, before I forget, one of the townsfolk dropped these off. Said they found them near where Victor found you, and guessed they might be yours.
0DI0015893	Well, we know your vitals are good.
0DI0015894	But that don't mean them bullets didn't leave you nuttier than a Bighorner dropping.
0DI0015895	What do you say you take a seat on my couch and we go through a couple questions? See if your dogs are still barking.
0DI0015896	Before I turn you loose, I need one more thing from you.
0DI0015897	I got a form for you to fill out, so I can get a sense of your medical history.
0DI0015898	Just a formality. Ain't like I expect to find you got a family history of getting shot in the head.
0DI0015899	Southeast of here is Primm - can't miss it, since it has this giant old rollercoaster right in the middle of town. The NCR's got an outpost there.
0DI0015900	If you follow the road north, you'll eventually hit Sloan and Quarry Junction. They mine rocks or something, but I heard they got troubles lately.
0DI0015901	I wouldn't head that direction if I were you, though. Got critters up there that don't take kindly to getting shot.
0DI0015902	Around here, mostly coyotes and geckos. The coyotes are pretty dangerous in large packs, but otherwise they're nothing to really worry about.
0DI0015903	The geckos aren't too tough, but they've got a nasty bite. I've heard about bigger, nastier versions out in the wasteland, but I've never seen them.
0DI0015904	Stick to the roads when you can, and steer clear of the hills north of Goodsprings. The critters up there are big and poisonous.
0DI0015905	If you want to know anything else, just ask.
0DI0015906	[SUCCEEDED] If you're willing to take the risk, be my guest.
0DI0015907	I've got it set to broadcast a powerful signal at 24,000 hertz. Just place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
0DI0015908	Signal's too high for people to hear, so no harm done, but it might make you feel sick to your stomach.
0DI0015909	[FAILED] I don't even know what the hell you're talking about. Sounds like gibberish.
0DI0015910	We'll keep that in mind. Now, if you're not going to buy something, get out.
0DI0015911	She does? You mean it? That's incredible!
0DI0015912	What happens next? Can she come here? How do we make sure she doesn't get blown up? Should I talk to the gunners? Or to Pearl?
0DI0015913	Okay, I'm just really excited is all.
0DI0015914	Oh, well let me know when you do.
0DI0015915	Did I say that? Sometimes I just say stupid things! Sorry about that.
0DI0015916	Pearl will tell you when the time comes. If, I mean. I should really be going.
0DI0015917	Thanks. Sometimes I talk too much. I guess you already know that.
0DI0015918	You said you'd talk to her. Don't treat me like a jerk for asking.
0DI0015919	Well, please, talk to her soon. The suspense is killing me!
0DI0015920	What are you waiting for? I've been losing sleep wonder what she'll say!
0DI0015921	Here take this Boomer outfit. I'll let the gunners know she is coming, and not to shoot at her.
0DI0015922	Wow, that seems dangerous, but if you really think it's safe, I'll trust you. You did make it here, afterall.
0DI0015923	I wish we'd blown you up! I wish you were dead! Just leave me alone!
0DI0015924	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my sweet blameless Red! Curse the walls of Nellis! Curse our guns and isolation! Her blood is on our hands!
0DI0015925	Only if we stop shelling everyone who comes close will some good come from this tragedy. If you'll excuse me...
0DI0015926	[FAILED] Then why didn't you stop her? You could've tackled her or something! You knew how much she meant to me!
0DI0015927	Just - just go away!
0DI0015928	Did I misunderstand what Pearl said? All right. Goodbye.
0DI0015929	Ain't nothing creepy about it. It's a term of respect!
0DI0015930	I know it does, but I tell you, it ain't! I've worked it out so it's simple!
0DI0015931	Maybe you don't understand. Hasn't been one of us, not a one, to set a foot outside Nellis in over fifty years.
0DI0015932	You come along, with your knowledge of the outside, and it seems the time's come to raise the Lady after all.
0DI0015933	Good. Here's the deployable ballast. Go find the plane, attach the ballast, and hit the button!
0DI0015934	No, it's not. It's the smartest idea you ever heard, but you're too stupid to know it!
0DI0015935	Might try holding your breath. If that doesn't sound good enough, talk to Jack. He was working on a rebreather once.
0DI0015936	Are you sure you know what you're doing? You nearly killed that man!
0DI0015937	You've made him worse! Is that what you savages call medicine?
0DI0015938	Were you exaggerating your knowledge of medicine? Even I would've known not to do that!
0DI0015939	Now I know what they mean by "dumb luck"!
0DI0015940	You're welcome to try - hell, maybe they'll listen to somebody they don't see as an authority figure.
0DI0015941	I'd be skeptical of the odds, myself. I just hope they figure it out before it comes to that.
0DI0015942	I suppose if you must stick with your narrow, parochial view of "in charge," then yes, it's a no. Are we done?
0DI0015943	Genius is seldom appreciated in its own time.
0DI0015944	[FAILED] Why would I? If this unit improves its performance, we'll be shipped to the front lines. That's hardly conducive to living a long life.
0DI0015945	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm. You're trying to appeal to my ego. I must admit, it's an effective tactic. All right - I'll help.
0DI0015946	But only because I want to see if it's even possible.
0DI0015947	[FAILED] Hey, you asked. Don't want the answer, don't ask a guy's opinion.
0DI0015948	[SUCCEEDED] Shit, maybe you're right. Guess I ought to give them a shot.
0DI0015949	Whatever. Not like I need any of them. I do just fine on my own.
0DI0015950	Don't apologize. Their care is my responsibility, but everything I know came from an old first aid field manual.
0DI0015951	I don't know what else to do to help them...
0DI0015952	[SUCCEEDED] If what you say is true, you can do us a world of good.
0DI0015953	[FAILED] No need to apologize. Their care is my responsibility, not yours. Thing is, everything I know came out of a first aid handbook!
0DI0015954	If you think you know more than that, let me know.
0DI0015955	[FAILED] These patients were gravely injured. It's not a joking matter!
0DI0015956	[SUCCEEDED] Well... I don't know, actually... I suppose it's possible. You should take a look!
0DI0015957	Mister Cuddles is my teddy. I lost him and I don't remember where.
0DI0015958	Oh. Bye then.
0DI0015959	Thanks! Let me know when you find him.
0DI0015960	Oh, I remember now! I was playing hide and seek in the big hangar! Mister Loyal made us leave though.
0DI0015962	Oh! Thank you so much! I'll never lose you again Mister Cuddles!
0DI0015963	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles!
0DI0015964	[SUCCEEDED] No! Not Mister Cuddles! He can't be dead!
0DI0015965	[FAILED] I know you're kidding. Mister Cuddles is just hiding somewhere.
0DI0015966	Okay, well thanks for looking. Let me know when you find him.
0DI0015967	You picked a good time to stop by, for we're swimming in problems. My youngers can tell you all about it.
0DI0015968	Raquel could use help with the bug problem, Doc Argyll has wounded he's tending to, and Loyal and Jack might be looking for help with some repairs.
0DI0015969	Or you could just go see Pete at the museum and hear the story of our people. All you have to do there is listen.
0DI0015970	Come and go as you like, help or don't help, I leave it up to you. But I hope you'll show my youngers that not every outsider needs to be blown up.
0DI0015971	[SUCCEEDED] You have to keep in mind that you're our first contact with the outside world since I was barely a woman.
0DI0015972	Seclusion has kept us safe. but the world around us is changing. Neon lights in the distance, patrolling robots, soldiers...
0DI0015973	My youngers think our guns can keep out the world, but I think we need to let it in, just a little, or become its victim.
0DI0015974	You're that little bit of the world, child. Welcome to Nellis.
0DI0015975	[FAILED] If I were your grandma, I'd wash out your mouth with Abraxo for being so rude, child!
0DI0015976	I'll send word to the spotters to let you come and go as you wish. Why not stay awhile before you head out?
0DI0015977	Long story short, the power failed a few days ago because giant ants have tunneled into the generator room and set up a nest.
0DI0015978	I led a team down to exterminate them, but there were... so many of them. We lost two killed, three wounded.
0DI0015979	Personally, I think it's more than a savage can handle, but if you want to kill those ants and switch the power back on, feel free.
0DI0015980	All I need is a pretext.
0DI0015981	We haven't seen the last of each other, savage.
0DI0015982	Get those ants handled, savage.
0DI0015984	Sure, anyone can. But there's more than a few down there. See for yourself.
0DI0015985	One other thing. The ants must be eating gunpowder from the munitions down there, or something.
0DI0015986	They exploded when hit by a flamethrower. One of us was using a laser pistol - same thing. Bullets seem okay, just don't hit the artillery shells.
0DI0015987	Loyal's been working on some kind of weapon to use against them. Maybe you should check with him.
0DI0015988	Don't get my hopes up.
0DI0015992	A savage, scared of bugs? I don't believe it. I'm sure you'll change your mind.
0DI0015996	It's not in progress if you're up here talking to me. Get it taken care of.
0DI0015997	If that's so, why isn't the power back on? Remember how I told you to power up the generators when the ants are dead?
0DI0015998	Looks like you've still got some work left to do.
0DI0015999	Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
0DI0016000	I'll tell Loyal to send someone down to clear out the eggs and repair the generators. Good work.
0DI0016001	I didn't tell you to kill most of the ants. It's an either-or proposition. Get down there and finish them off.
0DI0016002	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe Pearl is right about you, because I don't know how you pulled that off.
0DI0016004	[FAILED] You're a terrible liar. Get down there and clear out those ants.
0DI0016005	I already said you did a good job. I don't give out hugs.
0DI0016006	"You may have missed an ant or two?" Get back down there and finish those ants off!
0DI0016007	Well, look elsewhere. I can't let you near a patient after what happened.
0DI0016008	You're finished? So are they, I'm afraid. Your medicine was almost as dangerous to them as those giant ants!
0DI0016009	You did more harm than good, I think. Your heart was in the right place, at least.
0DI0016010	Those men owe you their lives. Seems we could learn a thing or two from you savages, when it comes to medicine, at least.
0DI0016011	Well, there are still patients left to treat... though I worry you'll just make them worse.
0DI0016012	There are still patients in need of treatment. Help them if you can.
0DI0016013	I have three patients here who were gravely injured fighting those giant ants in the generator building a few days ago.
0DI0016014	I've stabilized their wounds, but they're in bad shape. Do you have medical training?
0DI0016015	Seeing as you're a friend of ours, I suppose we could trade for what you need.
0DI0016016	I'm afraid medications are in short supply. Maybe you should seek medical treatment away from Nellis.
0DI0016018	Hold it right there! You had no business treating that man. You may've spared him a lingering death, but that's straight-out malpractice.
0DI0016019	At least a dozen, I'd say. And that was just the group that attacked us. For all I know, they've got a lot more friends lurking around.
0DI0016020	I saw you being awfully friendly with Joe Cobb, so no thanks.
0DI0016021	No thanks. I think we'd need some of Goodsprings on our side, and I hear you're not exactly friendly with them.
0DI0016022	We'd just end up sharing the same grave if it's just the two of us. Now, if some of the other people in town were also on board...
0DI0016023	Start with Sunny Smiles. She's been friendlier than most around here.
0DI0016024	I was thinking of myself, actually. Who's going to watch my back while I'm watching yours?
0DI0016025	Well, I guess that means we're ready to go. Unless you think there's something else you can do?
0DI0016026	Try to hurry.
0DI0016027	Oh. Well, I don't want to make a move until she's with us.
0DI0016030	Joe Cobb talks about leaving us alone if we hand over Ringo, but I know his type. He and his friends will come after the town eventually.
0DI0016031	However, between you, me, and Ringo, we aren't exactly a force to be reckoned with. A lot of people around here look up to Trudy.
0DI0016032	If you could convince Trudy to join us, some of the folks in town might decide to help out as well.
0DI0016033	I know Easy Pete's got a stock of dynamite somewhere, and Chet just got a shipment of leather armor we could borrow. Talk to them as well.
0DI0016034	Finally, there's a good chance we'll all end up with extra holes in us, so if Doc Mitchell could cough up some extra stimpaks, that'd be great.
0DI0016035	Even though Joe Cobb's dead, his friends will come after the town eventually.
0DI0016040	Just like that. I have a feeling that I'm going to end up fighting those guys one way or another, so I might as well get it over with.
0DI0016041	That's inspiring. You might want to keep your optimism to yourself if you try to recruit anyone else.
0DI0016042	Cobb hasn't exactly been looking for Ringo too hard - I think he's afraid that Ringo will ambush him, which is probably true.
0DI0016043	I'm done being nice. If you don't hand Ringo over soon, I'm going to get my friends and we're burning this town to the ground, got it?
0DI0016044	Sorry, son. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. I guess I missed a spot.
0DI0016045	Sorry, little lady. I fixed up your head as best I knew how. Guess I missed a spot.
0DI0016046	Look at that. Maybe them bullets done your brain some good.
0DI0016047	Now that don't make a lick of sense. Seems to me you're the luckiest son-of-a-gun in New Vegas.
0DI0016048	With luck like yours I'm surprised them bullets didn't just turn right around and climb back into the gun.
0DI0016049	That's some serious atrophy, even for someone who's been in bed awhile. It's a wonder you can move at all.
0DI0016050	Surprised anybody'd want to tangle with you. Heck, you could go Deathclaw hunting with a switch.
0DI0016051	I just don't get it. A stiff breeze'd tear you in two but a couple of bullets and you're right as rain.
0DI0016052	I guess that explains how you're still alive. You're built solid as an oak.
0DI0016053	Huh. Must be some frontal lobe damage.
0DI0016054	Good to see them bullets didn't affect your charm none.
0DI0016055	Now I ain't no optometrist, but maybe we should fit you for some glasses while you're here.
0DI0016056	Nothing gets by you, huh? Coulda used you when I lost my keys last month.
0DI0016057	Don't have all your coordination back yet, looks like. You should think about doing some rehab.
0DI0016058	Most patients don't get out of bed after being shot and then move like they was in perfect control. You're unusual, I'll say that.
0DI0016059	Yep, that's a pretty standard score there. But after what you been through, I'd say that's great news.
0DI0016060	You're awake. How about that.
0DI0016061	Whoa, easy there. Easy. You been out cold a couple of days now.
0DI0016062	Why don't you just relax a second? Get your bearings.
0DI0016063	Let's see what the damage is. How about your name? Can you tell me your name?
0DI0016064	Huh. Can't say it's what I'd have picked for you. But if that's your name, that's your name.
0DI0016065	I'm Doc Mitchell. Welcome to Goodsprings.
0DI0016066	Now, I hope you don't mind, but I had to go rooting around there in your noggin to pull all the bits of lead out.
0DI0016067	I take pride in my needlework, but you'd better tell me if I left anything out of place.
0DI0016068	How'd I do?
0DI0016069	Well, I got most of it right, anyway. Stuff that mattered.
0DI0016070	Okay. No sense keeping you in bed anymore. Let's see if we can get you on your feet.
0DI0016071	Good. Why don't you walk down to the end of the room? Over by that vigor tester machine there.
0DI0016072	Take it slow now. It ain't a race.
0DI0016073	Looking good so far. Go ahead and give the vigor tester a try. We'll learn right quick if you got back all your faculties.
0DI0016074	Let's go into the next room. I've got a few more tests I'd like to run.
0DI0016075	Take it easy now.
0DI0016076	[SUCCEEDED] You made your point. I can provide people with some leather armor and extra ammo. I sure hope it's worth it.
0DI0016077	And, uh, I'll be guarding the store while all this is going on. I have to put my business first, you understand.
0DI0016078	[FAILED] Look, you're bringing this on yourselves. There's no way I'm getting involved. But, hey, I'm sure you can buy what you need...
0DI0016079	Right. Just keep me out of it. Is there anything else?
0DI0016080	[SUCCEEDED] Uh huh. Guess you know what you're doing. I'll go dig it up and get it ready. You'll have it by the time the fighting starts.
0DI0016081	[FAILED] Too dangerous, sorry. Blow yourself up, blow your neighbor up, blow the whole town up.
0DI0016082	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse.
0DI0016083	Wasteland critters like to move in when Sunny's not looking, so watch out.
0DI0016088	He's holed up at the abandoned gas station up the hill.
0DI0016089	You mean murder him? That's not our way, even if Cobb is scum. He can bluster and threaten all he wants.
0DI0016090	Some of the others, like Sunny, will probably stand up for Ringo if he asks for help, which he hasn't.
0DI0016091	Personally, I hope he sneaks out of town one night and takes the Powder Gangers with him.
0DI0016092	Then just - just stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
0DI0016093	I said stay where you are! Raquel'll be here any second...
0DI0016094	Watch your mouth, savage! Raquel'll be here any second...
0DI0016095	Follow close - and mind your behavior.
0DI0016096	I oversee the security of the Nellis homeland, from the coordination of its defenses to the training and fitness of its population.
0DI0016097	I wasn't the one firing the howitzers. If you want to see how good I am at killing savages, I can show you.
0DI0016098	Or you can accept Mother Pearl's invitation. It's your choice.
0DI0016099	You appear to require assistance. I'll go find someone.
0DI0016100	It's a simple idea: the Army offers fiscal security and generous benefits at the cost of substantial personal risk - if you're on the front line.
0DI0016101	If you perform too poorly, they'll scrub you out. Perform too well, and you get sent to the front lines.
0DI0016102	All I have to do is ride that mediocrity gradient to a cushy, do-nothing job miles away from the war.
0DI0016103	To what purpose? It's highly unlikely you'd understand anything I'd say.
0DI0016104	Suffice to say I'm a certified genius, and when I'm discharged from this pit of testosterone and failure, I'll have all the money I could ever need.
0DI0016105	In a strictly official capacity, no.
0DI0016106	However, as I am by far the most intelligent and resourceful figure on this base, I feel it's safe to say the soldiers here look up to me.
0DI0016107	Well, as it turns out, we had a string of bad harvests a few years back. Pa said he couldn't afford to feed but three youngins, or we'd starve.
0DI0016108	As the biggest one it was my job to go join the Army so's my sisters could eat and so's we wouldn't all be killed by raiders and Jesus would love us.
0DI0016109	It's all right, I guess. I don't like all the fighting we gotta do, though.
0DI0016110	Oh, it's a fine place. The lake is real pretty, and we don't get bothered much by them Legion fellers.
0DI0016111	I ain't scared! I just don't like hurting folks, is all. Ma always used to tell me "boy, you're the biggest and the strongest, so you mind yourself!"
0DI0016112	Every day she told me that. Guess I done took it to heart.
0DI0016113	Well, I was born on a farm out in California. Weren't much - me, Ma and Pa, my two sisters and about 40 acres of corn and brahmin.
0DI0016114	Didn't never have no problems really, except for some lean years. Then I joined up and got shipped out here to New Vegas.
0DI0016115	They're mostly pretty nice - Poindexter showed me how to make fireworks! Razz kinda scares me sometimes, but I don't mind. He's had a hard life.
0DI0016116	Shit, man, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
0DI0016117	At least this way the badasses with the top-shelf guns are on my side.
0DI0016118	Shit, honey, it was this or the Fiends, and Fiends don't last too long in the NCR.
0DI0016120	What you want to know? Whole place used to be some kinda rich bastard resort, back before the war.
0DI0016121	Now the Rangers use the old resort, and we grunts get to live in tents. Fucking typical.
0DI0016122	Ain't much to tell. Grew up out west, in the Boneyard. Heard of it?
0DI0016123	Yeah, not many people have. Wasn't really a good place for kids, you know? I joined up to get out. My family's still back there.
0DI0016124	We don't talk too much, mostly. Poindexter's a smartass prick.
0DI0016125	O'Hanrahan's a big pussy, ain't good for shit in a fight, and Mags... well, Mags is cut out for something other than soldiering, you dig?
0DI0016126	I guess I wanted to make something of myself, you know? Be the best of the best. I *wanted* to be a ranger, but... guess this is as close as I get.
0DI0016127	Easy - this is where they send all the fuck-ups and people they don't want. But hey, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.
0DI0016128	Not much to tell, really. I grew up in New Reno, joined up, took my shot at being a Ranger. Didn't make it, so I'm stuck with this crew of jokers.
0DI0016129	Yeah. I mean, no, they're okay people, but they don't care, y'know? They don't have any ambition. No drive.
0DI0016130	They're slacking off, and that reflects badly on me.
0DI0016131	Man, it's my life. I joined up when I was 16 - I don't know how to do anything else.
0DI0016132	I've been here since the first push into Vegas. Back in the day, this camp was the hotspot for conflicts with the Legion, raider tribes, you name it.
0DI0016133	These days, I spend most of my time trying to beat a little discipline into the soldiers under my command. They've gotten soft with no action.
0DI0016134	Disappointed? We call 'em the Misfits for a reason. They're undisciplined, lazy, and they have absolutely no espirit de corps.
0DI0016135	The squad leader's got some promise, kid named Mags, but as for the rest... I don't see much hope.
0DI0016136	I'm going to make them shape up if it kills me, though. Or them, for that matter.
0DI0016137	Is that thing silver?
0DI0016138	You're not getting paid to run your mouth.
0DI0016139	So far you ain't paid us nothing!
0DI0016140	You'll get your caps when the job's done!
0DI0016141	Is this deep enough?
0DI0016142	Yeah. Take that thing off.
0DI0016143	Real shame you got caught up in this, kid. Must seem like bad luck.
0DI0016144	Truth is, game was rigged from the start.
0DI0016145	That the thing you were talking about?
0DI0016146	Beautiful, ain't it? It's platinum.
0DI0016147	Can't see shit out here.
0DI0016148	Either way, you owe us.
0DI0016149	I told you, you'll get paid when we get there.
0DI0016150	We just walked through hell, man.
0DI0016151	What are you, dense? I don't got it here!
0DI0016152	Hey. What do you want me to do with this?
0DI0016153	Almost forgot. Take off the hood.
0DI0016154	Well, kid, you're our last loose end.
0DI0016155	Shame you had to get caught in the middle of all this. Bet you don't even know why you're here.
0DI0016156	But hey, if it makes you feel any better, it's nothing personal.
0DI0016157	Just bad luck.
0DI0016158	Well we're not going back north. We're lucky to be alive.
0DI0016159	How the hell else are we supposed to get back, genius?
0DI0016160	We go east. Take the 95.
0DI0016161	East? Are you nuts? That'll take us days out of our way.
0DI0016162	Then you can just go back by yourself.
0DI0016163	Fine. Anything to get you two to shut up.
0DI0016164	Howdy, pardner! Fine evening, ain't it?
0DI0016165	Friend, you look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
0DI0016166	Howdy, pardner! Sure is one fine evening, ain't it?
0DI0016167	Gimme your hand, pardner. Let's get you out of there.
0DI0016168	You okay, pardner? You look like you could use a sarsaparilla.
0DI0016169	Really? That's so sweet!
0DI0016170	I'd love to go meet him. Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
0DI0016171	Well, you don't have to do that anymore! Sounds like I better hurry to him.
0DI0016172	Any chance the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
0DI0016173	Ooh, I've just got to meet him! Is there any way the Boomers would let me visit Nellis?
0DI0016174	[SUCCEEDED] Really? Thank you so much! I'll get going right away.
0DI0016175	[FAILED] Are you trying to get me killed? No way I'm going in there.
0DI0016176	Ok, let me know when you have an idea.
0DI0016177	This is so exciting! Let me know how it turns out.
0DI0016178	Just my luck. I finally find the perfect guy, and he's a Boomer.
0DI0016179	I was hoping you would. What's going on?
0DI0016180	I was hoping you would. What's going on? Have they agreed to my safety yet?
0DI0016181	Ok, talk to you soon.
0DI0016182	Well, with McLafferty dead, I guess my contract is done and I'm free to leave. I'm off to meet my admirer!
0DI0016183	There's one more thing. I have a work contract with the Crimson Caravan, and if I walk away, I lose the wages they owe me.
0DI0016184	Could you do just one more thing for me and talk to Alice McLafferty about it? I know if I do it, she'll just say no. I'd hate to lose the money.
0DI0016185	Okay, I'll be around.
0DI0016186	Gee, I dunno, maybe because I'm saddled with the worst damn unit in the NCR Army? Think that might have something to do with it?
0DI0016187	Please. Camp Golf is where they shuffle off anybody they don't want any more. Assignment here is a career ender.
0DI0016188	[SUCCEEDED] You really think so? Hell, I guess it's worth a shot.
0DI0016189	[FAILED] Yeah, right. You think Poindexter doesn't have a dozen of his crazy practical jokes all lined up if I try that?
0DI0016190	I like my underwear to *not* be full of radioactive itching powder, thanks.
0DI0016191	Yeah, well... I didn't want to get promoted out of the field. I didn't join up to drive a desk.
0DI0016192	Thanks. I only wish some of the soldiers under my command would share some of it.
0DI0016193	Yeah, well, somebody has to wrangle those washouts and losers. Somebody's got to turn them into a real fighting force.
0DI0016194	Mostly drill the troops, try to keep the discipline up and combat readiness high.
0DI0016195	It's not the easiest job in the world - soldiers without a mission get bored very easily.
0DI0016196	Still, with the Legion just across the river, we have to be ready.
0DI0016197	I'm glad that you made it out here. You're even more stunning up close than you were at a distance.
0DI0016198	Of course it would. I'll have you set up with some quarters with some of the other women.
0DI0016200	Hi there, it is great to meet you as well.
0DI0016201	And you're even more handsome up close. Do you think it'll be okay if I hang around here for a little while, so we can get to know each other better?
0DI0016202	Sorry to see you go so soon. Be sure to drink a Sunset Sarsaparilla for me!
0DI0016203	I watch all sorts of things with my binoculars. Who wants to know, and why?
0DI0016205	Alright then, goodbye.
0DI0016206	Nice-looking blonde boy? I always wondered if he was watching me back! What's he like?
0DI0016207	I've been in the Reaper's shadow for a long time now, and I thought he'd finally showed up to collect. He's just mocking me now.
0DI0016208	[SUCCEEDED] The truth of it is that I did cut out a raider's heart, but only took a bite to mess with his buddies.
0DI0016209	They had me surrounded and I went with the first thing that came to mind. Some ran, and the rest were startled just long enough.
0DI0016210	[FAILED] Nope. You'll just have to keep on wondering. Heh.
0DI0016211	What I could use is some scrap metal. It may not sound exciting, but around here we have to recycle every rivet and plate.
0DI0016212	The other thing, you being from the outside and all, well, I guess you'd call it a personal matter but, well... Eh, forget it!
0DI0016213	Like I said, I can never get enough scrap metal.
0DI0016214	Me? I work with Loyal, mostly electronics work and robotics. Keeping the old technologies alive, right?
0DI0016215	Thanks. That'd be great.
0DI0016216	[FAILED] I'll keep my spit to myself, thank you very much. That sounded stupid, didn't it? Damn it.
0DI0016217	[SUCCEEDED] That must be nice, sharing yourself like that, not being embarrassed or anything? Well, the thing is, there's this girl...
0DI0016218	I just need some parts from a pressure cooker to create a hermetic seal for the rebreather.
0DI0016219	Have you found a pressure cooker so I can finish the rebreather?
0DI0016221	There's an outpost near here. The signs say "Crimson Caravan?" It seems like they carry things to and fro for people out there?
0DI0016222	Well, every once in a while I watch the outpost through one of the spotters' binoculars. And sometimes there's this girl there, this special girl...
0DI0016223	And sometimes it's like she's watching me back with her binoculars! Except she's probably just watching Nellis. I haven't tried waving.
0DI0016224	All right. See you around, I hope.
0DI0016225	Then why did you make me spill my guts about it? You're an asshole!
0DI0016226	Loyal's a great man, but he's getting on in years, so a younger's got to learn everything he knows. That'd be me.
0DI0016227	The man knows how to fix and build just about everything that was ever made. It's not easy keeping up with him.
0DI0016228	If you help him recover the Lady I figure - oh, I figure it's been a nice day. Yeah, a real nice day.
0DI0016231	Oh come on, you've met Loyal by now. He's a mechanical genius.
0DI0016233	Oh, you can't miss her! She has short red hair and she's the most beautiful woman who ever lived!
0DI0016234	You'd really talk to her for me? What if she feels the same way? What if she comes here like you did?
0DI0016235	What if she gets blown up? What if she doesn't like me?
0DI0016236	Oh jeez, I better just let you handle it. I'm better with machines. They don't make my stomach queasy like this!
0DI0016241	That would be amazing. As in, I would thank you forever.
0DI0016242	Cool! How much can you spare?
0DI0016243	See you later!
0DI0016244	But I had you zeroed in the whole time! Nobody's that fast!
0DI0016245	Move a muscle now and I'll blow you to pieces!
0DI0016246	Are you even human? Some kind of mutant?
0DI0016248	I'm not telling you a thing, savage!
0DI0016250	Oh lordy lordy, you haven't heard of the Boomers? What rock have you been living under?
0DI0016251	They're a bunch of artillery-slingin' grenade lobbin' odd-jobs camping out in Nellis. Wander into their territory and you're as good as mincemeat!
0DI0016252	Suit yourself. Come back and see me when you get tired of picking shrapnel out of your backside.
0DI0016253	There is a way, and I'll tell you... for a little wager?
0DI0016255	Hey thanks!
0DI0016256	Thanks for dropping it off. Anything else?
0DI0016257	If that's so, how about you look into repairing the solar arrays on the roof of the generator building?
0DI0016258	Nothing too complicated about it, but it's a long ways to walk my old bones, and there's been that ant problem over near there.
0DI0016259	You can't miss the array. It's on top of the generator building smack dab in the middle of Nellis between the two runways.
0DI0016260	I started building a sonic emitter that might do the trick, but it's useless without knowing the exact frequency that would kill the ants.
0DI0016261	[SUCCEEDED] Hot damn, you're right! It's a matter of boosting across those thresholds, not exact amplitude. You're smarter than you look.
0DI0016262	Just so happens I was testing it at 24,000 hertz, so it should be good to go. Place it near their nest and cross your fingers.
0DI0016264	[FAILED] No, it doesn't have a dial! It has to be stabilized for an exact frequency or it could shake itself apart!
0DI0016265	A long time ago - long before the war that killed just about everything that ever lived - a bomber crashed not far from here.
0DI0016266	A bomber was a flying contraption that could drop explosives down on anything it flew over. But anyway, moving on...
0DI0016267	This bomber crashed down in Lake Mead, pretty damn near intact. When we got to Nellis, see, I found this article in a magazine all about it.
0DI0016268	There was another B-29 around here, part of a museum. Couldn't fly, but had a lot of spare parts, see? Get where I'm going?
0DI0016269	Since I was a young man, I've dreamed of raising that Lady from the lake and bringing her back to life. What do you say?
0DI0016270	It's at the bottom of Lake Mead. I'll mark its location on your Pip-boy map.
0DI0016271	Simple! Attach deployable ballast to the plane and float it on up!
0DI0016272	Here is a remote detonator. Once the ballast is attached to the plane just hit the detonator from the shore and let buoyancy handle the rest.
0DI0016273	I told you, at the bottom of Lake Mead! I'll make sure the location is displayed on your Pip-boy map.
0DI0016274	I wish you'd paid attention the first time! All you need to do is attach the deployable ballast to the plane.
0DI0016275	Some of my robots will carry a remote activation station out to the shore. Attach the ballast, hit a button, and they'll handle the rest.
0DI0016276	That's tremendous! I'll transmit instructions to the robots to start packing up the plane to bring it back to Nellis!
0DI0016277	I haven't heard anything. You must not be trying hard enough.
0DI0016278	I may have heard a compliment or two. Nothing special.
0DI0016279	I do believe you've convinced one or two of us that it's better you made it here than were blown to smithereens.
0DI0016280	More and more, I hear my people saying good things about you.
0DI0016281	I believe the time has come for you to show your value in full. The people have come to accept having you around.
0DI0016282	Find Loyal and ask him about our people's fondest dream. He will tell you what to do next.
0DI0016283	Each of the elders would appreciate assistance with various issues here in Nellis.
0DI0016284	Seek out Jack, Loyal, Raquel, and Argyll. They will guide you.
0DI0016285	Loyal still needs help getting the plane back to Nellis, and there may be others who still require assistance.
0DI0016286	What you have done for us is a miracle, child. You have fulfilled the only dreams we ever had outside our walls.
0DI0016287	You are a trusted friend of us all. If there is ever a way for us to help you, child, tell me and I will make it so.
0DI0016288	Extraordinary, child. Go tell Loyal, then return to me.
0DI0016290	Me? I'm Pete, Keeper of the Story.
0DI0016291	I know I seem kind of young. I was the apprentice Keeper of the Story until a couple months ago, but ol' Keeper Don, well...
0DI0016292	Whiskey and land mines don't go together. So it's up to me. I bet you want to know everything about us!
0DI0016293	Wonderful! I'm sure you've noticed the mural on the wall of this hut. Shall I tell you what it all means?
0DI0016295	Anything else you want to know?
0DI0016296	Other questions you want to ask?
0DI0016297	What else I can tell you?
0DI0016298	I wish everyone were just as interested in our story as you are! Maybe I should act out the battles or learn how to throw my voice...
0DI0016299	Oh, so many ways! Small ones to begin with, so we can get used to what it's like to have a sav- outsider around and about.
0DI0016300	Should that go well, it may be you can help in big ways, too. We'll have to see.
0DI0016301	Status............ operational.
0DI0016302	Loading memory banks........
0DI0016303	Current designation....... Koch.
0DI0016304	Current mission.........
0DI0016305	Warning! Primary defensive objective, designation Keely, taken by unknown hostile entities. Initiating full countermeasures.
0DI0016306	Well, I know Major Dhatri is offering bounties on some of the Fiends - that's the gang that controls the southeast part of the city.
0DI0016307	You can find the major at the camp just outside of the old airport.
0DI0016308	Not sure how to help you with that one. Major Dhatri was offering bounties on some of the Fiends, but I hear someone took care of that recently.
0DI0016309	Mahsohfabish.
0DI0016310	Ha ha ha! I wash ma bown. Wesibe.
0DI0016311	I have bo go. Fiebs aroub. Goobye!
0DI0016312	Mmm-hm. Goobye!
0DI0016313	Ba peasure is ah mah. Goobye!
0DI0016314	Mmm-hm. [Points to stump of tongue in his mouth.]
0DI0016315	I have bo go bow. Goobye!
0DI0016316	Goobye!
0DI0016318	Okay! Sold!
0DI0016319	That may be the worst-kept secret on the base. I'd be more surprised if you had proof he wasn't involved in criminal activity.
0DI0016320	But if you have proof, you're the envy of every MP stationed here. What'd you find?
0DI0016321	All right. Thanks for telling me. I'm going to have him rounded up.
0DI0016322	Pretty impressive work there. Wish I could keep you around.
0DI0016323	But for helping me nail this guy, I think you should have a little keepsake.
0DI0016324	Here. It's not contraband, but I confiscated it from Contreras last week because he was being smarmy and I was sick of his bullshit.
0DI0016325	Man, that guy's got water on the brain. Knows more about water pipes than any man should.
0DI0016326	If he says we're losing water, I think the colonel would listen to that. I'll talk to him about it.
0DI0016327	Anderson. I've heard of him, if it's the same guy. Water nerd from the Followers of the Apocalypse. Used to handle some of the operations for OSI.
0DI0016328	I don't know what to think about the Followers. The things they do... hard to say if they're helping or hurting sometimes. Especially in Freeside.
0DI0016329	I'll have to send some people out there to make sure we don't lose any more water. That stuff's like gold out here.
0DI0016330	But you. I owe you for this. You saved me a lot of work. And I'm sure Corporal White's family will be grateful to at least get some closure.
0DI0016331	The MPs keep a bunch of junk around that's confiscated off of people who decide to screw with us.
0DI0016332	I haven't really sorted through it, but go ahead and see if there's anything you can use in there.
0DI0016333	We keep it in a trunk across the hall, by the prison cells.
0DI0016334	Shit. That's why you don't go wandering off looking for some call girl on the Strip without telling somebody first.
0DI0016335	Anderson. Is that Followers of the Apocalypse Anderson?
0DI0016336	Okay, well let me know if you find out anything.
0DI0016337	Little bastard. I'm sure some of those find their way into the hands of our enemies, too.
0DI0016338	Well, that's a shame about Corporal White. He knew better than that.
0DI0016339	He's trafficking chems? I don't know how he thought he could get away with that.
0DI0016340	Aw, tear my heart out, why don't you? Well, maybe you can find a way to play with his mind - get him out of his comfort zone.
0DI0016341	People lose their heads and say things they regret. Especially if they underestimate you. This dickhead would underestimate a nuclear missile.
0DI0016342	Plenty of ways to skin a cat, as they say. Hey, what if we skinned him? Bet he wouldn't be so smug then.
0DI0016343	Get your ass up.
0DI0016344	What the-
0DI0016345	Move it!  Move it!  Move it!  Get those legs up you sorry bastards!
0DI0016346	Move, you lazy bastards! Do you think the legion is going to slow down for your sorry asses?!
0DI0016347	Quit dragging your feet, recruit. Pick it up!
0DI0016348	You run like a feeble old man, private!
0DI0016349	You can rest when you're dead, private! Move your ass!
0DI0016350	How the hell did you make it through boot camp, private?!
0DI0016351	You think it burns now, wait until I sit on your shoulders!
0DI0016352	The road to hell is paved by the bleached bones of privates that fell by the wayside, boys.
0DI0016353	Pathetic! My 80-year-old grandmother runs faster than you!
0DI0016354	Good thing you're not a ranger. When a ranger quits he's dead!
0DI0016355	Sound off like you've got a pair!
0DI0016356	That's better, but you're still not winning the battle, boys.
0DI0016357	Christina hired you, huh? Well, if you're going to go up there, there's a couple things you should know.
0DI0016358	Esteban's body is in the middle of those buildings up the hill there. Look carefully, and you can see the Fiends patrolling the rooftops.
0DI0016359	But they laid traps, too. There's mines all over. So for godsakes, watch your feet. Get him back here. We'll get him home.
0DI0016360	I wouldn't do that if I were you. Those buildings up ahead are crawling with psychos. This is as far up as we've been able to safely set up a position.
0DI0016361	You go any further, we can't protect you, understand?
0DI0016362	All right, smartass, I get it. You don't answer to us. But get this straight. You will get eaten alive if you go up that way.
0DI0016363	And that's not a figure of speech, either. Bunch of sick, messed-up junkies control the road up there. Got a thing for desecrating corpses.
0DI0016364	You've been warned.
0DI0016365	Hey, it's your life.
0DI0016366	Least we can do. Wish we could help more.
0DI0016367	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, buddy...
0DI0016368	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, lady...
0DI0016369	Ah, shit. Well since you seem to have things figured out, the name's Keller. I'm an NCR Ranger investigating chem runners.
0DI0016370	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
0DI0016371	What's your business with him?
0DI0016372	Well what the hell are you doing here? Get your ass out and find that metal.  Don't come back until the job is done!
0DI0016373	A few things here and there, but a lot of the data has been corrupted, and all of the live samples have been contaminated by the spore plants.
0DI0016374	One interesting thing I found is that one of the chemicals secreted by the spore plants serves as a mild stimulant when ingested by humans.
0DI0016375	As far as I can tell, it has no side effects or addictive properties, aside from the inherent psychological ones, of course.
0DI0016376	Now that I think of it, there was a Cpl. Farber back at McCarran who'd probably be interested in it. There's a sample of it around here somewhere.
0DI0016377	Those files need to be erased. Hold out your arm and I'll have it done in a flash.
0DI0016378	To someone, I'm sure. But they constitute a threat to life as we know it. Now give me your arm already.
0DI0016379	A pleasure to meet you, sir. What may I do for you?
0DI0016380	A pleasure to meet you, madam. What may I do for you?
0DI0016381	My, how rude. If you must know, I am here to assist my master Keely in her research.
0DI0016382	Why yes, the master was here some time ago. Do you have business with her?
0DI0016383	Very well, I'll get back to computing these protein sequences, then. Farewell.
0DI0016384	I couldn't say, exactly. She went down to the lower levels some time ago and hasn't been back since. Do you suppose something has happened to her?
0DI0016385	Oh, thank you! The master can really be a bother sometimes, but she has a good heart.
0DI0016386	Now, I must get back to computing protein sequences. Please tell the master to hurry back if you see her.
0DI0016387	I have been given explicit instructions to stay here until the master returns.
0DI0016388	Very little, I'm afraid. I've been stuck here calculating protein sequences for most of our sojourn here thus far.
0DI0016389	Master Keely has done most of the exploring. She might be able to tell you more.
0DI0016390	I am assisting my master Keely with her research. We have been tasked with extracting as much of the research that was performed here as possible.
0DI0016391	Daniel. Probably find him back in the Residential Wing somewhere.
0DI0016392	Yeah, it is yours if you help us out of here.
0DI0016393	[FAILED] Help us first, then we'll give you the password, and don't think about killing me. Its all in my head.
0DI0016394	[SUCCEEDED] Fine, it isn't like it is doing me any good in here. You'd better come back though.
0DI0016395	Okay, but be quiet. I don't want the Fiends to hear us.
0DI0016396	I don't know. Carter told me about some password he hacked out of a computer. I could give it to you, if you help us out.
0DI0016397	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah, I get insomnia pretty bad myself, out here. I think it's the heat. Weird how sometimes it's cooler out here than it is inside.
0DI0016398	Well, I hope you manage to get some rest. Take it easy.
0DI0016399	Be straight with me. If you're onto something, I want to know about it.
0DI0016400	If you were to get caught or killed, we'd lose everything you've learned about this case.
0DI0016401	[FAILED] Lost, huh? If you say so. If you head over to the front terminal building you should be able to get in through the garage doors in back.
0DI0016402	I'm headed that way, myself, actually, so you can just follow me if you need to.
0DI0016403	See those menacing looking troopers with guns standing on the walls up there? That's Bravo Company. My company.
0DI0016404	Since Oliver stuck me in a desk job, I hardly ever get to see them during the day. So sometimes I like to check up on them when they have night duty.
0DI0016405	But you still haven't answered my question.
0DI0016406	Damn, are you serious? He was one tough son of a bitch.
0DI0016407	Good, I hated that fucker.
0DI0016408	Yeah. Can't say I'm sad to hear he's gone. I should take over.
0DI0016409	Must have been some NCR. I know they've been gunning for him.
0DI0016410	Like anyone in their right mind would follow you.
0DI0016411	Yeah, you do that.
0DI0016412	So long as we understand each other.
0DI0016413	I'll take a look, just to see what sort of shit they were into.
0DI0016415	I've seen enough. You did everyone a service. Take these. Might help if you get a jam.
0DI0016416	That's right, we will. Anything I can help you with?
0DI0016417	All right, you can stop for a sec.
0DI0016418	Damn right they were. And they were good, too. 'Til I popped a couple shells in their assholes. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
0DI0016419	See, somebody gives me a job, I do it. Maybe I complain a little, here and there, but my shit gets done.
0DI0016420	'Course you didn't. 'Cause they crossed paths with Little Buster. Bam! Dead, finished, over.
0DI0016421	Oh, yeah. A lot. Like, before I was a bounty hunter, I worked as a caravan guard. You'd think that was a cakewalk, right? Wrong.
0DI0016422	Crazy bastards expected me to wake up at dawn. Forget it. That's about two hours after this guy hits the sack.
0DI0016423	And I need at least ten, twelve hours of sleep to do my job. Price of excellence.
0DI0016424	Hey, yeah. Next time you see me, maybe I'll be rolling in a shitload of caps, right?
0DI0016425	[SUCCEEDED] It's a Khan name. You know... the "Great Khans." That's what my parents were.
0DI0016426	I figured I grew up around the bastards... they owed me a name, after all they put me through.
0DI0016427	They're dead. Got themselves killed at Bitter Springs. Served them right, if you ask me.
0DI0016428	They're scum. Lazy, trumped-up Raiders. Most of the time, they're drunk or high, and when they're not shooting chems, they're selling them.
0DI0016429	Used to have a settlement up at Bitter Springs, 'til they pissed off NCR and got slaughtered for their trouble.
0DI0016430	Lot of us got killed at Bitter Springs. Lot of them, I mean. My parents died, too.
0DI0016431	It was massacre. That's what a lot of NCR folk will tell you. Most of them feel plenty bad about what happened.
0DI0016432	But I was there. Saw it myself. I don't care what anybody says. The Khans asked for Bitter Springs. They wouldn't leave the NCR be.
0DI0016433	My damn parents, too. They were just as bad as the rest.
0DI0016434	Yeah. That's probably best.
0DI0016435	You're sorry? Well, that makes one of us. Bitter Springs was the best thing that ever happened to me.
0DI0016436	Best thing that ever happened to my parents, too. They were as bad as the rest. Worse, maybe.
0DI0016437	Don't I? Mister, you never met my parents.
0DI0016438	Don't I? Beg pardon, ma'am, but you never met my parents.
0DI0016439	My dad, he got himself fucked up, every chance he got. Always started with folk for no reason.
0DI0016440	Hell, he was the one who taught me to shoot. You know how? By taking potshots at NCR. And not just soldiers. Civilians, too. Even kids.
0DI0016441	Then he'd get high with his buddies and swap tales about the folk they killed. Bunch of animals.
0DI0016442	And my mom... couple times she tried to sell me to some waster, just to score some Jet. Even the other Khans said she was useless.
0DI0016443	Only reason they kept her around was because she was a... how'd my dad say it... "a smokin' piece of ass."
0DI0016444	In the Khans, you're not fully grown 'til you've taken a beat-down. Everybody gathers round and hits you until you're damn near dead.
0DI0016445	After that - if you haven't begged for mercy - you get to choose a new name. One you'll use for the rest of your life.
0DI0016446	When NCR slaughtered the Khans at Bitter Springs, I hadn't got my beat-down yet. I was still too young.
0DI0016447	Way I see it, Bitter Springs was my beat-down. So afterward... I gave myself a name. It's all I've got from the Khans, and it's all I ever want.
0DI0016448	Guess I could tell a pretty good story, if I had a mind. But the truth is, I don't know. Just got lucky.
0DI0016449	They brought me to Dhatri after the battle. He was just a Captain, back then. Guess he saw something in me... knew I didn't belong with the Khans.
0DI0016450	Maybe he felt bad, too. About how his men killed my folks. I told him he did me a service, but he didn't believe me. Still doesn't.
0DI0016451	He's a good man, Dhatri. Doesn't act like it sometimes, I know. But he didn't have to take me in.
0DI0016452	It's like I tell Major Dhatri. Best not look under a rock, if you don't really want to know what's there.
0DI0016453	Could be that NCR found some blood on me, and none of it mine. Could be that a few of those Khans didn't die from NCR bullets.
0DI0016454	I had scores of my own to settle... deeper ones than NCR ever had. Don't bother asking who they were with.
0DI0016455	[FAILED] No. What's it matter to you? Why's everybody care so much about other people's business?
0DI0016456	Just leave it lie. And leave me be.
0DI0016457	Okay. I will. Guess that's something I'd rather not talk about, that's all.
0DI0016458	All right. Goodbye.
0DI0016459	Really? I never noticed that. I'm just following orders here, moving supplies as needed.
0DI0016460	Good. Does that mean you have those supplies?
0DI0016461	Whoa there, kiddo. No need to blow things out of proportion. I'm just selling certain ingredients on the side, not chems.
0DI0016462	Besides, it's not like drugs are a big deal. Alcohol is just as bad yet it is perfectly legal in the NCR. I'm just a businessman doing business.
0DI0016463	You're one pushy son of a bitch, I'll give you that. Alright, here are some caps to keep your mouth shut.
0DI0016464	There is a lot of money to be made, and I'm not afraid to share it with reliable folks. Just keep the busters out of this and we're good.
0DI0016465	So you've got the package then? I need to get that sorted and then sent off in a few days.
0DI0016466	Now see, that's just downright unfriendly of you. I can't just let you go shooting your mouth off to Boyd now can I?
0DI0016467	Fine, piss off then. I thought we had a good thing going here, but it looks like you're just a goody-goody.
0DI0016468	Your talking slows my healing process. Be snappy about it.
0DI0016469	Do you ever quit? Go on.
0DI0016470	He's stationed just inside the south wall of the base. Should be on patrol, if he isn't screwing around.
0DI0016471	It's in the main concourse. That's the building just across the skybridge. There's a barracks area that'll be behind you on the left when you enter.
0DI0016472	His stuff will be at the foot of one of the beds.
0DI0016473	You're getting too close, shamus!
0DI0016474	This is where your trail runs cold.
0DI0016475	The tram is about to depart. Please keep clear of the doors, and restrain any young children.
0DI0016476	Heh. My reputation precedes me, I see. Yeah I pulled a few pranks in my time.
0DI0016477	Aw, usual stuff. Brought a brahmin upstairs in the terminal once. They can go upstairs but not down. Two heads and both of 'em dumb as stumps.
0DI0016478	That got me some detention time, but it was worth it 'cause they couldn't get the brahmin back down, so it visited me a few times in my cell.
0DI0016479	Dropped some firecrackers in the toilets too. That was the real bad one for me.
0DI0016480	Turns out there's no way to replace the toilets now. Toilet company blew up in the War. I think they'd just have shot me if they weren't shorthanded.
0DI0016481	No kidding! What'd you cook up?
0DI0016482	Man, I can't wait to see the look on his face!
0DI0016483	What? Like hell you are.
0DI0016484	Really? That's great. I was getting so sick of this.
0DI0016485	What- What are you doing?
0DI0016486	Aww.
0DI0016487	Sure thing. Careful, though. I'll talk your ear off.
0DI0016488	Get your rifles and move out, First Recon. We've got a Fiend to kill.
0DI0016489	Just needed to make the situation clear is all. How can I help you?
0DI0016490	I would be happy to, should you require it. You seem to be in fine health now.
0DI0016491	I would be happy to. What I can do isn't much, but I give it freely.
0DI0016492	I'm afraid I have exhausted my supplies. If you come back in a day or two, I may be able to do more for you.
0DI0016493	I only do what I can to help.
0DI0016494	Go ahead, mock me. Nothing you say can be worse than my own shame.
0DI0016495	You'd do that for a complete stranger? Thank you, friend. The army says they don't have the available manpower - as if this city is more important.
0DI0016496	From what I've gathered from NCR rangers, they were most likely taken to Cottonwood Cove. You might start there.
0DI0016497	I... God help me, I ran! I abandoned my family to those butchers. Not a day goes by I don't hate myself for that.
0DI0016498	Oh God no! I haven't been the best father, but I didn't deserve this!
0DI0016499	They are? Oh my God, thank you! Thank you so much!
0DI0016500	But wait, where are they?
0DI0016501	Oh, thank you! Thank you!
0DI0016502	But wait, what about my wife?
0DI0016503	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving her, at least.
0DI0016504	But wait, where is she?
0DI0016505	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving the rest, at least.
0DI0016507	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving one of them, at least.
0DI0016508	But wait, where is my child?
0DI0016509	Oh. Oh, I see. Well... thank you for saving my children, at least.
0DI0016510	Where did they go?
0DI0016511	Please, hurry!
0DI0016512	Got a good memory for faces. Landmarks and such, too. Comes with practice, that's all. And a lot of scoutin' from place to place.
0DI0016513	I reckon I've walked every inch of ground between Shady Sands and the Colorado... or close enough to make a man's feet plenty sore.
0DI0016514	You're a fine-looking woman, no doubt about that. But I'm looking a little deeper than the skin, if you take my meaning.
0DI0016515	Not so long ago, I spent more than my share of time lookin' for memorable folk like yourself. Did a lot of scoutin' around these parts.
0DI0016516	Mighty pleased to meet you. Maybe I'll see you again, before we move out.
0DI0016517	Always a pleasure. You keep yourself safe.
0DI0016518	Well... that wasn't really a matter of choice. Got myself caught by Legionnaires, up near Malpais.
0DI0016519	They had themselves some fun with me... mangled my hands and feet pretty good.
0DI0016520	Wasn't much good with a pistol after that. Wasn't gonna be trekking across the waste on any more long scouts, either.
0DI0016521	Caesar's boys figured I wasn't going anywhere, after what they done to me. So they didn't bother tying me up.
0DI0016522	I crawled out of there on my elbows and knees. Must have looked a sight. Then I rolled down an embankment into the Colorado.
0DI0016523	Guess I had a mind to drown, rather than give Caesar's boys the satisfaction of killing me.
0DI0016524	But a couple Rangers happened to be watching from across the river. They jumped on in and pulled me out of there. Lucky break, they said.
0DI0016525	No trouble at all. Might be nothing. Couple frisky young folks looking for a quiet place to snuggle up.
0DI0016526	Then again... that light is mighty consistent. Always there at 1 AM. Might be worth a look.
0DI0016527	Huh. Not good. Price works alone. Chat him up and see what's going on.
0DI0016528	Don't give him any details and do not give him the package. There's a chance he actually knows Price, but I doubt it.
0DI0016529	Well, it sounds like you screwed the pooch. Give me the package back.
0DI0016530	Price works alone. If someone has replaced him, it's either some scumbag trying to hijack goods from his suppliers, or worse...
0DI0016531	It could be someone more dangerous. You need to kill him, whoever he is.
0DI0016532	Good to hear.
0DI0016533	Well, I'd say you're officially invited to the big kids' table now. My stash is your stash.
0DI0016534	Oh, and I think you might get more use out of this rifle than I ever will. Enjoy.
0DI0016535	Get it done.
0DI0016536	Well in that case, leave me to my work.
0DI0016537	In the area where the gas is active, any kind of fire or explosion should do the trick. Hell, even lasers would do the job.
0DI0016538	If you don't have anything like that, I've got some grenades in my bag in the corner that you can use.
0DI0016539	Oh yes, I imagine there'll be quite an explosion when the gas gets set off. Fire will probably expand throughout the entire level in mere moments.
0DI0016540	That does pose a problem, doesn't it?
0DI0016541	If you could seal yourself inside a room before the explosion went off, you might be protected from the blast.
0DI0016542	Then again, the flames will probably blow into the rooms down there. Maybe if there were a room that was reinforced...
0DI0016543	Well, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
0DI0016544	Yes, there'll be an explosion when the gas is ignited. But I'm sure you'll be fine. Now leave me to my work.
0DI0016545	What? Do I have to figure everything out for you? Fine, let me think for a second.
0DI0016546	It would be pretty funny, wouldn't it? Oh, don't look at me that way. I'm sure you'll be fine.
0DI0016547	From what I've been able to determine, the scientists here managed to breed them by combining traits from two distinct plant species.
0DI0016548	The resulting hybrid proved more adaptable than expected, however, and soon became a threat to humans.
0DI0016549	It's sad, really. All those wonderful minds, undone by their own irresponsibility.
0DI0016550	That's a very good question! Actually, I didn't come up with it. The systems were already set up to pump the gas when I first arrived here.
0DI0016551	I believe the scientists were in the process of attempting to ignite the gas just as we're about to do. And by we, I mean you, of course.
0DI0016552	Something prevented them from igniting the gas, obviously. I suppose it's possible that the gas triggered some kind of defensive reaction.
0DI0016553	Hordes of previously slumbering creatures may have awoken and entered a killing frenzy, ripping the hapless scientists into quivering, bloody chunks.
0DI0016554	You'll have to let me know when you get back from going downstairs.
0DI0016555	The mantises and spore plants virtually ignored me for most of the time that I've been here.
0DI0016556	It was only once I began to investigate the fifth level that my presence began to agitate them. I guess I was a little too close to home for them.
0DI0016557	A few days ago, I was attacked by a large number of mantises and was knocked unconscious. When I woke up, I was in that cave.
0DI0016558	The mantises seem to feed some of their prey to the plants. Fortunately for me, it appears the plants are disinclined to eat ghoul meat.
0DI0016559	Are you kidding me? This place is under quarantine! We can't let a single spore get out of this place if we can help it.
0DI0016560	What do you mean?
0DI0016561	Ah, I should have known. Well, in that case...
0DI0016563	We needed some place to put down some roots. I was having trouble keeping my people out of  Westside.
0DI0016564	Go on through, soldier.
0DI0016565	Go right ahead, trooper.
0DI0016566	Hold it. NCR only beyond this point. Keep your distance or I will fire.
0DI0016567	Sorry. No civilians on the monorail. Any closer and I am authorized to use deadly force.
0DI0016568	You had your chance.
0DI0016569	That's it.
0DI0016570	Oh, no you don't. Time to teach you to mess with our people!
0DI0016571	We saw you follow the kid in there. Figured we'd teach you a lesson.
0DI0016572	[FAILED] Right. No big deal. We're going to beat the hell out of you now, but don't worry - we don't think it's a big deal, either.
0DI0016573	It'll be hard for you to do anything once we break your arms and legs.
0DI0016574	[SUCCEEDED] No, no, it's all right. We're just looking out for our own, you understand. We're, uh, sorry to bother you.
0DI0016575	Where'd you get it from?
0DI0016576	Fuck! I did too. I'm not doing well.
0DI0016577	I don't know. If you can't trust dealers, who can you trust?
0DI0016578	I got it from my buddy. I think he made it himself.
0DI0016579	All I have is Psycho.
0DI0016580	Nope, not for you at least.
0DI0016581	Lying bitch.
0DI0016582	Fuck, I need a fix.
0DI0016583	I got some to last me a little bit I think.
0DI0016584	Yeah, me too. Gonna have to go hit the boss for a fix soon.
0DI0016585	I gave my last hit of Psycho to this hot little chick last night.
0DI0016586	Motor-Runner told me he was going to pick up some more when the Khans come back through.
0DI0016587	I can't help you.
0DI0016589	Damn, I gotta find some shit.
0DI0016590	Sorry. I'm moving.
0DI0016591	I didn't say anything.
0DI0016592	Yeah, you don't look too good.
0DI0016593	Me too. I think I need a fix.
0DI0016594	I don't feel right. My head is fucking with me.
0DI0016595	Shit. I gotta go find something to take the edge off.
0DI0016596	I'm not looking at anything.
0DI0016597	I'm looking at you.
0DI0016598	Get the fuck out of may way.
0DI0016599	Well keep moving.
0DI0016600	I try to keep my people out of Westside. Apart from trying to stay on good terms with the Khans, who do business there. There's Mean Son of A Bitch.
0DI0016601	That fucking mutant is more trouble to kill than to avoid. Having someplace for my people to sleep reduces the chances of drifting into Westside.
0DI0016602	Unbelievable. That man has given us so much grief since we set up here. This may be a major turning point for us.
0DI0016603	I can't tell you how many times we thought we'd taken him out, only to have him show up again later, taking more heads off of fallen troopers.
0DI0016604	This is for the bounty. And this is from a pool me and a lot of the soldiers around the base had going. You may not be NCR, but hey, it's only fair.
0DI0016605	I'd hoped he'd be able to slip past their security and be out before anyone knew he was there.
0DI0016606	But I underestimated the Fiends. Should've known better, given the hell they've caused for us.
0DI0016607	Regardless, what you did for Anders isn't something he or any of us around here take lightly. We're all glad to have him back. Thank you.
0DI0016608	That's probably true, but I wonder if I should've taken a different strategy entirely.
0DI0016609	Although my options were certainly limited with most of our forces tied up garrisoning this place.
0DI0016613	I surely am. Well, sort of. I came out from Utah about six months back, saw a need for my help here.
0DI0016614	The Followers weren't too happy about that, of course. They haven't been too fond of the NCR for a while, but I go where I'm needed.
0DI0016615	I give what aid and comfort I can. I have medical knowledge thanks to my time with the Followers.
0DI0016616	Well, that's an interesting question. Among the Church, I'm called Elder Gunnarsson. The Followers call me "Doc."
0DI0016617	You can call me Bert, though.
0DI0016618	I never was able to reach him. He has allowed drugs and hatred to consume him. He runs with the Fiends north of here, now. They call him Driver Nephi.
0DI0016619	Poor lost souls, most of them. They thought to come to New Vegas and find their fortunes on its shining Strip.
0DI0016620	But the journey is often long, and the price to enter the city is steep. Those who could not pay ended up here, hoping to earn the caps they need.
0DI0016621	Some find honest labor, but more fritter away what little they've saved on crooked gambling and cheap liquor. Still, I minister to them as I can.
0DI0016622	Following a lost cause, I'm afraid. My old friend Nephi fell in with a bad crowd.
0DI0016623	Drug runners, raiders, probably worse things it's better not to dwell on. When his gang headed west, I followed.
0DI0016624	I thought perhaps I could turn him back to the Church.
0DI0016625	Well... that was a bit messier than I would have liked. Was there anything else?
0DI0016627	Hey, you asked, I answered.
0DI0016628	Yeah. So what? I could take a bullet in the skull tomorrow. I haven't got time to take it slow and subtle.
0DI0016629	I see somebody I like, I go ahead and tell her. That's about the only thing that the horn-dog males get right.
0DI0016630	Damn shame. I've got some leave time coming to me, and I booked a suite at the Gomorrah. The two of us, rolled up in those silk sheets...
0DI0016631	Trust me, the alpha males are overrated. Plenty of them in the army. All they're good for is killing each other and taking smelly shits.
0DI0016632	I'm just saying... never know what you might like, if you don't give it a try.
0DI0016633	We're here. First Recon, get into your positions and wait for the target.
0DI0016634	Old Maude... Sometimes you can afford the creamy veal of a Sweetie, and sometimes you got just enough caps to buy a tough piece of jerky.
0DI0016635	Keith's a two-bit hustler, he runs a gambling operation out of his shack. Ask me, he wins way too often to be playing fair.
0DI0016636	I suspect he's running drugs, too, I just can't prove it. Maybe you can find something - talk to him, poke around his shack, something.
0DI0016637	Mind cleaning up our mess, Corporal?
0DI0016638	Not at all, ma'am. I'll get right on it.
0DI0016639	Can't stop talking about that, can they? The Lieutenant actually sat me down and asked if I wanted to talk to a doctor.
0DI0016640	Wouldn't believe me when I told him to forget it. I mean, if that slab of meat had gotten me pregnant, then maybe I'd want to talk to a doctor.
0DI0016641	What kind of dumbass question is that? Of course I want payback.
0DI0016642	If I get hold of that fat pile of shit, I'll shove my rifle up his ass a couple hundred times, see how he likes it.
0DI0016643	Then I'll fire some shells up in there, make sure he doesn't ever forget me. He left me a bunch of souvenirs - I figure I can do the same.
0DI0016644	So yeah. Payback would be good. Doesn't mean I need to have myself a big long cry.
0DI0016645	Yeah. Typical. Thing is, that fat pile of shit sneaked up on us from behind and kicked little 10 in the back of the head.
0DI0016646	Knocked him out cold. Probably meant to kill him. The kid had no idea what happened until he woke up in the infirmary.
0DI0016647	10 wants to blame himself, I can't stop him. He'll work it through on his own.
0DI0016648	Never said it was. But I don't need to talk to any doctors. Especially not the pricks around here.
0DI0016649	If I was smart, I'd fake a big old breakdown. That'd make everybody happy, and I'd get some leave time.
0DI0016650	But then I'd be doing what everybody wants, and being the asshole that I am, it just wouldn't feel right. Got to have some integrity.
0DI0016651	What gave me away? The big gun, the shades, or the attitude?
0DI0016652	Don't take this the wrong way, but girl, it's a damn good thing you're hot. That sarcasm blew right over your head, didn't it?
0DI0016653	Yup. Lot of people make that connection. Big gun. Sniper. Some people don't even need to ask.
0DI0016654	They don't. Only the good ones do.
0DI0016655	My partner's got some potential, so I let him wear those goofy glasses. I tell him they're his training shades. He totally buys it.
0DI0016656	Truth is, his eyes just suck.
0DI0016657	The little guy. 10 of Spades. I like him because he listens. Doesn't shut up the rest of the time, but when I talk, he listens.
0DI0016658	Also, he doesn't pull any stupid come-ons, like practically every other horn-dog alpha male on this base. Might be he's just scared of me, though.
0DI0016659	Yeah. We spot for each other, watch each other's backs. Usually works pretty well, unless you get paired up with an asshole.
0DI0016660	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. Now if they paired me up with somebody who looks like you...
0DI0016661	Lot of downtime in the army. Nobody around but you and your partner. Plenty of time for... whatever we want.
0DI0016663	Thing is, there's a lot of assholes in the army. I keep hoping they'll pair me up with some hot blonde, like you see on those old pinups.
0DI0016664	Shit, I don't even care if she can shoot straight. Can't have everything.
0DI0016665	Hah! See, we've even got the same sense of humor. I like a girl who doesn't piss me off after sex.
0DI0016666	Hah! You're not as dumb as I thought you'd be. We got the same sense of humor.
0DI0016667	Probably better to walk away while I still like you, though. All kinds of things piss me off. Like just about anything that anybody says.
0DI0016668	Yeah, right. You're sniffing up the wrong skirt. Try me again when you're tall, blonde, and female.
0DI0016669	Thanks for your help with Usanagi and all, but I still like them tall, blonde, and female.
0DI0016670	Not unless you count the Fiends as serious. Gorobets keeps us inside the fence, most of the time. Doesn't matter to me, I just shoot bad guys.
0DI0016671	Sooner or later, they'll move us out to the Dam, though. That's when the shit gets nasty.
0DI0016672	Legion fights to win. And they're smart... hell of a lot smarter than these crazy Fiends. But I don't feel bad about shooting Legion boys.
0DI0016673	Fiends, on the other hand... sometimes I get some pangs of conscience. Not often. But sometimes.
0DI0016674	Some cute little junkie bitch, so fucked-up she doesn't even know that she's the bad guy. And I've got to headshot her. Makes me think.
0DI0016675	Might just be sex, though. I see some cute little number, and I'd rather get in her pants. So maybe I'm a stone-cold bitch, after all.
0DI0016676	Yeah, doesn't sound like me at all, right? But it happens.
0DI0016677	Yeah, well, we can't all be heartless shitheads, right?
0DI0016678	Yeah... I always scare off the hot ones...
0DI0016679	You don't have to leave, girl. Better yet, come and find me when I'm off duty.
0DI0016680	Yeah. Try not to get killed.
0DI0016681	Marked cards, huh? I suppose it's obvious, really. Here, you've earned this.
0DI0016682	I'm going to go take Keith into custody. If you're interested in a little extra pay, I wouldn't mind the back-up.
0DI0016683	Son of a bitch - I knew he was involved with drugs. Thanks - this gives me the evidence I need. Here - you've earned this.
0DI0016685	Drugs and crooked gambling? Can't say I'm surprised. Here, you've earned this.
0DI0016687	Glad to have you. Let's go. Just stick close and follow my lead. Keith's a cowardly son of a bitch, but he might try something if he's desperate.
0DI0016688	Fair enough - you've done a lot already. I appreciate it.
0DI0016689	[FAILED] I guess Lady Luck just smiles on me, that's all. Nothing special about it.
0DI0016690	[SUCCEEDED] You know how they say you make your own luck? Let's just say I make mine with a little extra ink on the cards.
0DI0016691	[FAILED] What? Are you some kind of idiot? Why, uh... why would I know that?
0DI0016692	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, I getcha. Lookin for a slightly more chemical thrill?
0DI0016693	Okay, I tell you what - I happen to keep some Jet around for emergencies. 35 caps and it's yours.
0DI0016695	Hey, it's not like I use them all the time. Mostly I keep them in my shack until I see a really fat score roll into town.
0DI0016696	And here you go. Enjoy, my friend.
0DI0016697	Well, then, why are you wasting my time?
0DI0016699	Course I do. You want to meet them? Heh. Even money whether Violet's dogs rip you apart or Nephi caves in your skull with that iron of his.
0DI0016701	And after they're done... I get to play with whatever's left.
0DI0016702	That's right. Brahmin, mole rats, lizards... the occasional traveler lost in the wrong part of town.
0DI0016703	Not Queenie though. I'd never cook my Queenie.
0DI0016704	Who am I? I'm the scariest motherfucker you're ever gonna meet. I'm Cook-Cook, bitch, better not forget it.
0DI0016705	If I had to guess, it's because I cook shit for the rest of the gang. I'm a good cook. Maybe I'll make you dinner sometime.
0DI0016706	NCR? Bunch of soft little bitches, they've got no stomach for life in the wasteland. Got some choice strange, though, I'll give 'em that.
0DI0016707	Heh heh... yeah. I'll give 'em *that* all right.
0DI0016708	*That's* Queenie. She's the prettiest Brahmin in the Wastelands. Aren't you, Queenie, yes you are, who's a good girl?
0DI0016710	Goddamn right.
0DI0016711	You are! Yes that's right!
0DI0016712	Fuckin' A right it is. This baby's my life, my love, my strong right arm. Killed a lot of fuckers with this hunk of iron, yessir.
0DI0016713	I *could.* I'm not terribly inclined to, though. If you go talk to them, they might kill you and rob me of the fun.
0DI0016714	Really? Listen... you don't want to mess with Cook-Cook. And you *really* don't want to let him get you alone. Trust me.
0DI0016715	Name's Nephi, friend. Driver Nephi. Pleasure to meet you.
0DI0016716	Huh? Oh, lots. More than any other Fiend - hundreds, maybe. Wham, bam, "oh god, my brains, you hit me in my brains." Easy as that.
0DI0016717	Bert? That scaly, corpse-looking fuck, you tell him I'm never going back to his little cult!
0DI0016718	No, you fucking dolt! Why the hell would it be a pleasure?!
0DI0016719	And get the fuck away from me before I cave in your skull!
0DI0016720	Me and Dermot work salvage around New Vegas.
0DI0016721	You got his book? Dermot, this bastard got your book! He got your book!
0DI0016722	You got his book? Dermot, this bitch got your book! She got your book!
0DI0016723	What you doing stealing my stuff? That ain't even mine. I mean it's mine, but it's private. Give it back!
0DI0016724	Hell, don't give it back! I don't care. Just found it when we was working salvage and thought I'd save it to give to some kid if one came by.
0DI0016725	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at her.
0DI0016726	We have a Khan coming through to see the boss. Don't shoot at him.
0DI0016727	Then there's no problem here - and no need to get nasty. How can I help you?
0DI0016728	Long time, no see, Silus.
0DI0016729	Lieutenant. I was just thinking about you.
0DI0016730	That so?
0DI0016731	I was. I was just thinking about that pretty neck of yours.
0DI0016732	How sweet.
0DI0016733	I was thinking about how it would look with a Legion slave collar on it.
0DI0016734	I'll pass.
0DI0016735	Do you know what I love about our slave collars, Lieutenant?
0DI0016736	If you love them, maybe you should try one on.
0DI0016737	I love how tightly they fit.
0DI0016738	I train my men to make sure the slaves' flesh bulges a bit around the top and bottom. Know why?
0DI0016739	It's all the rage in fashion circles.
0DI0016740	Not quite. If you fit it just right, their body never gets used to the feeling of wearing it.
0DI0016741	It cuts in just enough when they swallow or turn their head to remind them who they belong to.
0DI0016742	And it's that constant reminder that keeps them docile.
0DI0016743	In that case, maybe you'd better save the collar you were going to give me.
0DI0016744	Oh? For whom?
0DI0016745	For a friend of mine you're about to meet. My friend isn't very docile.
0DI0016746	And who is this friend of yours?
0DI0016747	You know all the rules the NCR instituted to protect enemy prisoners of war?
0DI0016749	My friend doesn't.
0DI0016750	Oh, and Silus? If you resist at all, I'll personally blow your brains out.
0DI0016751	Come on in. He's all yours. I'll be back in a bit to see how you're getting along.
0DI0016752	And I'll need you to surrender your weapons before you go in. You can pick them up from the locker on your way out.
0DI0016753	Whoa, easy there! You're supposed to rough him up a little, not kill him.
0DI0016754	Why don't you step outside a minute? Let off some steam.
0DI0016755	Nice job.
0DI0016756	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep her under control.
0DI0016757	I think my friend doesn't like you, Silus. I don't know how much longer I can keep him under control.
0DI0016758	You think this'll make me talk? A beating. This the best you can do?
0DI0016759	Not just any beating, Silus. A savage beating. A beating that you'll be reminded of every time you feel pain from now on.
0DI0016760	When my friend's done with you, you won't have any of your teeth left. You'll be drinking your food through a straw.
0DI0016761	Your ribs will never heal properly and it will hurt every time you breathe.
0DI0016762	It'll be like your collars, Silus. Impossible to forget.
0DI0016764	Huh. Not the sort of wit I've come to expect from you, Silus.
0DI0016765	You're getting nothing from me.
0DI0016766	I'm getting entertainment. That's something. So what's it gonna be?
0DI0016767	Are you going to spill your guts to me, or am I going to let my friend the maniac back in here for some play time? Silus?
0DI0016768	Silent treatment, huh? Have it your way.
0DI0016769	Come on back in. I think he misses you. Oh, and let me check you for weapons, one more time. For your safety as well as his.
0DI0016770	All that shouting. Honestly, Silus, you get free room and board. The least you could do is be a good guest.
0DI0016771	Lieutenant, this woman is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
0DI0016772	Lieutenant, this man is an agent of the Legion on a mission to kill me.
0DI0016773	My, we have an active imagination today, don't we?
0DI0016774	Think about it! Is it worth the risk? You need what I know.
0DI0016775	Well, it sounds like the two of you are becoming fast friends.
0DI0016776	It'll be your head if I die, Lieutenant. You'll be disgraced.
0DI0016777	You know what? I think you're right, Silus.
0DI0016778	Of course I'm right.
0DI0016779	Except I don't care, because it'll be worth it.
0DI0016780	It'll be worth it to never have to hear you say another word, Silus.
0DI0016782	Lieutenant!
0DI0016783	Is something the matter, Silus? You look upset.
0DI0016784	Here, maybe you'd better step out for a moment. You've upset him.
0DI0016785	Your friend is a miserable fucking degenerate.
0DI0016786	I don't know, I thought she seemed like a nice lady.
0DI0016787	I don't know, I thought he seemed like a nice guy.
0DI0016788	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have her torn apart by dogs.
0DI0016789	If we were on the other side of the river, I'd have him torn apart by dogs.
0DI0016790	That's a long walk, Silus. I don't think it's gonna happen. You'd better just talk.
0DI0016791	Your tactics are a joke.
0DI0016792	If you don't like dealing with me, I can bring my friend back in.
0DI0016793	Both of you can rot.
0DI0016794	Have it your way.
0DI0016795	Come on back in. I think he misses you.
0DI0016796	Hey. No cause for th-that.
0DI0016797	Yeah, r-right. That's Brahmin shit. Lucky for you we're on b-b-base, and I can't start trouble with civvies. How 'bout you get l-l-lost?
0DI0016798	Nah... it's no p-problem. Everybody likes to have a little fun with me. Just shows they l-l-like me. You don't rib somebody you don't like.
0DI0016799	Yeah. You just walk away. No fool can trump the T-t-ten of Spades!
0DI0016800	Yeah, I'll s-s-see you around.
0DI0016801	It was m-my fault. See... I was kn-knocked out when it happened. That b-big guy sneaked up on us. I let B-Betsy down.
0DI0016802	Yeah. The LT shouldn't have b-brought that shit up. Not with civvies, anyway. Ain't right.
0DI0016803	Ain't right t-talking about this, anyway.
0DI0016804	No! Ha ha! More for me!
0DI0016805	Heh. Good. More for me.
0DI0016806	Sell? Sell?! My dogs! What part don't you get? Mine! Lucky they don't eat you alive for that!
0DI0016807	Arf arf! Ha ha!
0DI0016808	Hey! No feeding my dogs!
0DI0016809	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just... up and left.
0DI0016810	I remember hearing some of the missing folks were doing business with Dermot and Saint James - a couple of scavengers from Westside.
0DI0016811	Captain Parker. I'm in charge of this camp.
0DI0016812	This here's where folks go when their luck runs out. Drifters up from the Republic, locals that can't turn a dime, drunken reprobates from all around.
0DI0016813	If you don't have the caps to get onto the Strip, odds are you'll end up here.
0DI0016814	Let me see that... I know these names. Nephi and Cook-Cook are major players with the Fiends. Dermot and Saint James must be working with them.
0DI0016815	But, this just a list of names and not evidence of a direct connection with the missing people.
0DI0016816	Damn. Combined with that girl's bear you found in Saint James' room, this is enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
0DI0016818	That... I think that's her teddy bear! It's suspicious, but it doesn't tell us what happened to the refugees.
0DI0016819	Damn. Combined with that ledger you found in Dermot's room, it's enough for me to have them brought in for questioning.
0DI0016820	Well, I am a little short staffed. Maybe you could give me a hand.
0DI0016821	Some people have gone missing from the camp lately. Haven't seen any signs of violence or heard about any feuds, they just up and vanished.
0DI0016822	I've also got Keith and his gambling to deal with - I know that skunk's cheating folk out of their savings, I just can't prove it.
0DI0016823	Yeah? Like what?
0DI0016824	They never seemed to have much in common - that's why I didn't notice it sooner. Young folks, old folks, men, women... all disappearing.
0DI0016825	I remember a family with a little blonde girl. She... never talked much, but she always carried this little stuffed teddy bear.
0DI0016826	Well, you did ask if we needed help.
0DI0016827	Seem to recall a lot of them did business with those scavengers over on the West Side - Dermott and Saint James.
0DI0016828	Keep at it. I need to find out what happened.
0DI0016829	You've got it.
0DI0016830	I've been sniping since I was old enough to walk. Lot of us sharpshooters get recruited off the farms and ranches out west. Comes natural to us.
0DI0016831	As for my squad - they're the best we have. My word on that. They're all hand-picked, and I won't work with anybody who isn't up to snuff.
0DI0016832	10 of Spades is the greenest of the bunch, but he's a farmboy, like me. Shooting's in his blood.
0DI0016833	What did you have in mind? You thinking of luring him into range of my snipers?
0DI0016834	It's one hell of a risk you'd be taking. But if you're willing... we'll do everything we can to keep you alive.
0DI0016835	Can we hit him? Damn straight, we can. Question is whether he kills you before we get a clear shot.
0DI0016836	No, I won't risk my team in the open. They're deadly at range, but they've got no advantage hand-to-hand.
0DI0016837	But if you can draw him out... get us a clean shot... we can bring him down. No problem.
0DI0016838	It's a lot to ask, I know. You'd be taking most of the risk.
0DI0016839	Listen. My team has a debt to settle with Nephi. We've seen too many of our boys get brained by that golf club of his.
0DI0016840	You lure him out for us, and if we can score some payback... we'll all pitch in caps for a reward.
0DI0016841	My team will take up positions around the old rock crushing plant. They'll wait until they see Nephi, and then they'll start shooting.
0DI0016842	At that point, just keep your head down, and stay out of range of his golf club. We'll take care of the rest.
0DI0016843	Your call. Even if you were one of my troopers, I wouldn't force you to take a risk like that.
0DI0016844	But the offer stands. Give me the word, and I'll put my snipers in position. Otherwise, they'll stay inside the fence.
0DI0016846	Whatever you say, buddy.
0DI0016847	Whatever you say, lady.
0DI0016848	Yeah. You need something?
0DI0016849	Really now? We had our suspicions about that man, but he's got so many shipments going so many different directions it's been hard to track
0DI0016850	What exactly is his offer? Does he realize bribing a Ranger is a hanging offense?
0DI0016851	[SUCCEEDED] He has himself a deal. However, If he tries to run or he continues to deal strategic assets with enemies, he's a dead man.
0DI0016852	Tell Contreras to expect to see me around more often. He better have a new bit of information when I stop in or I'm reporting his ass to Boyd.
0DI0016856	Dogs? Good dogs! My dogs! Fiend dogs. Tear you up, arf arf arf! Ha ha!
0DI0016857	Heh. Good shit. Psycho. Top quality. You want? Might know a guy who knows a guy.
0DI0016858	Don't fuck with Fiends. Driver Nephi'll brain your skull in! Cook-Cook... don't even want to know what he'll do.
0DI0016859	Who wants to know? You here for my dogs? Can't have my dogs. Here for meat? Can't have my meat. Meat's for dogs.
0DI0016860	I'm Violet. Dogs are mine. Meat is mine.
0DI0016861	Heh heh. Good meat, huh? Cat meat, rat meat, dog meat - maybe even *you* meat!
0DI0016862	Yeah, you haven't exactly kept a low profile. That narrows our options somewhat. They're not gonna believe your accusations.
0DI0016863	But you can still create an alibi for me. I could make sure people know I haven't been near the monorail all day while you're busy blowing it up.
0DI0016864	It'd be better with a scapegoat, but it'll at least deflect some suspicion.
0DI0016865	I really don't have time for this right now.
0DI0016866	You know, hiring isn't really my department. You should talk to Ms. McLafferty about work for hire.
0DI0016867	Like I said, talk to Alice McLafferty, she's in charge here.
0DI0016868	The name's Hostetler - Don Hostetler. Can I help you with something?
0DI0016869	I've already told you... I'm Don Hostetler.
0DI0016870	Really?  Well, I obviously couldn't supply enough to feed the entire camp, but I'm game.  What kind of caps are we talking here?
0DI0016871	Hey, that sounds good to me.  No more wasted meat just laying around to rot.  I can keep my stock fresh and keep the caps flowing.
0DI0016872	If I get a big delivery brought in, I'll be sure to send a good chunk of it off to McCarran right away.
0DI0016873	Tell Farber I'll try and have the first shipment sorted in a week or two.
0DI0016874	Expanding isn't a bad idea.  Maybe I could open up a small cafe restaurant with the more diverse inventory...
0DI0016877	Rations do get tight from time-to-time and it would be nice to keep a regular stock of goods.
0DI0016881	I'll help you if I can. What are you looking for?
0DI0016882	There's the medic at Camp McCarran, but I've also heard there's a civilian doctor in the northeast part of New Vegas. I don't know for sure.
0DI0016883	The Crimson Caravan Company is north of here. They have just about everything you need.
0DI0016884	But, if you're in the market for guns, go see the Gun Runners. They're expensive, but they have stuff no one else carries.
0DI0016885	I'm a private in the NCR army, and I've been proudly serving for two years now.
0DI0016886	Although, if you were asking what I'm doing right this instant, I'm patrolling the farms. It's a safe post, but a little boring.
0DI0016887	I do get to take shots at marauding Molerats once in awhile, and that's always fun.
0DI0016888	Same as you, I'd imagine? Although, I'm assigned to watch over these farms and keep out trespassers.
0DI0016889	I do get to take shots at Molerats once in awhile, so that's always fun.
0DI0016890	It's NCR-owned farmland. It produces a lot of the crops that supply McCarran and the Dam. The farmers are all civilians, though.
0DI0016891	They work the farms, and in return they get a safe place to stay and clean food and water. Some of 'em aren't all that grateful, though.
0DI0016892	I shouldn't have brought it up. It's not my place to spread gossip.
0DI0016893	[SUCCEEDED] All right. Some of the farmers, especially Trent Bascom, claim the NCR isn't giving them the water they need to meet their crop quotas.
0DI0016894	Personally, I think they're just incompetent and making excuses. The NCR ought to send them all crying back to California.
0DI0016895	[FAILED] Not my place to talk. Sorry.
0DI0016896	Oh, you'd better believe it. I feel sorry for the troops who are charged with keeping the Fiends from overrunning everything.
0DI0016897	The Fiends are scary because they're unpredictable. One day, they'll be taking potshots at you and then running off before you can shoot back.
0DI0016898	And the next day, they'll come rushing at you pumped full of drugs and not stopping until you or they are dead.
0DI0016899	Current orders are to hold the line and nothing more. That's all we seem to do these days - hold the line.
0DI0016900	I guess it's a tricky situation since there's a vault in Fiend territory. If the NCR went after them, they'd just hole up.
0DI0016902	Then we ain't going nowhere.
0DI0016903	I like your speed, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
0DI0016904	Mercs with a brain are no good to me, stranger. Let me know when you start behaving like a real gun.
0DI0016905	Glad to hear it. Let me know when they're gone.
0DI0016906	I like your enthusiasm, stranger. Let me know when that's done.
0DI0016907	I thought you'd be made of stronger stuff, merc. Don't prove me wrong or I'll have to find someone else with the guts to do what's right.
0DI0016908	Great work. I gotta make sure this place doesn't eat itself from the inside.
0DI0016910	I take care of those who help with that. Here, you earned it.
0DI0016911	That's good to hear. Can't ever be too careful with strangers around here.
0DI0016912	I'm starting to think you're as undesirable around here as those strangers. Do something to change my mind, merc.
0DI0016913	That's good to hear. Can't ever keep too many eyes on strangers around here.
0DI0016916	Nonsense! Alice's a good girl. She may be going through a hard time, but...
0DI0016917	What the hell? It's none of your business. Don't bother me with this any longer.
0DI0016919	I don't want to talk about this, didn't you hear? Now, get lost before we run you off the hard way.
0DI0016920	They won't just let anybody into the Strip, but you should be able to have a good time in Freeside itself. Just, uh, keep a close eye on your caps.
0DI0016921	They're a bunch of crazies hopped up on all kind of drugs. Apparently, they're using one of the old vaults as a hideout.
0DI0016922	The army should really get in there and wipe 'em all out, but I guess they've got more than enough trouble to deal with right now.
0DI0016923	Their main base is right over there by the old airport - it's called Camp McCarran now. Some people like to paint 'em all as a bunch of bullies.
0DI0016924	Me, I'm glad they're around. They do what they can to keep things safe and orderly.
0DI0016927	The Crimson Caravan Company's the big dog around here. Keep following the road north and you'll eventually come across their camp.
0DI0016928	I'm pretty sure they've got a doc over at Camp McCarran, but I don't know if he'll treat just anybody.
0DI0016929	Let's see you try.
0DI0016930	Not enough. We've been trying to put a bullet in him for a few weeks. He's strong as a brahmin bull, and he's fast.
0DI0016931	Seems like he usually runs with a gang of Fiends. Uses them for cover. We haven't been able to get a clean shot at him.
0DI0016932	Betsy swears she's hit him. Twice. But if she's right, it didn't seem to slow him down.
0DI0016933	Pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every stim, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up earth.
0DI0016934	I've got three Fiends I want dead, and I don't give a goddamn how it gets done. That sound like something that interests you?
0DI0016935	Damn right I am. And I'm paying bounties.
0DI0016938	First one calls herself Violet. God knows why - the name is the prettiest thing about her. Spends most of her time with a pack of vicious dogs.
0DI0016939	Then there's Driver Nephi. He's fast and he's brutal. Killed about a dozen of my men with a goddamn driver iron. Hence his name.
0DI0016940	And finally... Cook-cook. Rapist. Pyromaniac. And damn good chef, if you believe the Fiends we've captured. Probably the craziest of the lot.
0DI0016941	I'm not going to feed you any bullshit. These aren't your common Vegas trash. They've all killed good NCR men, and plenty of mercs, too.
0DI0016942	You go after them - any of them - you're in for a hell of a fight. So... which one is it going to be?
0DI0016943	Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Only one thing concerns me right now, and that's killing the bastards that are murdering my men.
0DI0016944	You want to talk to somebody in charge, I'd start with Colonel Hsu and work my way down. You'll find him in the Main Concourse.
0DI0016945	But if you want to take down some psycho-crazy bastards... I'm happy to talk caps.
0DI0016946	Violet it is. Wish I could give you more advice on how to bring her down, but we know less about her than the other two.
0DI0016947	Just watch out for the dogs. She raises them herself. Might as well be their mother - they never leave her side.
0DI0016948	You've got some guts, I'll give you that. Nephi is one tough son of a bitch. You let him get close, and he'll take your head off.
0DI0016949	My advice is this. Talk to Lieutenant Gorobets. He's in charge of Alpha Team, 1st Recon. Snipers.
0DI0016950	If you're lucky, you can lure Nephi into the open, and the sharpshooters can bring him down. You bring me the head, you'll still get the bounty.
0DI0016951	It's a better bet than trying to take Nephi one-on-one, but it's your call.
0DI0016952	One thing I should tell you about Cook-Cook. The piece of shit is pure animal. He raped one of my snipers, and that makes this personal.
0DI0016953	Also... he's got a flamethrower, and he's damn good with it. From what I hear, he either rapes or burns every living thing he can get his hands on.
0DI0016954	Only one man's gotten close to killing him, and that's Little Buster. So he says, anyway. Maybe it's bullshit, but I'd still ask him about it.
0DI0016955	Can't say I blame you. If I wasn't in this fight for my country, you couldn't pay me enough to screw with those maniacs.
0DI0016956	If you change your mind, I'll be happy to see you again. Otherwise... best to stay out of the way.
0DI0016957	Good question. Fiend territory is southeast of here, but they range all over the area. None of them stays in any one place for long.
0DI0016958	One more thing. If you want the full reward, you need to bring me a recognizable head. My superiors need proof they're gone.
0DI0016959	That means no headshots. No decapitations 'til after they're dead. And no damage to the face. If you want to be safe, aim for the chest.
0DI0016960	You bring me a head that looks like a rotten tomato, people will be doubting, and I won't be authorized to pay the entire bounty.
0DI0016961	Good luck to you. And don't get careless.
0DI0016962	You've gone after the Fiends before - I don't have to tell you to keep alert. Good luck.
0DI0016963	Just bring me back that last head. And don't lose your own.
0DI0016964	Out in the yard. Gorobets coordinates our sniper teams. He's been gunning for Nephi for weeks now.
0DI0016965	Only thing he hasn't had is willing bait. Don't have enough troops to order anyone beyond the fence. Not anymore, anyway.
0DI0016966	Bounty hunter. Talks big. But he's still alive, so he can't be completely full of shit.
0DI0016967	I think he's out in the yard, waiting to claim a couple bounties.
0DI0016968	Fair enough. You've done your part. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
0DI0016969	That's the best damn thing I've heard all day. Finally somebody around here with some goddamn ambition.
0DI0016970	There's two psycho-bastards left. Which one will it be?
0DI0016971	Sorry to hear that. You had my hopes up. If you change your mind, the bounties still stand... unless somebody else claims them.
0DI0016972	Well... we're still better off than we were. Maybe one of my snipers will get lucky. If not, and you change your mind... you know where I'll be.
0DI0016973	Oh yeah. You can order up anything you want... as long as it's corn or beans!<Laughs>
0DI0016974	Just kidding. Haven't you heard? With few shipments from home and little variety, the troops are getting restless for some quality grub.
0DI0016975	You can only do so much as a chef with just corn, beans, onions, and peppers.
0DI0016976	Chow down.
0DI0016977	Sorry, but the brass ordered me to not serve enemies of NCR.
0DI0016978	I don't like your kind taking food from my men, so I'm going to charge you a little extra. Don't like it? Tough.
0DI0016979	Well, we haven't had any quality meat in months. Everyone in the camp just eating beans for protein... It isn't pretty.
0DI0016980	Some of my kitchen machinery is broken down, too, so we've been eating mostly raw vegetables.
0DI0016981	And I'm desperate for spices or seasonings. Anything. Just something to the general mood around here.
0DI0016982	Here is the list. We've been scrapping together quick-fixes to keep it running for months. I think it finally crapped out and needs a full overhaul.
0DI0016983	It's the goofy machine behind the counter in the corner next to the stove. I'd be much obliged if you could take a look at it and get it fixed up.
0DI0016984	I don't know. Try the various traders around the wastes, or the pawn shop in Westside might have some parts.
0DI0016985	Oh, I've heard of a place called House Tools you could check out! Its an old factory on the north side of Vegas.
0DI0016986	Just a word of warning, though. I hear no one who goes in there comes back out. Could be traps, crazy robots, or who knows what in that place.
0DI0016987	The Crimson Caravan would probably be able to arrange a regular shipment, but I don't know of any spices known to improve mood.
0DI0016988	Hell, we have a whole research department. One guy's even set up in the main terminal building. They're the ones who oughtta be looking into it.
0DI0016989	Great! Small price to pay in caps for a little variety in our weekly menu.
0DI0016990	Excellent! That'll save us some caps and help offload a bit of our overstock.
0DI0016991	Good to hear. That should cover the majority of the supply.
0DI0016992	That should help balance out our stock of food more reasonably and save us a ton of caps. Good work!
0DI0016993	You managed to swing us a discount and cover the majority of the meat supply we need? Good work!
0DI0016994	Good, that should help diversify things. It may be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
0DI0016995	Great! What he sells might be a bit gamey, but I can use it for stews and kabobs.
0DI0016996	Amazing. I thought that thing was done for. That'll help me transform what I can offer the troops.
0DI0016997	I'll give you a little extra discount the next time you buy food from me. Thanks again.
0DI0016998	No shit? The stuff actually does all that, huh?
0DI0016999	I'll have to start testing this out immediately. This will really help keep the guys focused.
0DI0017000	The brass are pissed about the trouble you've been causing. Your caps are no good here.
0DI0017002	Hey, I heard you were able to recover Morales' corpse.  In thanks, you get a discount on supplies.
0DI0017003	That was a real honorable thing you done there, kid.  Much appreciated.
0DI0017004	Here is what is currently available.
0DI0017005	With your reputation? Well, I won't say your caps are no good here... let's just say that they're... less good.
0DI0017006	You know what? I believe you.
0DI0017007	You're free to go. Contreras, however, won't be moving drugs ever again.
0DI0017009	Whoa!  Hold on a minute, honey...
0DI0017010	Ah, hell!
0DI0017011	Well, business is pretty light and I'd welcome the income, but I'll need a lot of caps to buy the necessary supplies.
0DI0017012	200 caps would get me started.
0DI0017013	Great. I'll just pick up future payments from McCarran directly when I drop off my snacks.
0DI0017014	You can let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days.
0DI0017015	[SUCCEEDED] You drive a hard bargain, but 100 caps will do until we can get a regular deal worked out with McCarran.
0DI0017017	[SUCCEEDED] Fresh food and water is worth it's weight in gold... You've got yourself a deal.
0DI0017018	Let McCarran know they'll have fresh snacks coming in a few days. I'll pick up the produce at that time as well.
0DI0017019	Suit yourself.  I'm always open to more business.
0DI0017020	Caps. This whole rotten town wants caps. Nobody does anything just because it's right.
0DI0017021	Fine. You want caps? You can have all of Esteban's back pay. NCR owes me, and I don't even want the damn money.
0DI0017022	Then you're not from the colonel's office? Sorry... I shouldn't have bothered you.
0DI0017023	I know... I've been crying. Stupid. I'm supposed to be a soldier.
0DI0017024	My husband... he's a Ranger, and he... he got murdered by a pack of Fiends. Goddamn savages laid his body out to rot.
0DI0017025	The brass won't say it to me straight, but they mean to leave Esteban out there. I can see that plain.
0DI0017026	No... I didn't expect nothing so soon. You're doing me a favor - I don't mean to be a pest.
0DI0017027	You said you wanted the caps. If you're thinking I'm not good for the money... please, you've got to take my word.
0DI0017028	They put him in a box? With a flag and all? I hope so. He'd have been proud.
0DI0017029	You're too good for this rotten town. First kind thing anybody ever did for me and Esteban.
0DI0017030	You ever need anything, all you need to do is ask. Thank you so much.
0DI0017031	You did what you said you would, and I owe you. Just like I promised, this is Esteban's back pay. Every cap.
0DI0017032	Maybe the caps are all that matter to you, but... you still did more for Esteban than his own country did. Thank you.
0DI0017033	You never lost anybody, have you? Not like this. Never had to think about that person you love all alone out there, cooking in the sun like meat...
0DI0017034	NCR never leaves a soldier behind. That's what the recruiters told us. Promised us. We believed them.
0DI0017035	Colonel says he can't spare the men to bring Esteban back home. And the Fiends, they put all kinds of mines and traps around his body. Snipers, too.
0DI0017036	So do I. But I know he won't. Ain't important enough in the scheme of things, you know? Still... thanks for listening.
0DI0017037	He was out on patrol. Bunch of drugged-up Fiends attacked them.
0DI0017038	Esteban laid down cover fire while the others fell back. One of the men saw him get shot. He didn't die, though, not then.
0DI0017039	They tried to go back for him, but there were too many Fiends, and they had to pull out. Damn savages chased them halfway to McCarran.
0DI0017040	Not your problem. Right. That's the motto in this town. Rotten people, rotten place.
0DI0017041	Mister, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
0DI0017042	Ma'am, I'd about given up hope. But you've got to be careful. I don't want anybody else dying on my account.
0DI0017043	Esteban's body is laid out between some buildings, east of the REPCONN headquarters. At least, that's what his squadmates said.
0DI0017044	There's an NCR position just north of there. It's on the way. They should be able to tell you what the situation is.
0DI0017045	Sorry... I'm not fit for proper conversation, not now.
0DI0017046	If you find him... or if you hear any news... I'll be right here.
0DI0017047	His best friend, Jackson, tried. Didn't even get permission from his CO, so it could have cost him a lot. But he never came back.
0DI0017048	Ah shit, I'm guessing he got caught by the NCR. You need to kill that guy now that he's seen you.
0DI0017049	Last thing we need is some investigator tracking you down. Get it done, and I think we can settle accounts, so to speak.
0DI0017050	Well, I can't exactly go wandering off the base whenever I want, you know? They're already suspicious.
0DI0017051	I can hear the MP's now. "Gee, Contreras, I didn't know you had so many friends in the Gun Runners." Speaking of which, guess your first stop.
0DI0017052	You're just passing a little note to a man named Isaac for me. I want to know which girl he likes.
0DI0017053	All right, well just find me when you want to get started.
0DI0017054	Great. Let me know what he says. They're almost a straight shot north from here, up past the sharecroppers.
0DI0017055	All right, all right. Just trying to make a little conversation. Shoulda known a youngin like you would be in a hurry.
0DI0017056	But that's neither here nor there. These plants have gotten completely out of control. I've got a plan to deal with them, but I'll need your help.
0DI0017057	Well that's a hell of a bit of luck on my part, then.
0DI0017058	Looks like you got sent on the same fool's errand I did, then.
0DI0017059	Good. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain what needs to be done.
0DI0017060	So you're one of those, huh? Fine, I'll give you all the money I have once we're done. Meet me on the second level, and I'll explain more.
0DI0017061	Have it your way. When you change your mind, I'll be on the second level. Meet me there and I'll explain what needs to be done.
0DI0017062	Time is of the essence, so I'll be brief. This place is filled with spores that are toxic to humans, and we need to get rid of them.
0DI0017063	I've pumped the vault full of a highly flammable gas that, once ignited, should destroy the vast majority of the spores. There's one problem, though.
0DI0017064	The gas becomes semi-inert on exposure to oxygen, meaning the gas will have to be ignited close to where it's being introduced.
0DI0017065	I need you to find the vents where the gas is being pumped and ignite it. Oh, and survive the resulting blast.
0DI0017066	You really have a one track mind, you know that? Anyway, listen up.
0DI0017067	Of course it is. This place is under quarantine until I finish what I started. Now listen up.
0DI0017068	I don't think you understand the situation. Listen up.
0DI0017069	This place is now locked down under quarantine, so neither of us is leaving until the situation at hand is dealt with.
0DI0017070	Good. Return to me when it's done.
0DI0017071	I'd love to debate you on this, but there's no time. Now do it or don't, but stop wasting my time.
0DI0017072	I set the gas to pump into the fifth level since that's where the concentration of spores was highest. I'd start looking there.
0DI0017073	Typically, these vaults use circular vents in their air circulation systems. Look for a wall with two of them almost side by side.
0DI0017074	There's one just around the corner outside this lab if you need an example.
0DI0017075	I've managed to create a connection to the vault's backup system from here. I just have to remotely delete all the files, and we're done here.
0DI0017076	What's got you so flustered? You just about scared me to death shouting like that.
0DI0017077	Don't you realize what those files represent? If they get into the wrong hands, this could happen all over again.
0DI0017078	Only this time, the madness won't just be confined to a musty vault. Do you really want that on your conscience? I sure as hell don't.
0DI0017079	No, these people died trying to stop a monster of their own creation. Failing to complete their work would mean they died in vain.
0DI0017080	And that's what I intend to do. And...
0DI0017081	How do you figure that?
0DI0017082	I suppose the data here could serve as a warning to other scientists. Tell them what paths of research not to follow.
0DI0017083	All right. You convinced me. Take the files back to that buffoon. You make a good point, but I still honestly hope you know what you're doing.
0DI0017084	No, it shouldn't take all that long. Just a few more moments and...
0DI0017085	...it's done. We can rest easy.
0DI0017086	...that's strange. The system says that the files were accessed recently, and copied to an external source.
0DI0017087	You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
0DI0017088	I've unlocked the door so you're free to run along now. Although it pains me to say it, I wouldn't have made it out of here without your help.
0DI0017089	If you're heading back toward McCarran, tell Dr. Williams that she has my thanks as well.
0DI0017090	If you're in the neighborhood of Camp McCarran anytime soon, look for a Dr. Williams. She was one of the few people there I could tolerate.
0DI0017091	She seemed genuinely worried when I agreed to come out here, so if you could be a dear and let her know I'm okay, I'd be most grateful.
0DI0017092	Yes, that sounds like something he'd do. Well, there's nothing for it, then.
0DI0017094	So you're going to be stubborn about it, eh? You're sure I can't change your mind about this?
0DI0017095	Then you give me no choice.
0DI0017096	Glad you're thinking clearly. I was afraid to blink there for a second.
0DI0017097	There, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
0DI0017098	Indeed. This should only take a minute. Just a few more moments and...
0DI0017099	It's possible. I have spent the last few days in a cave, after all.
0DI0017100	For all we know, that man sent someone immediately after you to swipe the data while you posed as mantis bait.
0DI0017101	Nothing to be done about it, I suppose. All we can do is delete what's here, and that's done.
0DI0017102	You're pretty highstrung for a youngster. In any case, just a few more moments and...
0DI0017103	Well, if they had any manners they would. In my day, if an old lady went missing for a spell, people cared.
0DI0017104	Oh, they did. I've taken extensive notes of all their successful experiments. Their research won't go to waste. As for the file erasure...
0DI0017105	Ah, she's such a dear. Not like that pompous little pedant she works for.
0DI0017106	Okay, what do you need?
0DI0017108	Okay, I'll follow you down to Motor-Runner. Here, take the key to the maintenance wing.
0DI0017110	Crap, it looks like I may have lost it. I sure hope you have some way to get us through that door.
0DI0017114	Really? It doesn't feel any better... but I'll take your word on it. Motor-Runner, here I come.
0DI0017115	Really? I didn't think my leg was up to full speed yet, but I'll take your word on it.
0DI0017116	I'll go take care of Motor-Runner.
0DI0017117	Thanks for the concern, doc.
0DI0017119	Okay, thanks again for the medical care doc.
0DI0017121	They're a bunch of degenerate, drug-addicted killers and rapists who've turned the west side of Vegas into a war zone.
0DI0017122	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner. He seems to be the only one who can still rub two brain cells together.
0DI0017123	The Fiends are a bunch of raider junkie fucks who have been causing a lot of trouble in the area outside of Vegas.
0DI0017124	Their leader calls himself Motor-Runner, and he seems to be the only one with a brain that isn't fully burnt out on chems.
0DI0017125	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves before they were all killed by the fiends.
0DI0017126	The inhabitants of the Vault were simple traders. They made a good living for themselves for a couple weeks.
0DI0017127	Then they caught the Fiends attention. I don't think they set up any kind of security, stupid fucks. They all got themselves killed.
0DI0017128	I was sent here to kill Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
0DI0017129	The NCR hopes that killing Motor-Runner will slow down the Fiends raiding in the area, at least until a new leader comes around.
0DI0017133	Okay, tell me what's on your mind.
0DI0017134	Roger that shit. Let's go.
0DI0017135	Okay, let's get him.
0DI0017136	Okay, I'll wait.
0DI0017138	I guess you probably can. You look tough enough at least. I'm not sure how long it'll take this leg to heal up.
0DI0017139	Sorry, no dice. I have a job to do, and it doesn't involve cleaning up after your mess.
0DI0017140	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you have a point. And I don't know how long it'll be before I'm on both feet...
0DI0017141	[FAILED] It's not a matter of toughness, it's a matter of smarts. You'll just make a mess of things.
0DI0017142	But if you must get yourself killed, I heard a Fiend named Daniel saying he carries keys. Maybe he has a spare to the Maintenance Wing.
0DI0017143	See that you don't.
0DI0017144	First sensible thing I've heard you say.
0DI0017145	Be quick about it.
0DI0017147	Alright then, take my helmet and bring it to the NCR. That should be proof enough. This doesn't make us friends though.
0DI0017148	We don't offer protection services. That's not my racket. So if you find yourself dead on your way out that's your tough shit.
0DI0017149	Okay, got anything else?
0DI0017155	Okay then. What's your business now?
0DI0017156	Thanks for doing business.
0DI0017157	Okay, we got a deal. Now let's talk a price, it'll cost you 200 caps for proof of my death.
0DI0017158	I'm not going to pay you squat. Now get outta my face.
0DI0017159	Yeah, that sounds like an alright deal. Here take my helmet back to the NCR. This doesn't make us friends though.
0DI0017161	Sorry, no deal.
0DI0017162	Okay, I don't need the money that bad. 150 it is. This doesn't make us friends though.
0DI0017164	We were part of a caravan heading into New Vegas from down south. They are holding us hostage, trying to get some ransom.
0DI0017165	Anyone willing to pay for us died in the attack. Once the Fiends figure that out, we are as good as dead.
0DI0017166	Can you set us free now?
0DI0017167	Thanks partner. I think the Fiend with the key is back in one of the bedrooms somewhere, someone called him Daniel. If that helps.
0DI0017168	I don't know much, only that the people who lived in here originally were killed by the Fiends. Carter there escaped and managed to explore for a bit.
0DI0017169	He hacked a password off of the computer, and found the location of some guns. He was on his way to get them when the Fiends caught him again.
0DI0017170	They are a bunch of junkies that do whatever they can to get money for chems.
0DI0017171	I hear they are lead by a guy calling himself Motor-Runner. I think he is in one of the other wings, although I haven't seen him myself.
0DI0017172	We are going to die in here. Please, if you find the key let us out. We'll find our own way to safety.
0DI0017173	Smart man. I could use somebody who can operate under the radar around here.
0DI0017174	Whoever our mole is, he's been slippery. Whenever one of the MP's gets too close, he changes his habits. Our last lead went cold weeks ago.
0DI0017175	Christ, keep it down! You want to blow the whole thing? We've worked years for this.
0DI0017176	But maybe it's good you're here. Hsu knows about the leaks, and I'm supposed to find the spy for him.
0DI0017177	At first I couldn't believe my luck. But since I haven't produced results - for obvious reasons - I feel him looking at me differently now.
0DI0017178	Maybe he's just thinking about putting someone else in charge, maybe he's starting to suspect. Either way it's bad for me.
0DI0017179	Especially once this next part goes down.
0DI0017180	Perfect. This has turned out better than I'd ever imagined.
0DI0017181	This will pay dividends for the Legion for a long time to come. I was with Hsu when the bomb went off. He'll never think to investigate me for it.
0DI0017182	I'll make sure Caesar himself hears about your success today. And take this, courtesy of the NCR. I'm sure they won't miss it.
0DI0017184	I don't know what you mean.
0DI0017185	Really? And how would you know where I'm supposed to be?
0DI0017186	Poor Crenshaw. He's pulled his last prank.
0DI0017187	Go and tell Colonel Hsu you found the bomber. Once Hsu's convinced, we can breathe easy.
0DI0017188	Is that right? No one has any business being in there after dusk. I wonder...
0DI0017189	There's a lot of communications equipment up there. He could be using it to touch base with whoever sent him.
0DI0017190	You've already done us a lot of good, but I'm afraid to move on this myself. We've tried catching this guy before and he can always smell a trap.
0DI0017191	But he may not know about you. I need you to follow him into the tower. See if you can discover his identity. Report back and I'll have him arrested.
0DI0017192	Report back when you've got it and I'll have him arrested.
0DI0017193	Took me three-and-a-half years, just to make Captain. Usually takes four, but I made sure there was an early vacancy.
0DI0017194	Caesar sees threats before they're even aware of him. He sent me long before we moved to occupy the eastern riverbank.
0DI0017195	And now all my work, all the waiting, is about to pay off.
0DI0017196	If you haven't noticed, the NCR bolsters its presence on the Strip from here. Sends troopers on the monorail in shifts.
0DI0017197	The monorail lets them occupy two positions for the price of one. It's a supply line that's immune to raiders and other hindrances on the ground.
0DI0017198	If someone were to cut that line, both positions would be much weaker. Fragile. They know this, and they watch it like hawks.
0DI0017199	But I've been here a long time, and I've learned everything there is to know about it. And I'm going to blow up that train.
0DI0017200	I told you I think they're starting to suspect me. You're going to help me cast away those suspicions.
0DI0017201	You're going to put the bomb on that train.
0DI0017202	I'll be sure to be in the presence of several reliable eyewitnesses when it happens. Then we're going to pin this on a scapegoat.
0DI0017203	I'd planned on disappearing after this operation. It'd be a matter of time before they traced it to me. Figured out I was a frumentarius.
0DI0017204	But with your help, maybe I can stay on after all. Make plans for something... grander.
0DI0017205	I have the explosives stashed in a trash can next to the ticketing counter along with some incriminating documents.
0DI0017206	You'll pick them up and make your way upstairs to the monorail terminal.
0DI0017207	They change the guard there at 0900 and 1800 hours. There'll be a small window where there's no one guarding the train.
0DI0017208	No, no. I wouldn't do that. Not unless I didn't have better options, anyway. And I do.
0DI0017209	Good. Try to plant the explosives quietly if you can - you'll make both our lives easier.
0DI0017210	But first things first. Go offer your services to Colonel Hsu. Tell him you'll work independently to find the leak.
0DI0017211	He's running out of options. He'll accept as long as you don't give him a reason not to.
0DI0017212	If he doesn't, then don't be surprised if you're the new scapegoat. So don't fuck this up.
0DI0017213	Yeah, let's make sure you have it down pat.
0DI0017214	Are you sure? Because I think the Legion would frown upon that decision.
0DI0017215	Very well. Let me know if you should change your mind.
0DI0017216	I can't let you leave.
0DI0017217	What? You idiot! I spent years earning his trust. The whole point of your heading up this operation was to preserve that trust!
0DI0017218	Now they'll replace him in a week with some other colonel and I'll be back to square one. You've set me back years today. Years!
0DI0017219	Get the hell out of my sight.
0DI0017220	Officially I'm in charge of Bravo Company. But since General Oliver has Bravo and most of our forces here garrisoned, I'm free to do other things.
0DI0017221	So I work with Colonel Hsu on logistics. Patrols, supply lines, reinforcements, that sort of thing.
0DI0017222	Hell of a position to be in when you're working for the other side. But I have to sabotage with a light touch, or else my guilt would be obvious.
0DI0017223	Lately it's been less about that and more about figuring out how that information is getting leaked to raiders.
0DI0017224	It's a big base with a lot of unhappy soldiers. They get stir-crazy. Hard to separate the malcontents from the actual culprit.
0DI0017225	Well, I'll leave that to you. But I would recommend Lieutenant Boyd and Sergeant Contreras as two people who usually know what's going on around here.
0DI0017226	Lupa, this is Frumentarius Picus, over.
0DI0017227	Ten-four. Keep us updated.
0DI0017228	Ten-four.
0DI0017229	Go ahead, Picus.
0DI0017230	Afternoon patrol enters Fiend territory at 1300. Have them mine that stretch.
0DI0017231	That would leave them the morning to bury mines along that stretch. Over.
0DI0017232	Ten-four, Picus. Fiends will be alerted.
0DI0017233	Roger Lupa.
0DI0017234	What's the status of your primary mission, Picus?
0DI0017235	Charges are set. Detonation will occur as the train leaves the station. Over.
0DI0017236	How long?
0DI0017237	Couple of minutes. Over.
0DI0017238	[SUCCEEDED] Sure. You got a deal.
0DI0017239	[FAILED] That don't buy much these days. Double it and you've got a deal.
0DI0017240	[SUCCEEDED] H-Hey... hey, don't worry, I was just kidding. We're going, right boys?
0DI0017241	[FAILED] I ain't moving my stuff just 'cause you ask, nicely or not. Get the fuck out of my sight, punk.
0DI0017242	Fuck you, asshole! You're gonna regret it!
0DI0017243	Oh really? And how are you gonna make us?
0DI0017244	Sure. Fire away.
0DI0017245	Doctor Usanagi runs a medical clinic up the road.
0DI0017246	I think there a few places, but I've heard that the Gun Runners sell the best.
0DI0017248	There's a few independent ones like me, but it's mostly the big trading outfits that deal in water, like the Crimson Caravan Company.
0DI0017249	Hmm... perhaps not, then.
0DI0017250	I know of only the one other. Though I wouldn't be surprised if there were a great many.
0DI0017251	Good. But for her to trust you to re-enter the room, she'll need to believe you've been doing what she expects of you.
0DI0017252	You'll need to punch me until I'm bleeding and weak. Go on. This is nothing compared to the Legion's training.
0DI0017254	I don't know why I'm taking this chance on an invalid... I'll explain again.
0DI0017255	[?] Foot soldiers of the Legion are trained to not have to think for themselves - to have conflict removed from their minds.
0DI0017256	They kill themselves to evade capture because they are not trusted to make such a decision rationally in the heat of battle.
0DI0017257	But I'm no foot soldier. I knew I could escape captivity on my own, without revealing the tiniest iota of information to my captors.
0DI0017258	[SUCCEEDED] I'll show you gutless, you sniveling bastard. I'll spill your guts all over this room!
0DI0017259	[?] I've told them nothing. They've gotten nowhere. I'm a centurion, for Christ's sake. I deserve his trust.
0DI0017260	[?] You have to let this go. I'll disappear. No one will ever see me again. That was always the plan in the first place.
0DI0017261	[SUCCEEDED] No! That's not what I meant! I-
0DI0017262	Lieutenant! This man is trying to kill me! He's not who you think he is!
0DI0017264	Lieutenant! This woman is trying to kill me! She's not who you think she is!
0DI0017265	[?] You think I could get where I was in the Legion army if I feared death?
0DI0017266	[?] Coward? I've faced odds that would make your NCR soldiers wet themselves.
0DI0017267	I've led charges against men with guns carrying only my knife, and I can tell you, it was they who feared me.
0DI0017268	But suicide is a weak death on a battlefield. It says to your enemy that you fear capture. It says if you're caught you can be broken.
0DI0017269	Take your time.
0DI0017270	[?] You've made your intentions clear. The Legion has abandoned me.
0DI0017271	[?] If I had killed myself then I would've been murdering one of Caesar's greatest soldiers. Either choice is a betrayal of the Legion, as I see it.
0DI0017272	[SUCCEEDED] I've done everything Caesar ever asked of me, and this is how I am repaid? With assassination?
0DI0017273	I ambushed countless NCR patrols and wiped them out so that our operatives could move freely.
0DI0017274	I waited for him to dispatch us for three days, never questioning why the "headaches" he complained of would hinder his ability to command.
0DI0017275	It'll take more than that to get me to talk, worm.
0DI0017276	What? What do you mean?
0DI0017277	Something is wrong with Caesar. Something he is attempting to hide from his men. But it was obvious before we set out on this last mission.
0DI0017278	For three days, we awaited his order to dispatch us. Three days. But he hid in his tent, refusing to give orders. Complaining of headaches.
0DI0017279	He looks different now than he used to. His face is sunken, sickly. But any questioning of his health enrages him.
0DI0017280	Cedo nulli.
0DI0017281	No! You slimy bastard!
0DI0017282	No! You cursed bitch!
0DI0017283	Nothing I've said will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion. This camp and everyone in it will burn.
0DI0017284	[SUCCEEDED] You think I'm going to slit my throat for some megalomaniacal self-appointed dictator?
0DI0017285	I didn't work my way up to have it all be taken from me out of some irrational paranoia. Caesar's losing it. I believe that.
0DI0017286	He's been shutting himself in his tent. Privately, he complains of headaches. Whatever it is, it's affecting his ability to lead.
0DI0017287	I hope the Legion burns your wretched body at the stake when they conquer this place.
0DI0017288	Nothing I could tell you would do anything to stop that.
0DI0017289	I don't know. I know he sends intelligence by radio in the middle of the night. Sometimes that intelligence would find its way to my century.
0DI0017290	Then you're a fool. That man reports to Caesar on what I do here. The Legion isn't going to take me back.
0DI0017291	My only hope is to escape and disappear. But if I escape and he reports it, they'll hunt me down as long as I live.
0DI0017292	It'd serve me to report him as much as it'd serve you.
0DI0017293	Beat me all you like, but it won't make my information any more useful. You can take what I have or leave it.
0DI0017294	There is one other thing that may interest you. I know that Caesar has planted a spy here.
0DI0017295	Every night details of NCR troop movements are broadcast from a radio on this base to Caesar's camp.
0DI0017296	The spy has been here a long time - since before the entire conflict began. He's an officer.
0DI0017297	If I knew who he was, I would tell you. If I escape and he's alive to report it, the Legion would hunt me down.
0DI0017298	But like I said, none of this information will change the outcome for you. No force can hold back the tide of the Legion.
0DI0017299	Good! Give it to me.
0DI0017300	I'm going to pretend to be unconscious. Let them send you out so no one suspects you.
0DI0017301	When I'm alone with a guard, I'll shoot him and leave in his uniform.
0DI0017303	We work together. I'm handling his deliveries for the moment while he handles a business opportunity that came up.
0DI0017304	What? Look, do you have something to drop off or not?
0DI0017305	Crazy wastelander.
0DI0017306	Lets see here...
0DI0017307	Congratulations, you're under arrest for chem trafficking. Hand over your weapons and come with me.
0DI0017308	Contreras will still get his. Killing you will just save me some paperwork.
0DI0017309	Great. Let him know we'll be keeping an eye on him. He is free to do business...
0DI0017310	But, if he isn't regularly reporting on illegal transactions, he's a dead man.
0DI0017311	Contreras, eh? We suspected he was involved somehow.
0DI0017312	It looks like you just gave me the evidence I've been looking for.
0DI0017313	Good. Saves me paperwork.
0DI0017314	Ranger Keller. I've been undercover for months tracking chems in this area.
0DI0017315	This has to be the easiest catch yet.
0DI0017316	Heh, an accomplice afterall. Well, it'll save me some paperwork just killing you.
0DI0017319	[SUCCEEDED] What?! How the hell did you figure that out?
0DI0017320	[FAILED] Password? That little bastard said nothing about a password.
0DI0017321	Price is in NCR custody and you're going to join him, unless you've got a damn good explanation for why you're looking for him.
0DI0017322	Hand over your weapons. You're under arrest.
0DI0017323	Hell. Thought I'd done a better job than that. Well, if that's how it is, you can call me Ranger Keller.
0DI0017324	Price is in deep with the NCR for supplying drug ingredients to the local gangs. He's currently being held for questioning.
0DI0017325	What is your business with Price?
0DI0017326	[SUCCEEDED] It might work since he's acting as a major hub for this activity. It's not like he has much choice now that we have evidence.
0DI0017327	If you can convince Contreras to work with the Rangers to break up the drug ring, I'll call off the firing squad.
0DI0017328	Just report back to me when he's agreed to make the deal.  Otherwise, he's dead.
0DI0017329	[SUCCEEDED] I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
0DI0017330	I'm never going to be able to track all of these bastards down without some help, and Contreras seems to be a central hub of activity.
0DI0017331	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates. Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
0DI0017332	[FAILED] You don't bribe a Ranger. You had better have something compelling to say, or you can join Contreras in hell.
0DI0017333	[SUCCEEDED] All right, if you hear anything, report it to myself or Lt. Boyd immediately. We need to track down his source.
0DI0017334	[FAILED] <Takes Contreras' package> Bullshit, lets see what you've got here...
0DI0017335	Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make chems. You're under arrest unless you've got a damn good explanation.
0DI0017336	He'll be shot. We have no tolerance for chem dealers in the military.
0DI0017338	I have Contreras. No one is going to miss you.
0DI0017339	I wouldn't normally do this, but seeing so much money change hands between scumbags on a daily basis has me thinking.
0DI0017341	Tell Contreras I'm willing to put in a good report with the brass if he cooperates.  Just give me a cut of the action and report any major moves.
0DI0017342	Otherwise, he'll be reported as a traitor selling contraband to the enemy and go in front of a firing squad.
0DI0017343	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, girlie.
0DI0017344	You really don't know what you just got yourself into, boy.
0DI0017345	Let's see... Well, it looks like you've got the materials here to make full-blown chems.
0DI0017347	[FAILED] What's that you're carrying? Looks like some kind of delivery to me...
0DI0017348	Ah shit. Well, please tell me you didn't hand him the package.
0DI0017349	Now you're just going to have to take him out. I can't afford having NCR knowing about my side business...
0DI0017350	...and I don't think you want to go in front of a firing squad either. You take care of this, my entire stock is available to you.
0DI0017351	Hell, I might even throw in something extra to sweeten the deal.
0DI0017352	[SUCCEEDED] That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
0DI0017353	The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
0DI0017354	[FAILED] No deals. I want that son of a bitch dead.
0DI0017355	Thank God. You're going to need to take him out.
0DI0017356	If McCarran hears I've been selling contraband, we're both dead.
0DI0017357	[SUCCEEDED] All right, here's a little something in advance. Now get the job done.
0DI0017358	[FAILED] You've got brass balls, but no deal. I'm already offering you access to my stash if you take care of this.
0DI0017360	Great. The Crimson Caravan has something ready for me.
0DI0017361	Look for Blake and let him know you're picking up Contreras' medical supplies.
0DI0017362	Thanks. Don't come back until you have it. Crimson Caravan is just northeast of the Gun Runners. Blake's usually in the main office.
0DI0017363	You bribed a Ranger? Ha! That's gotta be some kind of special talent.
0DI0017365	You need to clean up your reputation or you're going to get me in trouble - I'll have to charge you more to keep from arousing suspicion.
0DI0017366	That might just work. Tell him I'll cut him in on a bit of the profit and help him track down drug dealers if he'll give me a pass.
0DI0017368	No way. I'm making too much money to just hand him the entire contraband operation. Just kill the bastard.
0DI0017369	Don't come back until his corpse is rotting in the sunlight. The last thing I need is a do-gooder Ranger trying to take me down.
0DI0017370	Very professional. I like that. Maybe you can handle something bigger.
0DI0017372	You're right. I'm just an under-the-table arms dealer. What could I possibly offer you, a drifting mercenary? Sorry for wasting your time.
0DI0017373	Keely's brilliant... an absolute genius. She plays at being mean, but it's all a front.
0DI0017374	When you've lived as long as she has, you get defensive around new people. Who wants to make a friend when you know you'll outlive them?
0DI0017375	It's foul, to tell the truth. Most people try to get what they can from the outside... even if it's just a smuggled candy bar, now and then.
0DI0017376	Contreras is a genius, he can find almost anything you'd want. Takes caps to get him motivated, though. He won't do a thing for free.
0DI0017377	The Director? He's... very well-spoken. And... knowledgeable.
0DI0017378	My father used say good things about them, but that was years ago... back when they'd teach farmers and ranchers about crop rotation and the like.
0DI0017379	Nowadays... they've changed. They're doing what they can to discredit the NCR, give us a bad name with the locals.
0DI0017380	Dr. Hildern trained with them, years ago. Not me, though. I'm an OSI girl.
0DI0017381	Head researcher. Mostly on the Dam project, but I help out on other things, when they need me. Got to be flexible.
0DI0017382	Right. Stay safe.
0DI0017383	I couldn't get her to say. But she talked about the war - the great war, when the bombs fell - like she'd been there.
0DI0017384	So I'm guessing... pretty old. Two hundred years? Maybe more.
0DI0017385	[FAILED] Wouldn't be right for me to say. He's my boss... and he took a chance, bringing me out here as lead researcher.
0DI0017386	[SUCCEEDED] He's not what you'd call... warm. Unless he wants something from you. And even then, it's kind of a cold warm.
0DI0017387	Most of the time, I focus on the science and try to forget him. He doesn't get mixed up in any actual work. Though he tells people that he does.
0DI0017388	He sure does. Everyone knows it. I've just got to endure this job until the project is finished.
0DI0017389	But abandoning Keely... he crossed a line. Taking credit for other people's work is one thing. Sending people to die in the waste is another.
0DI0017390	If Hildern tries to recruit any more mercs, I'm going to warn them. What can he do to me? I'm the only one who can run this lab.
0DI0017391	Dead? But that's... terrible. You're sure? You saw her body? With the way she looks, maybe she just seemed dead, and she really wasn't...
0DI0017392	No... you've seen enough death to know the difference. I didn't mean to sound ungrateful. I know you tried.
0DI0017393	The notes count for something. I'll keep them safe. Keely's work in the vault won't be lost, and it won't be forgotten.
0DI0017394	Like a brahmin and a deathclaw. Though I'm not sure which would be which. Bad analogy, maybe - they're both deathclaws, in their way.
0DI0017395	Keely hates Hildern. She says he's more politician than scientist, and gets in the way of true discovery.
0DI0017396	And Hildern hates Keely because... well, because every time they meet, she makes him look like an ass. In front of important people, usually.
0DI0017399	Keely was brilliant... she'd seen so much. What a horrible waste...
0DI0017400	[SUCCEEDED] She is? But she didn't call in. Keely wouldn't waste a chance to yell at Dr. Hildern.
0DI0017401	But if she's caught up in her notes... I guess she might have forgotten.
0DI0017402	Sorry. I shouldn't question your word. If you say Keely's safe, I owe you these caps.
0DI0017403	Thanks again. Really. I owe you.
0DI0017404	[FAILED] No. That can't be right. Keely would've called in.
0DI0017405	Maybe you think you helped her... I don't know. But I need to hear from Keely. Personally.
0DI0017406	Otherwise... no reward. Not a cap.
0DI0017407	From Alice? I'll see that she's paid right away.
0DI0017408	Crimson Caravan runs a tight operation, even out here in the waste. Wouldn't do to keep them waiting.
0DI0017409	Was there anything else? Or were you just here about the invoice?
0DI0017414	Fine. I'll see that she's paid. Crimson Caravan always fulfils their contractual obligations to the letter.
0DI0017415	Now I assume there's nothing more, so I trust you can see yourself to the door.
0DI0017416	Dammit. Now you've made me forget what I was doing...
0DI0017417	You were warned! Time to die.
0DI0017418	Yeah - fuck off, and be grateful you're still breathing!
0DI0017419	Final warning, asshole. Get the fuck out of here or we are going to waste your ass.
0DI0017420	All right, asshole, you just fucked yourself!
0DI0017421	[FAILED] Who the fuck you trying to kid? You're lucky if I let you walk away from this, asshole.
0DI0017422	[SUCCEEDED] If you're fucking carrying, just fucking say so. Yeah, deliver to the boss, business as usual.
0DI0017423	Motor-Runner's down in the Maintenance Wing. Straight through the door behind me, down the hall, down the stairs to the right.
0DI0017424	Hey! No need, no need! I was just kidding!
0DI0017426	I was just kidding about tossing me some Psycho. So you don't got to say anything about that.
0DI0017427	Then what the fuck are you doing here? You looking to get killed? What the fuck?
0DI0017428	I'm paying 20 caps each for Jet, Psycho, or Buffout.
0DI0017429	Deal is still the same, 20 caps each for jet, psycho, or buffout.
0DI0017430	Okay, our deal was Jet, Psycho, or Buffout for 22 caps a pop.
0DI0017431	[FAILED] Then I think you'd better find your way out before you get yourself hurt.
0DI0017432	[SUCCEEDED] I guess it isn't a secret. Yeah, the residents of the Vault are all dead. We killed them.
0DI0017433	Funny thing is, they just let us in. We didn't have to force the doors or anything.
0DI0017434	Nice doing business with you.
0DI0017435	You? Take care of me? Ha! You don't look half-tough enough.
0DI0017436	Then get the fuck out. I'm a busy man.
0DI0017437	Cool. I haven't had a good fight in a while, and it's been ages since Donnie and Marie had something they could sink their teeth into!
0DI0017438	Sounds good to me, and to the dogs, too! Dinnertime, boys!
0DI0017445	[SUCCEEDED] Alright, 22 caps each, but that's it.
0DI0017446	[FAILED] These are my prices. I don't negotiate.
0DI0017447	I'm not here to talk. I'm here for business. Either do some or get the fuck out.
0DI0017448	What kind of arrangement did you have in mind?
0DI0017449	Well now, I guess that depends on who's paying.
0DI0017450	Jules, myself, and a few others patrol the streets and sewers. Any punks come up out of the rest of the city, we give 'em the run off.
0DI0017451	Like I told you, we look out for each other here. Me, Jules, and a few others make sure any trouble stays the hell out of our streets.
0DI0017452	[FAILED] Really? You'll forgive me if I ask you to back that claim up, won't you?
0DI0017453	[SUCCEEDED] That's the kind of stuff I like to hear, stranger. All right, we could use someone like you.
0DI0017454	Folks that don't belong. Murderers, rapists, extortionists, and everything in between.
0DI0017455	You know, business as usual in North Vegas, stranger.
0DI0017456	NCR... did you just crawl out from under a rock? Those folks only care about their business, their people and their pockets.
0DI0017457	NCR's order? Don't make me laugh, stranger. We work this land, we own these streets, and we yank up the bad weeds ourselves, got it?
0DI0017459	[FAILED] Hmm. Honesty's a good trait, stranger, but I don't deal with mercenaries unless I'm damn sure they can be trusted.
0DI0017460	[SUCCEEDED] Spoken like a true mercenary. Well, you seem like you can handle yourself, stranger, and we can use people like that.
0DI0017461	We may not squander our wealth like those fools in the Strip, but we take care of our own business. Consider this a token of good faith.
0DI0017462	This? The OSI lab. We don't get many visitors. The smell puts people off, I think.
0DI0017463	Nobody ever said science would smell clean and fresh. Anyway, you get used to it, if you give it some time.
0DI0017464	I know I don't sound the part. Get raised by brahmin ranchers, and you never lose the twang. Drives Hildern crazy.
0DI0017465	But I know every inch of the power grid from Hoover Dam to Shady Sands. That's what we do here - try to optimize the power output from the Dam.
0DI0017466	Some of the others are working on an agricultural project, but... truth be told, they aren't making much progress. Not yet, anyway.
0DI0017468	You mean... give you work? No, that'd be up to the administrator. Hildern. He's back there in his office.
0DI0017469	Between you and me, I don't think he ever leaves. Plenty of mercs go in to see him, though.
0DI0017470	I can't say. We're not supposed to talk about the research. Not the details. If you're interested, I'm sure he'd see you.
0DI0017471	Nice to meet you. If you need anything, I'm almost always in the lab.
0DI0017472	I shouldn't say anything, I know that. But you're not the first person Hildern's sent out to the vault.
0DI0017473	There were a lot of mercs. One after another. None of them came back.
0DI0017474	Then, about a week ago, there was a scientist. Keely. She's unusual, not the sort of person you'd expect, but she's an absolute genius, and...
0DI0017475	And he didn't mention her? Not even her name? Or any of the other mercs?
0DI0017476	Not interested. More concerned. It's just... you're not the first person he's sent to Vault 22. And I know he'd never tell you.
0DI0017477	We shouldn't even be talking about this, I know. But I think someone should tell you. You're not the first one he's sent to Vault 22.
0DI0017478	But now he's hired you. Which means one of two things. Either he heard back from Keely, and she failed, or he's given up on her.
0DI0017479	Listen. I make a fair wage, but I'm not rich, not by any means. Maybe my kind of money wouldn't appeal to your average merc.
0DI0017480	But I'm willing to pay you, if you'll find Keely and make sure she's safe. Isn't right leaving her out there, no idea if she's alive or dead.
0DI0017481	I had a good feeling about you. Moment you walked in. I mean it.
0DI0017482	No, wait! I don't mean to see any harm come to Dr. Hildern. Unless by "talk" you just mean... talk.
0DI0017483	No, I knew the danger wouldn't. I'm not trying to scare you off the job.
0DI0017484	That's all I ask. She might even be able to help you. As long as you don't speak too well of Dr. Hildern.
0DI0017485	I know it's not your business to fend for anyone but yourself. If not for her, do it for the caps. That's all I'm asking.
0DI0017486	Of course. Anything.
0DI0017487	Right. Good luck.
0DI0017488	Intruder Alert! Activating Defenses!
0DI0017490	Anything else I can do for you?
0DI0017492	I don't know him very well, myself. I seem to remember that he was the man to call on if you needed someone to get in and get out quietly.
0DI0017493	Colonel Hsu would really be the person to talk to.
0DI0017494	Maybe break-in isn't the right word. We didn't find signs of forced entry. But I've had reports of someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
0DI0017495	It's probably just a meeting spot for a steamy military base love affair. <Sighs> Kids today.
0DI0017496	But it bothers me that they didn't break in. It means they have an access code. Most soldiers around the base don't have that.
0DI0017497	Well, there's Anders. He's a Ranger. That one's not suspicious so much as worrisome - he left on a dangerous assignment.
0DI0017498	Colonel Hsu sent him out. Now I think he feels guilty not having any way to check up on him.
0DI0017499	Yeah. We keep coming up short on our weekly supply inventory checks. Guns and ammo, mostly. Not the kind of things you like to see go missing.
0DI0017500	No witnesses yet. I've got my money on Sergeant Contreras, who's supposed to be in charge of distribution, the little weasel.
0DI0017501	But he's too slick to let anyone catch him doing it. We've searched his possessions a dozen times. Nothing.
0DI0017503	Good. The more guns you can recover, the more I'll be able to use to shoot Contreras for being inept.
0DI0017504	I like the way you think. Have I said that yet?
0DI0017505	Problem is that the NCR frowns on using that sort of tactic. There are some restrictions still in place from President Tandi's administration.
0DI0017506	But here's my favorite thing about you - you're not in the NCR. Plus, for all this guy knows, you're completely insane. That's a winning combination.
0DI0017507	Don't have anything like that. Sounds nice. Like the kind of thing I'd want to take home and use on my husband.
0DI0017508	But even if we did, I don't know that I'd be comfortable using it. If there's any risk of overdose, it's not worth it. Asshole's too valuable.
0DI0017509	Yes, and one time I thought I saw a tear when I told him his uniform was unflattering. But I think he just got some dust in his eye.
0DI0017510	That's the spirit. Okay, I'll go in and have a word with him. Then I'll call you in.
0DI0017511	You sure? You're missing out. Well, you're always welcome, if you should change your mind.
0DI0017512	Word around the base is he'd been going regularly to visit a hooker named Dazzle at Gomorrah. That's a casino on the Strip. Classy place.
0DI0017513	His belongings are up in the barracks in the concourse building. First bunk on your left if you're facing in from the center.
0DI0017514	I haven't had a chance to look through his things yet, so that might be a good place to begin.
0DI0017515	Caesar's eyes truly are everywhere. And here I thought they'd send assassins instead. Did the officer send you?
0DI0017516	[?] You're nothing. You're some inept mercenary the NCR is paying to supplement its own incompetent soldiers.
0DI0017517	[?] What? No! Listen, Caesar's secrets are safe with me. I stayed alive because Caesar would've wanted it. I'm useless to him dead.
0DI0017518	[?] You must have some reason to be in your line of work. Tell me, what did the Legion do to you?
0DI0017519	Did we enslave your children? Slaughter your family before your eyes to teach you a lesson?
0DI0017520	Whatever it was, I hope I was there to give the order.
0DI0017521	[FAILED] I must admit that a conversation with an imbecile may be far worse than the kind of torture I was anticipating.
0DI0017522	But somehow I think I'll manage.
0DI0017523	Of course, of course. All you had to do was ask. I'll tell you everything I know.
0DI0017524	Let's see. I know that you're a brainless cretin. I know that you're wasting your time. I know the lieutenant is going to be disappointed in you.
0DI0017525	And I know that by this time next month the streets of New Vegas will be decorated with the decaying heads of NCR soldiers.
0DI0017526	Is there anything else you wanted to know?
0DI0017527	I can take anything you've got.
0DI0017528	I don't know what name he goes by here. But I saw him when they brought me in, and I recognized him.
0DI0017529	When I saw him last it was ages ago. He was training to be an agent of Caesar's frumentarii. Apparently he passed the trials.
0DI0017530	And what a job he's done, to achieve such a rank. I have no doubt he'll deliver a crippling blow to the NCR while he's here. Perhaps many.
0DI0017531	I have heard that he has been radioing high-level NCR intelligence back to Caesar's camp virtually every night.
0DI0017532	But never mind that now. We don't have much time. If you can get me a weapon, the rest will be easy.
0DI0017533	In the hall outside, they still have my possessions in a locker. There's a gun in there that should be small enough to get past the lieutenant.
0DI0017534	When she comes back, I want you to go and get it for me. Simple enough?
0DI0017535	See, you're practically stealing caps from me, this work is so easy.
0DI0017536	There's one more job. It's a little more complicated, but I think you're up to it.
0DI0017537	I need to get some stuff sorted around. Gonna take me a day or two, so just stop back in a few days.
0DI0017538	Well, I'm not. Come back tomorrow and the stuff will be ready to transport.
0DI0017539	All right, I need you to pass something off to a merchant. The guy's name is Price. The exchange goes down at Miguel's Pawn Shop in Westside.
0DI0017540	This next bit is very important. He's paranoid. Maybe a little schizo. You have to identify yourself with a passcode or he'll shoot you right there.
0DI0017541	Just tell him you're looking for some betting advice. Then he'll say the surest move is to bet on the house.
0DI0017542	Be sure you do.
0DI0017543	If you get this last job done, full access to my stash. At a discount, even. Just because I like you.
0DI0017544	Get moving, watch out for raiders, and do not lose that package. Good Luck.
0DI0017545	To be frank, I have no idea. I leave the fighting to Colonel Hsu, and I expect him to leave the science to me.
0DI0017546	Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have.
0DI0017547	Keely. Again. Do you... do you understand what that rotting old bitch has done?! Thousands of people, mass starvation. We had a chance to avoid that.
0DI0017548	And I had a chance to prove that scientists could be more than a bunch of useless idealists. But Keely doesn't give a goddamn about that, does she?
0DI0017549	You're an accomplice in this. Keely is one old woman - you could have easily stopped her. You're either incompetent, or you were on her side.
0DI0017550	Now get out of this office. Get out!
0DI0017551	If you're unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
0DI0017552	In the future, I'm sure you'll consider your agreements and contracts more carefully. Now, here is the sum we agreed to.
0DI0017553	Best of luck to you. Not that you'll need it. You seem like a reasonably competent person...
0DI0017554	Williams has a tendency to feel before she thinks. Not in the lab. But everywhere else.
0DI0017555	That might be forgivable if she kept her concerns to herself. But she doesn't. Not in front of her peers, not even with contractors like yourself.
0DI0017556	That kind of behavior can undermine morale. She convinced my last contractor to quit. Same way she tried with you.
0DI0017557	Probably didn't tell you that, did she?
0DI0017558	No, I... no. The OSI hasn't been around for very long. I received my training elsewhere.
0DI0017559	Before the bombs, I might have studied at any number of colleges, universities. They gave a man a chance to advance himself... or so I've heard.
0DI0017560	But after the bombs - until a few years ago - anyone with half a brain had one choice. The Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0017561	Didn't matter if you agreed with them or not. You either played along or you were turned away.
0DI0017562	Knowledge for knowledge sake. A society of equals. They purport to be intelligent people, and then they spout this old-world dogma.
0DI0017563	[SUCCEEDED] Exactly right. Imagine what the Followers could have accomplished if they were properly motivated... if they had a unified purpose!
0DI0017564	Those of us who founded the OSI... we wanted to put our knowledge to work. And we have, to some degree.
0DI0017565	But the execs at OSI Central... they're still bound to the old ideas. Society of equals, and all that. There's still too little direction.
0DI0017566	If I can make real breakthroughs here... show the President what can be done when junior researchers are kept in line... kept focused on task...
0DI0017567	Who knows. Maybe I'll be sitting in OSI Central, in a few years time. And there'll be no more coddling of "free spirits" like our friend, Williams.
0DI0017568	[FAILED] That was years ago. No point in discussing it. We have more practical concerns... and more important things to talk about.
0DI0017569	Destroyed. Really. I find that hard to believe. More likely, you failed to locate the proper server.
0DI0017570	We? We?! You were a part of this? After we made an explicit agreement, you have the fucking gall to destroy priceless scientific data?
0DI0017571	The authorities are going to hear about this. They're going to know your name, they're going to know your goddamn face.
0DI0017572	Keely. It was Keely, wasn't it? Who else would fail to give a fuck that thousands of people are going to starve, without that data?
0DI0017573	And for what? So Keely can wage her selfish little war against me and the OSI.
0DI0017574	If the data's intact, you'll get your reward. I gave my word. I'm not the kind of wasteland savage you're used to dealing with.
0DI0017575	I'm sorry you feel that way. But we both came out ahead, so... no harm done, I hope.
0DI0017576	I don't see how that's relevant. The dangers of the Vault were your business, not mine. The only question is whether the data is still intact.
0DI0017577	Was it? I'm sure I made it very clear... the hazards of the job were your business, not mine. The important question is whether this data is intact.
0DI0017578	Williams is an admirable researcher. If she wasn't, I'd have terminated her contract, and she'd be begging for work from my former employers.
0DI0017579	Okay, but make it quick.
0DI0017580	Tell me why I should tell you anything. I don't know you.
0DI0017581	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, my apologies sir. I was sent here by Colonel Hsu to exterminate Motor-Runner, the leader of the Fiends.
0DI0017582	[FAILED] Your curiosity and a few caps will get you a rat on a stick, but it won't get you fuck all from me.
0DI0017583	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing. Maybe you'll brave up and do the right thing. Good luck.
0DI0017584	Well, take this goddamn key anyways. It'll get you into the Maintenance Wing.
0DI0017585	Goddammit! Is there nothing I can't fuck up here? I've lost the goddamn key!
0DI0017586	That's it. I'm heading for McCarran. Good luck to you.
0DI0017587	'Cause it's clean. The crops taste funny if you don't use clean water, but the NCR won't give us any and it's too expensive to buy.
0DI0017588	Oh no! Miss Tabitha is hurt! Someone, get a doctor!
0DI0017589	There, there Miss Tabitha. It's going to be all right.
0DI0017590	Miss Tabitha, your distinct lack of respiration is quite worrisome.
0DI0017591	That's good, Miss Tabitha. It's important that you don't move. You might aggravate your injury.
0DI0017592	Where is that doctor?
0DI0017593	Don't worry, Miss Tabitha, I'll keep you warm with my exhaust.
0DI0017594	I do hope the doctor doesn't get lost on the way up here.
0DI0017595	Not big on reading nametags, huh? That's okay, my name is long and difficult to pronounce. Ready for it?
0DI0017596	It's Boyd. Lieutenant Boyd to my friends. Colonel Hsu has me handling the policing duties for the base.
0DI0017597	I've told him he could make my job a whole lot easier if he would just let me shoot anyone who talks back to me, but you know how colonels can be.
0DI0017598	No, I've got this one. I don't think he's going to have much information of value, so I'm just tormenting him for fun. Thanks, though.
0DI0017599	Yeah, so far this has gone exactly as expected - poorly. But with the work you've done for NCR already, you might be just what I've been looking for.
0DI0017600	We captured an honest-to-God centurion of Caesar's Legion recently.
0DI0017601	Sorry, this is state business, what I'm working on. You'd have to do a lot more NCR ass-kissing before they'd let you help me with this one.
0DI0017602	Now what kind of MP would I be if I didn't notice anything suspicious?
0DI0017603	I've had soldiers go AWOL, break-ins, thefts, you name it.
0DI0017604	For you? Just the basics. Come back when you're a little more seasoned and maybe we could talk about other options.
0DI0017605	Bad business if someone hurts themselves using your products, you know? Gets all kinds of unwanted attention.
0DI0017606	Are you implying I have some kind of secret under-the-table stash I only offer to certain clients? Because that could get a man in trouble.
0DI0017607	What do you need then?
0DI0017608	Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
0DI0017609	If you're willing to do a little legwork for me, I could give you access to my stash and at a discount.
0DI0017610	Many of these items aren't available in the NCR, and you'll be hard-pressed to find them at a better price anywhere else.
0DI0017611	[SUCCEEDED] Now you're talking my language. I do have an expanded inventory for people I can trust.
0DI0017614	[FAILED] I don't think so. This is what I've got. Take it or leave it.
0DI0017619	I never said you were. You've been speaking to Williams, haven't you?
0DI0017620	Fair enough. Begging your pardon, but this is beginning to feel like an interrogation.
0DI0017621	All right. I'll take you at your word. Williams didn't say anything at all, you just came to this conclusion on your own.
0DI0017622	None at all. Informed speculation on my part. Williams is very good at her job, so it remains secure... despite her best efforts.
0DI0017623	No, you aren't the first person I've sent to the Vault. I'm sorry that I neglected to tell you, but I don't see how it makes any difference.
0DI0017624	Yes. With the assistance of my team, of course.
0DI0017625	Not yet. But our government understands the value of proactive thought. Our studies project an imbalance between production and consumption.
0DI0017626	Or, for a layman such as yourself - not enough food, too many mouths to feed. Mass starvation. In a decade or so.
0DI0017627	Directly? No. But we attempt to maximize its output. You have no idea how difficult it is to provide power to an entire nation.
0DI0017628	Fortunately, we also have the HELIOS One facility. One of our external contractors recently got the station up and running.
0DI0017630	We were starting to bring the HELIOS One facility online, as well. That might have increased our power output by half.
0DI0017631	But some wasteland scum managed to sabotage the array. Probably got quite a laugh at our expense. Very funny indeed.
0DI0017632	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that he'd ever show his face in a place like this.
0DI0017635	I'd pay a year's salary for a crack at that maniac. Not that she'd ever show her face in a place like this.
0DI0017636	Our efforts at HELIOS One held a great deal of promise, until some drifter blew in from the waste and managed to reroute the power.
0DI0017637	As to where the power is going... who knows. Can you imagine? A drifter outsmarting professional scientists? Only in New Vegas.
0DI0017638	We'd hoped that HELIOS One would boost power to McCarran and Vegas. Then some damned crusader routed all the power to Freeside.
0DI0017639	I also have high hopes for our HELIOS One facility. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the two "scientists" who are working there.
0DI0017640	So far, they've only managed to achieve one percent power output. I'd send help, if I could spare the personnel.
0DI0017641	His name was something like... "Exceptional" or "Marvelous" or...
0DI0017642	That's the trouble with this wasteland - too many damned variables. No one can account for them all.
0DI0017643	Yes! That was it, exactly.
0DI0017644	I... see. Of course you did.
0DI0017645	I'd have to consult my records. Eight? Ten? Your point is what?
0DI0017646	You want certainty? You'll never find it... especially not in the pursuit of science.
0DI0017647	Do whatever you think is best. You're under no obligations. If you want the caps, you'll complete the job. Simple.
0DI0017648	Take my advice. Forget about Williams. She's a talented researcher, but she doesn't understand people, and she can't see the big picture.
0DI0017649	Now, I know your time is valuable, so I won't waste any more of it. Feel free to show yourself out...
0DI0017650	[SUCCEEDED] All right. I'll admit that it's been difficult to find anyone willing to enter the Vault. And I'd rather get the data sooner than later.
0DI0017651	You have a deal. I'll double your reward, if you bring me the data. But this is as high as my budget will allow.
0DI0017652	I have no evidence that they're dead. A thousand things could have happened between here and the Vault.
0DI0017653	They could have changed their minds and walked away. I wouldn't be much of a scientist if I leapt to conclusions without proof.
0DI0017654	[FAILED] No. Our agreement was very specific. You bring me the data, I give you a reward.
0DI0017655	We never discussed the dangers. That's your business, not mine. If you can't provide the data, I'm sure I'll find someone who can.
0DI0017656	How's it look, doc?
0DI0017657	What are you looking to find out?
0DI0017658	Make yourself scarce. If you get yourself in trouble, I'm not going to cover your back.
0DI0017659	Why I'm here is my business. If you don't have a question for me then get lost.
0DI0017660	The Fiends killed everyone living here, and now they are squatting in their home.
0DI0017661	This was Vault 3, but I'm sure you can tell that by all the 3s all over the damn place. Now it is a drug den for the goddamn Fiends.
0DI0017662	The Fiends are degenerate drug addicts who kill and rape for fun, basically. They're human garbage - though I'm not sure about the human part.
0DI0017663	You can go back to old Hsu and tell him that the mission will be completed. I just need a couple more days.
0DI0017664	Is that right? And what sort of support, exactly, is it that you have to offer?
0DI0017665	Good idea. Try not to get hurt out there.
0DI0017666	Yeah? Nice thought, but that's not my primary mission. If you want to go it solo, more power to you.
0DI0017667	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight. Here, take the key...
0DI0017668	Here, take this key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner a whole easier. I'll follow you down.
0DI0017669	[SUCCEEDED] I guess you're right. I won't be able to move fast, but I can more than hold my own in a firefight.
0DI0017671	Well, this whole thing's improvised, and now we'll have to improvise some more and find another way through. I'll follow you down.
0DI0017672	[FAILED] Thanks for the offer - but the answer is no. Once my leg is healed up, I'll take care of Motor-Runner easily enough.
0DI0017673	Bad idea on all sorts of levels. Leave it to the professionals, kid.
0DI0017674	What's it look like? I caught one in the leg. I killed a dozen of those degenerates sneaking my way in... but one got a drop on me.
0DI0017675	I holed up in here after I killed that one. They're too stupid to unlock the doors, so I knew they'd figure whoever attacked had just taken off.
0DI0017676	I just need day or two and then I'll take out Motor-Runner myself. I even got the key to his Maintenance Wing. Situation's under control.
0DI0017677	[SUCCEEDED] Goddammit. I know. Was just hoping that, uh...
0DI0017678	Are you trained as a doctor? Can you fix my leg?
0DI0017679	[FAILED] The slug went straight through. I'm a goddamned NCR ranger, all right? I'm trained in first aid!
0DI0017680	Goddammit. Fine. I'll head back. Are you saying you'll handle Motor-Runner yourself?
0DI0017681	What are we waiting for? I've got a high-value target to kill!
0DI0017682	Thanks, doc. The Fiends have got a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Here's hoping a doctor's bag is in the mix.
0DI0017683	All right. Let me give you the key to the Maintenance Wing...
0DI0017685	I don't know what to say. You'll have to find your own way to get at that sick bastard. Hope to see you back at McCarran.
0DI0017686	Here, take this. It's the key to the Maintenance Wing. Should make getting to Motor-Runner that much easier. Good luck.
0DI0017687	Yeah? Well, there's a ton of pharmaceuticals out there. Maybe you can find one and bring it back to me. It'd be a great help...
0DI0017688	You're getting ahead of yourself.
0DI0017689	Curtis? He's been in the NCR long before our conflict with the Legion. There's just no way...
0DI0017690	I hope you're mistaken, but somehow I don't think so. It'd explain a lot. This is much worse than anyone expected. There could be others, too.
0DI0017691	You've done everything that was asked of you. You have my personal thanks for this, and I'll make sure you receive the credit you deserve.
0DI0017692	I'll have Curtis taken into custody. If he lets himself be taken alive, that is.
0DI0017693	Curtis? Something's not right. He came to me today saying he was worried about the monorail. Had me put him in charge of the inspection crew.
0DI0017694	Listen, you've got to get to the monorail. If it's been sabotaged, we're completely crippled here. Go!
0DI0017695	Goddamn it! How could I have let this happen?
0DI0017696	Come back and see us again soon.
0DI0017697	Until next time!
0DI0017698	Glad to do it.
0DI0017699	The NCR fixed up the pipe network pretty good, and water merchants like me are allowed to have some of it to sell.
0DI0017700	If we have a water license, of course. Still, it beats the inconvenience of having to trek all the way to the lake to resupply.
0DI0017701	Heh, you've got moxy, buddy, but we don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. 100 caps should cover this trip into our territory.
0DI0017702	I like to think that we are Prisoners Of War that managed to escape before capture.
0DI0017703	I don't know how long it'll be before the Legion crosses the river, but sure as fuck I don't want to be wearing a NCR inform when they get here.
0DI0017704	We figured we'd make some money in New Vegas and then beat feet.
0DI0017705	Then we'd head north or something and take our caps to start up a ranch or something.
0DI0017706	Perhaps, but you won't be the one to collect!
0DI0017707	Our luck has gone south since we lost all of our money gambling in Vegas. We didn't go AWOL from duty to become raiders.
0DI0017708	But we've seen what the Legion does to people that survive their battles. We wanted to be gone before the fighting starts.
0DI0017709	And we heard there may be some safety up in New Canaan.
0DI0017710	Looks like we've got a wannabe hero on our hands, boys.
0DI0017711	No fucking way. We're deserters now, the NCR isn't going to throw us a ticker-tape parade for going home.
0DI0017712	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over 100 caps, or we start using you for target practice.
0DI0017713	[SUCCEEDED] Fuck, we lose again.
0DI0017714	We heard Primm was ripe for the picking, so figured we could come here and shakedown some of the suckers. We weren't expecting a sheriff here.
0DI0017715	We're just trying to put as many miles from NCR as we can, we don't want to be anywhere near New Vegas when the Legion crosses the river.
0DI0017716	[FAILED] I seriously doubt that. You've got about as much personality as a baked potato.
0DI0017717	I'm getting tired of your chatter. Hand over the caps, or we start using you for target practice.
0DI0017718	So be it. Perhaps your corpse will be better at coughing up the caps...
0DI0017719	Wonderful! Straight to it, then. Have you signed the release forms? No? Doesn't matter - we'll keep that to ourselves.
0DI0017720	Vault 22... where to begin...
0DI0017721	No, they wouldn't have briefed you, would they? Probably better that our junior fellows stay within the bounds of their pay grade, anyway.
0DI0017722	Wrong turn? Happens all the time. Do they give me a secretary? Of course not.
0DI0017723	Your concerns are perfectly understandable, but I assure you, they're entirely misplaced. We would never use a technology that wasn't fully tested.
0DI0017724	We aren't some motley band of Vault alchemists. We're with the government, for goodness sake. Have a little faith in us!
0DI0017725	[FAILED] If you are unhappy with the terms of our agreement, then consider this an object lesson.
0DI0017727	Of course, we're very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
0DI0017728	Ha ha! A mercenary, is that it? You won't be disappointed, I promise you. The Office of Science and Industry provides highly competitive benefits.
0DI0017729	And as an external contractor, your pay would be... rather more competitive than those of our regular employees.
0DI0017730	But we should keep that to ourselves, don't you think?
0DI0017731	So... how about I tell you what we need, and then you can tell me whether you're up to it? No pressure, of course.
0DI0017732	Skepticism can be forgiven. But I think you'll come around... if the reports I've heard are true.
0DI0017733	I'm very sorry to hear that. If you should change your mind, the offer will stand. As will the substantial reward...
0DI0017734	Naturally! Take all the time you need.
0DI0017735	I assure you, the OSI places considerable value upon our contractors. We will take good care of you, should you decide to accept our offer.
0DI0017736	Of course not! You're obviously a busy man. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
0DI0017737	Of course not! I can see you're a woman of consequence. But if life should... quiet down a bit... I'm certain we can find a place for you here.
0DI0017738	Imagine, if you will, the wasteland in bloom... vast fields of corn that grow from seeds and produce their bounty in the space of a month...
0DI0017739	...orchards of trees, their branches weighed halfway to the ground, hung with fat, ripe oranges. A harvest that could feed a city... or a nation.
0DI0017740	And all this... all this... requiring no more than a few of drops of precious water, and the efforts of only a handful of human farmers. Impossible?
0DI0017741	All right. Straight to the point. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
0DI0017742	Plants are spilling from their gate. No one tends them. No one waters them. Yet they multiply and spread in all directions.
0DI0017743	Find the reason for this miraculous growth, and I promise you, the OSI will see that you are generously compensated.
0DI0017744	A realist. We have that in common. A year ago, I'd have said the same.
0DI0017745	But what if I was to tell you that the wasteland can yield an endless bounty, and that the secret may lie a mere few miles from where we stand...
0DI0017746	We need only reach out and take it. And for that, I need you.
0DI0017747	Precisely. Science has proven that truth a thousand times over, but how many wasteland savages believe it? Present company excepted, of course.
0DI0017748	The bounty I described to you is no idle fantasy. It exists, in primitive form, only a few miles from where we stand.
0DI0017749	We need only reach out and unlock its secret. For that, the OSI needs you.
0DI0017750	Fair enough. My point is this. I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
0DI0017751	Good. No need to check in with the NCR authorities, I can authorize your payment from OSI accounts.
0DI0017752	Vaults typically contain a server room on a lower level, where they would have backed up their research data. A computer room, you understand?
0DI0017753	Download all the information on the central server to your Pip-Boy. And you'll be certain to bring me any notes or samples that you find, won't you?
0DI0017754	Very well. I hope you'll consider this an open offer from the OSI. Now, I'm sure your time is valuable, so unless there was anything else...
0DI0017755	Yes... goodbye.
0DI0017756	The Office of Science and Industry. That's a rather expansive topic. I could talk for hours, but I'm sure I'd bore you.
0DI0017757	Suffice to say, we are the leading edge of the NCR. Our work focuses on practical matters. Medicine, engineering, biology.
0DI0017758	The Dam, for instance. OSI routes its energy supply to our cities in the west. That's only one responsibility of this office.
0DI0017759	I thought it was a fairly straightforward assignment. It's a simple question of retrieving the data, which shouldn't prove overly challenging.
0DI0017760	Downloading the data will be handled by your Pip-Boy. You might think of yourself as a mere means of conveyance. No insult intended, of course.
0DI0017761	Oh? What might those be?
0DI0017762	Good! I thought I sensed a kindred soul in you, beneath the wasteland veneer.
0DI0017763	Isn't it? One directs one's efforts - or the efforts of others - toward a goal, and progress is made. It's a matter of incentives, nothing more.
0DI0017764	I believe that the inhabitants of Vault 22 unlocked the secrets of vegetative growth.
0DI0017765	[FAILED] No, I'm sure I won't require your services in the future. The OSI does not enter into long-term arrangements with its contractors.
0DI0017766	Of course, we're all very grateful for your efforts, and I'll make certain that you're credited in our final report. Good day to you.
0DI0017767	Wonderful! Excellent work! Let me see it... it'll take a moment to decode on my terminal...
0DI0017768	You won't keep me in suspense for long, I hope? Of course I can't authorize any payments until I have the data in hand...
0DI0017769	I think...  Williams' decryption algorithms seem to be working...
0DI0017770	Yes... here it is! The data is mostly uncorrupted. This will make the board of directors finally sit up and take notice...
0DI0017771	Here, then... as promised. An agreeable sum, payable upon delivery of the data. You've more than done your part.
0DI0017772	Didn't I? Did you encounter undue difficulties? Clearly not, or you wouldn't be standing here, would you?
0DI0017773	All that matters is whether the data is intact...
0DI0017774	I knew you were a reasonable person. Here you are... our agreed-upon sum.
0DI0017775	A pleasure working with you, really! I'll make certain that you're mentioned in the final report, you have my word on it.
0DI0017776	You want to renegotiate your contract. Mm. This is a very serious matter, you do understand that, don't you?
0DI0017777	I realize that one's word counts for little in the wasteland, but amongst civilized people, one doesn't just... demand more than one has agreed to.
0DI0017778	[SUCCEEDED] Now... wait a minute...
0DI0017779	[SUCCEEDED] You're saying that I didn't file the proper paperwork, is that it? I suppose you're an expert on NCR procedures?
0DI0017780	There's... there's no need to do anything rash. Naturally, OSI would be willing to negotiate for exclusive rights to that data.
0DI0017781	Here. Take these caps. That's all of my contracting budget, and it's yours.
0DI0017782	Now, I've... got to get back to work. I'm sure you understand. Exit's over there, you can show yourself out.
0DI0017783	Director of the entire OSI? Me? If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to plant seditious ideas in my head. Ha ha ha.
0DI0017784	No, I direct our eastern operations. I've been responsible for squeezing unprecedented levels of power from the Dam.
0DI0017785	I'm also confronting the problem of food production, in what little spare time I have. But I've found some promising leads.
0DI0017786	All right. Fair enough. No need to bring the military into this matter - it's between the two of us, after all.
0DI0017787	Hmm... you don't cook by any chance, do you? Farber's doing his best, but it's hard to manage an army with half my staff in line for the latrine.
0DI0017788	Honestly, we're fighting a lot of fires right now. The Fiends keep pressing their position from Vault 3.
0DI0017789	We've got the Legion breathing down our necks across the river. We actually took an officer alive last week, but so far he hasn't spoken a word.
0DI0017790	There are a lot of things I can't spare troops for right now.  If you can help us, we can definitely pay you for your work.
0DI0017791	Could be better, I'll say that much.
0DI0017792	We set up here with our sights set on annexing New Vegas. That's a lot of resources that could do a lot of good for us. But that hasn't happened.
0DI0017793	If anything, they annexed us. They rake in the profits from our soldiers and we're stuck protecting them from the Legion. Not exactly the plan.
0DI0017794	As in chem fiends. Biggest gang of raiders I've ever seen. Nothing like addiction to swell your numbers. Psychotic, and completely unpredictable.
0DI0017795	They've set up shop in Vault 3 to the west. Every day they attack our positions and my men repel them.
0DI0017796	But every day there's more of them and less of us. I sent one of my rangers after their leader to try and destabilize them. He didn't return.
0DI0017797	Hell of a thing, losing a ranger. You come to depend on them. And they come through for you so often, you forget it can happen.
0DI0017798	I have Lieutenant Boyd on that already, and she's excellent. But I think she's hit a wall.
0DI0017799	Talk to her, if you like. See if she has any use for you.
0DI0017800	Her office is right above mine, but I think she might be interrogating right now. So she'd be upstairs on the other side of the building.
0DI0017801	You? I think you've done enough.
0DI0017802	Hmm... Well, why not? Given your recent arrival, at least I can safely rule you out as the leak.
0DI0017803	I'd like to have absolute trust in my men, but that's just not practical right now. Go ahead and look into it. See what you find.
0DI0017804	Sure. I'm all ears.
0DI0017805	What? Who?
0DI0017806	No? What happened?
0DI0017807	Calm is what you have to be when people look to you. And it's all you can be when things are out of your hands.
0DI0017808	[SUCCEEDED] I'll believe it when I see it. You've got one shot, and you're on a tight leash. I'll be watching.
0DI0017809	[FAILED] Forget it. We have no use for you here.
0DI0017810	We don't have much to go on right now. Lately every raiding party in New Vegas seems to have a map of our troop movements.
0DI0017811	It derails everything. Supplies, reinforcements. And it'll only get worse, the longer we let it go on.
0DI0017812	Captain Curtis is heading up the investigation right now. He can fill you in.
0DI0017813	Crenshaw... I've met Crenshaw. At his disciplinary hearing. Still, this is hard to imagine - he was just a prankster.
0DI0017814	I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
0DI0017815	[SUCCEEDED] That's what the Legion calls their spies. I was afraid of this. Caesar's reach is longer than anybody guessed.
0DI0017816	If only we'd caught this sooner, before he got to the monorail...
0DI0017817	Still, this investigation has been valuable to us, and you deserve to be compensated for it.
0DI0017818	The NCR appreciates the work you've done. Will there be anything else?
0DI0017819	[FAILED] That's not exactly airtight.
0DI0017820	That doesn't implicate Crenshaw any more than it does anyone else.
0DI0017821	This isn't the resolution I was looking for when I assigned you to this.
0DI0017822	Given the dubious circumstances under which the confession took place, the NCR can't compensate you.
0DI0017823	Ordinarily I'd have to arrest you for this. But we can hardly afford to waste resources in the wake of all that's happened.
0DI0017824	I think your freedom is compensation enough for whatever it is you've done here, don't you?
0DI0017826	That Vault is a hornet's nest. If you have second thoughts, no one would think less of you for it. But if you can get him home, it'd mean a lot.
0DI0017827	Watch for civilians, too. The Fiends have been kidnapping locals. They just walk right into people's homes in the middle of the day and take them.
0DI0017828	But the man you're looking for is Bryce Anders. Anders was trying to find the leader, Motor-runner.
0DI0017829	You hear something like a chainsaw, you've found Motor-runner. Put a bullet in his head, and you'll have some new friends around here.
0DI0017830	So you convinced those NCR sons of bitches to take an interest, did you? Well, we need the help. I'll sign.
0DI0017831	Oh, I don't know anything, mister. I just think it, and then I don't.
0DI0017832	Oh, I don't know anything, ma'am. I just think it, and then I don't.
0DI0017833	I still have a job to do here. Some Mutants may have heard Tabitha's broadcasts and are headed here even as we speak.
0DI0017834	I'll remain and direct any who show up toward Jacobstown, where they'll be much better off.
0DI0017836	[FAILED] Invalid response! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
0DI0017839	Vegas is bleeding us dry. We're tossing caps at a hundred different problems, while Caesar bides his time and lets us wear ourselves out.
0DI0017840	This war is gonna bankrupt the NCR, unless we finish off the Legion fast and dirty.
0DI0017841	We shouldn't be perched up at the Dam - we ought to be crossing the Colorado and sticking a boot up Caesar's ass.
0DI0017842	So I hooked up with a couple other vets... bribed a Gun Runner...
0DI0017843	Now we're supplying grunts, mercs, and anybody else on our side. We don't make much... but at least we're saving lives.
0DI0017847	Hell, yes sir. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
0DI0017848	They mustered me out a year ago. Administrative discharge.
0DI0017849	Hell, yes ma'am. Well... not officially. Not anymore.
0DI0017851	Sure do. Lots of folk been coming out east, sorting through junk, looking for whatever they can sell.
0DI0017852	Times are tough back home. Too many people, not enough work. Unless you like shoveling brahmin shit.
0DI0017853	It means my C.O. was an asshole, and I told him to eat shit. He ordered me to flog a couple "deserters."
0DI0017854	Those kids didn't desert. They just got liquored up on the Strip and missed roll call.
0DI0017855	I don't know what else the brass expects... half these kids don't get more than two weeks of training before they ship 'em out here.
0DI0017856	Staff sergeant, Third Platoon, Bravo Company. I was at the Dam when the Legion hit us, three years back.
0DI0017857	That was a shitstorm, and don't let anybody tell you different. The brass try to play it down, but most of them were back at McCarran.
0DI0017858	Going home didn't feel right, not with those savages camped on the other side of the river, sharpening their knives.
0DI0017859	And I still get to see my old platoon when they pass through here... make sure the new C.O. is treating them right, and sneak them extra ammo.
0DI0017860	Anyway, I was always complaining about the standard issue gear. The new kids don't even get body armor, can you believe that?
0DI0017861	Heh. There's a sad story behind that. Marcus smashed it just fine, but while we were gone some Ghoul named Raul came along.
0DI0017862	Tabitha turned him into her personal mechanic. A slave, really. See, if I'd been standing down here, I could've warned him before it was too late.
0DI0017863	Good luck. We're going to need it.
0DI0017864	Yes, so try to stay out of sight, because they'll be coming this way.
0DI0017865	Whatever you need to do, be quick about it.
0DI0017866	[Rhonda] You're listening to Radio Free Utobitha, bringing truth to Utobithians 24 hours a day! Welcome!
0DI0017867	[Tabitha] I am in control here!
0DI0017868	[Rhonda] That was today's and every day's extra special guest, Best Friend Tabitha, supreme commander of Utobitha and Wearer of the True Eyes!
0DI0017869	[Tabitha] I still miss you, Rhonda. After all these years...
0DI0017870	[Rhonda] Also joining us from his locked cell is Raul Tejada, master mechanic who can be executed at any time! Hello, Raul. Or should that be "Hola?"
0DI0017871	[Raul] Uh, either one works.
0DI0017872	[Tabitha] Today you die, Raul! I command it!
0DI0017873	[Rhonda] Ooooh, Raul. Supreme commander Tabitha says you die today. Any reaction?
0DI0017874	[Raul] I going to obey supreme Tabitha, claro, whatever she say. Just I feel so bad I die before I fix her special robot.
0DI0017875	[Silence.]
0DI0017876	[Tabitha] <Growls in frustration.>
0DI0017877	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this musical interlude! Enjoy!
0DI0017878	[Rhonda] You're listening to UNC - the Utobithian News Channel - with breaking news!
0DI0017879	[Rhonda] The execution of master mechanic Raul Tajeda has again been commuted for a period of 24 hours to allow time for important repairs.
0DI0017880	[Tabitha] <snarling> This time you will get it done, Raul!
0DI0017881	[Rhonda] Joining us from his cell to comment on the situation is Raul Tejada. Raul?
0DI0017882	[Raul] Hi, Tab - <catches himself> Rhonda.
0DI0017883	[Rhonda] What's your take on the situation?
0DI0017884	[Raul] All I want is to make that special robot work again, you know? I give it my best.
0DI0017885	[Rhonda] We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor during which Raul will contemplate how lucky he is to be alive.
0DI0017886	[Tabitha] Are you tired of getting chased because you're bigger than humans, and scaring them?
0DI0017887	[Tabitha] Did you kill some and they overreacted? Are two-head-bear people shooting at you, and battle cattle mooing? Beware the battle cattle...
0DI0017888	[Rhonda]<whispering a line prompt> "Leave the fear behind."
0DI0017889	[Tabitha] Leave the Fear Behind. Meet at the Mountain Top! Enjoy life in a state of Utobitha - Free, Safe, Secure!
0DI0017890	[Rhonda] <rushing sotto voce like disclaimers at the end of prescription ads> Freedom limited to following the commands of Best Friend Tabitha...
0DI0017891	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Safety not guaranteed against siege or assault by two-head-bear people or battle cattles.
0DI0017892	[Rhonda] <Cont.> Many infractions are punishable by death, no allowances for dumb-dumb "misunderstandings".
0DI0017893	[Tabitha] Utobitha! Come feel the difference!
0DI0017894	[Rhonda] Welcome back, Utobitha. It's time!
0DI0017895	[Tabitha] Time for what, Rhonda?
0DI0017896	[Rhonda] <sing-song> True Eye Seeing Time!
0DI0017897	[Applause track.]
0DI0017898	[Rhonda] I see that you're already wearing the True Eyes, Best Friend Tabitha, along with your head of True Hair. What do you see?
0DI0017899	[Tabitha] Uh... I see Neil...
0DI0017900	[Rhonda] First-generation Neil from down the mountain? And what is he up to? 
0DI0017901	[Tabitha] Standing outside his shack down there.
0DI0017902	[Rhonda] In the same spot as before, or has he moved?
0DI0017903	[Tabitha] A little.
0DI0017904	[Rhonda] Wow! It must be so exciting to see and know all. What a powerful reminder of your ultimate authority and power for our listeners!
0DI0017905	[Tabitha] I see Moe...
0DI0017906	[Rhonda] Moe, the Centaur? Favorite Centaur Moe? What's he up to?
0DI0017907	[Tabitha] Licking the gate. Wants out of the pen.
0DI0017908	[Rhonda] Now, I'm almost afraid to ask, but do you see any - you know - threats out there?
0DI0017909	[Tabitha] Threats all around us... converging... like a noose, tightening! Two-head-bear people astride battle cattles!
0DI0017910	[Rhonda] <unnerved> Not the dreaded battle cattle training to hunt mutants?
0DI0017911	[Rhonda] <calmer> Would it be going too far to say that your gift of True Eyesight is the only thing saving our community from annihilation?
0DI0017912	[Rhonda] Because I think it's so important for everyone - even the dumb-dumbs - how impossible it is to sneak up on us! More after this!
0DI0017913	[Rhonda] Welcome back, Utobitha. I have with me Best Friend Tabitha, who has something important she'd like to share.
0DI0017914	[Tabitha] Well Rhonda, I'm a little concerned about the number of humans that keep coming to Black Mountain.
0DI0017915	[Rhonda] Humans? Here? Why do you think they'd do that?
0DI0017916	[Tabitha] Honestly, I think they're a little jealous of the ideal society we've built here, Rhonda. And I can't blame them.
0DI0017917	[Tabitha] We have everything we need here. Food, shelter, safety, entertainment. It really is a paradise.
0DI0017918	[Rhonda] There's no arguing with the truth, is there?
0DI0017919	[Tabitha] But humans need to be aware that Black Mountain is no place for them. In fact, it's even dangerous for them here.
0DI0017920	[Rhonda] Why is that?
0DI0017921	[Tabitha] First of all, there's the radiation. That warm, peaceful glow that we all know and love doesn't have the same effect on humans.
0DI0017922	[Tabitha] You see, humans are weak, and have an inherent defect that causes them to fall apart when exposed to radiation.
0DI0017923	[Rhonda] That sounds terrible! How do they stand it? Radiation's, like, everywhere!
0DI0017924	[Tabitha] I know. They truly have a hard lot in life. Which may explain why they're so irritable all the time.
0DI0017925	[Rhonda] I don't know about you, Utobitha, but my eyes have really been opened. We'll be back after some music!
0DI0017926	Hello, please remember closing time is at 5 PM. Please make your way toward an exit.
0DI0017927	The REPCONN museum is now closed. Visitors are required to leave the premises.
0DI0017928	Now these colorful fellows behind me are REPCONN's earliest... experiments in flight. Feel free to read the plaques and learn, Rocketeers!
0DI0017929	Now for the highlight of our tour! Due to a generous donation from RobCo, this next exhibit showcases the wondrous world of - robots!
0DI0017930	Around you are the incredible Eyebot, the fearsome Sentry Bot, and the always-helpful Mr. Handy. That helpfulness runs through our whole line!
0DI0017931	This is the final stop on our tour. This model of our solar system is a small example of where the partnership between RobCo and REPCONN hopes to go.
0DI0017932	See those little rockets zipping about? They are manned by robots, tirelessly looking for resources to mine on planets beyond our own.
0DI0017933	And that's it for our tour today, Rocketeers - RobCo and its tiny partner REPCONN thank you! Any further questions, please, feel free to ask.
0DI0017934	The road is a series of switchbacks up to the peak. There are three blockades, plus patrols. Sneaking past them would be... difficult.
0DI0017935	Just before the peak is a kind of shanty village. More second-gens there. And then there's Tabitha's compound - heavily guarded by her Nightkin.
0DI0017938	[SUCCEEDED] Help would improve the odds. Help might just make the difference...
0DI0017939	All right, if you're good enough at what you do to meet me in the village up near the peak, we can talk further.
0DI0017940	I'll have a plan by the time I see you - if I see you. Good luck. It's going to be a lot harder for you to get up there than it will be for me.
0DI0017941	[FAILED] Hmm. While your enthusiasm is... admirable, I think I'd best stay here so I can warn other travelers.
0DI0017942	For years, Black Mountain was a peaceful community. Its leader, Marcus, broadcast an invitation to Mutants throughout the wasteland.
0DI0017943	That's how I found Black Mountain. So did others, most of them second generation Mutants. Marcus welcomed everyone - that was his mistake.
0DI0017944	The community ended up being mostly second gen - not very bright, but easy to influence. Fine, until the Nightkin came along, led by Tabitha...
0DI0017945	In a week she had most of the second-gens thinking she was some kind of prophet - and that she should be broadcasting her "truth," not Marcus.
0DI0017946	Marcus saw what was coming and decided to leave before things got out of hand. He smashed the radio and left to found Jacobstown.
0DI0017947	The opposite of Black Mountain! A stable community of Mutants, mostly, led by a mentally stable leader.
0DI0017948	Humans are welcome there, so long as they behave themselves. Look northwest of Red Rock Canyon if you want to find it.
0DI0017949	Yes... And it's not something I care to discuss with one of your kind.
0DI0017950	If you have some insatiable curiosity about the matter, talk to Marcus in Jacobstown. He's more patient with such questions than I am.
0DI0017951	The Nightkin are vicious in combat, and that's if you see them coming. Most don't.
0DI0017952	They were created to be soldiers, and given devices to camouflage them in battle. Unfortunately, the devices drove most of them mad over time.
0DI0017953	They spend most of their time at the top of the mountain, but patrol the roads after dark as well. You'd do well to avoid the mountain at night.
0DI0017954	Marcus sent me here a couple of months ago to check on Black Mountain. I suppose you could say I came here as a spy.
0DI0017955	But with no signs of Tabitha's weakening, and none of the second-gens ready to revolt or to come to Jacobstown, there wasn't much I could do.
0DI0017956	Down here, on the other hand, I've saved a dozen Mutants from heading up the mountain. It's not much, but it's something.
0DI0017957	I have my own reasons to stay away from Jacobstown for a while - reasons we won't be discussing - so I've stayed here.
0DI0017958	Keep saying things like that, and I won't be so friendly. Not every Super Mutant is a brain-damaged brute.
0DI0017959	Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans - and the rest don't really have any choice in the matter, do they?
0DI0017960	Yes, that's exactly what I'm telling you to do. Move on.
0DI0017961	And none taken... since you apologized.
0DI0017962	Of course. Sorry I bothered you. Enjoy your travels.
0DI0017963	Not all Super Mutants were created equal. Or at the same time, or for the same purpose.
0DI0017964	The first generation tends to be smarter, stronger, and... more civilized, I suppose you could say, than the ones made later, save the Nightkin.
0DI0017965	Voice 1: She can't do this.
0DI0017966	Voice 2: It's done. We're done.
0DI0017967	Voice 1: Nothing's done.
0DI0017968	Voice 2: She's got the authority. The only thing she can't do is change her own fate.
0DI0017969	Nothing says she can't change the selection process for future overseers.
0DI0017970	Voice 1: I say she can't.
0DI0017971	Voice 2: You shouldn't have toyed with her like that, Roy.
0DI0017972	Voice 1: We still have the majority.
0DI0017973	Voice 2: We don't vote for anything anymore.
0DI0017974	Voice 1: I'm not talking about voting.
0DI0017975	Voice 2: What, then? You want to have a sit-in? A hunger strike?
0DI0017976	Voice 1: Not exactly.
0DI0017977	Voice 2: Maybe march into her office with torches and pitchforks?
0DI0017978	Voice 1: Yes.
0DI0017979	Voice 2: Come on.
0DI0017980	Voice 1: I mean it.
0DI0017981	Voice 2: What, start a revolution?
0DI0017982	Voice 1: Laws don't outlast their governments.
0DI0017983	Voice 2: Roy, all we have to do is wait until someone from Justice Bloc gets picked for overseer. Then we have them change the law back.
0DI0017984	Voice 1: There won't be any blocs after the new overseer is picked tomorrow. Everyone's going to move on.
0DI0017985	By the time we've reformed, who knows if we'll still be in the majority.
0DI0017986	Voice 2: We can hold the bloc together.
0DI0017987	Voice 1: You don't know that. Besides, what if the computer picks you? What if it picks me?
0DI0017988	Voice 2: And your solution is to start shooting?
0DI0017989	Voice 1: Not if we don't have to. Look, we arm up. We go to the lower floors, take some strategic targets. Power, food, water.
0DI0017990	Just until she turns authority over to us.
0DI0017991	Voice 2: The other blocs won't support it. They're tired of us having the power.
0DI0017992	Voice 1: We have the majority. We don't need them.
0DI0017993	Voice 2: This isn't a vote, Roy. They'll fight back.
0DI0017994	Voice 1: They've never had the nerve.
0DI0017995	Voice 2: Hell of a way to test it.
0DI0017996	Voice 1: Are we really gonna do this? It's open. We could just leave.
0DI0017997	Voice 2: I couldn't. Not after that.
0DI0017998	Voice 3: We don't deserve to leave.
0DI0017999	Voice 4: "A shining example." That's what it called us.
0DI0018000	Voice 1: But we were! We did what we were supposed to.
0DI0018001	Voice 5: Not by a long shot.
0DI0018002	Voice 1: Anybody would've done what we did.
0DI0018003	Voice 2: You ask me, that's exactly the problem. Now let's get on with this.
0DI0018004	Voice 3: I'll go first.
0DI0018005	Voice 1: Wait. Wait. People should know what happened. They could learn from it.
0DI0018006	Voice 5: If there's anyone out there at all, I hope they never have to find out. Ready, Harry?
0DI0018007	Voice 3: Yeah.
0DI0018008	Voice 1: No no no, wait!
0DI0018009	<Four gunshots in succession>
0DI0018010	Voice 1: <Whimpers>
0DI0018011	<Sound of a pistol dropping to the floor>
0DI0018012	Hello. Could you please direct me to mistress Tabitha?
0DI0018013	I wonder what mistress Tabitha has been doing with herself during my convalescence.
0DI0018014	It is so good to be traveling with mistress Tabitha again!
0DI0018015	Nevertheless, I must find her, so I'll just tag along with you for a bit until I pick up her trail.
0DI0018016	It pleases me to see you, mistress. I owe my functional state to this human here.
0DI0018017	Thank you very much. My internal clock says it's been 6 years, 52 days, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds since I last spoke to her.
0DI0018018	I hope she hasn't gotten lonely.
0DI0018019	Why do I even bother? Go play with something shiny, dumb dumb.
0DI0018020	Why thank you! It's always gratifying to talk to one's fans. Hold on, I have something I need to do for a second.
0DI0018021	Gah, stupid dumb dumbs have the attention span of a gnat.
0DI0018022	[SUCCEEDED] I am supreme commander Best Friend Tabitha! Neil is nothing! You are all traitors! I sentence all dumb-dumbs to death!
0DI0018023	[SUCCEEDED] A dumb-dumb revolt, you say? Then I sentence all dumb-dumbs to death!
0DI0018024	[FAILED] Hello. Was that supposed to sound like a dumb-dumb? Because they sound dumber than that. They sound like this: "Duuuuuh."
0DI0018025	Excuse me just a moment, would you?
0DI0018028	You've interrupted my broadcast, dumb-dumb - so there had better be a good reason! What is it?
0DI0018029	R- Rhonda? Is that you?
0DI0018030	I don't know... it's been so long since I lost Rhonda, that I'm not sure...
0DI0018033	We don't take kindly to tourists on our turf. You're gonna need to pay a fine if you want to leave in one piece. 100 caps should cover it.
0DI0018034	Thanks.  We're leaving now, we don't want no more trouble.
0DI0018035	Alright, since you look new and didn't know better, we'll cut you some slack.  50 caps.
0DI0018036	That's alright, we'll take what we can from your body before the law shows up.
0DI0018037	Thanks, Let's get out of here boys.
0DI0018038	All right, I know you can hear me, so listen up. There's five of us left. Five. Out of... I don't know how many.
0DI0018039	So... it's over. We've talked and it's over. We're not going to send anybody to die anymore.
0DI0018040	So shut off our water or gas us or do whatever it is you're programmed to do. But we're done listening to you.
0DI0018041	Congratulations, citizens of Vault 11! You have made the decision not to sacrifice one of your own.
0DI0018042	You can walk with your head held high knowing that your commitment to human life is a shining example to us all.
0DI0018043	And to make that feeling of pride even sweeter, I have some exciting news.
0DI0018044	Despite what you were led to believe, the population of Vault 11 is not going to be exterminated for its disobedience.
0DI0018045	Instead, the mechanism to open the main vault door has now been enabled, and you can come and go at your leisure.
0DI0018046	But not so fast! Be sure to check with your overseer to find out if it's safe to leave. Here at Vault-Tec, your safety is our number one priority.
0DI0018047	Not much to tell. A brahmin or two loaded up with weapons, and a whole mess of well-armed guards to make sure it ends up where it's supposed to.
0DI0018048	One nifty bit, though. The gun cases are rigged to explode. So trying to loot one of our caravans doesn't do much good.
0DI0018049	And that's how the NCR stays equipped. The only thing we don't bring in is energy weapons.
0DI0018050	We used to. But every caravan carrying them was getting ambushed and wiped out. By someone sophisticated enough to know which was which.
0DI0018051	We think it was the Brotherhood of Steel - those crazies always go hard for energy weapons. But the NCR would rather pretend they killed all of them.
0DI0018052	Still plenty of other problems keeping the 15 shut down, though. Thanks for playing.
0DI0018053	That'll help. Still plenty of problems out that way, though.
0DI0018054	You took out a Deathclaw nest? Either you're lying, or you're tougher than you look.
0DI0018055	Still plenty of troubles out that way, though. Thanks for playing.
0DI0018056	That's impressive - if you're telling the truth.
0DI0018057	Still, it'll take some time for routes to readjust. I expect I'll be working from here for the foreseeable future.
0DI0018058	Oh, you could. You just don't want to.
0DI0018059	I understand. Sorry to be a bother.
0DI0018060	But... Of course. It's all right. Thank you.
0DI0018061	Thank you so much! I'm so hungry!
0DI0018062	Sorry I had to bother you. I've... well, I've lost everything.
0DI0018063	You're very kind. I wish... well, I'll just thank you and leave you be.
0DI0018064	Let me take off my medicine...
0DI0018065	Bull and Bear over the Dam, at each other's throats... but a light from Vegas? Ball spinning on the wheel, more than two at the table, placing bets.
0DI0018066	All lose in different ways, a dam of corpses, towns of corpses, scattered across the sand. But whose, in what shares? Even the dealer doesn't know.
0DI0018067	Forecast: A rain of blood will flood the desert and not purify it.
0DI0018068	Bleh. Thinking about Everywhere always makes me feel a little sick...
0DI0018069	I thought you'd say that.
0DI0018070	Okay. Let me take off my medicine...
0DI0018071	Your face does the thinking - two to the skull, yet one gets up. Odds are against you... but they're just numbers after the two-to-one.
0DI0018072	You're playing the hand you've been dealt, but you don't let it rest, you shuffle and stack, and a gamble... a gamble that may pay off? But how?
0DI0018073	Forecast: Rapidly changing conditions.
0DI0018074	A lot of thinking - most of it in your face, it's almost shouting at me. Sorry if I said anything weird.
0DI0018075	I need to take off my medicine...
0DI0018076	Local, local, the here and now... little of interest... things to buy, false hopes, and regrets watered down, washed down in dirty glasses.
0DI0018077	With regret comes a girl... smiling sad, brown robe, name Veronica, half here. Wraps her and her heart up like a pack, in the pack, a key, some say.
0DI0018078	Forecast: Cloudy, with a chance of friendship.
0DI0018079	Ouch. Thinking small only hurts a little, but it's a sharp pain.
0DI0018080	There's more to the 188 than meets the eye. Troops move back and forth on 93 all the time, and 95 is how NCR folks come and go from Vegas.
0DI0018081	No shortage of customers... so long as Legion raids south of here don't get worse, anyways.
0DI0018082	Not much. I hear some folks got killed down by Nelson... or was it Novac? I don't know. If they come up this way, me and dad'll go someplace else.
0DI0018083	Name's Michelle. My Dad and me run this store. His name's Samuel. I take the day shift and he takes nights.
0DI0018084	We came here about a month ago, when Primm went to hell on account of the prison break north of there. Found a bin to call home and set up shop.
0DI0018085	That's nice. I suspect we'll stick around here, though. Business has been good.
0DI0018086	You do know these old roads were numbered, right? We're standing where the 95 and 93 meet. And 95 plus 93 equals... 188.
0DI0018087	Well... There's been reports of trouble south, but me and Michelle can handle ourselves. And there's plenty of soldiers about, so that helps.
0DI0018088	When 15 shut down, 95 became the route NCR citizens use to get to the Strip - or limp back home, after the Strip's drained 'em of caps.
0DI0018089	We get 'em coming and going. Coming, the suckers flush with caps they saved to gamble on the Strip...
0DI0018090	...and going, the same folks, but now they're losers who'll trade you the shirt off their backs so they don't starve before they make it back home.
0DI0018091	Add in the troopers marching back and forth from McCarran and the Dam, and well, let's just say we don't miss Primm.
0DI0018092	Michelle and I ran a little shop in Primm 'till a prison break north of town spoiled it for everyone. Goddamned convicts just about shut down I-15.
0DI0018093	When traffic dried up, we took to our heels to find us some customers. I'm not one to sit around waiting to get saved, and Michelle ain't, neither.
0DI0018094	Samuel Kerr at your service. Me and my daughter Michelle run this fine establishment.
0DI0018095	We came here from Primm about a month past. Doesn't look like much, but it's one hell of a location.
0DI0018096	Guess that makes you a big hero - in Primm. Like I said, me and Michelle didn't sit around waiting to be saved. Business is better here, anyway.
0DI0018097	Welcome. Please sit in the chair. The show is about to begin.
0DI0018098	The show requires that you sit in the chair.
0DI0018099	It is absolutely essential that you sit in the chair.
0DI0018100	You have no other choice. You must sit in the chair.
0DI0018101	Congratulations, martyr! Your fantastic journey is only just beginning. Please proceed to the light.
0DI0018102	The light is calming, and puts your mind at ease. Go to the light.
0DI0018103	Greetings, martyr, and welcome! If you're here now, it means you've been offered up as a sacrifice so that your vault can continue to thrive.
0DI0018104	And who could forget when you met the love of your life? What a looker! These are just examples.
0DI0018105	Do you feel that feeling stirring in your chest as you think of these things? Good. What you are feeling is peace.
0DI0018106	You've led a great life. Living it has been its own reward. But it is only the beginning.
0DI0018107	Close your eyes now, and imagine what joys await you in the next life - the afterlife. Can you see them? Good.
0DI0018108	Currently, you may be feeling sad or angry. Perhaps you never got to have grandkids, or to enjoy the pleasures of a fresh cigar.
0DI0018109	But march with your chin held high, soldier, and remember that each of us has an important role to play.
0DI0018110	For some people, their role might be to heal the sick. For others, it might mean they will drive a racecar or fly a rocket ship.
0DI0018111	And some of us are meant to forfeit our lives for the good of the people.
0DI0018112	Sure it might not be as fun as driving a racecar, but it's every bit as important.
0DI0018113	Let's take a moment to reflect on the moments that made your life worth living.
0DI0018114	Think about that time you kissed your steady girl for the first time under the bleachers at the big game.
0DI0018115	Or when you snuck out after curfew to catch that new flick that your parents wouldn't let you see because it was too scary. Boy, were they right!
0DI0018116	Excellent, excellent! Please be patient, the tour will begin in just a moment.
0DI0018117	I am so pleased you enjoyed the last tour! A new tour will begin in a moment, if you wish to wait.
0DI0018118	I can answer whatever questions you'd like... provided your query is limited to REPCONN history, research and development, or RobCo.
0DI0018119	REPCONN's illustrious history began way back in 2054, shortly after the famous Delta XI rocket was completed and launched.
0DI0018120	REPCONN's initial focus was on the development of fuel to be used in orbital propulsion in response to the energy crisis of 2052. Sad times, indeed.
0DI0018121	The company really took off when RobCo purchased REPCONN in late 2076 to develop unmanned rockets to explore the solar system.
0DI0018122	As you may already know, REPCONN is an industry leader in producing alternative fuels for military and scientific purposes.
0DI0018123	REPCONN scientists were pioneers in fission-based propulsion systems, and have recently had some very exciting breakthroughs with plasma systems.
0DI0018124	The recent partnership with RobCo has freed our engineers from mundane business matters, allowing them to focus solely on future projects.
0DI0018125	RobCo industries purchased REPCONN in 2075 to assist with some of RobCo's military projects, as well as developing unmanned space exploration.
0DI0018126	The relationship between RobCo and REPCONN is mutually beneficial, and we hope that both companies bolster each other well into the next century.
0DI0018127	Very well, feel free to ask me more about REPCONN at any time, don't be shy.
0DI0018128	The tour showcases REPCONN's amazing scientific contributions, and the promise of many more, coupled with its parent company, RobCo.
0DI0018129	Ready for the REPCONN tour, Rocketeers? Courtesy of the fine folks at RobCo, I'll be your guide today on the path of... Scientific. Discovery.
0DI0018130	In the lead-lined case behind me is a spent radioactive rod from of our old reactors. No need to stand too close, let's move along, shall we?
0DI0018131	Look here - a row of multi-colored plasma fuels! Careful, they may look safe to drink, but your stomach is the last place they should be.
0DI0018132	Why the difference in cylinder size? Refining our production methods has resulted in higher yields of fuel over time, that's why!
0DI0018133	To my right you can see a sample of some old "safety barrels" REPCONN once used to store radioactive waste. Perfectly safe.
0DI0018134	On my left is an example of a mountain of REPCONN safety barrels some legislators claim are poisoning our environment. Ridiculous.
0DI0018135	Behind me is our most recent rocket project, which we're keeping under our hats... until "launch," if you'll pardon the expression.
0DI0018136	And in front of me is a model  - not actual size - of the launch dome we are using to send our rockets screeeeaming into orbit.
0DI0018137	Yes, I hear that sometimes. And then I never see the people who said it again.
0DI0018138	You do look like someone who can take care of himself. But I think you'll find this is more than you bargained for...
0DI0018139	You do look like someone who can take care of herself. But I think you'll find this is more than you bargained for...
0DI0018140	Intruder! I have foreseen your death!
0DI0018142	You! Now you've gone and done it! No one messes with my radio station!
0DI0018143	Valid facial pattern detected.
0DI0018144	Third floor access is for executives only. Please identify.
0DI0018146	You have accessed a restricted area.
0DI0018148	[SUCCEEDED] Override accepted.
0DI0018149	[SUCCEEDED] Correct. Facial pattern recognized. Diagnostic mode initiated.
0DI0018150	[FAILED] Unauthorized access. You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
0DI0018151	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you sir, have a nice day.
0DI0018152	[SUCCEEDED] Thank you ma'am, have a nice day.
0DI0018155	[FAILED] Incorrect. Security alert! You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
0DI0018156	[SUCCEEDED] Diagnostic mode entered.
0DI0018157	[FAILED] No maintenance service request logged. Intruder alert!
0DI0018158	Here's the plan. The gate to Tabitha's compound is guarded by several Nightkin, all of them using devices that make them invisible.
0DI0018159	I'm going to draw them away from the gate by telling them I spotted an intruder in the village. Then you slip in.
0DI0018160	Hello Mrs. Millet, I hope you have an excellent day at work today.
0DI0018161	Hello! Have a wonderful day here at REPCONN. Remember, security is job one!
0DI0018163	Unauthorized facial pattern. Second floor access restricted to registered employees.
0DI0018164	No valid REPCONN identification badge detected. Please vacate the premises.
0DI0018165	No valid REPCONN identification badge detected. This is your second and final warning. Please vacate or security will be alerted.
0DI0018166	Unauthorized access. Activating Security!
0DI0018167	I'll be here a while yet, if you need any guns or ammo.
0DI0018168	I didn't. My C.O. ordered me to flog a couple "deserters," and I told him to eat shit. So they kicked me out for insubordination.
0DI0018173	Unauthorized facial pattern detected. Valid security badge detected. Temporary access granted. Please complete employee registration with security.
0DI0018174	Unauthorized facial pattern. Please present credentials for first floor access.
0DI0018175	Hello, please remember visiting hours are from 10 AM until 5 PM. Please show your badge or make your way out of the building.
0DI0018176	You have been warned. Please vacate the premises or you will be considered an intruder.
0DI0018177	Intruder Alert! Intruder Alert!
0DI0018178	[SUCCEEDED] Please do not not make your way to the 2nd floor.
0DI0018179	[FAILED] Unauthorized access.  You have 30 seconds to vacate before security is alerted.
0DI0018180	You won't live to regret those words!
0DI0018181	No biggie there. We've been avoiding the patrols and staying low key until this mess.
0DI0018182	Maybe you're right. Come on, boys, lets get the hell out of here before the law shows up.
0DI0018183	And it'll be the last thing you hear!
0DI0018184	Yeah, if we see the NCR, they'll be waiting for us with a bullet to the brain pan.
0DI0018185	So what are we supposed to do, just run?
0DI0018186	You got the caps, I got the skills.
0DI0018187	Sure, boss. I'd be happy to prolong my captivity and psychological abuse to tighten some lug nuts for you.
0DI0018188	Sure, I'll just pull a toolbox out from behind a conveniently-placed rock and get to work.
0DI0018189	If by some chance you want to find me again, and if by some even greater chance coyotes haven't picked my bones clean, I'll be at my shack.
0DI0018190	Anything's better than staying here. Let's go.
0DI0018191	Sorry boss, but as much as I'd like to risk getting killed by your side, you seem to already have some help.
0DI0018192	Alrighty then, I'll just head out. Alone. By myself. Into the dangerous wastes.
0DI0018208	Now, music.
0DI0018209	And now, music.
0DI0018210	But you don't want to listen to me, do you? You want music.
0DI0018212	And depart we will!
0DI0018213	Don't leave me here too long. I can't wait forever.
0DI0018214	I just hope I won't have to use it!
0DI0018215	That explains why there's been no sit-rep from Sergeant Lee.
0DI0018216	It took months to get authorization for that assault. It'll be a long time before we take on the Powder Gangers again.
0DI0018217	I'm not surprised. Criminals like to act tough, but they're no match for military discipline.
0DI0018218	Everyone in the base has to spend a minimum of five hours a week running tactical simulations, but outside that, interest is scarce.
0DI0018219	It wasn't always this way. When we first moved into the bunker, everyone was so excited that the VR systems were intact.
0DI0018220	Over time, though, my fellows have become listless and less entertained by the wonders of the technology around us.
0DI0018221	That's why Apprentice Watkins is such a joy to work with. Her unbridled enthusiasm for virtual combat is unparalleled.
0DI0018222	Ah, the outsider. I suppose it's too much to ask that jarhead Ramos to keep outsiders away from my research.
0DI0018223	I am Head Scribe Taggart, and I am much too busy to deal with the likes of you right now.
0DI0018224	Some Powder Gangers did you wrong, is that it? Get in line.
0DI0018225	Still, you do look capable enough, and manpower hasn't been easy to come by...
0DI0018226	All right. Fine by me if you want to put yourself in harm's way. I'll mark the staging area on your map. Talk to Sergeant Lee.
0DI0018227	I don't remember saying there was going to be an attack on the prison, waster. You've overstayed your welcome.
0DI0018228	[SUCCEEDED] Some Powder Gangers did you wrong, is that it? Well, get in line.
0DI0018230	All right. If you want to put yourself in harm's way, I'll help you do it. I'll mark the staging area on your map. Talk to Sergeant Lee.
0DI0018231	[FAILED] I don't know how they'll do it without you - if they are going to do it - but I guess they'll have to manage. Now get out of here.
0DI0018233	Oh, that's so gracious of you, to offer to bodyguard me like that? But I'd only slow you down. See you outside!
0DI0018234	[FAILED] I know! It's incredibly generous and altruistic of you. See you outside!
0DI0018235	[SUCCEEDED] Oh! Why, uh, of course! I would never let you fight my kidnappers with my help. Uh, without it! You lead the way!
0DI0018236	Then I'll defer to your superior appraisal of character and prowess in contests of arms and see you outside!
0DI0018237	Whoa, really? Ho, shit! I knew I could do it. Those NCR pricks can all get on their knees and worship at the altar of fucking Fantastic!
0DI0018238	But don't worry, I'll tell them what you did for me, man. Not all of it, though. They'd think I was an idiot. But some of it.
0DI0018239	Keep at it, man. One day you could end up where I am. You never know.
0DI0018240	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to everyone. Very admirable.
0DI0018241	Now that the NCR has more or less what they want, hopefully their curiosity about the plant is satisfied and they'll dig no deeper.
0DI0018242	The Followers will be grateful. Here, take these, as a parting gift. I hope you'll find them useful.
0DI0018243	I saw that on the monitors here. And you sent it to Freeside, where power is in short supply. A respectable decision.
0DI0018246	I saw that on the monitors here. It's strange, but I can't find where on the grid the power is being sent to.
0DI0018247	Nevertheless, hopefully the NCR's curiosity is satisfied now that the plant's output is improved. Here, accept these, for your efforts.
0DI0018248	So I saw. Shame to let the energy go to waste, but on the other hand, now we can rest easy. Here, accept these, for your efforts.
0DI0018249	Well, come back and see me after you find some caps somewheres and put 'em on you!
0DI0018250	Well, I swore not to say a word, but an NCR deserter passed through some days ago and traded for supplies.
0DI0018252	Traitor! Learn what it means to betray the Brotherhood of Steel!
0DI0018253	[SUCCEEDED] So you weighed the value of confirming if his location was known against your advantage of surprise. All right.
0DI0018254	[FAILED] What's in doubt isn't your ability to kill. It's your ability to be thorough. Your circumspection, so to speak.
0DI0018255	So again, I ask: How do you know that killing this ranger didn't make matters worse, exposing us to greater dangers?
0DI0018256	That's where we are. This here little casino brought some cash and bodies into the town before them Powder Gangsters came in.
0DI0018257	They can't rush us without eating a good bit of hot lead, but we are in kind of a box canyon. Guess this is as fitting a place for that as any.
0DI0018258	I reckon if they thought hard enough about it, they'd realize they got more bodies than we have bullets, but for now we're safe enough in here.
0DI0018259	You'll find your belongings in the chest to your right. Don't come back until you've dealt with the ranger.
0DI0018260	[SUCCEEDED] I wish I could tell you, but we've had so many replacements lately I couldn't be sure. Go in and look around if you want.
0DI0018261	Try not to make any trouble.
0DI0018262	[FAILED] Sorry. No civilians inside. I can't start making exceptions now.
0DI0018263	Best you can do is talk to someone at the station where your brother enlisted.
0DI0018264	Why would I want to let you do that?
0DI0018265	I ask myself the same question all the time. But energy is hard to come by around here. Gives you more control over this area than troops ever could.
0DI0018266	Hell, if we lose the dam to the Legion, this little plant may be our last stand.
0DI0018267	I can't tell whether you're joking or radiation melted part of your brain, but either way I don't see a good reason to let you through.
0DI0018268	I'm glad we sorted this out.
0DI0018269	Or you're a Legion spy trying to infiltrate our perimeter. Give me one good reason I should let you through.
0DI0018270	There should. But we're not getting much power out of it so none of our enemies have a big interest in it either. Not like Hoover Dam, anyway.
0DI0018271	We had a real fighting force here just long enough to take it from the Brotherhood of Steel. Then they got sent east to the dam like everybody else.
0DI0018272	Caesar's Legion sends skirmishers every so often. Prodding for weaknesses, mostly. The reality is, if they really wanted it, we'd all be dead.
0DI0018273	This is NCR property and we have guns. So you can only do as we please here. And it would please us if you got the hell off our lawn.
0DI0018274	No need. We already have an expert hard at work on it.
0DI0018275	Then again... our expert is an idiot. Hell, he might as well be a saboteur. I guess you couldn't do any worse.
0DI0018276	Have him fill you in on the details. He's in the back of the building. You'll know him when you see him.
0DI0018277	Keeps his sunglasses on all the time, even when he's sleeping. Idiot.
0DI0018278	Stay where you are. You're not allowed in there. This is your only warning.
0DI0018279	We've held off tougher enemies than you.
0DI0018280	Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
0DI0018281	But if you really want to help us, talk to the idiot with sunglasses in the back of the plant building.
0DI0018282	He's been trying to get this place running for months and hasn't made any forward progress.
0DI0018283	[SUCCEEDED] Your being here is a start, soldier. We aren't exactly overflowing with troopers here.
0DI0018286	[FAILED] That uniform's got an awful lot of blood on it, soldier, and you don't look injured to me. Doesn't fit you so well either.
0DI0018287	You're trying to put one over on the wrong trooper.
0DI0018288	Yes. And the technology they have in this facility is like nothing I've seen. Some of it reminds me of Enclave equipment, but more advanced.
0DI0018289	A weapon based upon it would be catastrophic, no matter who claimed it.
0DI0018290	It's no wonder the Brotherhood wouldn't give it up.
0DI0018291	I see. Then you must have some special business here, for them to have let you through.
0DI0018292	Then we have that in common. Whom do you typically work with?
0DI0018293	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim to the Followers of the Apocalypse over the years have had less than pure intentions.
0DI0018294	But if it's really as you say, then take my advice. This installation carries with it dangers that no one here has realized.
0DI0018295	Take care what you do here, and who you listen to. Some things are best left buried with the old world.
0DI0018296	That's reassuring, although many who've made that claim over the years have had less than pure intentions.
0DI0018299	Not yet. By some miracle they've hired an imbecile to try and decipher the systems here.
0DI0018300	He's spent months working at one console trying to get the solar reflectors to track the sun.
0DI0018301	What he doesn't know is that the only thing the console controls is the plant's intercom system.
0DI0018302	I tried to tell him, but he insisted that the largest console had to be the most important. Still, it's only a matter of time.
0DI0018303	Then I would say do it. As long as the power of this plant is committed to the regional grid and not to a weapon, we are safe.
0DI0018304	If you are the one to restore output, then you can route the power where you choose, and they'll never be the wiser.
0DI0018305	I can't get you past the security in the tower, but I can be of some help.
0DI0018306	I've discovered a password for one of the mirror control terminals outside. You'll need it.
0DI0018307	They're playing you for a fool. You'll die in that tower, just like their soldiers did. Why do you think they haven't taken care of this themselves?
0DI0018308	Interesting. Forgive me for prying, but I'm curious. Are you with a particular group?
0DI0018316	Well that explains it. NCR? Who do you fight for?
0DI0018317	Ah, but there's no avoiding it. You can only outrun the choice for so long.
0DI0018318	Take now, for instance. You are inside a facility with lost technology, some of it very dangerous.
0DI0018319	Unless you turn and leave right now, you'll be very much involved in the lives of people you've never seen or met.
0DI0018323	That's... an unfortunate mistake.
0DI0018324	As a Follower of the Apocalypse, I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
0DI0018326	I've studied it all my life, but I'll never understand how people don't foresee what lies ahead on that path.
0DI0018327	I don't entirely know. Our records on the company that built this place suggest that their dealings were not only in energy, but also in weapons.
0DI0018328	And I've seen equipment here marked with symbols used by the Pre-War military. Targeting computers. Shock sensors.
0DI0018329	A codeword comes up repeatedly in the papers I've looked through here. ARCHIMEDES.
0DI0018330	Oh, the NCR has their own designs for it, no doubt. But resist the urge to send it only to the thriving communities.
0DI0018331	The need for power is great everywhere. Distributing it evenly is the most rational and humane choice.
0DI0018332	I was sent here when we saw that the NCR had taken it. We have no record of the facility, but its original builders were cause for concern.
0DI0018333	I'm to determine the threat level of this place and do everything in my power to prevent the revival of any dangerous Pre-War technology.
0DI0018334	The NCR let me stay because they are desperate for answers about this place, but I've kept them in the dark.
0DI0018335	I'm a visiting scholar. Solar power technology may be important to our future and I was sent to research it.
0DI0018336	I'm a man of letters. I'd be torn to pieces by the security system they have in that tower. I'd never reach the mainframe.
0DI0018337	But eventually the NCR will, or if not them, Caesar's Legion. They will use this place for war.
0DI0018338	Because the possibility exists you might do anything else, you're the only choice I have.
0DI0018339	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here.
0DI0018340	I'm a member of the Followers of the Apocalypse, and for once we might want the same thing.
0DI0018341	This place houses technology beyond anything I've seen. I'm afraid it could be dangerous if either of the warring factions here learns how to use it.
0DI0018342	The Brotherhood? I never thought I'd say it, but I'm glad you're here. For once our organizations may want the same thing.
0DI0018344	Then may you die in his service. I have nothing to say to you.
0DI0018345	That makes sense. It is their facility, after all. At least as long as they can hold it. As for me, I'm with the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0018346	Then for everyone's sake, I hope you serve a worthy master. Are you a maker of war, or peace?
0DI0018347	[SUCCEEDED] Very well. Yes. I'm part of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0018348	If you're not familiar, we seek peace and the spread of knowledge. Knowledge that must never be lost to the world.
0DI0018349	Now your turn.
0DI0018350	[FAILED] I would, but I wouldn't want to influence your answer.
0DI0018351	Very well. It's to our benefit that you'd be well-equipped. I'll send word ahead.
0DI0018352	[SUCCEEDED] Really? You think so? We've only got the one gun, and there's two of us... and we've never done anything like this before...
0DI0018353	We've never been on the Strip, either, so we don't know how many guards the casinos have. And I keep having these nightmares...
0DI0018354	What are we thinking? We're gonna get ourselves killed!
0DI0018355	Look, tell Sammy to give you the gun, all right? Just take it! I don't want it around, tempting us to do something stupid!
0DI0018356	[FAILED] So does your face, all right? And Sammy will add a few more if you don't shut up!
0DI0018357	Sammy and me got our hands on a powerful weapon not too long ago: Vance's gun. You know - Vance, of Vance and Vikki?
0DI0018358	That gun's our "shot" at the big-time. We're gonna sneak it onto the Strip and rob one of the casinos. Maybe all of them!
0DI0018359	We'll be known as the greatest gunslingers to ever terrorize the wastelands!
0DI0018360	Really? Oh, thank god! I love that woman, but I swear this time she was gonna get us killed!
0DI0018361	The gun's in the safe. The combination's 05-23-34. Take it far away from here, before she changes her mind.
0DI0018362	So? That's just one of our crimes! We're depraved, stone-cold degenerates, you know? You don't want to mess with us!
0DI0018363	You'll have to ask Pauline about that! She's the brains of our operation. I'm the muscle.
0DI0018364	The Bison Steve is one of Primm's less-impressive casino hotels. I'd steer clear of that place, pardner, if I were you.
0DI0018365	Rumor is the dealers over there cheat, and that rickety roller-coaster's liable to fall down any day 'cause it wasn't built to code.
0DI0018366	Primm is a thriving resort community located in Clark County, Nevada, right along Interstate 15.
0DI0018367	Whether you can't wait 'til Vegas to try your luck, or want to hit one last jackpot before you leave Nevada, Primm's your place!
0DI0018368	The town's Primm-eer attraction is the world-famous Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum, so you came to the right place, pardner!
0DI0018369	Just mosey on over to the display case and you'll see it plain as day. Quite a piece, that gun. Mint condition. Never fired.
0DI0018370	Have you gone loco, pardner? I can see the gun with my own three photo sensors from where I'm standing right now.
0DI0018371	[You hear strange sounds coming from Primm Slim. He may be trying to read a corrupted file, but it would take more science knowledge to be sure.]
0DI0018372	Quit yammering on about missing guns, pardner. Primm Slim's a busy man, ain't got time for that sort of bosh.
0DI0018373	[SUCCEEDED] <Primm Slim buzzes and whirs while he reformats.>
0DI0018374	Well look at that. I happened across this data file locked away in an isolated sub-system.
0DI0018375	[FAILED] You're plumb loco partner.
0DI0018376	Yessir, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
0DI0018377	Yes ma'am, you just tell ol' Primm Slim what you'd like to know.
0DI0018378	Where have you been, pardner? Hiding under a rock?
0DI0018379	Vikki and Vance were this nation's fourth or maybe fifth most infamous celebrity outlaw couple ever, that's who they was!
0DI0018380	Primm Slim here can tell you the whole story, if you can spare a minute to hear the tale.
0DI0018381	Yes, we could kill him easily enough. But sometimes you can learn a great deal by observing people, both enemies and friends.
0DI0018382	Which is why it will be very interesting to observe how you choose to deal with the situation, and decide which you are. Enemy, or friend?
0DI0018383	Do we understand one another?
0DI0018384	I never said the ranger had to be killed. And I wasn't giving you the option. I merely asked if you understood.
0DI0018385	Makes things simple for us.
0DI0018386	Take it all off, and hand it to me. Then come inside, and through the door at the rear of the chamber. Paladin Ramos is waiting for you.
0DI0018387	Okay, folks. I called you out here because I've grown to trust you. Primm, the town to the south, is looking for some new law.
0DI0018388	I know that you guys don't have experience with law enforcement at least not on the enforcement side.
0DI0018389	However I also know that you are honorable and looking for some redemption. This is our chance for redemption.
0DI0018390	Now let's head down there and bring them some law!
0DI0018391	Why, yes I am. It's a pleasure to meet you.
0DI0018392	I'm in a bit of a predicament here. I'd be most appreciative if you'd set me free.
0DI0018393	Why, I am Deputy Beagle, and I am being held hostage. Can you imagine?
0DI0018394	I'd be most grateful if you would set me free.
0DI0018395	I must say it's been the low point of my career in law enforcement...
0DI0018396	The Powder Gangers stole into town at night and murdered my sister and her husband, the sheriff, in bed, while I was sleeping in the office.
0DI0018397	I watched them for a bit, waiting for the right moment to pounce and arrest the lot of them. Taking careful notes as I watched.
0DI0018398	To my dismay, they found me while I waited in the shadows and brought me here.
0DI0018399	Oh that's just marvelous. I think I'll be making my way outside now. The air's a little close in here.
0DI0018400	No need to rush on my account. I lost feeling in my hands and legs hours ago.
0DI0018401	Well, in that case I'll just wait for you right here.
0DI0018402	It should be someone brave like you, but more of a homebody. Someone who'll settle down and watch over us.
0DI0018403	I heard the Powder Gangers talking about someone in the prison named Meyers who has some experience as a sheriff. He may be a good choice.
0DI0018404	Also with the NCR so close by, you may be able to get them to take over the town. Not sure why they haven't helped out already.
0DI0018405	I know what it's like to have a busy schedule, but surely you can squeeze this in.
0DI0018406	If you run across someone whose bearing and experience screams "sheriff," simply tell him or her about Primm's perdicament. That's all it takes.
0DI0018407	You will? That's just marvelous! I'll start thinking up questions for the interview!
0DI0018408	The sheriff that was incarcerated up at NCRCF may be a good choice.
0DI0018409	You also may be able to convince that NCR guy across the road to take the town under his wing, although martial law doesn't sound so fun.
0DI0018411	No. No, no, no!
0DI0018412	How could I... Stupid! Oh god...
0DI0018413	That armor isn't working. Leave it there.
0DI0018414	Good luck killing something with that. Thing's busted.
0DI0018415	Newsflash. Fantastic is irreplaceable.
0DI0018416	Ah, shit. Shit, man. I need this. Gotta pay the bills. And I'm addicted to a lot of different kinds of chems. I mean a lot.
0DI0018417	Ah, shit, man. You're direct, you're no-nonsense. How am I supposed to compete with that? I gotta pay these chem bills.
0DI0018418	It was easy, man. They were going door to door asking if anyone knew any scientists. I said look no further.
0DI0018419	They asked me if I knew anything about power plants. I said as much as anyone I'd ever met.
0DI0018420	They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard.
0DI0018421	Well hey, if you find yourself up at the mainframe, do yourself a favor and make sure you send the power to the right place.
0DI0018422	It needs to go to the Strip and McCarran.
0DI0018423	What else? I'm in charge. This whole operation depends on me. No Fantastic, no power. Got the whole NCR suckling my teats, and it feels so good.
0DI0018424	No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have.
0DI0018425	Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network.
0DI0018426	That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.
0DI0018427	Ah well. Guess I'll have to wait for the next curious sucker.
0DI0018428	[SUCCEEDED] Aw, man. How am I supposed to buy chems now? Fine. Here.
0DI0018429	[FAILED] Ha! You had me going for a second there. Then I remembered that there's only one Fantastic. I'm king of this dump.
0DI0018430	There's these two terminals outside. They control the mirrors. I tried fooling with them but didn't get very far.
0DI0018431	You'd have to get them to talk to the mainframe up in the tower, then do the rest from up there. I'm guessing. But it sounds good, right?
0DI0018432	Hey, you're not thinking of going up there, are you?
0DI0018433	Damn right, you're not. Goddamn right. Why would they? You can't top this guy. Just a little more time. You can't keep Fantastic down for long.
0DI0018435	Because I get paid, that's why. Per kilowatt-hour, whatever the hell that is. That's where the NCR wants the power, so that's where I want it.
0DI0018436	But you know, you do that, maybe I put in a good word for you with them. Fantastic's little helper. There's a reputation you can hang your hat on.
0DI0018437	Well, see, we're getting power, because the guy running this place is Fantastic.
0DI0018438	But the mirrors outside aren't aimed right, so we're running at one percent efficiency. And I guess that just isn't good enough for some assholes.
0DI0018439	Trouble is, most of the controls for this place aren't here - they're in the tower.
0DI0018440	And that place has some crazy Pre-War security system that the dumbshit NCR set off when they took over. Killed two guys. Now they won't go near it.
0DI0018441	They want me to make an omelet, but I can't break any of their eggs, know what I'm saying?
0DI0018442	Fuck, man. Everything. I push buttons. I turn dials. I read numbers.  Sometimes I make up little stories in my head about what the numbers mean.
0DI0018443	Like one time I imagined they were a code to get into a vault full of naked women. Man, how cool would that be?
0DI0018444	Worried? Do I look worried to you? I've got this under control, baby. No one else can do what I do here.
0DI0018445	Yes Lieutenant!
0DI0018446	Are you ready to depart for Primm?
0DI0018448	Ok, we have some soldiers heading to town now. I'll have them sweep the Bison Steve before they start regular patrols.
0DI0018450	Quiet.
0DI0018451	Quiet!
0DI0018452	You name it. Anything that comes within a thousand yards that looks like trouble.
0DI0018453	Lately we been getting ghouls, coming from the road to REPCONN, out to the west. Quite a few, last couple days.
0DI0018454	The big threat is the Legion coming from the East. If they decide to attack with a full force they'll run us over. But so far we been lucky.
0DI0018455	Were they tough? I was in the Khans, man. It doesn't get any badder.
0DI0018456	That's none of your business, smoothskin!
0DI0018457	I already told you how to get up here. Big room on the east side of the first floor. Take the stairs up. Got it?
0DI0018459	Jason was very clear. Get rid of the demons, then report back. He didn't tell you to poke around down there. Got it?
0DI0018460	Oh, you haven't run across Bright's little cult upstairs, eh?
0DI0018461	Harmless bunch, really. Religion and me never really got along, but they're good company. I helped out with odds and ends.
0DI0018462	Hey Jason, your rockets are ready!
0DI0018463	You mess with a man's radio, and he might take it personal like, you hear?
0DI0018464	Now, who can tell me the primary components of gunpowder?
0DI0018465	The principles of fusion are relatively simple.
0DI0018466	...then you bring your second unit up to provide covering fire, like so...
0DI0018467	It's an old hotel and casino here in town. Old Laurie used to rent out rooms there, but she took off months ago.
0DI0018468	Across the way from the Vikki and Vance, the other old casino. Can't miss it.
0DI0018469	Yes, that's everything. I'll tell Jason the rockets are ready. It's time to get this over with.
0DI0018470	Yes. I'll tell Jason that the Great Journey can begin.
0DI0018471	My specialty is a radscorpion venom casserole. It's a more appetizing than it sounds!
0DI0018472	The venom has a sharp, smokey flavor, and it numbs your mouth so fierce you'll forget you ever had a tongue!
0DI0018473	It's perfectly safe, long as you don't have sores in your mouth for the venom to find your blood. 'Cause that'll kill you dead.
0DI0018475	You were the one who came talking to me.
0DI0018476	If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
0DI0018477	Not far from it. When we reclaimed this bunker, I found a number of VR tapes. Most were corrupted, but a few programs still ran.
0DI0018478	Using those as my foundation, I was able to code the training VR, as well as other applications.
0DI0018479	Chris shall be declared the Saint of the Great Journey before we depart. I hope this will ease his sadness...
0DI0018480	It is the creator's will, and I must submit. There is no malice in it. We would take him with us if we could.
0DI0018481	To our new friend, we say thanks, and promise never to forget how he cleared from our path the demons who sought to stay our Journey.
0DI0018482	But to Chris, we owe more than thanks. Chris, you have made this Great Journey a reality.
0DI0018483	From this moment forward, you will be remembered as the Saint of the Great Journey. We shall never forget you.
0DI0018484	I ask that you forgive us, Chris, and give us your blessing, and we bestow ours upon you.
0DI0018485	Seekers, board the rockets, take your seats. The Great Journey awaits! To the promised land we go! To the Far Beyond!
0DI0018486	Let's hope you do.
0DI0018487	Stop wasting time.
0DI0018488	Get moving.
0DI0018490	Like I said, find the metal staircase in the big room on the east side of the building. It's where they used to make rockets.
0DI0018491	Big room. Metal staircase. East side of the building. Is that too many syllables for you?
0DI0018492	Who I am doesn't matter, smoothskin. Stop wasting time and get up here.
0DI0018493	What, you think I'm too stupid to pull it off? I know enough to get their rockets working, don't I? So I can make them fail, too!
0DI0018494	Like I could forgive myself for getting duped like this? They used me! And now they'll throw me away!
0DI0018495	And dying would be worse than this? Used up and thrown away like garbage?
0DI0018496	Oh, so I've redeemed the human race, is that it? What a crock! The human race can't stand me!
0DI0018497	So you want me to accompany you on your adventures across the wasteland, is that it?
0DI0018498	Life among humans again, that's what you're suggesting?
0DI0018499	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got.
0DI0018500	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. I'll get Jason and his flock on their way, and then I'll head for Novac.
0DI0018502	I guess... I guess it's the only chance I've got. Maybe it'll be different this time. I was never a Saint before.
0DI0018503	I can't believe I'm agreeing to this, but I'll give it a try. You go launch the rockets. I'm on my way to Novac.
0DI0018504	Then bring me Sugar Bombs. Three boxes should do the trick. Add those to the fuel mixture and "Boom!"
0DI0018505	I'll show those rotten ghouls! And they'll know exactly who did them in!
0DI0018508	I said I need three boxes of Sugar Bombs, not less than three.
0DI0018509	I'll mix the Sugar Bombs into the fuel mixture before they launch. They'll never suspect a thing... until it's too late.
0DI0018511	But first I'll need the other parts we talked about.
0DI0018512	All right. Go on.
0DI0018513	Obviously. It's taken months, but I've nearly got them in working order. Soon they'll take us to the Far Beyond.
0DI0018514	I was skeptical at first, of course - being a man of science - but Jason is certain, and I believe in Jason.
0DI0018515	I'm the flock's resident engineer. I've always been good with machines. Jason says the Great Journey would've been impossible without me.
0DI0018516	Of course, my skills aren't much use unless I have the right materials. That's where you come in.
0DI0018517	When I joined the flock, Jason made it clear that he wanted me to supervise the repairs, not do them myself.
0DI0018518	It would be a waste of my gifts to work on just one system at a time. From up here, I've been able to supervise the entire project.
0DI0018519	I thought we were past all that, smoothskin. But you just can't resist the chance to mess with me. Typical human.
0DI0018520	I was human once, you know. Grew up in Vault 34, northeast of here.
0DI0018521	Nice upbringing, if you like assault rifles and target practice. But oh, you prefer machines that don't shoot people? Not so nice then.
0DI0018522	Who should maintain the Vault's reactor? Houser? Mitchell? No - make it Haversam. He likes machines!
0DI0018523	Haversam won't mind getting irradiated! Haversam won't mind mutating! He's already ugly as it is!
0DI0018524	Haversam won't mind when his hair starts falling out after a few years. There's no connection, Haversam! You're neurotic!
0DI0018525	Bald? You call this bald, smoothskin? I'm a monster! A monster!
0DI0018526	Stop making fun of me! But you're telling the truth, aren't you?
0DI0018527	Oh no! How could they do this to me? For two years? My god, I've been a joke to them!
0DI0018528	Do you have any idea how easy it'd be for me to sabotage those rockets? That'd be a joke, huh? One hell of a joke!
0DI0018529	[SUCCEEDED] Oh god! You're telling me the truth, aren't you...?
0DI0018532	[FAILED] I see your ploy, smoothskin. I won't fall for your trap. You can plainly see that I'm a ghoul myself. You can't turn me against my flock.
0DI0018533	Stay away from me.
0DI0018536	Please do.
0DI0018537	Leave me alone! Everyone else does!
0DI0018538	The rockets are ready, Jason. The Great Journey can begin. Good luck, I guess.
0DI0018539	The rockets are ready, Jason... ready to carry you and your little clan on the "Great Journey." Bon voyage.
0DI0018540	We have everything we need to launch the rockets, Jason! The Great Journey can begin!
0DI0018541	It pleases me to hear this. Truly, the creator sent you to help us in our time of need.
0DI0018542	Well, saints alive. That is a load off. Nothing to be done, though. Those ghouls just didn't know when they weren't wanted. Couldn't take a hint.
0DI0018543	And aren't you just the most unexpected gift our little town ever had? Here, take this. And go buy yourself something nice.
0DI0018544	Leave? I don't believe that was what was discussed. They could be back tomorrow knocking on my door wanting hand-outs.
0DI0018545	I'm sorry, I know what I promised, but my mind is just not at ease about this. I'm afraid I can't pay you for what you done.
0DI0018546	And I bet he told you it's the creator's will for you to risk your ass, instead of him, right?
0DI0018547	Well, good luck with that! I'd give you a hand, but no thanks. I may look like a corpse, but I'm partial to living!
0DI0018548	A stash of Stealth Boys. Are you kidding me?
0DI0018549	If there was some big stash of devices in here that made you invisible, do you really think we'd be having this conversation?
0DI0018550	The only thing you'll find up here is a bullet hole between your eyes. Got any better ideas?
0DI0018551	Maybe you noticed a bunch of invisible monsters out there? I've been in here trying not to get dead.
0DI0018552	Stop looking at Antler!
0DI0018553	No eyes on Antler! You make him nervous!
0DI0018554	Eyes to yourself, human!
0DI0018555	Your eyes on Antler! Stop looking!
0DI0018556	You touched Antler!
0DI0018557	Now you pay!
0DI0018558	Antler is my friend!
0DI0018559	Antler loves me! Not you!
0DI0018560	No one touch Antler but ME!
0DI0018561	Antler bring us here for hundreds of Stealth Boys, human. Antler thinks big. Antler IS big.
0DI0018562	Antler don't bring us here for Stealth Boys some puny human carry. Pull head out of your ass.
0DI0018563	Who is Antler? WHO IS ANTLER?
0DI0018564	Antler, the human asks about you! What do I tell it? All right.
0DI0018565	All right... Yes, yes, of course.
0DI0018566	Who Antler is, not important to you. Antler wants that you deal with me.
0DI0018567	Cut it out, human. Serious. Final warning.
0DI0018568	You did it now! Antler's horns stabbing! Antler MAD!
0DI0018571	Very well. We don't need a huge amount. Two to three liters should be enough.
0DI0018572	All right. Anything else?
0DI0018573	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need a quantity of the igniting agent.
0DI0018574	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need the thrust control modules.
0DI0018575	To sabotage the rockets, I'll still need to get them ready for launch. I still need a quantity of the igniting agent and the thrust control modules.
0DI0018576	For the fuel source, any shielded nuclear waste should do the trick. That's why we can't use the waste on the launch pad. Too much decay.
0DI0018577	As for the computer parts, the thruster control systems aren't complicated, so any good mix of components is all I need.
0DI0018578	I was close to completing work on the rockets before we were driven into hiding on the top floor.
0DI0018579	Two components were missing: a quantity of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
0DI0018580	The igniting agent is highly radioactive, and decays quickly. That's why we can't use the drums that leaked down on the launch pad.
0DI0018581	It's no longer potent enough. I need you to find an intact, shielded container of the igniting agent.
0DI0018582	As for the thrust control modules, they were custom-built for these rockets. They won't even launch without them.
0DI0018583	As I said before, I need an intact, shielded container of Isotope-239 igniting agent, and a set of thrust control modules.
0DI0018584	All right. What would you rather be doing?
0DI0018586	REPCONN has been ransacked so many times by scavengers, it's hard to know where the components might turn up. IF they turn up.
0DI0018587	Jason has mentioned some industrial ruins to the east that are supposed to be highly radioactive.
0DI0018588	I'd start by visiting local junk merchants or traders and see if that turns anything up.
0DI0018589	Scavengers wouldn't know the value of the modules just by looking at them. If you know any junk dealers in the area, I'd start there.
0DI0018590	All right. Carry on.
0DI0018591	Oh! Well I'm Alice and you've already met my beau, Dusty. He's sweet, ain't he? I don't care what my mama said, I know how to pick 'em.
0DI0018592	Oh! Well I'm Alice and that handsome stranger yonder is my husband Dusty. Going on fifty years, now.
0DI0018593	I keep waiting for him to leave me for some young thing with platinum blonde hair and hoop earrings, but he still sticks around.
0DI0018594	Says it's my cooking. I think it's because I know which Brahmin udder you can milk without getting kicked in the noggin.
0DI0018595	We set up this ranch years back when Novac was just getting settled.
0DI0018596	But now with all the danger on I-15, folks are starting to come through here from all over. Novac might just be the next Nevada boom town.
0DI0018597	Oh, we keep to ourselves, for the most part. Try not to pry. I think Jeannie May gets bothered that we aren't more sociable, but it's just our way.
0DI0018598	Ain't that we don't appreciate what she's done, managing this town like she has, but I worry she feels that way anyhow.
0DI0018599	Not that there ain't others who pry around here. That No-bark was skulking around our yard last week.
0DI0018600	<Laughs> I thought he was our cow-killer. Was about to lash him with our bullwhip till I saw who it was.  He's harmless, though.
0DI0018601	Part of me wishes I could see things like he sees 'em, all full of mystery.
0DI0018602	Bless her. Seems like every traveler I get in here tells me the same thing.
0DI0018603	They see the sign and think, gift shop? That's just too good to be true. But Jeannie May always points them back in my direction.
0DI0018604	Well, a friend of Jeannie's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
0DI0018605	You just... did it? Just like that, on a whim?
0DI0018606	Well listen, sir, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
0DI0018607	Will there be anything else?
0DI0018609	Well listen, ma'am, if something like that crosses your mind about me, please let me know. I'm sure we can work something out.
0DI0018611	Ki- killed her? Why would you do something like that?
0DI0018612	I- I'm sorry to hear that. She's a nice woman. Was. She might've grown on you.
0DI0018613	She's usually real good about those calls. Something must've happened.
0DI0018614	I hope just because I said she and I were friends doesn't mean you and I can't still be friendly.
0DI0018616	Lord almighty. I can't for the life of me imagine her doing anything that'd make someone want to kill her.
0DI0018617	Not that I'm saying you're a liar, of course! I'm just surprised, is all.
0DI0018619	No. Antler says you are solution. Plus can't have you skulking around, making trouble.
0DI0018620	Do as Antler says, or feel his horns. Up to you.
0DI0018621	No! Antler was clear! Do as Antler says or feel Antler's HORNS!
0DI0018651	I don't give my help to enemies of the NCR. Maybe you can find a raider "medic" to fix you up.
0DI0018652	Are you sure? You won't be able to read in the dark as well.
0DI0018654	Well, one thing we do have is a good supply of Rad-Away. Sure, I can help you with that.
0DI0018655	No, sorry, we're totally unprepared to deal with radiation sickness.
0DI0018656	Ha ha, just kidding, of course I can!
0DI0018657	We always make sure to keep an ample supply of Rad-Away. Most of us haven't had the exposure outsiders like you take for granted.
0DI0018658	Sure can. Quick and easy.
0DI0018659	In that case, stand just like that for a second. I want to make some toast.
0DI0018661	All right, but don't blame me if you end up sterile.
0DI0018662	Whatever you say. Hey, is that a little patch of ghoul rot on your cheek there?
0DI0018663	Suit yourself. I'm sure there are ghouls and other mutants who once said the same thing.
0DI0018665	Okay. And remember, if this doesn't help, try taking a bath in tomato juice.
0DI0018666	Okay... all done.
0DI0018667	Just stand still and try to ignore the tingling.
0DI0018668	This might tickle a little. Or it might cause searing, agonizing pain to shoot through your body. You never know.
0DI0018669	I bet you could make some of the money letting people work on their tans next to you.
0DI0018670	Well, come back when you do. I'll be here.
0DI0018671	Well, if you scrounge it up, the help is here waiting for you.
0DI0018672	Then I can't help you much. Now, maybe if you enlisted....
0DI0018673	Here we go. You'll be rad-free in no time.
0DI0018674	Then I can't help, sorry. Just following protocol.
0DI0018679	Your decisiveness is truly a wonder to behold, boss.
0DI0018680	Mmm hm.
0DI0018681	What is this, the Hokey Pokey?
0DI0018684	Don't be playing with my heart now, gets me pissed.
0DI0018685	You sure now? All right.
0DI0018686	Either shoot or don't, but don't be wishing and washing about it.
0DI0018687	You're like a switchblade stuck on flick.
0DI0018688	Going to give a lightswitch a run for its money. Click click click.
0DI0018689	Oh, pumpkin, you make grandma so happy!
0DI0018690	All right. Guess I'll be around Novac for a while longer, until I figure out what I want to do with myself. See you around.
0DI0018691	That's why you're the boss. You always make the right decisions. I'll just head home. Home to my lonely, abandoned shack in the middle of nowhere.
0DI0018692	Okay. Then I guess I'll be back at the 188. Maybe digging in some dirt for scrap metal or something.
0DI0018694	I'll head back to the Old Mormon Fort. If you need me, just swing by.
0DI0018696	Fine then.
0DI0018697	I'll get out of your hair, then.
0DI0018698	All right, then, dearie. Now you promise to come visit grandma soon, you hear?
0DI0018699	I am in command of my faculties! In command of my troops!
0DI0018700	Antler guides me in all things! As I in turn guide my kin!
0DI0018701	I see. Well, spare me the details.
0DI0018702	Damn it, I'm going to miss that crooked, yellow smile...
0DI0018703	All right, you did your part, so I'll do mine. Look around up here if you want. I'm going to make a break for topside.
0DI0018704	He did, did he? I swear, I should tear the rest of the hair out of that cocksucker's head.
0DI0018705	Send a rescue mission after Harland? Nah, let's just send some smoothskin whose radio got broke!
0DI0018706	Harland's tough! He probably enjoys waiting to be attacked at any moment! He probably loves eating nothing but roach meat!
0DI0018707	Licking up condensation from a rusted pipe is his idea of fun! So's doing his business in a corner, and smelling it for days!
0DI0018708	But oh, that's right - the crisis is that you need some computer parts! Well, you can go fuck yourself until you get my friends out of this mess.
0DI0018709	And I thought I was old. It's a junkshop east and slightly north of here. There's an old woman running it. Gilbert, or something.
0DI0018710	No! I won't do it!
0DI0018711	Shhh. Shhh. Can't sleep. Can't sleep. Shhh.
0DI0018712	Stop it, stop it, stop it!
0DI0018713	Stay in control. Stay in control.
0DI0018714	Not real. Don't look. Not real.
0DI0018715	Stop talking to me!
0DI0018717	Get outta my head!
0DI0018718	Thank you so much.
0DI0018719	I wonder what it's like to be able to "get going" whenever you like.
0DI0018720	I certainly hope so. It gets lonely down here on the floor.
0DI0018721	Well, thank you so much, so very much, for ruining my life.
0DI0018722	My problem is that I'm no longer a deputy. I'm just a Beagle now.
0DI0018723	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that - all new.
0DI0018724	He's rude. Just don't tell him I said it. Primm has a sheriff now, just not as supportive as I would've hoped.
0DI0018726	Apparently two-and-a-half months of law enforcement experience doesn't count for anything. The new regime is just that: all new.
0DI0018727	He's a good sheriff but a hard man. He doesn't abide by anyone slinking by the rules. I guess there won't be any trouble, but the man's law is hard.
0DI0018729	Slimm is alright, I don't wish him no harm, but the law to him is a set of logic.
0DI0018730	Not everything is black and white, not sure a robot can ever understand that.
0DI0018731	Oh no! I'm just the deputy. And I can't be a deputy without a sheriff. It's called chain of command!
0DI0018732	But - but the town doesn't have a Sheriff! I don't have an employer, and that means I don't have a job.
0DI0018733	If you think you might be able to help, come find me. I thank you for all you've done.
0DI0018734	Maybe next time you can bring a new sheriff back with you!
0DI0018736	I do thank you so kindly for your efforts.
0DI0018737	Why, this is the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum - Primm's Primm-eer tourist attraction and resort destination! Yeehaw!
0DI0018738	Primm Slim at your service! Authentic cowpoke and official spokesbot of the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum! Yeehaw!
0DI0018739	Dang it. I hope you'll keep looking.
0DI0018740	Those thieves had some gall, stealing from a museum dedicated to romanticizing a couple of criminals!
0DI0018741	I'll make sure the gun ends up back on display. I thank you, Primm thanks you, and I do believe Vance'd thank you, if he could.
0DI0018742	Have it your way, pardner. Maybe work up your curiosity by having a look at thrilling exhibits like the genuine Death Car and Vance's machine gun!
0DI0018743	Yahoo! I ain't had a chance to tell their tale in a mess of years.
0DI0018744	First things first: any bosh you've heard about Vikki and Vance being copycats ain't nothing but ill-tempered slander.
0DI0018745	Fact is, they begun their crime spree two days before Bonnie and Clyde robbed their first bank - so who was copying who?
0DI0018746	Now true, Vikki and Vance didn't exactly cut a wide swath of murder and bank robbery across the central U.S., like Bonnie and Clyde did.
0DI0018747	It was more like a narrow swath of shoplifting, check-cashing fraud, and gas pump driveoffs - but crime is crime! They drove reckless, too.
0DI0018748	Having lived by the gun - well, Vance owned one, anyway - it was only fitting that the duo of desperados would die by the gun.
0DI0018749	Perhaps it was fate itself that accidentally drove them into a crossfire between police and a gang of bank robbers in Plano, Texas.
0DI0018750	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki would have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
0DI0018751	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire tore the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
0DI0018752	You can put your eyes on the genuine Death Car just over yonder, and there's Vance's machine gun in the case next to it!
0DI0018753	You got it, Pardner. Primm Slim loves to spin a yarn.
0DI0018760	Or maybe they just didn't notice until it was too late. It's been said that Vikki might have tried to cash a bad check in that bank, had she lived.
0DI0018761	We'll never know for sure. All we know is that the crossfire shot the car and both occupants to pieces, and the police issued an official apology.
0DI0018763	Me? I'm Sammy, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal duo!
0DI0018764	You better not mess with us or you'll end up face down in a shallow grave!
0DI0018765	We ain't never heard of you, either, so the not being impressed is mutual.
0DI0018766	Come a week or so, though, and everyone will've heard of Sammy and Pauline! Just you wait!
0DI0018767	I'm Pauline, of Sammy and Pauline, the wasteland's most dangerous and notorious criminal couple!
0DI0018768	You'd best not mess with us, or you'll have a bullet hole where your eye used to be!
0DI0018769	Simple! Up 'til now, we committed our crimes stealthily, leaving no evidence behind. So we never built a rep.
0DI0018770	But that's gonna change with our next score. You just wait and see.
0DI0018771	Why would I deny it? I was the one that hacked that Cowboy Robot while Vance kept him busy. Ain't the first thing we stole. Won't be the last.
0DI0018772	You'll see! You'll feel stupid that you made fun of us when you learn how rich we are!
0DI0018773	Well, you can call Beagle a deputy so long as you don't harbor too high an opinion of the word.
0DI0018774	Boy was 'bout as useful as tits on a radscorpion. Only qualification he ever had was to be brother to the wife of the sheriff.
0DI0018775	Still, I s'pose he don't deserve what's befell him. We would've considered paying the ransom, if we'd had caps to spare.
0DI0018776	I feel safer already. Meanwhile, there's still more of them Powder Gangers out there than I care to count.
0DI0018777	What we need around here is a real sheriff. Someone who can help fight off the next attack.
0DI0018778	Kind of too bad you didn't do it the other way around! Primm ain't got no future until rule of law comes back to town.
0DI0018779	Finally decided to make yourself useful, huh? If you can bring the law back to Primm, we'll all be in your debt.
0DI0018780	Ha! Well, you're polite, I'll give you that. If this was just between you and me, I'd do as you ask. But it's not.
0DI0018781	I had a friend with me when those mutant bastards came out of nowheres. She panicked and ran the wrong direction - further into the basement.
0DI0018782	She's probably dead, but I ain't leaving until I know for sure. I'd have gone looking myself, except I wouldn't last a minute out there.
0DI0018783	You, on the other hand, seem pretty resourceful. Find my friend, and I'll get out of your way.
0DI0018784	Then you're dumber than you look, smoothskin. Eat this!
0DI0018785	First off, I'm not trapped. This was a tactical choice, all right?
0DI0018786	I'm no match for those things out there, so I found a good defensive position, and I've been defending it, right?
0DI0018787	...Aw, who am I fooling? I'm trapped. Name's Harland. Pleased to meet you.
0DI0018788	What happened was, I was escorting folks down to work when those things attacked us.
0DI0018789	Most of the fight was upstairs, but some folks panicked and made for the basement. And I went after them.
0DI0018790	Well, turns out there were even more of those bastards down here than upstairs, and things went to shit fast.
0DI0018791	I couldn't find the others, so I fell back to this room and set up a nice little kill zone. End of story.
0DI0018792	I'm not delicate. Radroach meat for protein, condensation off the pipes for water, and I do my business over in the far corner.
0DI0018793	I wouldn't say it's been comfy.
0DI0018794	Guess the outfit gives that away, huh? I never did buy into that religious mumbo-jumbo with the robes and all that shit.
0DI0018795	It gets lonely out in the wastes, okay? And I don't have to tell you that Bright's group has got some fine-looking ghoulettes in it!
0DI0018796	Eh... or maybe I would have to tell you...
0DI0018797	Anyway, I helped them out, and they kept me supplied with ammo and pleasant company.
0DI0018798	I kill them on sight, so we haven't had much time to get acquainted.
0DI0018799	They're hard to see, obviously, but they aren't too smart when it comes to tactics. Or not stepping in traps.
0DI0018800	I'm not expecting good news, but keep looking.
0DI0018801	You must mean what's left of it. Somebody's been attacking our animals at night. We're down to less than half of what we had a few weeks back.
0DI0018802	Beg your pardon mister, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
0DI0018803	Not to mention what would happen if half of what No-bark says is true.
0DI0018804	Best we can hope is that whoever's doing this'll move on, or get tired of it. I just hope it happens while we still got animals left.
0DI0018805	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they've taken to shooting from the west side.
0DI0018806	Beg your pardon ma'am, but them two-headed beeves ain't worth getting shot over.
0DI0018809	Whoever it is, I don't think they're from around town. Seems like they're usually shooting from the west side.
0DI0018810	Losing don't describe it. It's a massacre. Few more days and there won't be nothing left to lose.
0DI0018811	Well I don't know how you done it, but I do know how I can thank you. Please take this, compliments of Alice and myself.
0DI0018812	And help yourself to anything in that freezer over yonder. We got more steaks in there than we'd be able to eat in a year.
0DI0018813	Well we surely appreciate for what you done for us. Even without our stock, just having peace of mind means the world to us.
0DI0018814	Take this, compliments of Alice and myself. We'd give you more if we could, knowing you risked your neck for us.
0DI0018815	Well don't worry yourself too much over it. We'll get by.
0DI0018816	We'd be grateful. Especially if you find 'em before they get my whole stock. But don't go getting yourself killed over it.
0DI0018817	Alice and I'll find a way to make do. Always have.
0DI0018818	Oh, I tend to my ranch, that's about it. Alice'll tell you. I don't get out a whole lot.
0DI0018819	You sure, now? It's kinda hard to hear you.
0DI0018820	Weird's just normal when normal decides to start taking notice of things. You just think about that.
0DI0018821	Now what'd you come here for?
0DI0018822	Let me know if you meet anyone suspicious.
0DI0018823	We'll just see about that. You come any closer and I'm liable to stick you with my stickin' knife. Ol' Sticky's feeling mighty ornery this day.
0DI0018824	Confound it, No-bark, you done it again. You let on that you know things. Now they'll never let you be.
0DI0018825	All right, stranger, you got me. What do you want to know?
0DI0018826	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, mister, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
0DI0018827	I give up! Please don't do no harm to me, missy, leastaways not my face. All I got left is my rugged good looks. What do you want to know?
0DI0018828	Okay, okay. Just speak up a little. But not so much that They hear you. They got people everywhere, always listening.
0DI0018829	'Cause they know I ain't just barking here. What I say's got bite, 'cause it's the truth.
0DI0018830	Them quack doctors can say what they want about all the radscorpion stings that done pierced my skull. I know what I seen.
0DI0018831	I'm not sure who started it. It wasn't a very nice name, but he took to calling himself by it, so we all had to.
0DI0018832	I don't even remember what his real name is.
0DI0018833	Anyway, I think it comes from that expression that people say when you're crazy - that not all of your dogs are barking. Poor No-bark.
0DI0018834	Molerat men, come up from the Underneath to steal young women with promises of riches and fancy mud mansions with all the latest designer appliances.
0DI0018835	They covet our ladyfolk's long hair for wigs, it's said, being either bald or balding themselves.
0DI0018836	I don't trust a man that doesn't have something strange going on about him, 'cause it means he's hiding it from you.
0DI0018837	If a man's wearing his pants on his head or if he says his words backwards from time to time, you know it's all laid out there for you.
0DI0018838	But if he's friendly to strangers and keeps his home spick-and-span, more often than not he's done something even his own ma couldn't forgive.
0DI0018839	Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.
0DI0018840	Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.
0DI0018841	I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes.
0DI0018842	Although being a scientist, I have to admit I might've just blinked for longer than usual, what with the shock of seeing a commie ghost and so forth.
0DI0018843	Seen it all. Seen shadowy folk come to his room and leave again in the middle of the night. Thought one might've gone in the lobby, too, for a spell.
0DI0018844	Could be that person went in to get something. Or use the john maybe. Mighty interesting either way, you ask me.
0DI0018845	I thought it was cannibals, come to eat us all for sure, so I kept out of sight. But now I know better.
0DI0018846	I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me.
0DI0018847	He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground.
0DI0018848	Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible.
0DI0018849	Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it.
0DI0018850	Walked right past me having an argument with somebody.
0DI0018851	But I only saw the one chupacabra, so I guess the other fella had to be invisible too. Only more invisible than the other one.
0DI0018852	There's been things of a disturbing nature going on at the McBride Corral.
0DI0018853	Seems every night one of their herd meets a most unnatural death, and always there's holes all over the body.
0DI0018854	Work of the chupacabra, the livestock vampire, says No-bark, but they don't pay no mind. Too many holes, they say, and there's bullets in them.
0DI0018855	Well, says No-bark, we got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we're in.
0DI0018856	Folks'll tell you that they seen ghouls up near the rocket factory.
0DI0018857	Sensationalist hooey, cooked up by superstitious yokels seeing phantoms of their own imagining.
0DI0018858	Good idea. It ain't safe to stay on the same topic for too long.
0DI0018860	Yeah, and I need sterile medical supplies. But let's see what I have with me.
0DI0018862	I'd love to help you out, but I'm pretty strapped here as it is. I really don't have anything to sell you.
0DI0018863	Hmm... well, I am better set for supplies now that you helped me out. I guess I can part with some of them.
0DI0018864	Here's what I've got.
0DI0018865	I suppose I have a few things around that I can spare.
0DI0018867	...drove the raiders off. No casualties. In the meantime-
0DI0018868	Patrol's back.
0DI0018869	They're late. I hope they've got a good excuse.
0DI0018870	What took-
0DI0018871	This is a message to the NCR from the Legion.
0DI0018872	We are coming for you. Run, and we will catch you. Hide, and we will find you. No matter what you do, you are all going to die.
0DI0018873	We took one of the women alive.
0DI0018874	Man, you name it.
0DI0018875	See, I grew up in North Vegas. Me and my cousins. We were some bad seeds. Got in with a gang. I loved it.
0DI0018876	Then something happened, and I couldn't handle it anymore.
0DI0018877	So, I enlisted. Earned my future. Brought down my best friend to share that future with me.
0DI0018878	And here was this woman who was too good for it, trying to take him away. So yeah. I didn't see eye-to-eye with the bitch.
0DI0018879	Boone's a sniper, same as me. Used to spot for him when we were enlisted with the NCR.
0DI0018880	After we got out, I talked him into settling down here. So, here we are.
0DI0018881	I'd introduce you, but uh... we're not so friendly right now.
0DI0018882	Me and his wife, we didn't see eye-to-eye on some things. We had some pretty big arguments.
0DI0018883	One day she turns up missing, and he hasn't said a word to me since.
0DI0018884	I understand your concern, Edgar, but the answer is no.
0DI0018885	Then what do you propose? Every day that he's here, the risk increases.
0DI0018886	And our chances of exposure might be one hundred percent if we act rashly.
0DI0018887	Better that than not act at all!
0DI0018888	No, I will not endanger the entire chapter so recklessly.
0DI0018889	Look, I've made my decision. Abide by it. I have other matters to attend to.
0DI0018890	You took an extreme risk in coming here. My policy towards trespassers has not been... lenient.
0DI0018891	The security of this bunker is my foremost concern, and I take pains to minimize our exposure topside.
0DI0018892	For this reason, I might be interested in contracting with an outsider, who can accomplish certain tasks - some basic, some a bit more... involved.
0DI0018893	An NCR Ranger has begun to set up post in one of the other bunkers up top, for example. I want him driven off. Understood?
0DI0018894	How do you know he won't be missed, that other rangers won't come looking for him? Or NCR patrols? Did you just make matters worse?
0DI0018895	Indeed he did. The collar includes a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
0DI0018896	Had you told him the location of this bunker, for example... well, let's just say we wouldn't be having this conversation.
0DI0018897	Given the circumstances, termination was the best option - so your actions demonstrated loyalty, good judgment, and prowess in combat.
0DI0018898	That's right. Because you did nothing to find out. Your collar was rigged with a microphone, you see. Part of the test.
0DI0018899	It would seem you are a brute, but even a brute can be of use. Particularly one capable of taking down an NCR Ranger one on one.
0DI0018900	Since you completed your assigned task, I will allow you to come and go from the bunker freely. So let's get that collar off you.
0DI0018901	There, that's better, I hope. Now that we have that bit of unpleasantness out of the way, there is a matter that I would like to discuss with you.
0DI0018902	Stop by the command room when you can. Oh, and bear in mind, if you end up betraying us, we will know it - and there will be no mercy.
0DI0018903	Gone? Why did he leave? And what makes you think he won't be back?
0DI0018904	Very well. I'll be interested to see how thoroughly and efficiently you carry out your mission.
0DI0018905	Paladin Ramos will escort you back to the bunker's entrance and set you loose. Notice that I said "loose," not "free."
0DI0018906	You are not free to carry the secret of this bunker's location beyond Hidden Valley - until I'm convinced that you're capable and dependable.
0DI0018907	To underscore this point, you'll be fitted with an explosive collar. Wander off, and it will detonate. Focus on your mission, and you'll be fine.
0DI0018908	Bored already? You should try living down here. Sorry, but I don't really have- oh, for Pete's sake, not again.
0DI0018909	Great, looks like they're going at it again.
0DI0018910	Give it a few moments. This won't take long, trust me.
0DI0018911	Ha! Just having some fun with you, waster. No harm done, right? What can I do for you?
0DI0018912	Exactly what powder ganger scum would say! Any last words before I pull this trigger?
0DI0018913	Relax, son. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?
0DI0018914	Relax, little lady. Just pulling your leg. What can I do for you?
0DI0018915	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Got some stones on you, son. I like that. What can I do for you?
0DI0018916	[SUCCEEDED] Ha! Got some claws on you, little lady. I like that. What can I do for you?
0DI0018917	[FAILED] I'll point my rifle at anything and anyone I please to! Got that, powder ganger?
0DI0018918	You did not just destroy my radio.
0DI0018919	You bastard! Those ghouls declared me a Saint!
0DI0018920	I suppose there was always that risk. It's just that Jason was so certain...
0DI0018921	You don't seem to understand how close you are to being erased from existence. Will you, or will you not comply?
0DI0018922	There's nothing to talk over. You can strip down and hand over your equipment, or you can die. Will you comply?
0DI0018923	I've told you what to do. Strip off your clothes and equipment, or face summary execution. Will you comply?
0DI0018924	You don't. Ever. You don't even think about it.
0DI0018925	Even if we did recruit trespassers, you're far too old for us. Your relationship to technology has already been perverted.
0DI0018926	Okay. I'll take you to him. Follow me. Closely. Or you'll be shot.
0DI0018927	[You hear nothing.]
0DI0018936	Yes. Permanently, I'm afraid.
0DI0018937	Guess you'll be needing to find some, huh? Come back when you do.
0DI0018938	One's enough to make a helping. Hand it over!
0DI0018939	Hand 'em over and I'll get to baking!
0DI0018940	Is that right? Then hand 'em over and I'll get to baking a whole batch of casseroles!
0DI0018941	Does sound good, don't it? How many radscorpion glands you got?
0DI0018942	Let's see. Been tough around here for a good while now. Worse since them thugs kidnapped our deputy.
0DI0018943	It started with that breakout from the prison up the road. First there was just a few thugs rolling through town, but then they got organized.
0DI0018944	Now they call themselves Powder Gangsters or something, and run around throwing dynamite and shooting people.
0DI0018945	Little while ago a good chunk of them left whatever kind of organization they got up there to squeeze all the food and drink out of us they could.
0DI0018946	Sure, have a look.
0DI0018947	Well yes and no. My shop's got plenty of stock.
0DI0018948	Problem is I ain't going into my shop until I know it's good and safe.
0DI0018949	Give me a moment to get back to my shop and I'll show you my stock.
0DI0018950	Things are pretty good with Meyers watching over us. I can give you a little bit of a discount.
0DI0018951	Yep, and I got more ammunition now that the NCR keeps supplies flowing in.
0DI0018952	On the other hand I'm payin' them NCR taxes, so now you got to as well.
0DI0018953	We got rule of law again, but of the martial variety. NCR orders us around like junior soldiers. Better than lawlessness, though.
0DI0018954	Got a new sheriff, as you know. Meyer's a bit rougher-hewn than I might've liked, but he seems like a good sort. So far, so good.
0DI0018955	We know Primm is a great strategic point, and we aren't blind to the needs of the town, but we're barely holding our own against the Powder Gangers.
0DI0018956	We don't have the guns or the personnel needed to carry out our mission, much less take on defending this town as well.
0DI0018957	Have you gotten us any additional support yet?
0DI0018958	Yes, I just got word of that. There's a squad of rangers standing by.
0DI0018959	Sergeant McGee will take over as sheriff and the rangers will be his deputies. This town will be an NCR territory.
0DI0018960	This means that aside from protection, the citizens will also need to become registered NCR citizens and pay any appropriate and associated taxes.
0DI0018961	That ranger squad is still standing by, and McGee is anxious to take over as sheriff. Are you ready for me to make the call?
0DI0018962	Yeah, good luck with that.
0DI0018963	We were sent out here to hold back the tide of convicts from the correctional facility.
0DI0018964	As you can probably tell, we aren't doing the kind of job we could be doing.
0DI0018965	I'm from Hub originally, but it's been a long time since I saw it. I'm on my second tour here. Most Non-Commissioned Officers are.
0DI0018966	Do you think I'm blind? Of course I can see the Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
0DI0018967	You have any other obvious facts you'd like to share? Don't fist fight with Deathclaws? No kissing Cazadores?
0DI0018968	I can't imagine that deputy of theirs is worth more than a spit. I was on lookout when he got frog marched over to Bison Steve.
0DI0018969	If I had a long rifle or the order I would have taken out the Powder Gangers to save him, but I didn't. His tough shit I guess.
0DI0018970	I'm Manny. I'm on security detail here.
0DI0018971	You see a rifle barrel sticking out of the dinosaur's mouth, you got a fifty-fifty shot it's me. Otherwise it's Boone.
0DI0018972	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. He might not have done a goddamn thing.
0DI0018973	Goddamn it. This wasn't supposed to be a guess. She might not have done a goddamn thing.
0DI0018974	Get out. I don't ever want to see you here again. And you stay the hell away from me.
0DI0018975	You don't want to do that.
0DI0018976	Well, that's about all the proof I could hope for, I guess. Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
0DI0018977	I don't know. I won't be staying, I know that. Don't see much point in anything right now, except hunting legionaries.
0DI0018978	Maybe I'll wander, like you.
0DI0018979	Yeah. That might be true. And that's reason enough for me to take you up on it, I suppose. But this isn't gonna end well.
0DI0018980	Fine. Let's get out of here.
0DI0018981	No. People die out there. Often enough that no one worries about blame. They're too anxious to forget it happened in the first place, I guess.
0DI0018982	Besides. I was on break when it happened.
0DI0018983	Hnh. Yeah. Working on your own, you're a lot less effective. I've been there and paid for it.
0DI0018984	But this isn't gonna end well.
0DI0018985	You've done enough for me. What's coming next, that's something for me to deal with on my own.
0DI0018986	Not unless you give me a reason.
0DI0018987	Wait. You just got into town. Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
0DI0018988	I guess I shouldn't be surprised. It'd be like them to keep paperwork.
0DI0018989	Here. This is all I can give. I think our dealings are done here.
0DI0018990	I don't have friends here.
0DI0018991	I know, all right? And that's all you need to know.
0DI0018992	You didn't have any proof?
0DI0018993	Don't come here again till it's over.
0DI0018994	There's nothing up here.
0DI0018995	I think you'd better leave.
0DI0018996	I don't know who you think you're kidding. I've lived here for more than a year.
0DI0018997	Anyway, I need someone I can trust, and you may be a liar, but you're also a stranger. And that's a start.
0DI0018998	No. No you're not, are you? Maybe you shouldn't go. Not just yet.
0DI0018999	I said it was a start. This town... nobody looks me straight in the eye anymore.
0DI0019002	My wife's dead. I want the son of a bitch who sold her.
0DI0019003	Yeah. I guess maybe I am. But not like you.
0DI0019004	Huh. Maybe it should've been you I was expecting all along.
0DI0019005	Why are you here?
0DI0019006	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join him.
0DI0019007	You sick bastard. You'd better be ready to join her.
0DI0019008	I want you to find something out for me. I don't know if there's anything to find, but I need someone to try.
0DI0019009	My wife was taken from our home by Legion slavers one night while I was on watch.
0DI0019010	They knew when to come and what route to take, and they only took Carla. Someone set it up. I don't know who.
0DI0019011	Bring him out in front of the nest here while I'm on duty. I work nights.
0DI0019012	I'll give you my NCR beret to put on. It'll be our signal, so I know you're standing with him.
0DI0019013	And I'll take care of the rest. I need to do this myself.
0DI0019014	Find out who had Carla kidnapped. Bring him out in front of the dinosaur while I'm working my shift.
0DI0019015	Let me know it's him by putting on the beret I gave you. That's it. Now go on.
0DI0019016	I need someone I can trust. You're a stranger. That's a start.
0DI0019017	Yeah, looks that way.
0DI0019018	If that doesn't work, you could always try using some chems.
0DI0019019	Suits me - I've got plenty of other patients to take care of.
0DI0019020	Heh. Good luck with that. Just try to remember the Cazadores crawling out of your skin aren't real.
0DI0019021	But on the off chance they are, come back and see me.
0DI0019022	You're making a mistake, but that's just my opinion. What do I know, after all? I've only studied medicine my entire life.
0DI0019027	Okay, there you are. The convulsions should stop in the next one to twelve weeks. If they don't, try holding on to something that's very still.
0DI0019028	All right, there you go. And don't complain about the taste.
0DI0019029	And there we go. Now, try to stay off the stuff, you hear?
0DI0019030	Why didn't you say so? No problem. I'll give you my free cure. Here, lean in. It's a special doctor secret.
0DI0019031	Stop doing chems!
0DI0019032	Hey, I'd love to help you out of the goodness of my heart, but I have an awful lot of patients to consider.
0DI0019033	There, that's got it. Do be so eager to sample dangerous substances in the future, okay?
0DI0019034	Sorry, my supplies are rather limited, and we can only get more by trading. Which requires money. Money you don't have. Come back when you have some.
0DI0019038	Guns? I, uh, well... yeah, I guess I might have a few.
0DI0019039	Darn it. No one ever buys the t-rexes.
0DI0019042	Well, a friend of Jeannie May's is a friend of mine. And my friends get a discount at my store.
0DI0019043	Liar! The invoice said Stealth Boys here! Antler read it out loud to me!
0DI0019044	Yeah. Twice. Actually the first time it was more like half my body. Knocked me out of the Rangers.
0DI0019045	This time it's mostly just reminded me how useless I've gotten.
0DI0019046	A few years back, we get a tip that some Legion slavers were holed up in this burnt out house a few klicks from where we were stationed.
0DI0019047	We get there and it's deserted. No sign anyone's been there. I mean nothing. As we're leaving, I hear something behind me.
0DI0019048	I turn around and there's this kid, just skin and bone, and he's looking up at us and he's scared half to death. Been hiding in a closet.
0DI0019050	Sorry you feel that way. Then again, I'm not so sure I want to know who did this, myself.
0DI0019051	Obviously you don't know the first damn thing about the Rangers. Without them, nobody in these parts would be safe.
0DI0019052	No, I'm getting all worked up for nothing. Those boys are just fine.
0DI0019053	Those were good men at the station. Good men. This whole town was sleeping a lot easier because of them.
0DI0019054	At least they gave somebody some hell on their way out.
0DI0019058	God damn it! I just spoke to them the other day. If this is some kind of sick joke-
0DI0019059	<Sighs> Nah, that'd be too far, even for those guys.
0DI0019060	Listen, this could be trouble for all of us. Whoever did this is still out there, and they might come this way.
0DI0019061	If you can find out who did this, we can be better prepared to deal with them if they come through here.
0DI0019063	Now, who knows what we're in for? The Legion? Christ, we'd be better off with Raiders.
0DI0019067	Heh. People don't exactly line up to find out what's in my head. Can't remember the last time someone suggested I knew something worth knowing.
0DI0019068	You know, maybe there's something I can do for you. Since you've gone to all the trouble of flattering a crippled old soldier.
0DI0019071	Was. Was with them. That was back when my arm and leg used to work better.
0DI0019072	I still like to pretend I'm a Ranger, though. I'll check in with the guys up at the station pretty regular on the ham radio.
0DI0019073	Sometimes they stop by, tell me they're paying their respects, the smug bastards.
0DI0019074	They haven't been responding to me, last couple of days. I guess they got tired of hearing me talk, but it's still got me a little worried.
0DI0019075	Hell, listen to me talk. Like some damn mother hen.
0DI0019076	Please, if you know the truth, tell me. Those guys were friends of mine.
0DI0019077	Okay. Keep me posted.
0DI0019078	Yes, that's Isotope-239, all right. And there's enough here to launch the rockets.
0DI0019079	You already brought me the thrust control modules, so all I need now is three boxes of Sugar Bombs.
0DI0019082	Let me see. Yes, that's the igniting agent! But we'll need more of these souvenirs. A total of five should do it...
0DI0019086	Really? I never thought I'd see the day.
0DI0019087	I mean... the day I'd part with them for such an incredibly low price. With so many other offers flooding in.
0DI0019088	But I like you. I think maybe it's time. All that's left is in this storage room here. You can buy the key from my store.
0DI0019089	Well, let's see. Dusty McBride's been losing some Brahmin, but that's probably the heat more than anything. Honestly, it's been real quiet.
0DI0019090	Ranger Andy's still hurt, but we got these two gentlemen snipers watching the road day and night, keeping the trash out of Novac.
0DI0019091	They've been a blessing.
0DI0019092	Oh, what am I doing? I got to thinking about making a good impression and plain forgot to tell you my name.
0DI0019093	I'm Jeannie May. I take care of folks here at the motel. Long as they aren't trouble makers.
0DI0019094	Well it is. Not everybody appreciates it like they oughtta.
0DI0019095	Go see Cliff Briscoe at the Dino Bite Gift Shop, and tell him I sent you.
0DI0019096	I think he gets lonely standing around in that dino belly all day. He'll be glad for the company.
0DI0019097	Well, there's Dinky, the town mascot. He's a sight. You probably already saw him when you came in, but you can go up inside, too.
0DI0019098	Up the road a ways to the west, there's REPCONN. That's the old rocket factory.
0DI0019099	There's been some sinister characters out there lately, so you may want to stay clear.
0DI0019100	Other than that, nothing to do but take it easy and enjoy good company.
0DI0019101	We're in a little desert oasis, name of Novac. This is the Dino Dee-lite Motel, and it's mine.
0DI0019102	I take no pleasure in hiding the truth from Chris. But it is the creator's will, to which I must submit.
0DI0019103	I understand if that's how you feel. But keep in mind that I've been selling these for years and I'm fine.
0DI0019104	I'm sure the kids that buy them are all fine too.
0DI0019105	[SUCCEEDED] I, ah, well I don't really know. Would that sour you on buying one if it did?
0DI0019106	Gather, all. May the creator guide my words and help me speak true...
0DI0019107	The almighty creator has seen fit to answer our prayers. The time has come for us to board the rockets and begin the Great Journey.
0DI0019108	Though it may seem that all humans despise us, the creator has seen fit to instruct us differently.
0DI0019109	The Journey ahead would have been impossible if not for the intercession of two human friends, one new, the other a long-abiding companion.
0DI0019110	But we have no hope of completing the Great Journey without your help!
0DI0019111	I pray that you will reconsider, wanderer.
0DI0019112	Praise the creator. Bless you, wanderer! Bless us all!
0DI0019113	With the underground rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
0DI0019115	As soon as the underground has been rid of demons, preparations for the Great Journey can resume!
0DI0019116	Great. Here you go!
0DI0019117	Really? I mean, that's great! I'm sure you'll be quite pleased with it.
0DI0019118	Oh, that? It's just a bit west of Novac, up in the mountains. Lots of broken equipment and such. Place is deserted. Or used to be, I guess.
0DI0019119	Lately there's been talk of ghouls up that way, but I can't rightly say whether it's so or not. If you want to know more, ask old No-bark.
0DI0019120	They're scale replicas of the real thing. Very detailed. Got a liquid in them that makes them glow.
0DI0019121	From what I hear, REPCONN used to give them out on tours of their HQ up in Henderson.
0DI0019122	But I guess they had to stop after the first few kids thought they were filled with Nuka Cola and drank it down.
0DI0019123	The papers had a name for the condition and everything. They called it the "REPCONN Shakes." Those were bad times for RobCo.
0DI0019124	Well, there's t-rex figurines, of course. That's our bread and butter.
0DI0019125	We also have an assortment of the REPCONN factory souvenirs - rockets, things of that nature.
0DI0019127	Yeah, I heard it too.
0DI0019128	No, you just hearing things again.
0DI0019129	Yeah, I hear it too.
0DI0019130	Ready as I'll ever be.
0DI0019131	Here it comes.
0DI0019133	To the Bone Orchard you go!
0DI0019134	Draw, pardner!
0DI0019135	Howdy, pardner!
0DI0019136	I'm game.
0DI0019137	Let's get this over with.
0DI0019138	I'm with ya!
0DI0019141	Here I go.
0DI0019142	I'm comin', too!
0DI0019143	This'll be fun!
0DI0019144	Been years since I did this.
0DI0019145	Let's get 'em!
0DI0019146	This should be over quick.
0DI0019147	Leave it to me.
0DI0019148	It's on.
0DI0019149	Bring it on.
0DI0019150	You're done for.
0DI0019154	I made you do this!
0DI0019155	Lay into me! I deserve it!
0DI0019156	Uh oh! I did something bad!
0DI0019157	Take positions!
0DI0019159	Cover me!
0DI0019162	Got it covered.
0DI0019163	Fighting's not my strong suit, but I'll see what I can do.
0DI0019164	I'm on it.
0DI0019165	Right with you.
0DI0019167	Sure, boss. You lead the charge, I'll follow as fast as my arthritic, rotting knees can carry me.
0DI0019168	You want to send an elderly, half-decrepit ghoul into combat? Your tactical brilliance is unmatched, boss.
0DI0019169	Sure thing, boss. You betcha.
0DI0019170	Well now, what's all this.
0DI0019171	Looks like a party.
0DI0019172	Caught me good and pissed.
0DI0019173	Don't worry, pumpkin, grandma's here to help!
0DI0019174	Grandma's coming, babies!
0DI0019175	Leo! Try not to chop our friends this time!
0DI0019177	Leave some for me!
0DI0019178	I want to get some licks in, too!
0DI0019179	Yeah, let's show them how Kings rumble.
0DI0019180	Engaging.
0DI0019181	Entering combat.
0DI0019182	Use of force authorized.
0DI0019197	Never! Antler protects! You feel Antler's horns now!
0DI0019198	A human who is friend to ghouls? Suspicious.
0DI0019199	You mean the ones upstairs. Antler used intercom, told them stay put. But they want to come down in basement anyways?
0DI0019200	I cannot allow. My kin are... not right in head like I am. They attack you on sight. Ghouls too. They crazy.
0DI0019201	Your ghoul friends have to wait until you find what Antler brought us to get.
0DI0019202	No trouble wanted? Too bad. Trouble finds you!
0DI0019203	You come here for a reason, human! Antler say so!
0DI0019204	You do as Antler says, or you feel Antler's horns!
0DI0019206	But invoice note said Stealth Boys were here! Why can't that note be true?
0DI0019207	What, Antler? ...But human could be lying! Stealing the Stealth Boys for itself!
0DI0019208	Oh, Antler... You trust so easy...
0DI0019209	Your lucky day, human. Antler believe you. Nightkin will follow the new note to find Stealth Boys. Better be there.
0DI0019210	Me? I am devoted to Antler. But before Antler? Hmm...
0DI0019211	Captain, once. Last name, Davison. First name... don't remember.
0DI0019212	I commanded a troop of Nightkin. The Master's elite. A great honor, very proud.
0DI0019213	Something happened. We wandered the desert. Life without Master was... hard. The others' minds going strange, going crazy.
0DI0019214	But then I found us new master. I find us Antler!
0DI0019215	Since then, everything's been going really well.
0DI0019216	A ghoul. But not squishy like others. This ghoul is tough.
0DI0019217	I thought Antler said send my kin into that room, but three died. Ghoul is a crack shot and set traps too.
0DI0019218	After, I realize I heard Antler wrong. So I lock the door to keep kin out and wait for Antler to tell me what to do.
0DI0019219	Then you come along. Antler says you are solution.
0DI0019220	Pay attention when I speak! I said ghoul is a crack shot and sets traps!
0DI0019221	Too dangerous for us. Okay for you.
0DI0019222	Good. Antler brought us here for a reason... Why was that, Antler?
0DI0019223	Right! A piece of paper. Shipment invoice. Hundreds of Stealth Boys, sent here a long time ago...
0DI0019224	But Stealth Boys must be in the one room one we don't search yet - the one we can't search.
0DI0019225	Told you already. Antler wants Nightkin to have all the Stealth Boys in the bad room. With the ghoul.
0DI0019226	What you saying, human?
0DI0019227	Yes, Antler says we leave here as soon as we get Stealth Boys.
0DI0019228	Let me give you key. Antler had me lock the door. The ghoul inside not expecting a human. Maybe he don't shoot you. Maybe he will.
0DI0019231	Keep looking... Antler wants Nightkin to have them.
0DI0019232	Find them or Antler's horns find you.
0DI0019233	On it!
0DI0019234	I'm with you!
0DI0019251	Sir, I regret to inform you that this unit cannot accept orders from an officer under a Court Martial!
0DI0019253	Huh. Well, let me know when there's room for me.
0DI0019254	I'm ready when you are.
0DI0019259	I'm just saying that if it were to "fall" into Lake Mead and be irreparably damaged... and if you threw an EMP grenade in after it...
0DI0019263	A courier, doctor, and a cybernetic dog. After we deal with the whole "imminent conquest of New Vegas" problem, we should open an act at the Tops.
0DI0019264	Words cannot contain my excitement at the chance to throw myself headlong into danger with you again, boss.
0DI0019265	Let's go make trouble.
0DI0019266	Ooo. Sorry. Don't want to be a third wheel, you know?
0DI0019269	[Rex growls at ED-E's presence.]
0DI0019271	Can't be any worse than here.
0DI0019272	All right then, let's get the train rolling.
0DI0019274	Not in the mood for a threesome. Today.
0DI0019275	What, you teasing me? Lose one, then ask me again.
0DI0019276	That'd be lovely, dearie.
0DI0019280	You wanna do something different?
0DI0019281	Oh, this should be good. I mean, what's on your mind, boss?
0DI0019282	I'll defer to your judgment, naturally.
0DI0019283	Am I punching too much? I get carried away.
0DI0019287	Tactics ain't the word I'd use.
0DI0019288	So talk then.
0DI0019289	Got my attention.
0DI0019290	Of course, dearie, I'll do whatever you want. I can't make any promises about Leo, though.
0DI0019291	If you think it'll help.
0DI0019292	I'll do my best.
0DI0019293	In what way, boss?
0DI0019294	My recommendation - more punching.
0DI0019297	My style suits me just fine. But go ahead anyway.
0DI0019298	Well, we all ain't got Pip-VATS on our wrists.
0DI0019299	You expecting a fight?
0DI0019300	Ohhh, Leo might not like that, but I'll try, sweetheart.
0DI0019301	No arguing here.
0DI0019302	As long as we're not here all day.
0DI0019303	Long as it's not a lecture.
0DI0019305	Not a problem.
0DI0019307	Whatever you say, boss.
0DI0019308	Yeah. Shake things up a little.
0DI0019310	<pant pant>
0DI0019311	Whatever you like, dearie.
0DI0019315	Count me in.
0DI0019319	Road's not getting any shorter.
0DI0019320	All right, let's get this caravan rolling.
0DI0019321	Don't you want to give grandma some sugar first?
0DI0019322	Not my strong suit, but okay.
0DI0019323	Right. Got it. I'll just stop using this melee weapon and instead use a melee weapon. Good idea, boss.
0DI0019324	If you would like me to die very rapidly, this is clearly the best tactical choice.
0DI0019325	Sure, I'll stop using my rather effective gun and switch to, ah, this piece of metal tubing here. Great plan, boss.
0DI0019326	You mean like this melee weapon right here in my hand at this very second?
0DI0019327	Yes! Finally. Everything's coming up Veronica.
0DI0019330	[Rex defaults to melee attacks since he has no ranged weapons.]
0DI0019331	All right. <Cracks knuckles>
0DI0019332	As long as I'm not bringing a knife to a shootout.
0DI0019333	Good, my fists were getting bored.
0DI0019334	Gives me a chance to practice my backhand.
0DI0019335	Throw some whiskey in the mix, and I'm game.
0DI0019336	Time to make some new friends.
0DI0019337	Oh dearie me, I thought I already was! Have I been confused all this time?
0DI0019338	Oh, I'm so glad, peanut. Leo finds chopping people so much easier.
0DI0019339	Yeah, you and me both.
0DI0019340	You mean like the one I'm already using, boss?
0DI0019341	No arguments from me.
0DI0019342	Sure thing, boss.
0DI0019345	Does jumping at them with my fists count as ranged? <Sighs> Fine.
0DI0019346	Are you talking to me, or a future Veronica who is not already doing that?
0DI0019347	[Rex is incapable of ranged attacks and will continue using melee attacks.]
0DI0019348	Could use a little target practice.
0DI0019350	Dad'd approve.
0DI0019351	Line the bottles up, I'm ready.
0DI0019352	Well, if you insist, but Leo isn't going to like it much.
0DI0019353	Now now, dearie, there's no need to repeat yourself. Grandma hears just fine.
0DI0019354	What, I got whiskey on my breath?
0DI0019355	Look, if you ripped one, I don't care.
0DI0019356	Washed a hundred times, Brahmin smell never gets out.
0DI0019357	Sorry - travelling the Mojave don't exactly leave me smelling like a rose.
0DI0019358	Just tell me where you want me.
0DI0019359	We can do that.
0DI0019360	What are you saying, exactly?
0DI0019361	Am I stepping on your shoes or something, boss?
0DI0019364	What's the matter, dearie? Afraid grandma will embarass you in front of your little friends?
0DI0019365	What's the matter, dearie? Do you miss having grandma close by?
0DI0019366	Any closer and you'd need a Rad-Away, boss.
0DI0019367	Okay, I'll keep it tight.
0DI0019368	I'm not going to wander off, but okay.
0DI0019369	Hey, now. You're gonna have to buy me dinner first.
0DI0019370	This is as close as I get until you turn into a leggy brunette.
0DI0019371	Sorry. I get distracted. Been scavenging too long.
0DI0019372	Oh, I wouldn't dream of getting too far away, boss.
0DI0019375	About as close as I can get without crawling up your ass.
0DI0019376	Any closer, I'm stepping in your boots.
0DI0019377	Already am... 'less you're getting fresh on me.
0DI0019378	Gonna need a wedding ring first.
0DI0019379	Sorry, was lagging behind there.
0DI0019380	Keep your shirt on, I'm coming.
0DI0019381	All right, I'll rein it in.
0DI0019382	Bringing up the rear.
0DI0019383	If I get any closer, I might squish you! And that would make grandma sad.
0DI0019384	Aww, someone misses grandma!
0DI0019385	I'm always eager for more of your scintillating conversation, boss.
0DI0019388	See? I'm good at stuff.
0DI0019393	What can grandma do for her little pumpkin?
0DI0019396	Good talk.
0DI0019400	Grandma's right behind you, sugar!
0DI0019402	All right, enough jabbering.
0DI0019403	That's what I do best.
0DI0019404	They'll never see the haymakers coming.
0DI0019405	Wherever you want me. No problem.
0DI0019406	You mean like the last time you told me to do that, boss?
0DI0019407	Got it. I'll be way back here, boss.
0DI0019410	Like your thinking.
0DI0019411	Sweetie, I think knows a little something about chopping evil people. That's what I've been doing.
0DI0019412	All right, dear, grandma will stay out of your way - but I'll be close enough to hear if you call!'
0DI0019414	Yeah. Screw them.
0DI0019416	Don't strain yourself, boss.
0DI0019419	Fine, let's focus on the bad guys.
0DI0019420	Waste of time, anyway.
0DI0019421	Fine. All this planning won't matter much when the bullets fly, anyway.
0DI0019422	He's making a move! Stop him!
0DI0019423	She's making a move! Stop her!
0DI0019424	Coward!
0DI0019425	All right, I'll just get my scalpel here, and... ugh. Did I leave that sitting outside? Well, you know what? Free tetanus shot!
0DI0019426	Okay. Hold still.
0DI0019427	Okay, that's about the best I can do. Try not to get hurt that bad again, it's not like I've got an endless supply of bandages.
0DI0019428	All right, just hold steady. Want a shot of whiskey to calm your nerves? Mind if I have one? Heh heh, little doctor humor there.
0DI0019429	Darn it! That money was going to help pay to get me some medical training.
0DI0019431	Then I'm sorry, but I don't have any treatment for you. My priority is helping the refugees here at this camp.
0DI0019433	This might take a while. Close your eyes and try to relax, and we'll begin.
0DI0019434	I'm afraid protocol prevents me from treating you then.
0DI0019446	This shouldn't take too long. Just close your eyes and relax.
0DI0019456	Darn it...
0DI0019457	What a waste...
0DI0019458	Meaner than a rattlesnake, ain't ya?
0DI0019459	Goldurnit!
0DI0019460	Damn it to hell!
0DI0019462	Damn...
0DI0019463	Shame...
0DI0019464	Goddamn it!
0DI0019465	Blast it!
0DI0019466	God dammit...
0DI0019467	You'll pay for that...
0DI0019469	Fucker!
0DI0019470	Now you've gone and done it.
0DI0019473	Press on!
0DI0019474	Keep fighting!
0DI0019475	Rest in peace, Brother.
0DI0019476	You will be avenged, Brother.
0DI0019479	Ah, hell.
0DI0019480	Dammit!
0DI0019481	Et in Arcadia ego.
0DI0019482	Oh! Dammit.
0DI0019483	Well, crap.
0DI0019485	Their trouble's all gone.
0DI0019486	Gone to their reward.
0DI0019487	Running out of friends...
0DI0019488	One of ours is down!
0DI0019489	Wake up, sleepyhead! Wake up? ...Please?
0DI0019490	Oh, no! Grandma's little pumpkin! Rraaaargh!
0DI0019491	We've got a man down here!
0DI0019495	Time to die, Outsider!
0DI0019496	Damn, there goes a big earner.
0DI0019497	Fuck, that's not good.
0DI0019498	I'm gonna kick your ass.
0DI0019499	You wanna piece of this?
0DI0019500	Let's get this goin'.
0DI0019501	Hm.
0DI0019504	Bastard!
0DI0019505	Think you can take me down too?
0DI0019506	I'm going to blow you to pieces.
0DI0019507	Stupid shit.
0DI0019508	Oh yeah! That means more for me.
0DI0019509	Let's rock.
0DI0019510	I'm going to make you bleed.
0DI0019511	Alright, its on now!
0DI0019518	You bastard!
0DI0019521	Made me mad now!
0DI0019522	Try killing me!
0DI0019523	You die next!
0DI0019524	Partner unit disabled.
0DI0019525	Destruction of law officers is a capital offense.
0DI0019534	Signing off.
0DI0019535	<Singing>
0DI0019564	Grandma's here! Grandma's here!
0DI0019565	Oh, my goodness, look at these little angels! Becky, that dress looks so lovely! And Jimmy, my word how you've grown!
0DI0019567	Did you bring us presents, grandma?
0DI0019568	Well, now, I don't know... have you been good for your mommy and daddy?
0DI0019569	Yes!
0DI0019570	Well, then, let grandma see what she's got....
0DI0019571	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our program. This is Mr. New Vegas, and each and every one of you is wonderful in your own special way.
0DI0019572	Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is Mr. New Vegas. Thank you very very much for listening.
0DI0019573	Hello ladies and gentlemen. Mr. New Vegas here. You're all so great, we're gonna keep you listening all day.
0DI0019574	Howdy folks, it's Mr. New Vegas, and I have a good feeling about all of you listening.
0DI0019575	Welcome back to the Mr. New Vegas Show, the show with, in my opinion - which I respect - the best looking audience around. Somebody prove me wrong.
0DI0019576	Me again, Mr. New Vegas, reminding you that you're nobody till somebody loves you. And that somebody is me. I love you.
0DI0019577	Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to me, Mr. New Vegas, and you look extraordinarily beautiful right now.
0DI0019578	This is Radio New Vegas, and I'm your host, Mr. New Vegas. And in case you're wondering if you've come to the right place, you have.
0DI0019579	You know, I tried to measure my charisma on a Vit-o-matic Vigor Tester once. The machine burst into flames.
0DI0019580	The women of New Vegas ask me a lot if there's a Mrs. New Vegas. Of course there is. You're her. And you're still as perfect as the day we met.
0DI0019581	This is Mr. New Vegas, fanning the flames of your passion.
0DI0019582	And we're back. This is Mr. New Vegas, and I feel something magic in the air tonight. And I'm not just talking about the gamma radiation.
0DI0019583	Welcome back to the program. This is Mr. New Vegas, and I hope I'm not comin' on too strong.
0DI0019584	You're listening to Radio New Vegas, your little jukebox in the Mojave Wasteland. I'm Mr. New Vegas, and I'm here for you.
0DI0019585	Hey, it's Mr. New Vegas, letting you know I've got a new Christmas compilation coming out soon. Nuclear Winter Wonderland. Look for it on holotape.
0DI0019586	Bravo, come in, Bravo. Is anyone out there?
0DI0019587	The camp was attacked. I think I'm the only one left alive.
0DI0019588	We were attacked by some kind of freak mutants from the caves. Please send backup!
0DI0019589	God damn leg... I don't know how much longer I'm going to make it before I bleed out.
0DI0019590	Bravo, this is Camp Guardian calling for backup. No sign of the rest of the men stationed here.
0DI0019591	This is Private Halford requesting backup. Anyone out there?
0DI0019592	Guardian is down. I repeat Guardian is down. Requesting backup from any nearby forces.
0DI0019593	Those beasts drug the rest of the men away. Oh God, I hope they don't come back for me.
0DI0019594	Uh... Am I broadcasting? I'm broadcasting? Shit, ok. This is the NCR Emergency channel. It sounds like the Hoover Dam is under attack. Stay tuned.
0DI0019595	Rangers have managed to hold off a Legion attack at Camp Golf. Some casualties, but Camp Golf stands.
0DI0019596	Rangers have barely managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. The numbers had not yet been reinforced to replace the missing troops.
0DI0019597	Camp Golf has fallen! Apparently a small group of troopers broke rank and fled their posts once the battle began.
0DI0019598	A group of troopers, that can only be described as rag-tag, managed to fend off a brutal attack at Camp Golf. I salute your bravery. Hold the front.
0DI0019599	Troopers have managed to contain several small riots that were breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas.
0DI0019600	There is chaos breaking out at McCarran. The Fiends are using the opportunity to attack the base.
0DI0019601	There are also several riots breaking out in the area surrounding New Vegas. The looters have taken to the streets.
0DI0019602	There is a confirmed report that the Legion mounted a simultaneous assault at Camp Forlorn Hope.
0DI0019603	Yes Forlorn Hope has fallen. Some troops managed to fall back, but the fortification is lost.
0DI0019604	Forlorn Hope has sustained heavy casualties, but the fortification stands. We have successfully defended Forlorn Hope.
0DI0019605	I'm not getting any more information from Forlorn Hope. The Camp appears to have been totally overrun.
0DI0019606	I'm receiving reports that Forlorn Hope has been totally overrun, and the Legion is killing civilians as far as the township called Novac.
0DI0019607	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion attack with very few casualties.
0DI0019608	The troops at Forlorn Hope, assisted by First Recon, have repelled the Legion in what will surely be the most decisive victory in this entire battle.
0DI0019609	What the fuck is happening on the Strip? I'm getting reports that someone just bombed the embassy.
0DI0019610	It sounds like the Omertas are mounting some sort of attack on the Strip. They are receiving heavy casualties from the Securitrons and other casinos.
0DI0019611	The attack is coming from the Omertas. They are using some kind of gas to kill everyone in the casinos on the strip. How is this possible?
0DI0019612	The monorail at Camp McCarran just exploded. I'm not getting any reports of any fighting, but the monorail is gone for sure.
0DI0019613	We aren't going to be able to reinforce the Strip against the Omerta assault there. How the fuck did this happen? Jesus.
0DI0019614	There is some sort of obstruction on the road to Hoover Dam. We're going to do our best to send reinforcements around.
0DI0019615	Deploying battalion 14 to the southwestern flank.
0DI0019616	Unit 15 reinforce unit 16 at defense point sigma delta.
0DI0019617	Delta squad, redeploy.
0DI0019618	All units, be aware we are receiving help from a non-NCR military asset.
0DI0019619	Snipers in position. Repeat. Snipers in position.
0DI0019620	Unit 4 reinforce unit 8.
0DI0019621	Unit 23 await reinforcement from unit 42.
0DI0019622	Location Bravo Bravo Charlie, the doctor is coming.
0DI0019623	All unit commands, relay your current position and status.
0DI0019624	They're coming out of the walls man! They're coming outta the damn walls.
0DI0019625	Game Over Man! GAME OVER!
0DI0019664	That just ain't necessary
0DI0019665	Kids today.
0DI0019666	Looks like we got us a ruckus.
0DI0019667	Well look at them carrying on.
0DI0019668	I'm not taking sides.
0DI0019670	Whoa, what's going on?
0DI0019671	Hey, I'm not a part of this.
0DI0019672	Look at 'em go!
0DI0019673	Get 'em! Yeah!
0DI0019674	Keep me out of this!
0DI0019675	Not my problem.
0DI0019676	Hey, some entertainment, finally.
0DI0019677	Hey, cool. A fight.
0DI0019678	Pointless.
0DI0019679	Not my fight.
0DI0019680	I'm not touching that one with a ten-foot pole.
0DI0019681	You can get involved if you want to, but I'll be over here.
0DI0019682	No need to get into that mess, sweetheart!
0DI0019683	No, Leo, we won't go over there and start chopping! No!
0DI0019684	If there's one thing there's no shortage of in the Mojave, it's violence.
0DI0019685	It would be nice if things could stop tearing each other apart around here.
0DI0019688	Had it coming.
0DI0019690	They hardly even know how to fight.
0DI0019691	Let them fight it out among themselves.
0DI0019692	Assault noted. Considering intervention.
0DI0019693	An assault has been noted. Analyzing.
0DI0019707	You're done hidin'!
0DI0019708	Shoulda gone quietly.
0DI0019709	Knew it!
0DI0019711	Prepare to run against the pill!
0DI0019712	Yeehaw!
0DI0019713	Got ya!
0DI0019714	Knew you'd turn up sooner or later.
0DI0019715	Ah, there you are!
0DI0019716	There you are.
0DI0019717	Let's finish what we started.
0DI0019719	There ya are!
0DI0019720	Couldn't hide, could ya?
0DI0019721	Got my eye on you now!
0DI0019723	Now it ends!
0DI0019724	Got 'em!
0DI0019727	Here we go!
0DI0019730	I found you!
0DI0019733	You can't escape my True Eyes!
0DI0019734	Found the hostile!
0DI0019735	The target's over here!
0DI0019737	Visual confirmation made.
0DI0019738	Target reacquired!
0DI0019740	Over there!
0DI0019742	Oh! There we go!
0DI0019743	Busted!
0DI0019744	Found 'em!
0DI0019745	There we go!
0DI0019746	Couldn't even hide from a half-blind old ghoul. How embarassing for you.
0DI0019747	Got 'em, boss!
0DI0019748	All right, let's try this again.
0DI0019750	Gonna kill you for wasting my time.
0DI0019751	Should've run, now say your prayers.
0DI0019752	There they are! Get them, Leo!
0DI0019753	We found you!
0DI0019754	You can't hide from your paddling!
0DI0019755	I got you now!
0DI0019756	Let's do this!
0DI0019757	It's on!
0DI0019758	You thought you could lay low?
0DI0019759	I'm gonna grease you good.
0DI0019763	Ah hah!
0DI0019764	Got you now!
0DI0019765	Now you die!
0DI0019766	Not so sneaky, are we?
0DI0019767	Gotcha!
0DI0019769	Couldn't run forever...
0DI0019770	Nowhere to run now!
0DI0019771	I knew I'd find your bitch ass.
0DI0019772	You're dead now.
0DI0019773	I'm not going to let you get away.
0DI0019778	I've found the enemy!
0DI0019779	You'll have to hide better than that!
0DI0019780	Hide from this!
0DI0019781	Made me look! Made me mad!
0DI0019782	No - more - hiding!
0DI0019783	Target found.
0DI0019784	Target reacquired.
0DI0019785	Target found. Engaging.
0DI0019803	Hard to believe I scared somebody off.
0DI0019804	Up and left on me.
0DI0019805	Gone now...
0DI0019806	Seems they made like a ghost.
0DI0019807	It would appear they skedaddled.
0DI0019808	I guess I run them off.
0DI0019809	Damn, guess they're gone.
0DI0019810	Long gone by now.
0DI0019811	Fine, stay hidden for all I care.
0DI0019812	Dammit. Got away.
0DI0019813	Maybe next time.
0DI0019814	Ah, to hell with this.
0DI0019815	I ain't chasin' 'em.
0DI0019816	This is too much runnin' for an old man.
0DI0019817	Someone younger can run after 'em.
0DI0019818	Must be gone by now...
0DI0019819	Not really worth looking for anyway.
0DI0019820	Okay, I give up.
0DI0019821	Fine. I'll get your ass next time.
0DI0019822	Next time, then.
0DI0019823	Shit. Guess I lost 'em.
0DI0019824	Let's bounce, boys.
0DI0019825	Guess he's gone.
0DI0019826	Guess she's gone.
0DI0019827	I'll kill them if they come back.
0DI0019828	I scared them away. No match for the Legion.
0DI0019829	The True Eyes show me the intruder is gone.
0DI0019830	Stand down. The hostile's gone.
0DI0019831	Must've scared them off.
0DI0019832	Call off the search. They got away.
0DI0019833	Damn it, they're not here.
0DI0019835	Gone for now.
0DI0019836	Gone. Huh.
0DI0019837	I guess they're gone. Probably for the best.
0DI0019838	Got away.
0DI0019839	I give up.
0DI0019840	Probably die of natural causes eventually anyway.
0DI0019841	Ah, screw it.
0DI0019842	Maybe they just... went home, huh boss?
0DI0019843	I got nothing, here.
0DI0019844	Doubtless they ran away in sheer terror of the mighty Raul! Oh, and you too, boss.
0DI0019845	Guess they got rattled.
0DI0019846	Get 'em next time.
0DI0019847	Got no patience for hunting.
0DI0019848	If they come back, Leo will be waiting!
0DI0019849	It's probably best to leave well enough alone, dearie.
0DI0019850	The bad men have all gone away, sweetness. Grandma's here to protect you.
0DI0019851	I guess the outsider left.
0DI0019852	I bet the coward ran back to those NCR fools.
0DI0019853	Guess they're too scared to fight.
0DI0019854	I got you next time.
0DI0019855	Be glad I didn't find your punk ass.
0DI0019856	Fuck this, I got shit to do.
0DI0019858	Maybe stupid head voice was right?
0DI0019859	Was definitely there. Not crazy.
0DI0019860	You come back, I kill you.
0DI0019861	All right, I'm offically saying screw this.
0DI0019862	Let's go home, boys.
0DI0019863	This is dullsville. Let's bounce.
0DI0019864	Let's go do something else.
0DI0019865	You're not worth my time.
0DI0019866	What a punk.
0DI0019867	Chicken ass.
0DI0019868	Time to find some more psycho.
0DI0019871	It seems they ran off.
0DI0019872	They're gone. No sense in looking any more.
0DI0019873	We're wasting time. Call off the search.
0DI0019874	This is a waste of time.
0DI0019875	Hmph, they're long gone.
0DI0019876	Stupid hider.
0DI0019877	Hmph. Tired of looking.
0DI0019878	Fine! Hide for all I care!
0DI0019879	Search operations suspended. Have a nice day.
0DI0019880	Canceling search. Have a nice day.
0DI0019881	Halting search. Have a nice day.
0DI0019896	Must have got away.
0DI0019899	Huh. Looks like they left.
0DI0019901	Coulda sworn you was here!
0DI0019902	Nuts! You was just here...
0DI0019903	Gave me the slip.
0DI0019904	Come on now and fight honorable like?
0DI0019905	Quit your hidin' and fight!
0DI0019906	Pony up, now! Lord hates a coward.
0DI0019908	Hmph. Tricky little bastard, ain't ya?
0DI0019909	I know you're still out there.
0DI0019910	Come out, finish this!
0DI0019912	Where the hell did you go?
0DI0019913	Where are ya?
0DI0019914	Strange... Ain't there no more.
0DI0019916	You won't get away!
0DI0019917	Damn, lost 'em!
0DI0019918	I'm not done with you!
0DI0019919	Where the fuck are you?
0DI0019920	Quit playin' games!
0DI0019921	Come out here and fight!
0DI0019922	Don't think you can just up and run away.
0DI0019924	I'll find you!
0DI0019925	You won't escape me!
0DI0019926	You can't hide from me!
0DI0019927	Where'd they go, Rhonda?
0DI0019928	I've lost visual. Moving to pursue.
0DI0019929	Target lost. Begin full grid search.
0DI0019930	Does anyone see the hostile?
0DI0019931	Where'd he go?
0DI0019932	Where'd she go?
0DI0019933	Think you can hide, huh?
0DI0019934	Lost contact!
0DI0019935	I don't see 'em!
0DI0019936	Still around here somewhere.
0DI0019937	Where'd they go?
0DI0019938	Lost 'em.
0DI0019940	Hey! Come out and fight!
0DI0019941	Oh, come on, don't make the old guy chase you!
0DI0019942	I can't see 'em!
0DI0019943	Boss, where'd he go?
0DI0019944	Hide nor hair of them.
0DI0019945	Fucker pops back up, they'll wish they hadn't.
0DI0019946	Picked the wrong time for hide and seek.
0DI0019948	Grandma will find them, sugar, don't you worry!
0DI0019949	Do you see them, Leo? I don't see them!
0DI0019950	Show yourself, Outsider.
0DI0019951	Come out, come out, wherever you are.
0DI0019952	We'll find ya' one way or another.
0DI0019954	You're gonna pay for that when I find you.
0DI0019955	Where the fuck did you go?
0DI0019958	You're out there!
0DI0019959	Not crazy! You out there!
0DI0019960	Where'd you go? I ain't done with you.
0DI0019961	Don't think you can get away.
0DI0019962	Whoa. Spooky.
0DI0019963	Must've blinked or something.
0DI0019964	That's right. Run!
0DI0019965	I can smell your fear.
0DI0019966	Don't think I don't know where you are.
0DI0019967	You'd better hide.
0DI0019971	Damn, this one's tricky!
0DI0019972	Be on your guard! The enemy is still here!
0DI0019973	Damn! Lost 'em!
0DI0019974	Huh? Where'd you go?
0DI0019975	Not fair! Haven't killed you yet!
0DI0019976	Get out here! Not done with you!
0DI0019977	Target lost. Searching.
0DI0019978	Target lost. Attempting to reacquire.
0DI0019979	Target lost. Analyzing.
0DI0020001	Ah, forget it. I'm gonna go get a drink.
0DI0020002	I'm supposed to be retired.
0DI0020003	No more fightin' for me.
0DI0020004	That's enough.
0DI0020005	Looks like they hightailed it.
0DI0020006	Looks like I run them off.
0DI0020007	Guess they threw up the sponge.
0DI0020008	That wraps that up.
0DI0020009	Coward.
0DI0020010	Guess I'm done here.
0DI0020011	You should've known better.
0DI0020012	Well, that's that.
0DI0020013	Hahaha!
0DI0020014	Ah, well.
0DI0020015	Excitement's over, I guess.
0DI0020016	Kids these days...
0DI0020017	Glad that's over with.
0DI0020018	Guess you're not so tough.
0DI0020019	Probably afraid of me.
0DI0020020	Had enough? I thought so.
0DI0020021	Yeah, I'd run away, too.
0DI0020022	Fucked you up, bitch! And you know it!
0DI0020023	Done and done.
0DI0020026	That's it, run away.
0DI0020027	Degenerate.
0DI0020028	What trickery is this? Only nightkin should vanish like that!
0DI0020029	So fall the enemies of the Brotherhood.
0DI0020030	Technology prevails.
0DI0020031	Situation handled.
0DI0020032	Hostile eliminated.
0DI0020033	Tag 'em and bag 'em.
0DI0020036	I'm glad that's over with.
0DI0020037	I guess that could have gone worse.
0DI0020038	Guess we made it.
0DI0020039	All right, it's over.
0DI0020041	I've had worse.
0DI0020042	That's enough of that.
0DI0020043	Wow, I'm actually still alive. Who would have guessed?
0DI0020044	I'm sure our victory was purely thanks to your brilliant leadership, boss.
0DI0020045	I guess old guys are tougher than we look, huh?
0DI0020047	In no mood for hunting.
0DI0020048	It's okay, sweetheart, the bad people are all gone now.
0DI0020049	That will teach them to mess with my babies!
0DI0020050	Leo won't be happy there's no one else to chop!
0DI0020051	I didn't think you had it in you.
0DI0020052	You can run, but you can't hide forever.
0DI0020053	We'll save a shell for you.
0DI0020056	Forget about it.
0DI0020062	Not here...? Just saw, of course here?*shut up stupid head voice!*
0DI0020063	Stupid head voice.
0DI0020065	Hope you enjoyed your stay in Freeside.
0DI0020066	And... we're done here.
0DI0020067	The Kings reign supreme.
0DI0020068	Is that it?
0DI0020069	You're lucky I didn't find you.
0DI0020070	That's right, run.
0DI0020071	Fucking chicken.
0DI0020075	Looks like I got my exercise for today.
0DI0020076	And that's that.
0DI0020077	That'll teach them to mess with mutants.
0DI0020078	Ha ha. Too weak.
0DI0020079	Done with you now.
0DI0020080	Fight's over. Back to boring walking around.
0DI0020081	Stupid weak things never last long.
0DI0020082	Target lost. Engagement successful.
0DI0020083	Target lost. No further action needed.
0DI0020084	Target lost. Returning to non-combat operations.
0DI0020105	Just bugs I guess.
0DI0020106	Get a grip, Doc.
0DI0020107	Ears must be actin' up.
0DI0020108	Seems my ears is playin' tricks on me.
0DI0020109	Well I'm confounded. Must've been the wind.
0DI0020110	Well I'm stumped. Guess it was nothin'.
0DI0020111	Must've been nothing.
0DI0020112	I've got better things to do.
0DI0020113	Oh, well.
0DI0020114	Need to stop jumping at shadows.
0DI0020115	Huh... Oh, well.
0DI0020116	Whatever it was, it's gone now.
0DI0020117	Just a noise.
0DI0020118	Just getting old, I guess.
0DI0020119	Stupid deaf ear.
0DI0020120	Must be hearing things again.
0DI0020121	Scared me there for a second.
0DI0020122	Guess there's nothing there.
0DI0020123	God dammit... I guess it's nothin'.
0DI0020124	Fine. I'll catch you next time.
0DI0020125	Yeah that's right, I'd run away, too.
0DI0020126	I must be going as crazy as ol' Rex.
0DI0020127	Guess it was nothing.
0DI0020130	Nothing here.
0DI0020131	I think they left, Rhonda.
0DI0020133	I've finished my sweep. Nothing to report.
0DI0020134	Everyone back to your posts.
0DI0020135	Something must be wrong with my suit's audio receptors.
0DI0020137	Everything's quiet here. Heading back.
0DI0020138	I've got nothing.
0DI0020139	Never mind.
0DI0020140	Huh. Maybe I need some glasses that aren't two hundred years old.
0DI0020141	Nothing here, I guess.
0DI0020142	Gone now.
0DI0020144	Ah, forget it.
0DI0020145	I worry too much.
0DI0020146	Sorry, boss. Must be my glaucomas acting up again.
0DI0020147	If you say you saw something, I'm sure it was there.
0DI0020148	Nothing here, boss.
0DI0020149	Yeah, better run. Uh, them, not us.
0DI0020150	Not worth our time.
0DI0020151	Nothing. Must be nerves.
0DI0020152	Let's move on.
0DI0020153	Leo's playing tricks again.
0DI0020154	It's okay, sweetheart, there aren't any monsters out there.
0DI0020155	We're all alone now, pumpkin.
0DI0020156	Nothing out here.
0DI0020157	Guess I'm seeing things.
0DI0020158	Aw, forget this.
0DI0020159	Alright, just my imagination.
0DI0020160	My mind is playing tricks on me. I gotta get laid.
0DI0020161	Guess it was just in my head.
0DI0020164	Nothing!
0DI0020165	Stupid head voice go away again.
0DI0020166	Just stupid head voice again.
0DI0020167	Guess I'm hearing things.
0DI0020168	Probably just a rat.
0DI0020169	Bah, it's nothing.
0DI0020170	I got better things to do than jump at noises.
0DI0020172	Someone must be fucking with me.
0DI0020173	I was sure I heard something.
0DI0020174	Goddamn, I must be tripping.
0DI0020178	Must've been my imagination.
0DI0020179	Whatever it was is gone now.
0DI0020180	No sense wasting more time looking.
0DI0020181	Just a noise. Gone now.
0DI0020182	What was I doing again? Oh well.
0DI0020183	Nothing there. Stupid noise fooled me.
0DI0020184	Stupid ears. There's no noise out here.
0DI0020185	Bah, searching is boring.
0DI0020186	Suspending search.
0DI0020187	Canceling search.
0DI0020188	Halting search.
0DI0020203	Nothing I like better than a little R&R on Uncle Sam's dime.
0DI0020209	I didn't want to do this!
0DI0020210	You crossed the line.
0DI0020211	You done ticked me off now.
0DI0020212	Next stop: Boot Hill!
0DI0020213	Yeeeeeehaw! Hahaha!
0DI0020214	Yippie-kay yay! Hahaha!
0DI0020215	You messed with the wrong bartender.
0DI0020216	I've had it!
0DI0020218	Oh, that's it!
0DI0020220	I'm taking you down!
0DI0020221	Whippersnapper!
0DI0020222	Uppity youngster!
0DI0020223	No respect for the elderly these days.
0DI0020225	I'll kill you!
0DI0020226	Looks like I'll have to fight!
0DI0020227	Oh yeah? You're fuckin' dead!
0DI0020228	Come and get it!
0DI0020229	You are so fucked!
0DI0020230	Showtime!
0DI0020232	Die, coward!
0DI0020233	Death to Profligates!
0DI0020234	Another kill to my name!
0DI0020235	Invade my mountain, will you?
0DI0020236	Hostile sighted!
0DI0020237	Engaging hostiles!
0DI0020240	All mine.
0DI0020241	What a shame.
0DI0020242	Looks like break time's over.
0DI0020243	Take 'em out.
0DI0020244	Contact!
0DI0020246	Trouble.
0DI0020248	Get 'em, boss! I mean, if that fits with your schedule.
0DI0020249	Don't worry, boss, with my cataracts you only sort of look like the bad guys.
0DI0020250	Yeah, yeah, time for more fighting, I know.
0DI0020251	And then the fight started.
0DI0020252	Don't need this right now.
0DI0020253	Let's kick this in gear.
0DI0020254	Get behind grandma, sweetheart!
0DI0020255	I won't let you hurt my babies!
0DI0020256	Leo! Time for chopping!
0DI0020257	Fire for effect!
0DI0020258	Saturate that quadrant!
0DI0020259	Lock target and fire!
0DI0020260	I'm gonna clip your sorry ass.
0DI0020261	I'm gonna send you packin'.
0DI0020262	Eat shit, fucker.
0DI0020264	You die now!
0DI0020268	Nobody messes with the Kings!
0DI0020269	Let's get him, boys!
0DI0020270	You're dead, punk!
0DI0020271	And I was just getting bored!
0DI0020272	The lady's mine, boys!
0DI0020273	You ready to die?
0DI0020274	You'll bleed, bitch.
0DI0020275	I've been waiting for a fight.
0DI0020279	Stop right there!
0DI0020280	Intruder!
0DI0020281	Gonna kill you!
0DI0020283	Engaging target.
0DI0020284	Use of force has been authorized.
0DI0020303	Help me out!
0DI0020306	ANTLER!!!
0DI0020307	Knew you was here!
0DI0020308	You're in for it now!
0DI0020309	You're goin' down!
0DI0020311	Prepare to meet your maker.
0DI0020312	Say your prayers, desperado!
0DI0020313	Didn't get far enough, did ya?
0DI0020317	Can't sneak up on me.
0DI0020318	I knew it!
0DI0020319	Found ya!
0DI0020320	You ain't getting away!
0DI0020323	Finally found you.
0DI0020324	Now just hold still.
0DI0020326	Here it is!
0DI0020327	So much for sneaking!
0DI0020328	Got you!
0DI0020329	I've got you now.
0DI0020331	Fool!
0DI0020333	I found the intruder!
0DI0020334	I've found the target!
0DI0020335	Enemy spotted!
0DI0020336	I've got visual confirmation!
0DI0020337	Commencing attack.
0DI0020338	I've made contact. Form on me!
0DI0020340	Spotted!
0DI0020341	Company!
0DI0020342	Looks like trouble!
0DI0020343	Bad guys!
0DI0020344	Got you in my sights.
0DI0020349	We got company, boss!
0DI0020350	Guess my eyes weren't playing tricks after all!
0DI0020351	Guess who won the lottery.
0DI0020352	Got 'em spotted.
0DI0020353	Theeeere you are.
0DI0020354	Got one!
0DI0020356	Grandma sees you!
0DI0020357	You can't hide from Leo!
0DI0020358	Target sighted!
0DI0020361	I'm gonna make mincemeat outta you.
0DI0020362	Time to party.
0DI0020367	I see you, human!
0DI0020371	Guess you're not so good at hiding, huh?
0DI0020372	I knew I'd find you!
0DI0020374	There's no escape now!
0DI0020375	You thought you could hide from me?
0DI0020381	Now I've got you!
0DI0020382	I have you now!
0DI0020388	Searching. Confirmed.
0DI0020389	Searching. Target confirmed.
0DI0020390	Searching for target. Confirmed.
0DI0020417	Had to be somethin'.
0DI0020418	Am I hearin' things?
0DI0020419	Is there an outlaw skulking about?
0DI0020420	Hmm... Best look lively.
0DI0020421	Somethin' don't sit right.
0DI0020422	Anyone out there?
0DI0020424	I just heard something.
0DI0020427	Who's there? Show yourself!
0DI0020428	Eh?
0DI0020429	Trudy, that you?
0DI0020431	Hm? Thought I heard a sound...
0DI0020435	Hey, what was that?
0DI0020436	All right, who's there?
0DI0020439	Ave? Someone there?
0DI0020441	I heard something...
0DI0020442	Rhonda, you hear that? Hear what?
0DI0020443	I've got a possible hostile. Beginning search.
0DI0020445	You just hear something?
0DI0020447	Eyes open, people.
0DI0020448	There's something there.
0DI0020449	Shh. Eyes and ears.
0DI0020450	We're not alone.
0DI0020452	That doesn't sound good.
0DI0020453	Hey. Something's there.
0DI0020454	You hear that?
0DI0020456	Boss, if I heard something, you really should have heard something.
0DI0020457	I think we got company.
0DI0020458	Hello...?
0DI0020459	That wasn't you, was it.
0DI0020460	Hear something, doesn't sound like a friend of yours.
0DI0020461	Looks like someone wants to be neighborly.
0DI0020462	Did you hear something, Leo?
0DI0020464	Becky? Jimmy? Is that you?
0DI0020465	I heard a noise.
0DI0020467	What was that? Hello?
0DI0020468	Where the fuck did that come from?
0DI0020469	There somethin' out there?
0DI0020470	Who the fuck is out there?
0DI0020473	Head voice, that you?
0DI0020474	Wuh?
0DI0020477	You guys hear something?
0DI0020478	Shhh. I hear something.
0DI0020479	Man, I gotta cut back on that buffout.
0DI0020480	I think I heard something.
0DI0020487	Did anyone hear that?
0DI0020488	If someone's there, I'd advise you to come out.
0DI0020491	Heard a noise.
0DI0020492	Something's here.
0DI0020493	Unconfirmed threat. Analyzing.
0DI0020494	Possible threat. Searching.
0DI0020495	Unconfirmed threat detected. Searching.
0DI0020513	You're a damn coward!
0DI0020514	No use hidin'!
0DI0020515	Doggone it. Show yourself!
0DI0020516	I intend to see you dead, outlaw.
0DI0020517	Death's comin' for ya, I swear!
0DI0020518	Won't help you none to lay low.
0DI0020519	Hiding won't help, you know.
0DI0020520	Just wait till I find you.
0DI0020521	You won't escape that easily.
0DI0020522	Come out you coward!
0DI0020523	Hiding won't save you!
0DI0020524	This isn't over!
0DI0020525	Hm?
0DI0020526	You just disappear?
0DI0020527	You still there?
0DI0020528	Don't think you can hide forever.
0DI0020529	You're dead, you hear me?
0DI0020531	Ah shit, when I find you...
0DI0020532	You think you'll get away from me?
0DI0020533	Runnin' away like a little bitch!
0DI0020534	What say you come out and we play some more?
0DI0020535	I'll find you.
0DI0020536	By Caesar, I will find you.
0DI0020537	Skulking like a coward will not save you!
0DI0020539	Come out now, and Tabitha will be merciful. Or at least an approximation thereof.
0DI0020540	Still no sign of the hostile.
0DI0020542	The target can't have gone far.
0DI0020543	Keep searching.
0DI0020544	Anyone spot anything?
0DI0020547	Gotta still be here...
0DI0020548	Keep looking.
0DI0020549	Still nothing...
0DI0020550	Uh...
0DI0020551	Not seeing anything...
0DI0020552	Still looking, boss.
0DI0020553	Amazingly, they've still managed to outwit a half-blind arthritic ghoul.
0DI0020554	Don't worry boss, you'll know if I find anything.
0DI0020555	Think they ran?
0DI0020556	Less hide-and-seek, more shoot-and-kill.
0DI0020557	I see jack and shit - 'cept no jack.
0DI0020559	Not finding much.
0DI0020560	You'd better come out befoe Leo gets mad!
0DI0020561	Do you see anything, sweetie?
0DI0020562	Don't worry, grandma's still looking!
0DI0020563	Show yourself.
0DI0020564	I can hear you breathing, Outsider.
0DI0020565	I'll blow this place apart if I have to.
0DI0020566	I'm gonna pop you when I find you again.
0DI0020567	When I find you I'm gonna rip you a new one.
0DI0020568	Come out, come out, whever you are.
0DI0020571	Not seeing things! You're out there!
0DI0020572	Stupid head voice wrong! I know you're there!
0DI0020573	You come back!
0DI0020574	C'mon. Less hiding, more fighting!
0DI0020575	Come out, come out, wherever you are...
0DI0020576	We *will* find you, you know.
0DI0020577	You're only delaying the inevitable.
0DI0020578	I'm starting to get bored.
0DI0020579	What say you come out and take your asskicking like a man?
0DI0020581	Don't let me find you.
0DI0020582	I know where you went.
0DI0020586	Keep looking! They're here somewhere!
0DI0020587	Be on your guard! The enemy could be anywhere!
0DI0020588	You can't hide forever...
0DI0020589	If I were a scared little thing, where would I hide?
0DI0020591	Come out and fight!
0DI0020592	Hiding boring! Fighting much more fun!
0DI0020593	Before, just going to kill you. But now, going to kill you real bad!
0DI0020594	Still searching.
0DI0020595	Still analyzing.
0DI0020596	Still attempting to reacquire target.
0DI0020615	Where'd you go, punk?
0DI0020616	I don't like this.
0DI0020617	Somethin' don't feel right.
0DI0020619	I do believe I heard somethin'.
0DI0020620	Now what was that?
0DI0020622	Come on out!
0DI0020625	Something over there?
0DI0020627	Don't see anything, yet...
0DI0020630	Strange...
0DI0020631	Anyone there?
0DI0020635	Somethin' there?
0DI0020637	Don't make me come looking for you.
0DI0020639	I thought I heard something...
0DI0020640	You won't escape me.
0DI0020641	Show yourself and I may let you live.
0DI0020642	I know I heard something. Don't worry, Rhonda. We'll find them.
0DI0020644	We will find you!
0DI0020645	Come out and face your death!
0DI0020646	Reveal yourself and I promise the end will come quick.
0DI0020647	This grows tiresome.
0DI0020648	This little sneak is beginning to vex me.
0DI0020652	Huh.
0DI0020654	Got my eyes peeled.
0DI0020655	Still looking.
0DI0020658	I'm looking, I'm looking!
0DI0020659	Hope you're looking, boss, because I don't see so good.
0DI0020660	Anything moves, it's going to get it.
0DI0020661	Don't see a thing.
0DI0020662	Wish they'd show themselves.
0DI0020663	I don't see them anywhere, Leo! Do you?
0DI0020664	You can't hide from grandma!
0DI0020665	If you don't come out soon, ooh, you're going to get such a paddling!
0DI0020666	You're not getting away.
0DI0020667	I know you're out there!
0DI0020669	Come out. I just want to talk.
0DI0020670	Pretty sure I heard something.
0DI0020671	Is there someone out there?
0DI0020678	You better hope I don't find you.
0DI0020679	Come out, if you dare.
0DI0020680	Save us both some time and come on out.
0DI0020682	Just stay right where you are. I'll find you.
0DI0020683	When I find you I'm going to eat your spleen.
0DI0020684	You're out here somewhere.
0DI0020688	Hiding just delays the inevitable.
0DI0020689	Keep looking, everyone.
0DI0020690	I know you're here.
0DI0020691	Why don't you come out?
0DI0020692	Show yourself!
0DI0020693	Analyzing.
0DI0020694	Interpreting sense data.
0DI0020695	Target unconfirmed.
0DI0020723	You shouldn't be here.
0DI0020724	You better go.
0DI0020725	You got no right.
0DI0020726	You'd best git or I'll be in a pucker.
0DI0020727	Best be off right quick, pardner.
0DI0020728	Why don't you mosey along, pardner.
0DI0020729	Shoo!
0DI0020730	I'm warning you.
0DI0020731	Keep your distance.
0DI0020733	Don't.
0DI0020734	Stay away!
0DI0020735	Stay back.
0DI0020736	Don't get any closer.
0DI0020737	Not another step!
0DI0020738	Get the fuck outta here.
0DI0020739	Get out, now!
0DI0020740	Hey! No trespassing.
0DI0020741	Find someplace else to be.
0DI0020742	You're not supposed to be here.
0DI0020743	You don't belong here. Go.
0DI0020744	You're treading on dangerous ground. I suggest you split.
0DI0020746	Move along or suffer the consequences.
0DI0020747	Leave while you still can.
0DI0020748	Vacate the premises. Now.
0DI0020749	This area is restricted.
0DI0020750	This area belongs to the Brotherhood of Steel. Leave or face lethal force.
0DI0020751	You need to leave.
0DI0020752	You're not really supposed to be here.
0DI0020753	Beat it.
0DI0020754	Keep walking.
0DI0020755	Uh uh. I don't think so.
0DI0020756	Just keep on moving.
0DI0020757	I got my eye on you. Even if it doesn't see so good.
0DI0020758	You're outstaying your welcome.
0DI0020759	Go away! Go away!
0DI0020760	If you don't leave now, Leo might start chopping!
0DI0020761	You're frightening the children! Leave!
0DI0020762	Get lost.
0DI0020763	You'll turn back, if you know what's good for you.
0DI0020764	This area is off limits, Outsider.
0DI0020765	Stay the fuck away from here.
0DI0020766	This is restricted.
0DI0020767	Hey, that's off limits.
0DI0020768	Back off, human?
0DI0020770	Stop that, human?
0DI0020771	This is the Kings' turf. Scram!
0DI0020772	You should head back if you know what's good for you.
0DI0020774	You better think twice about that.
0DI0020776	Get the fuck out of here.
0DI0020780	You're not wanted here. Leave.
0DI0020781	You're not supposed to be here. Go before I get angry.
0DI0020782	This is our place. Go or be smashed.
0DI0020783	Get out of here before I get mad!
0DI0020784	You are not authorized to enter this area.
0DI0020785	This area is off-limits. Please vacate.
0DI0020786	Leave the vicinity immediately. Thank you.
0DI0020787	Back off. This is our turf.
0DI0020788	Not gonna stay nice if you don't leave.
0DI0020789	Clear out. You're not welcome here.
0DI0020812	You're taking your life into your own hands.
0DI0020816	You're not supposed to be here, are you?
0DI0020817	I didn't see anything.
0DI0020818	Hate to see that.
0DI0020819	Too bad.
0DI0020820	Darn shame about that.
0DI0020821	Huh...
0DI0020822	Well, they's a goner.
0DI0020823	Downright mean, that was.
0DI0020824	Probably deserved it.
0DI0020825	I've seen worse things happen to better people.
0DI0020826	I'm not cleaning that up.
0DI0020828	Dead.
0DI0020830	No one'll miss that one.
0DI0020831	Howah...
0DI0020832	Not my business.
0DI0020833	Cha-ching!
0DI0020835	Just unlucky, I guess.
0DI0020836	Must've had it comin'.
0DI0020837	That settles that.
0DI0020838	Yikes...
0DI0020839	That just ain't right.
0DI0020840	The weak must die.
0DI0020841	One more to feed the worms.
0DI0020842	A fair kill.
0DI0020843	Good one!
0DI0020844	You're a killer!
0DI0020845	We all gotta go sometime.
0DI0020846	Ugh.
0DI0020847	Strange how dead bodies appear wherever you go.
0DI0020850	Easy come, easy go.
0DI0020851	Yup. Definitely dead.
0DI0020852	Well, that sure is a dead body there, boss.
0DI0020853	I'm sure that was a cleverly-planned act, boss, and not just random psychosis.
0DI0020854	That one won't be breathing any time soon. Ouch.
0DI0020855	Well, that's all wrapped up.
0DI0020856	Sure put a nail in that one.
0DI0020857	That's all she wrote.
0DI0020858	Sweetie, leave that messy business to Leo.
0DI0020859	I'm sure that one was very naughty, pumpkin.
0DI0020860	Leo says your technique was very good that time!
0DI0020861	We kill to survive.
0DI0020862	At least it was a quick death.
0DI0020863	The tribe must be protected.
0DI0020864	Nice clip there.
0DI0020865	Someone just got burned.
0DI0020866	Probably had it coming.
0DI0020870	That's life in Freeside for you.
0DI0020871	That had to hurt.
0DI0020872	That hurt me just watching it.
0DI0020873	They had it coming.
0DI0020874	Bleed bitch. Bleed!
0DI0020875	Like I give a fuck.
0DI0020879	Bad way to go.
0DI0020880	Nothing to do with me.
0DI0020881	Ah ha ha ha ha!
0DI0020882	Weakling!
0DI0020883	Homicide detected.
0DI0020884	Homicide is a serious offense.
0DI0020885	Homicides will not be tolerated.
0DI0020888	Now that just wasn't called for.
0DI0020890	Sucks to be you.
0DI0020891	I'm staying out of this one.
0DI0020893	You ain't getting away with that.
0DI0020895	What the samhill?
0DI0020896	What in tarnation was you thinkin'?
0DI0020897	You low-down scallywag!
0DI0020898	Ahhhhhh...
0DI0020902	Don't!
0DI0020903	God!
0DI0020904	What in the hell are you doing?
0DI0020905	What're you doing?
0DI0020909	Oh, what the hell?
0DI0020910	Hey! Why would you do that?
0DI0020911	Asshole!
0DI0020912	That was way outta line.
0DI0020913	I'm not gonna stand for that!
0DI0020916	Reprisal!
0DI0020917	Vengeance!
0DI0020918	Retribution!
0DI0020924	Filthy lowlife scum!
0DI0020925	My god!
0DI0020926	What in Maxson's name?
0DI0020927	What the hell was that?
0DI0020928	Are you mentally deranged?!
0DI0020929	What the hell is wrong with you?!
0DI0020931	You're gonna get us in some serious shit.
0DI0020932	Hey! That's not okay.
0DI0020934	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, boss, what the hell?
0DI0020935	Boss, you really think that's a good idea?
0DI0020936	Oh, good, the boss is murdering people now. Excellent.
0DI0020937	Going to run out of friends at the rate you're going.
0DI0020938	You are such an asshole sometimes.
0DI0020939	Who's side are you on?
0DI0020940	Did you do that on purpose?
0DI0020941	You shouldn't be so naughty, pumpkin!
0DI0020942	No, no, no! Leo does the chopping, not you, dearie!
0DI0020943	That wasn't a nice thing to do!
0DI0020944	You'll pay for that, Outsider!
0DI0020946	You son of a bitch.
0DI0020947	That's some shit right there.
0DI0020949	Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!
0DI0020951	I'll have your blood, human!
0DI0020953	What the shit?
0DI0020954	You got a deathwish?
0DI0020955	Dammit that is going to stink.
0DI0020956	Shit.
0DI0020957	Oh damn, that's going to leave a stain.
0DI0020961	You think you'll just get away with that?
0DI0020962	You'll pay for that, scum!
0DI0020963	You'll die for that!
0DI0020964	Uh-oh.
0DI0020965	Heavily engaged.
0DI0020966	Threat level elevated.
0DI0020987	Aggression detected. Initiating alarm.
0DI0020989	You want to start something, baby?
0DI0020990	Yo, little help here!
0DI0020991	What's your problem, punk?
0DI0020993	That ain't right!
0DI0020994	Hurt an old man, will ya?
0DI0020995	Gonna make a fuss, then?
0DI0020996	Eh, you tryin' to drygulch me?
0DI0020997	Tryin' to kick up a row, is ya?
0DI0020998	Quit that!
0DI0021000	What the hell?
0DI0021002	You crazy?
0DI0021004	Shit!
0DI0021005	That hurt!
0DI0021007	What the fuck?
0DI0021008	You're dead, asshole!
0DI0021010	Stop it right now!
0DI0021011	What the-?
0DI0021012	Big mistake.
0DI0021013	You wanna tussle?
0DI0021015	Degenerate!
0DI0021016	Damn you!
0DI0021018	I'm sorry!
0DI0021019	Whatever I did, I regret it!
0DI0021020	I have no one to blame but myself!
0DI0021021	I was asking for that!
0DI0021022	What was that for?
0DI0021026	Engaging hostile.
0DI0021027	That didn't even tickle.
0DI0021028	Enough.
0DI0021029	You're asking for it.
0DI0021032	Hey, not so rough, I break easy!
0DI0021033	Knock it off!
0DI0021034	I'm going to knock you off your axles.
0DI0021035	Gonna fix your wagon.
0DI0021036	Fat's in the fire now, you little bitch.
0DI0021037	That does it.
0DI0021038	Pushed me too far.
0DI0021039	You'll make Leo angry!
0DI0021040	Didn't your mama ever tell you not to hit old ladies?
0DI0021041	Under fire!
0DI0021042	Protect the tribe!
0DI0021043	Kill the Outsider!
0DI0021044	Oh yeah, now it's on.
0DI0021046	You want to rock? Let's rock.
0DI0021050	That was *dumb*, human!
0DI0021051	<Pained Grunt>
0DI0021052	*Hurt*!
0DI0021055	Nobody messes with the Kings.
0DI0021056	Oh, it's on now!
0DI0021059	Don't you know who I work for?
0DI0021060	Tangle with the Gun Runners and it's the last thing you'll do.
0DI0021061	I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
0DI0021062	I'm not a threat to anyone!
0DI0021063	What did I do wrong?
0DI0021064	Please, no more!
0DI0021068	Check your fire!
0DI0021069	Hey! What'd you do that for?
0DI0021070	What's wrong with you?
0DI0021071	Unacceptable behavior has been noted.
0DI0021072	Assaulting an officer of the law is a capital offense.
0DI0021073	An assault has been perpetrated. Response in progress.
0DI0021091	That's mine!
0DI0021092	Get your own!
0DI0021093	Try robbing me, will you?
0DI0021095	Stealing from a King is a capital offense in Freeside.
0DI0021096	I thought I smelled a rat.
0DI0021097	Keep your hands to yourself!
0DI0021098	Hey, that's mine!
0DI0021100	Gonna smash stupid thief!
0DI0021101	You want something? I'll give you something!
0DI0021108	All right, but don't let it happen again!
0DI0021110	All right - since you gave in.
0DI0021111	You're not worth it anyway.
0DI0021112	Git.
0DI0021113	Showed you.
0DI0021114	Yeah, I thought so.
0DI0021115	What the hell were you thinking?
0DI0021116	You best not do that again.
0DI0021118	The ultimate insult is to be spared.
0DI0021119	You're too nice! Don't worry - I can take it!
0DI0021120	I love you too!
0DI0021123	Don't try that again.
0DI0021124	That's more like it.
0DI0021125	Okay. Well, I guess I can let it go this time.
0DI0021126	Next time, I'll put a nail in your head.
0DI0021127	Done fucking around? Good.
0DI0021128	Temporary insanity? All right.
0DI0021129	Did someone slip Psycho into your water or are you just naturally berserk?
0DI0021130	You shouldn't be so mean to people!
0DI0021131	Behave yourself from now on, you hear?
0DI0021133	Don't let it happen again.
0DI0021135	Stupid weak human.
0DI0021138	Consider yourself lucky.
0DI0021139	Huh. I guess it's all right, then.
0DI0021140	All right. I'll let it go - this time.
0DI0021141	You're lucky we Followers tend to be forgiving.
0DI0021143	Don't push your luck again.
0DI0021152	Please, have mercy!
0DI0021153	Hey! That don't belong to you, so keep your grubby mitts off it!
0DI0021154	You should give that back.
0DI0021155	That don't belong to you.
0DI0021156	That ain't yours!
0DI0021157	Now had that back, you low-down thief!
0DI0021158	Why you low-down nibbler, I'll have that back!
0DI0021159	I'll thank you not to touch my plunder.
0DI0021160	Don't think I didn't see that!
0DI0021164	Return that now.
0DI0021167	Caught you red handed!
0DI0021168	I saw that!
0DI0021169	Hands off!
0DI0021170	That doesn't belong to you.
0DI0021171	Hey! Give it back!
0DI0021172	That ain't fuckin' yours!
0DI0021173	Give it back, asshole!
0DI0021174	Fuckin' thief!
0DI0021175	I reckon that don't belong to you.
0DI0021177	Honorless thief!
0DI0021178	You debase yourself!
0DI0021179	You have no honor!
0DI0021180	If you want it, take it!
0DI0021181	If you see something you like, it's yours!
0DI0021185	That's against regulations!
0DI0021186	Put that down!
0DI0021187	Caught you in the act.
0DI0021188	We have enough problems around here!
0DI0021189	Uh... that doesn't belong to you.
0DI0021190	I'll take that back now.
0DI0021192	I don't know who you think you're fooling.
0DI0021193	Hey! I need that for stuff!
0DI0021194	Come on. At least steal from a mean person.
0DI0021195	<Sigh>Boss, if you just ask, I'll hand it to you. Probably.
0DI0021196	Boss, why do my pants suddenly feel lighter?
0DI0021197	Look, boss, I appreciate you not making me carry that, but come on.
0DI0021198	Think I didn't see that?
0DI0021199	Good way to lose a hand.
0DI0021200	Sweetie, if you want something, just ask grandma politely.
0DI0021201	Stealing isn't very nice, is it Leo?
0DI0021202	Is someone looking for a paddling?
0DI0021204	Stop the Outsider!
0DI0021205	I knew you'd try something.
0DI0021206	Fucking rat, don't touch that shit.
0DI0021207	Watch those light fingers buddy.
0DI0021208	Keep your hands off.
0DI0021210	Stupid human!
0DI0021211	That's mine, human!
0DI0021213	That belongs to the Kings!
0DI0021214	Hey, that's ours!
0DI0021215	You gonna pay for that?
0DI0021216	Stay the fuck away from that.
0DI0021217	Don't touch that.
0DI0021218	That isn't yours.
0DI0021223	Thought no one was looking, did you?
0DI0021224	Not yours!
0DI0021227	Larceny is a serious offense.
0DI0021228	That does not belong to you.
0DI0021229	Theft is not a victimless crime.
0DI0021251	We've trained for this. Stay cool.
0DI0021256	Antler... I have failed you.
0DI0021257	Ahh...
0DI0021259	Ehahugh
0DI0021261	Gahulgh!
0DI0021263	Ahhh...
0DI0021265	Yeragh!
0DI0021267	Ahhhh...
0DI0021268	Ough!
0DI0021272	I... am... supreme...
0DI0021273	See you soon.
0DI0021274	I'll do better next time, promise!
0DI0021275	Back to the drawing board!
0DI0021276	Gosh darn it!
0DI0021277	This is my fault!
0DI0021293	Got me...
0DI0021294	Damn... it...
0DI0021304	Not... like this...
0DI0021305	No...
0DI0021311	Gah...
0DI0021312	Not... done...
0DI0021313	Not... unh...
0DI0021314	Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!
0DI0021315	Aaarrrggggghh!
0DI0021316	<Death sound.>
0DI0021346	Trouble...
0DI0021348	Close shave, that was.
0DI0021349	Thought I was a goner.
0DI0021350	Clear out!
0DI0021354	Clear the way!
0DI0021355	Make way!
0DI0021356	Ah, shit!
0DI0021357	Not this time!
0DI0021358	Get out of the way!
0DI0021362	Displace!
0DI0021363	Scatter!
0DI0021364	Hahaha! Ka-boom!
0DI0021370	Hey, look out!
0DI0021371	Holy-!
0DI0021372	Heads up!
0DI0021374	Abandon ship!
0DI0021376	Might want to watch it there, boss.
0DI0021377	Yikes!
0DI0021380	Oh shi-
0DI0021381	Trouble!
0DI0021382	Be careful, sweetie!
0DI0021384	Don't hurt yourself, pumpkin!
0DI0021392	Everyone back off!
0DI0021393	Gotta run!
0DI0021396	Hey! Look out!
0DI0021402	Get away!
0DI0021403	Go! Run!
0DI0021404	Proximity alert.
0DI0021405	Threat detected.
0DI0021409	Get outta the way!
0DI0021411	Hooo!
0DI0021412	Hurah...
0DI0021414	Down!
0DI0021415	Heh heh!
0DI0021416	Watch this!
0DI0021417	Hit the dirt!
0DI0021418	Get the hell down!
0DI0021420	Here, take this!
0DI0021425	<Grunting as you throw.>Look out, brothers!
0DI0021426	Explosive, brothers!
0DI0021427	This one's for all my listeners!
0DI0021430	Let's see you handle this!
0DI0021432	Suppressing fire!
0DI0021437	Mind the explosion!
0DI0021438	Might want to watch the explosives, boss!
0DI0021440	Fuse lit!
0DI0021441	About to get loud!
0DI0021442	This is going to be loud, sweetie!
0DI0021443	Cover your eyes, pumpkin, or you'll go blind!
0DI0021444	3, 2, 1, contact!
0DI0021453	Here, on me!
0DI0021454	Eat shrapnel, bitch.
0DI0021458	Frag out!
0DI0021461	From me, to you!
0DI0021462	Think you can handle this?
0DI0021463	Have one on me!
0DI0021464	Here, catch!
0DI0021465	Boom! Ha ha ha ha!
0DI0021466	Deploying grenades.
0DI0021467	Firing grenades.
0DI0021471	Time to am-scray!
0DI0021472	I should go!
0DI0021473	Ain't no place for me!
0DI0021474	Gotta get out while the getting's good.
0DI0021475	Giddeup!
0DI0021476	Time to skedaddle!
0DI0021477	I best be on my way.
0DI0021479	I've got a bar to tend!
0DI0021480	This ain't worth it!
0DI0021484	I'm outta here!
0DI0021486	Ahhhh!
0DI0021487	Fuck this!
0DI0021488	Scram!
0DI0021489	I gotta get outta here!
0DI0021490	That's it for me!
0DI0021491	Ah, screw this!
0DI0021493	Time to get scarce!
0DI0021496	Run, brothers!
0DI0021498	Is it okay that I'm running away?
0DI0021499	Let me give you some space!
0DI0021500	It isn't you, it's me!
0DI0021506	This isn't like the sims!
0DI0021507	Gotta pull back!
0DI0021508	Sorry! I'm out!
0DI0021510	They're in too close!
0DI0021511	We're overwhelmed!
0DI0021512	We've gotta run!
0DI0021513	This old man's retreating, boss!
0DI0021514	Yeah, I really don't want to be here right now.
0DI0021515	Oh sure, make the old man run!
0DI0021516	Not looking to die here.
0DI0021517	Me and courage are out of here.
0DI0021518	Blood's running, and I'm going to follow.
0DI0021519	Why the hell do I follow you into things like this?
0DI0021520	They want me, they'll have to catch me.
0DI0021521	Get away from them, sweetie! Follow grandma!
0DI0021522	No, Leo, we have to run away now! No more chopping!
0DI0021524	Back to base!
0DI0021526	Pull back!
0DI0021527	No way I'm sticking around here.
0DI0021528	Fuck this shit.
0DI0021529	I'm gettin the fuck outta here.
0DI0021536	I just remembered I gotta be somewhere else!
0DI0021537	I didn't mean it, don't kill me.
0DI0021538	I don't need this.
0DI0021540	Need to regroup!
0DI0021541	Damn it all to hell!
0DI0021542	Brought too many bullets and not enough stimpaks!
0DI0021543	Bleeding out pretty bad here!
0DI0021544	We need more firepower!
0DI0021545	I'm just slave! I'm not worth it!
0DI0021546	I don't want to die!
0DI0021547	Mercy!
0DI0021555	Battle cattle! Run for your lives!
0DI0021558	Too strong!
0DI0021559	Displacing.
0DI0021560	Relocating.
0DI0021584	Ack!
0DI0021587	Oof...
0DI0021590	Eragh!
0DI0021595	Ngh!
0DI0021597	Ah!
0DI0021604	Agh!
0DI0021605	Oww!
0DI0021606	Ohha!
0DI0021609	Eyah!
0DI0021619	Ow! You okay, Rhonda?
0DI0021623	Oh! That's not very nice!
0DI0021624	Serves me right!
0DI0021625	That's it, make me take my medicine!
0DI0021626	Bad robot! Baaad robot!
0DI0021629	Argh, my head!
0DI0021634	Gah!
0DI0021635	Damn, I'm hit!
0DI0021647	Ah shit!
0DI0021663	Damn, my arm!
0DI0021664	Agh, my leg!
0DI0021665	My head!
0DI0021674	Ah, my head!
0DI0021675	It hurts!
0DI0021679	<Grunt.>
0DI0021724	Huragh!
0DI0021725	Umph!
0DI0021726	Uragh!
0DI0021728	Hm eragh!
0DI0021729	Hm ahh!
0DI0021730	Yaaaa!
0DI0021731	How 'bout this?
0DI0021734	Ooagh!
0DI0021736	Ehh!
0DI0021738	Dahhhh!
0DI0021739	Haagrh!
0DI0021743	Haaa!
0DI0021746	Feel my supreme power!
0DI0021747	Ooh, this one's gonna hurt!
0DI0021748	I see your death!
0DI0021756	Huh!
0DI0021758	Raaaagh!
0DI0021762	Can you handle this?
0DI0021763	I bet this'll hurt!
0DI0021765	Grrrraaahhh!
0DI0021766	Yaaaaahhhhhh!
0DI0021767	Diiiiiiieeeee!
0DI0021768	Uwwwaaaahhh!
0DI0021769	<strenuous grunt.>
0DI0021784	I'm gonna ring your bell, creep!
0DI0021785	You touched Antler! Now you DIE!
0DI0021786	You will pay, human!
0DI0021787	You'll get yours!
0DI0021789	Where's your manners?
0DI0021790	Hog-killin' time!
0DI0021791	I aim to kill you!
0DI0021792	You're a goner!
0DI0021793	How you like that?
0DI0021796	Ergh!
0DI0021797	Enh!
0DI0021799	Let's take these guys!
0DI0021803	You like this?
0DI0021805	Nyeaa!
0DI0021807	Try this on!
0DI0021808	For Bright!
0DI0021809	The Bright One is dead!
0DI0021810	We will never reach the Far Beyond.
0DI0021811	The Great Journey will never happen.
0DI0021812	What have you done? Bright was the best of us.
0DI0021813	I knew you weren't to be trusted!
0DI0021818	Get 'em, boys!
0DI0021819	I got more of that for ya!
0DI0021820	I've got a big hunk o' love for ya!
0DI0021824	For Navarro!
0DI0021825	Just like old times.
0DI0021826	Stay still while Best Friend Tabitha pounds you!
0DI0021827	All intruders are to be killed!
0DI0021828	I am the supreme ruler here!
0DI0021829	Feel my power! Yeah, feel her power!
0DI0021831	You're no match for us!
0DI0021832	I've got this one!
0DI0021834	This'll be over quickly!
0DI0021835	Can't stand up to this, can you?
0DI0021837	Flank them!
0DI0021838	Set up a crossfire!
0DI0021840	Dodge this!
0DI0021842	Eat this.
0DI0021843	You're mine.
0DI0021844	Can't run from me.
0DI0021846	For the Brotherhood.
0DI0021847	Okay, I guess we're doing this.
0DI0021848	Let's dance!
0DI0021849	I've been doing this longer than you, pal!
0DI0021850	Someone's looking to cash their chips early.
0DI0021851	Time for some get-even.
0DI0021852	Let's paint this place red.
0DI0021853	Let's start this dance.
0DI0021854	Serving up some hurt.
0DI0021855	Gonna six this bitch.
0DI0021856	You're just in time for your ass whipping.
0DI0021857	That how you want to play, huh?
0DI0021859	Leo is going to give you such a paddling, you won't be able to sit down for a week!
0DI0021860	Why! Won't! You! Behave?!
0DI0021861	Bad Nightkin! You need to go see Marcus and Doctor Henry!
0DI0021862	Stop acting so rambunctious, you naughty, naughty children!
0DI0021876	You've got nothing!
0DI0021878	This is how we do it in Freeside!
0DI0021879	Let's kill this guy!
0DI0021880	Let's kill this chick!
0DI0021882	Don't mess with us!
0DI0021883	I'll make this quick!
0DI0021884	Let's bleed this fool!
0DI0021885	Freeside is ours!
0DI0021886	Hey guys, watch this!
0DI0021887	You like the sight of your own blood?
0DI0021888	I'm going to make you scream.
0DI0021891	Locked and loaded!
0DI0021893	Nobody screws with the Gun Runners and walks away from it!
0DI0021894	I'm not scared of you!
0DI0021895	I'm no Legionary, but I'll kill you all the same!
0DI0021896	I'll take you down with me!
0DI0021897	You pushed me too far!
0DI0021899	I know where to hit you where it hurts the most.
0DI0021900	The wasteland will be more civilized without you!
0DI0021901	Damn giant bugs!
0DI0021902	I don't think I've had to kill one of these things before.
0DI0021903	Fighting was part of my studies.
0DI0021904	We Followers aren't pushovers!
0DI0021905	I didn't want to have to do this!
0DI0021906	Get some!
0DI0021910	You have no chance!
0DI0021911	Kill them all!
0DI0021912	You want some more?
0DI0021914	I'm just getting warmed up!
0DI0021916	Grah!
0DI0021917	Yeah ha ha ha!
0DI0021918	Want more?
0DI0021920	Destroy!
0DI0021924	Targeting.
0DI0021926	Innocent visitors, please disperse.
0DI0022037	Chair... empty? Head voices say so.
0DI0022038	Head voices say silver chair flies east.
0DI0022039	Chip slippery! More slippery than the Chair thinks!
0DI0022040	Buildings not covered in blood. Chip is cause?
0DI0022041	Chip goes when broken man calls!
0DI0022042	Shiny screens brighter! Don't let them flicker at us!
0DI0022043	Withered... broken! Not speak any more.
0DI0022044	Broken one is ended. Head voice not sure what this mean.
0DI0022045	When Mars calls... we run?
0DI0022046	Thorn... *pulled* from flesh of bull? Not sure why.
0DI0022047	Bull is broken. But bull has many friends.
0DI0022048	Bull lies dead. Dogs coming for fresh meat.
0DI0022049	Bull not as smart as he thinks! Can't see dogs around him.
0DI0022050	Shiny screens brighter! Why so bright?
0DI0022051	Shiny screens go dark. Stupid head voice have no use for shiny screens.
0DI0022052	Snake dead! Rats scurry while they can.
0DI0022053	Bears returning! Rats will flee.
0DI0022054	Arms of mars are unbound. Watch them swing!
0DI0022055	Head voice say bear heads still talking. Is surprised at this.
0DI0022056	Bear heads in pain. Chip cannot help them.
0DI0022057	Chip hurt bear heads! Stupid head voices afraid.
0DI0022058	Bear heads in pain. But voices don't know who hurt them.
0DI0022059	Green grass man dead. Head voices wonder why?
0DI0022060	Green grass man dead. We understand why.
0DI0022061	One head cut off. Head voices say many will take its place.
0DI0022062	Hah hah, many rats dead in gutters today!
0DI0022063	Bull attacks bears! Many more will come.
0DI0022064	Horns will help the bull. Voices say they knew that would happen.
0DI0022065	Bear has horns? Head voices not see that coming.
0DI0022066	Horns fall on bloody rocks. Head voices saw many bodies.
0DI0022067	Horns leave this place. Head voices see them go far away.
0DI0022068	Horns unleashed. Many will feel their sting.
0DI0022069	Crowned heads lie dead. Bear heads growing strong.
0DI0022070	Crowned heads make nice with bears? Voices confused.
0DI0022071	Metal men walk no more. Stupid metal men. Head voices don't like metal men!
0DI0022072	Head voices say Mars angry.
0DI0022073	Bears hurt.
0DI0022074	Squishy human not making many friends.
0DI0022075	Bears grow stronger. But still sit on edge of cliff.
0DI0022076	Bears in pain. Head voices not surprised.
0DI0022077	Bears killed cornered dogs. Voices not surprised.
0DI0022078	Horns dead on rock city.
0DI0022079	Horns on the run. Voices wonder where they going?
0DI0022080	Head voices say new meat will rot in the sun.
0DI0022081	Bears taking over twisty track. Voices unsure of this.
0DI0022082	Head voices wonder... why bull doggies die?
0DI0022083	Head voices hear of new metal men. But not metal men. Different metal men. Make head hurt.
0DI0022084	Bears strong like metal men? Bears stronger now.
0DI0022085	Mars growing bigger. Shadow gets larger.
0DI0022086	Mars *eclipsing* bears. Bulls come soon.
0DI0022087	Head voices hear things. Many things. Not all make sense.
0DI0022088	Head voices see clouds in the sky. Where is sun?
0DI0022089	Sun sets.
0DI0022090	Voices say waters close around bears *and* bull. Not sure who in better shape.
0DI0022091	Head voices say smart man also metal man. Don't like metal men!
0DI0022092	Head voices say quiet man knows more than he says about horns!
0DI0022093	Head voices say they knew flower girl's father.
0DI0022094	Funny robot make blinky sounds.
0DI0022095	Head voices say someone close. Someone like us.
0DI0022096	Head voices know smelly ghoul. He old and good with guns.
0DI0022097	Head voices speak of doggy with squishy brain.
0DI0022098	Book girl has hard decision to make.
0DI0022114	Not always. I have other places I need to be, but I stop by every few days or so.
0DI0022115	I'm usually here a few days out of the week.  Mostly to keep the fridge stocked.  Plus it's nice to get away from it all every now and then.
0DI0022116	No, there are other places that require my attention.
0DI0022117	My duties tend to take me elsewhere, but I try to be here at least a few days out of the week.
0DI0022118	Thank you, every tag you bring me is one more soldier at peace.
0DI0022119	I was stationed at Camp Searchlight before the incident.
0DI0022120	I've since taken it upon myself to keep travelers away from the area.
0DI0022121	All right. I'll be here, obviously.
0DI0022122	Fine. Just get me those Sugar Bombs.
0DI0022123	Come back when you've found the igniting agent.
0DI0022124	Come back when you've tracked down the thrust control modules.
0DI0022125	Great, let's do everything when it's convenient for you.
0DI0022126	You can jump out the window, for all I care, mister.
0DI0022127	You got no right to come in here and start criticizing our town. Folks work hard to keep it clean and safe.
0DI0022128	We do the best we can. But still there's always some of you finicky types that there's just no pleasing.
0DI0022129	You can jump out the window, for all I care, lady.
0DI0022132	Okay, if that's what you think.
0DI0022133	Again? All right.
0DI0022134	As long as we don't go too far. Jeannie May would have a fit if she saw me out and about.
0DI0022135	Any excuse to get out of my room.
0DI0022136	What, now? This better be good.
0DI0022137	You say so, chief.
0DI0022138	If you're talking about that thing that looks like the entrance to the center of the Earth, I think it might just be a pothole.
0DI0022139	But we better check it out anyway.
0DI0022140	I know we already did this, but this time things might turn out different.
0DI0022141	I guess I can leave the store for a minute. I hope I don't miss any customers.
0DI0022142	Really? Store's still okay, isn't it?
0DI0022143	You sure seem worked up about something. I suppose I can hear you out.
0DI0022144	It's kinda late, but I guess if it's important to you.
0DI0022146	I can give you stims or radiation supplies, which would you prefer?
0DI0022147	I have some goods collected during my travels. You may take something if you wish.
0DI0022148	Certainly, which type of ammo would you like?
0DI0022153	Humanity lost many things after the war. Methods of agriculture, techniques for survival.
0DI0022154	We took it upon ourselves to piece together this knowledge and bring it back to them.
0DI0022155	We're scattered, mostly. We go where we're needed. Our largest presence is in Freeside at Old Mormon Fort.
0DI0022156	Other than that, I know Dr. Usanagi set up a practice near the Crimson Caravan. And a man we trained is operating out of the Aerotech building.
0DI0022157	Another man, Tom Anderson, was looking into water supply problems in Westside. But that was a while ago.
0DI0022158	We did, for a time. But our goals differ. The NCR only cares to expand their wealth and their reach.
0DI0022159	For us, territorial boundaries mean nothing. And prosperity has to be for everyone, not just citizens of the NCR.
0DI0022160	So a parting was inevitable. While the NCR pushes east, we clean up the mess they leave behind. Try to provide some stability.
0DI0022161	If you insist on going north, don't be expecting a rescue when you get into trouble.
0DI0022163	If you want to be that way I'll leave you alone.
0DI0022164	From what I've been able to gather, they've been seen messing around with the machinery up there. What could they be up to?
0DI0022165	I don't know what else I could tell you. You could give No-bark a try, though, or Jeannie May.
0DI0022175	This shouldn't take too long. Just close your eyes and try to relax.
0DI0022180	Sometimes ignoring something is the best medicine.
0DI0022182	Swing back by if you change your mind. I'll see what I can do for you.
0DI0022183	You want to play tough guy, that's no skin off my nose.
0DI0022184	You want to play tough gal, that's no skin off my nose.
0DI0022185	Not my clinical opinion, but so be it.
0DI0022188	Sure. Just don't treat me like a pack Brahmin, okay?
0DI0022189	Ooo. Got something good for me? Is it a dress?
0DI0022190	You're making me carry the heavy stuff, aren't you?
0DI0022191	I'm sure you'll be fair and equitable, boss.
0DI0022192	I expect to be awed by your dizzying mercantile sense, boss.
0DI0022195	Let's distribute the weight.
0DI0022196	Let's deal.
0DI0022197	Let's see what you got.
0DI0022198	Grandma's got a present for you!
0DI0022199	Come back when you have news about the Boomers.
0DI0022200	Come back when you know more about the White Glove Society.
0DI0022201	Return to me when you've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
0DI0022202	Come back when you've destroyed whatever you find down in that bunker.
0DI0022203	Complete your mission, then return to me.
0DI0022205	<Laughs>Yeah. I'm with you there.
0DI0022208	If that's what you think.
0DI0022209	Good call! I mean, if that's what you really want, boss.
0DI0022210	Why does everyone always say that?
0DI0022214	If you're sure... your loss.
0DI0022215	What no music? I'll hold the tears 'til I'm gone.
0DI0022216	If you're sure... your loss. Can't say I couldn't use a break from you for a while.
0DI0022217	Aww, grandma will miss her little pumpkin! Are you sure?
0DI0022218	There are plenty of people here to talk to you about us and our mission. Let's get to brass tacks and talk about that robot.
0DI0022219	Gangers, gangsters, all sounds like trouble to me.
0DI0022220	All right, let's play.
0DI0022221	A fellow enthusiast, huh? That's great! Let's play.
0DI0022222	Sure. Old No-bark is always looking to play. Not for entertainment, mind you, but because if you look at the cards right you can know the future.
0DI0022223	Damn straight I would! Let's see what you got.
0DI0022224	Bring it on, buddy!
0DI0022225	I always have time for a good game of Caravan. I hope you're up to the challenge.
0DI0022226	A fascinating proposition. Naturally, my considerable genius makes me a master of the game, so try not to be disappointed if you lose miserably.
0DI0022227	You betcha! Caravan's got me through many a long night before. I hope you're ready.
0DI0022228	You think you have what it takes, kid?
0DI0022229	All right, let's see what you got.
0DI0022230	I'm going to roll over you.
0DI0022231	That was too easy. How about we play again and this time you actually try.
0DI0022232	No-bark wins! A few more like that and the curse'll get lifted for sure.
0DI0022233	Don't take it to heart. I've studied the strategies of the masters.
0DI0022234	Nice try. Care to try your luck again?
0DI0022235	It looks like you need a bit more practice. Another lesson perhaps?
0DI0022236	I am unsurprised regarding your appalling lack of talent. Perhaps you'd care to try another hand? After all, you can only improve.
0DI0022237	Here I was thinking you'd be a challenge, want a rematch?
0DI0022238	Nice try. Let's play another game.
0DI0022239	Dammit. I should have won that match. Let's play again.
0DI0022240	Dang it! Shoulda known you was getting caravan hints from the bloatfly spirits what live in these parts.
0DI0022241	Well I'll be cold and rotting before I let them get the best of me. Let's go again.
0DI0022242	Huh. I wonder where I went wrong. Let's try that again.
0DI0022243	Not too bad. How about we play again?
0DI0022244	Impressive. That was a very good game. Would you care to play again?
0DI0022245	Well now, this is an unexpected variable. You really must let me challenge you to a rematch, so I can analyze what passes for your strategy.
0DI0022246	Dammit, I thought I had you there. Let's play again.
0DI0022247	Wow, you're good. Give me another game.
0DI0022248	I'll be here if you ever want a rematch.
0DI0022249	Dang it, No-bark, just when you was making a friend.
0DI0022250	Shucks, well, let's do it again sometime.
0DI0022251	Okay. If you want to play again sometime, let me know.
0DI0022252	Another time then, perhaps.
0DI0022253	As you wish. Once you've salved your battered ego, perhaps you'll make another go of it.
0DI0022254	You know where to find me if you want to play again.
0DI0022255	What? Afraid to lose. Well come find me if you want to play again.
0DI0022256	I hope you're ready for this.
0DI0022257	No more magic spells this time.
0DI0022258	I've got a good feeling about this hand.
0DI0022259	Let's get this started!
0DI0022260	Excellent. Let the game begin!
0DI0022261	Very well. I would wish you luck, but of course peerless intellect is all that matters here.
0DI0022262	Ok, hope you're ready to lose.
0DI0022263	Let the Caravan Lesson begin.
0DI0022264	Oh... All right. So, Ah... Bye.
0DI0022265	Never forget the Bitter Springs Massacre.
0DI0022266	Have a good time, baby.
0DI0022269	Try not to do anything too disruptive, okay?
0DI0022272	Stay safe out there.
0DI0022273	Yeah, okay, see you around.
0DI0022276	Goodbye, Rocketeer, be sure to visit again! Oh, and please - for your own safety, stay outside of restricted areas.
0DI0022282	Ciao.
0DI0022290	Happy trails partner.
0DI0022297	Thank you, and enjoy your stay at The Tops.
0DI0022298	A pleasure doing business.
0DI0022299	Enjoy your stay at the Atomic Wrangler.
0DI0022300	Have a good time and good luck.
0DI0022301	Play safe.
0DI0022308	Hey, uh. Wait a sec. I know what I said, but...  if you find yourself by Ranger Station Charlie, let me know what you find. I'd be interested.
0DI0022309	Look out for yourself.
0DI0022310	Watch out for strangers.
0DI0022311	Yeah, see you.
0DI0022313	Nice of you to visit.
0DI0022316	Come back soon, now.
0DI0022317	If anyone asks, we never spoke.
0DI0022321	Aw, come on! Don't leave me here!
0DI0022328	Take it easy, baby.
0DI0022329	So long, friend.
0DI0022330	Yeah yeah, see you later.
0DI0022331	Yeah, go on, scram.
0DI0022332	Sure, later.
0DI0022333	Yeah, see ya kid.
0DI0022334	Don't be a stranger, doll.
0DI0022335	Come back later if you need anything!
0DI0022337	Don't stay away too long!
0DI0022338	See you around!
0DI0022340	Remain vigilant.
0DI0022341	The power of the law rests in the hands of every citizen.
0DI0022342	Report suspicious activity.
0DI0022343	Practice good citizenship.
0DI0022347	Until we meet again.
0DI0022360	No, please! Don't leave me here!
0DI0022362	Take it easy, dude.
0DI0022363	Take it easy, kitty cat.
0DI0022365	Come back and see us soon.
0DI0022366	Come back any time.
0DI0022367	Thanks for stopping in.
0DI0022369	Herrgghh.
0DI0022370	Fair thee well.
0DI0022371	All right. I'll see you later.
0DI0022376	Talk to you soon, dear.
0DI0022379	Farewell, brother.
0DI0022380	Farewell, sister.
0DI0022382	Yes. Goodbye.
0DI0022383	Mars's eyes are upon you. Do not fail him, or me.
0DI0022384	Farewell, friend.
0DI0022387	Come on back if you want a game.
0DI0022402	You take care, now.
0DI0022403	Keep your gun handy if you go poking around some of the abandoned places around here, like the schoolhouse. Critters move in there sometimes.
0DI0022435	Sure, boss.
0DI0022436	Sure, see you around.
0DI0022438	Toodle-oo!
0DI0022439	I somehow suspect you'll be back to converse with me later.
0DI0022442	Do come find us!
0DI0022443	Return to me, wanderer. We need your help.
0DI0022444	Let me know when the underground has been rid of the demons.
0DI0022445	There is no way that we can thank you enough, wanderer. Your arrival here was a blessing. We will remember you always.
0DI0022446	Goodbye, wanderer.
0DI0022447	Choke on your goodbyes.
0DI0022451	Let's plan on meeting again as soon as- Wait. Did you hear something? Were you followed?
0DI0022454	Indeed.
0DI0022456	Adieu.
0DI0022458	Pleasure speaking to you.
0DI0022465	Here, you'll want this. It's the password to one of the terminals outside. Found it written on one of the stalls in the bathroom.
0DI0022466	Adios, amigo.
0DI0022472	Yep. See you round.
0DI0022473	Take care, pardner. And keep drinking Sunset Sarsaparilla!
0DI0022474	No problem. If you do end up trying to collect more stars, watch out for a man named Allen Marks. He's killed several people for their stars already.
0DI0022489	Don't get blown up.
0DI0022492	Come on back if you have any interesting news.
0DI0022493	I'm sure I'll hear about you again soon.
0DI0022498	Til next time.
0DI0022502	Yeah yeah, {shee-ya)see you later!
0DI0022503	Yeah yeah!
0DI0022512	By Caesar's will.
0DI0022519	Yeah, bye.
0DI0022535	Get fucked.
0DI0022538	Come on back if you get lonely, sweet thing.
0DI0022542	Have a seat, baby - let's get this kicking.
0DI0022543	Sit down, hey? Don't keep me waiting.
0DI0022544	Baby, you can savor the swank digs all you want when we're done talking. Sit down.
0DI0022545	Don't just stand there looking stupid.
0DI0022547	Don't just stare in dumb admiration.
0DI0022548	Mind where you point those dimmers.
0DI0022550	Thanks for talking us out of our evil ways. I'm starting on that novel soon. Pauline is so happy. You are a nice person! Hurray!
0DI0022551	Sammy and I are grateful. We are going to follow our dreams.
0DI0022553	What the hell are you doing here?
0DI0022554	You again?
0DI0022555	Hey doc.
0DI0022557	You're slowing down. Pick it up!
0DI0022558	Good. You'll be a Legionary yet.
0DI0022559	What the fuck was that? I've seen crippled slaves move faster.
0DI0022560	Run faster or I will throw you off the side.
0DI0022561	Welcome. Come on in!
0DI0022562	Hey, you came back! Must be doing something right.
0DI0022563	How ya doing?
0DI0022564	Look who's here.
0DI0022566	Hey. Welcome.
0DI0022570	Careful. They got spies all over.
0DI0022571	Hello, potential customer.
0DI0022572	Hello, it is great to finally meet you.
0DI0022573	What the hell is your problem?
0DI0022575	Lovely weather, eh?
0DI0022576	Looking for anything in particular?
0DI0022578	We've got stuff you never realized you needed.
0DI0022579	Feel free to look around.
0DI0022580	Hey ya.
0DI0022581	Just let me know if anything catches your eye.
0DI0022582	We've got competitive prices and a good inventory.
0DI0022583	<Unintelligible Grunt/Burp>
0DI0022584	Thank you for visiting New Vegas.
0DI0022585	Move along.
0DI0022586	Place your bets and give the wheel a spin!
0DI0022587	Give her a spin and win big!
0DI0022588	Have a seat and give lady luck a chance!
0DI0022589	Try your hand at blackjack!
0DI0022590	The bosses are having a meeting. You'll have to wait until it's over.
0DI0022591	Be patient. The guns'll still be here in a few minutes.
0DI0022594	We're watching you. Closely.
0DI0022595	Keep your hands where we can see them.
0DI0022597	Kill me!
0DI0022598	Don't get too close to Mr. Benny
0DI0022599	No sudden moves around the boss, got it?
0DI0022600	I got my eye on you, so no funny business.
0DI0022601	Keep those hands where I can see 'em.
0DI0022602	Ring-a-ding, baby.
0DI0022603	How's it hangin'?
0DI0022604	I am so happy to see you!
0DI0022605	Yay, it's you!
0DI0022606	I am so glad to see you!
0DI0022607	Heya mama, what's the haps?
0DI0022608	Hope Swank's smarter than Benny.
0DI0022609	Wonder where Benny got off to?
0DI0022610	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a rat all along.
0DI0022611	You dig this crazy scene or what?
0DI0022613	Ave.
0DI0022617	Aw crap.
0DI0022622	<Humming>
0DI0022624	How about some grub?
0DI0022625	Whew, you don't look so good. You might want to see Doc Kemp.
0DI0022626	If you need anything, just give me a holler.
0DI0022627	Now is not a good time.
0DI0022628	I'm a busy man.
0DI0022629	You look like you could use some medical attention.
0DI0022630	Damn addicts.
0DI0022631	You look like you're suffering from some radiation sickness.
0DI0022635	Hey, over here.
0DI0022636	Damn leg.
0DI0022637	Oh, excuse me.
0DI0022638	Afternoon, friend.
0DI0022641	Excuse me, coming through!
0DI0022642	Get out of the way, chump!
0DI0022643	Move, lard ass!
0DI0022644	Scoot your boots, ya bum!
0DI0022650	Hey there, "Cannibal." Heard you become a hunter - good for you.
0DI0022651	Looks like you're going to get another to chance to fly, Whitman. Hope you haven't lost your touch.
0DI0022652	You look like shit, Johnson. Damn, you got old.
0DI0022653	Together again, eh, Captain?
0DI0022654	It's nice to see us all here - even you, Moreno.
0DI0022655	Do little angels want butterscotch candies? Sweets for sweeties!
0DI0022656	Aww, aren't you just precious? Come here little darling, let grandma pinch your cheek!
0DI0022657	Look at this little dear! Grandma Lily could just eat you up!
0DI0022658	Peek-a-boo! I see you!
0DI0022659	Come here little one, give Grandma Lily some sugar!
0DI0022660	Have you got a hug for me, cutie-pie?
0DI0022661	Grandma Lily's got hugs and kisses for all good little children! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
0DI0022662	Who wants some of Grandma Lily's famous Chocolate Double Surprise?
0DI0022663	Outrageous what Mortimer did. The nerve of some people.
0DI0022664	Oh, Mortimer. You always had the gift of gaffe.
0DI0022665	Usually we punish people who come in here uninvited. But you've made such a splash, we don't have the heart.
0DI0022666	Your theatrics were just priceless. I salute you.
0DI0022667	The boy has seen too much!
0DI0022668	Trespasser!
0DI0022669	You don't belong here!
0DI0022670	Leave this instant!
0DI0022671	Outsiders are forbidden!
0DI0022672	What the devil?
0DI0022674	How do you do?
0DI0022675	Greetings.
0DI0022676	Salutations.
0DI0022677	How do you fare?
0DI0022678	Hello, there.
0DI0022681	You sure you're in the right place?
0DI0022682	Well, well, well. Look what walked in.
0DI0022683	Nobody around here's hiring if you're looking for work.
0DI0022685	This chainlink fence perimeter is worthless. We might as well be defending a cage from the inside.
0DI0022686	This place is off-limits to civilians. You don't like it, take it up with Lieutenant Haggerty.
0DI0022687	Pretty sure H.Q. has forgotten all about us.
0DI0022688	Who knows which side the Legion's gonna hit us from next?
0DI0022689	If the Legion breaks through our defenses, I got one bullet I'm saving just for me.
0DI0022690	We should be up on the front lines, not out here in bumblefuck. This place is a junkyard.
0DI0022691	We're supposed to be relieved any day. That's what they keep telling us. I don't think anyone's coming.
0DI0022692	Maybe that guy Fantastic wasn't an idiot. Maybe he was a genius.
0DI0022693	Damn that was some light show out there.
0DI0022694	That was blinding out there. Feels like I've been staring at the sun.
0DI0022695	Is the plant actually working again?
0DI0022696	The attacks have stopped. Winning the dam saved our asses.
0DI0022697	We lost Forlorn Hope. The eastern front is collapsing. They'll be here next.
0DI0022698	Heard the Brotherhood got smoked. Guess somebody finished what we started.
0DI0022699	With Caesar dead, maybe they'll stop attacking us.
0DI0022700	Hey, man.
0DI0022702	What is it? I'm a busy woman.
0DI0022704	Hello, outsider.
0DI0022705	You're being watched, so don't get any ideas.
0DI0022706	The bunker takes a little getting used to, doesn't it?
0DI0022709	Initiate.
0DI0022710	Greetings, Elder.
0DI0022714	Apprentice.
0DI0022715	The reports say Mr. House's robots are now using tech we've never heard of. We need to send a team up there, soon.
0DI0022716	Looks like Mr. House is out of the picture. One less thing for us to deal with.
0DI0022717	With their leader gone, the Legion will likely tear itself apart. It's what most violent tribal societies do.
0DI0022718	Our instruments show some impressive power fluctuations coming from across the river. What's going on over there?
0DI0022719	There was a huge explosion east of the Colorado a little while ago. Does the NCR have any artillery that big?
0DI0022720	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this  time to strike!
0DI0022721	Seems the destruction of the monorail didn't slow the NCR down much. How many troops do they have?
0DI0022722	There was an attempt on the NCR president's life recently. Too bad it didn't succeed.
0DI0022723	Did you hear? Someone actually managed to assassinate the NCR's president! And we just sit here!
0DI0022724	The other day I heard some bigwig in the NCR military died. Hopefully it disrupts their chain of command some.
0DI0022725	Did you hear about that NCR higher up that died? That he was trying to sabotage them? Hope he wasn't the only one.
0DI0022726	Seems the NCR is making friends. We've had reports of them making overtures to some gang in Freeside.
0DI0022727	We just had word that the town of Primm is now part of the NCR. At this rate, they'll be running the whole region soon.
0DI0022728	I heard some special squad of Rangers is on its way to the Vegas area. I guess the NCR is finally getting serious about fighting the Legion.
0DI0022729	There've been reports that the NCR is moving more and more troops into the area.
0DI0022730	It's the quiet before the storm up top. For once I'm almost glad we're down here.
0DI0022731	I still can't believe we came to terms with the NCR.
0DI0022732	Something I can do for you?
0DI0022734	You got something to say or do you always look like that?
0DI0022735	Boyd's in there with a prisoner right now. Boy, is she pissed.
0DI0022736	That business at the Tops could never happen here. We don't admit that sort of riff-raff.
0DI0022737	I know Benny was murdered, but if you ask me, the real crime was that checkered jacket.
0DI0022738	A little bird told me Benny might be gone for good. He must've been in some delightful scandal to have run off so suddenly.
0DI0022739	Those Omertas. Always plotting, never relevant. Bravo for putting them in their place like that.
0DI0022740	Word has it you were spotted entering the Lucky 38. How ever did you get on that guest list?
0DI0022741	Is it me or do the Securitrons seem... sassier?
0DI0022742	Whatever has become of Mr. House? He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
0DI0022743	There's a rumor going around that you killed Caesar! I'm dying to know... is it true? That he used a hairpiece, I mean?
0DI0022744	Caesar may be dead, but I think the toga is here to stay. You simply can't buy better thigh accentuation.
0DI0022745	The Kings will be missed. Not by me, of course. But who will buy the food at the Tops now that no one needs it to grease their hair?
0DI0022746	It sounds like the Kings made nice with the NCR in Freeside. Seems there was room for two flies on the same bit of dung after all.
0DI0022747	Life at the top is immensely satisfying.
0DI0022748	You mustn't ask why we wear our masks. We are forbidden to speak of it.
0DI0022749	It must be horrible to live in places without luxury.
0DI0022750	Lookin' sharp, Ramos.
0DI0022751	Hey, Ramos.
0DI0022752	Heya Torres.
0DI0022753	How's the ol' cage treating you, Torres?
0DI0022754	Still breakin' hearts there, I see, Scribe Schuler.
0DI0022755	How are you, Scribe Schuler?
0DI0022756	I can hardly notice that lazy eye anymore, Watkins.
0DI0022757	Watkins.
0DI0022758	Don't work too hard there, Ibsen.
0DI0022759	You look tired, Ibsen.
0DI0022760	Scribe Taggart! It's your favorite student.
0DI0022761	Hey Scribe Taggart! Did you get some sun?
0DI0022762	Hardin.
0DI0022763	Hey! How ya been?
0DI0022764	Long time, no see!
0DI0022767	Let's get going!
0DI0022768	How did the Legion make it into the power plant?
0DI0022769	You need to get to the Legate!
0DI0022770	Don't shoot!
0DI0022771	Please don't kill me!
0DI0022772	Watch your step, sister.
0DI0022773	If you can't keep that thing under control, I will.
0DI0022774	I've never seen a ghoul up close. Not sure I wanted to.
0DI0022775	Make my day, mutant.
0DI0022776	I can take care of that robot problem for you. Just saying.
0DI0022777	Whatever you're selling, we have plenty.
0DI0022778	Once a republican, always a republican.
0DI0022779	You aren't stealing our medicine, are you, doc?
0DI0022780	You should get out of my face before you get yourself hurt.
0DI0022781	I don't know how you survived the bombardment. That's incredible.
0DI0022782	I'm happy you came along. You are the answer to our dreams.
0DI0022783	I can't believe we may see the superfortress built in my lifetime.
0DI0022784	Really? So we may see our dream of flight soon?
0DI0022785	I hear you're going to help us, I hope you're up for the task.
0DI0022786	I'm happy that we managed to raise the bomber in my lifetime.
0DI0022788	I didn't think the day would ever come, but thanks to you our dreams have come true!
0DI0022789	I'm amazed that an outsider has proven so helpful.
0DI0022790	You've given us the ability to touch the sky! Thank you.
0DI0022791	You've done us a great service. Thank you.
0DI0022792	You've done us a great service. Thank you for your help.
0DI0022793	I'm not going to take anything from you. Leave me alone!
0DI0022794	Hey! You tried to get me sick!
0DI0022795	You should learn to give kids nice things... Like toys!
0DI0022796	You're the one that tried to give me that yucky stuff.
0DI0022797	I don't think I should talk to you. You aren't very nice.
0DI0022798	You need to leave me alone. I don't like you anymore.
0DI0022799	I like you, we should play sometime!
0DI0022800	Thanks for the toy! It was great!
0DI0022801	Yay! I love my new toy!
0DI0022802	I'm going to play raise the B-29!
0DI0022803	Sorry, no time to talk, Outsider.
0DI0022805	Nice day we're having.
0DI0022806	That Fiend leader got what he fucking deserved.
0DI0022807	Fuck that Fiend bastard. Wish I would've seen him die.
0DI0022808	Can't help thinking that we've not seen the last of the Fiends yet.
0DI0022809	I hope the Fiends have learned their lesson.
0DI0022810	Won't have to worry about those Fiend assholes for some time now, huh?
0DI0022811	I heard Mr. House's done for. I hope the Sewers don't turn for the worse.
0DI0022812	We should reclaim the rest of city, if the rumors about House are true.
0DI0022813	It's too bad the NCR boss got out alive.
0DI0022814	Even Presidents die, huh? Good.
0DI0022815	Caesar's death don't change shit down here.
0DI0022816	That Legion boss would've never taken the city, but I'm glad he's a goner.
0DI0022817	Wonder if we can move into the Sewers under the Strip now that Mr. House is outta business.
0DI0022818	The wind's changing. I can see trouble ahead.
0DI0022819	If there's war in the end, it won't affect our city.
0DI0022820	Rumors of imminent war have made it all the way down here.
0DI0022821	Going to stay down here until all the trouble outside blows over.
0DI0022822	Looks like the entire region's going straight where we are - knee-deep in shit.
0DI0022823	Only one bad thing about the Thorn, it brings all the idiots, assholes and topsiders down here.
0DI0022824	Going to place me a good bet at The Thorn.
0DI0022825	One of these days, Red Lucy's going to show off her Deathclaws.
0DI0022826	All hell broke loose when the creatures escaped from The Thorn!
0DI0022827	Can't believe that The Thorn's no more.
0DI0022829	Red Lucy was a fine warrior, and a beautiful woman.
0DI0022830	We'll miss Red Lucy down here.
0DI0022831	The Hostetlers have gone through quite some trouble, lately.
0DI0022832	Terrible thing, what happened to the Hostetlers.
0DI0022833	Fiends don't come here no more, they say.
0DI0022834	I bet NCR troops can't wait to clean the sewers.
0DI0022835	New Vegas, paradise, my ass.
0DI0022836	NCR came all the way to save us, huh? Guess they missed the shit-holes.
0DI0022837	NCR should head back to their lands, I'm sure *their* people miss them.
0DI0022838	Stay underground at night.
0DI0022839	Watch out where you exit. Sewers can lead you to Fiend territory.
0DI0022840	Keep an eye on your stuff. Damn thieves.
0DI0022841	Don't go too far, it's all shadows and dangers in the lower levels.
0DI0022842	Careful with those Fiends in the western sewers.
0DI0022843	I need my fix.
0DI0022844	I hurt all over.
0DI0022845	Going to eat the next fucking rat I see.
0DI0022846	Just got to find me some sweet Jet.
0DI0022847	Won't ever make enough to live outside.
0DI0022848	Can't go anywhere else.
0DI0022849	Don't think I'll make it topside any time soon.
0DI0022850	Smells like shit all the time, but at least we're safer than in the Wastes.
0DI0022851	Beats being on patrol.
0DI0022852	Just lost a month's caps...
0DI0022853	Fucking Crocker couldn't find his ass if it wasn't on his backside...
0DI0022854	Don't be carrying any guns into the casino.
0DI0022855	Love how this place comes alive at night.
0DI0022856	You should see this place at night.
0DI0022857	Looking to lose a few caps, huh? Just the place.
0DI0022858	The bots have enough firepower to arm a full platoon.
0DI0022859	I won't be missing Mr. House, that's a given. The Strip's better off without him.
0DI0022860	It was a matter of time before someone got to Mr. House.
0DI0022861	NCR should take this chance, now that Mr. House's out of the way.
0DI0022862	Good riddance, Caesar! We can finally enjoy some R&R without worrying about a Legion attack at McCarran.
0DI0022863	I tell you, something stinks about this Monorail attack!
0DI0022864	My buddies at McCarran will find the asshole that destroyed our Monorail.
0DI0022865	Once I'm done here, I hope they assign me to find the son of a bitch that took down our President.
0DI0022866	I heard it got nasty at the Tops; wish I could've seen the shooting.
0DI0022867	My buddies at Camp McCarran are breathing easy now that the Fiends' leader is dead.
0DI0022868	Without leadership, the Fiends are as good as dead!
0DI0022869	Traveling into the Strip just got a lot easier now that the Fiends' leaders are dead.
0DI0022871	Shame about the fighting at the Tops; it's got the best patrons around here, hands down!
0DI0022873	Kimball's dead, I wonder how long until the Legion's at our walls.
0DI0022875	It's amazing that Kimball managed to survive.
0DI0022876	If someone can blow up the Monorail, I guess we're not safe even in the Strip.
0DI0022878	How the hell did the monorail blow up? Someone's bringing back luck into the Strip, I tell you.
0DI0022880	Someone got Mr. House. The Strip's going to change, I'd bet on it.
0DI0022882	After what happened to Mr. House, nobody knows for sure what's in play for the Strip.
0DI0022884	The tables turned for Mr. House. What next, huh?
0DI0022886	Looks like Mr. House run out of luck, huh?
0DI0022888	These bots now have eyes on their backs, I swear!
0DI0022890	Those punks at Gomorrah got what they deserved.
0DI0022891	Come on... time to get lucky.
0DI0022893	Luck's about to change, I can feel it.
0DI0022895	Almost outta caps...
0DI0022897	Damn slots are robbery.
0DI0022898	The robots here look different than others I've seen.
0DI0022900	Wish I could've seen what's inside the 38.
0DI0022902	Did you hear? Gomorrah's under new management!
0DI0022904	You turned around?
0DI0022906	Watch your caps - they go quick.
0DI0022908	Seeing the sights?
0DI0022910	Vegas at night is like nothing else.
0DI0022912	Who would have thought a place like this would exist?
0DI0022914	At this rate, one Securitron is going to be enough to defend the whole Strip.
0DI0022915	Help you?
0DI0022917	Monorail transit is safe transit.
0DI0022918	Report any suspicious activity near the Monorail.
0DI0022919	No loitering.
0DI0022920	Please enjoy the casinos.
0DI0022921	Please do not stand in the fountains.
0DI0022922	No violence is permitted on the Strip.
0DI0022923	Obedience is virtuous.
0DI0022924	Please obey all weapon laws.
0DI0022925	Continuing patrol.
0DI0022926	Strip secure.
0DI0022927	Hey, good going with that hit on The Tops.
0DI0022928	That prick, Benny, had it coming.
0DI0022929	I always suspected Benny was a coward.
0DI0022930	You must have some serious brass to fight off Benny's goons. Bravo.
0DI0022931	You made a real mess of the Omertas. Looks like the place will be under new management now.
0DI0022932	You must have some real pull with House to get inside the Lucky 38.
0DI0022933	Have you seen the new Securitron upgrades? I pity anyone who gets testy with those bots now.
0DI0022934	The Lucky 38 has been quiet. I wonder if something happened to House.
0DI0022935	Have you noticed the Securitrons acting up? People are saying House might be dead.
0DI0022936	Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar! That son of a bitch had it coming!
0DI0022937	People say Caesar is dead. I hope someone worse doesn't replace him.
0DI0022938	Good going destroying House's Securitron Army. That old boy's had too much power for too long.
0DI0022939	Great, with the monorail bombed, Freeside is the only route in and out of Vegas.
0DI0022940	At least the local vendors are seeing more business with these wealthy NCR shits wandering through.
0DI0022941	I hear some Legionary named Silus got freed from McCarran. He's got quite the NCR kill count.
0DI0022942	Why didn't you just let Kimball get killed? What did he ever do for us to warrant saving his life?
0DI0022943	You must have thought you were hot shit going after Kimball like that, huh?
0DI0022944	I hear you bagged kimball. Damn fine work, kid.
0DI0022945	Some President Kimball was. Chalk up another death to NCR incompetence.
0DI0022946	Good riddance. With Chief Hanlon dead, that's one less officer to lead the NCR troops.
0DI0022947	Too bad Hanlon is dead. It turns out he was trying to get the NCR out of the Mojave.
0DI0022948	The Fiends have been less organized with Motor Runner gone. Good riddance.
0DI0022949	Shouldn't be long before the Fiends are wiped out, now that their bosses are gone.
0DI0022950	Did you hear? The Legion attacked Bitter Springs!
0DI0022951	Did you hear the Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I wonder how that happened.
0DI0022952	People say the Khans got wiped out at Red Rock. That's one less bunch of crazies to worry about.
0DI0022953	The Great Khans moved out. One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
0DI0022954	Crazy Khan bastards. What were they thinking attacking the dam like that?
0DI0022955	With the Kings gone, Freeside is going to be a real mess.
0DI0022956	The Kings are working with NCR? What's this place coming to?
0DI0022957	People are talking, buddy. You've made quite an impression on The Strip.
0DI0022958	The Rangers are getting reinforcements? I hope they don't decide to bring the battle to Freeside.
0DI0022959	Things look to be building up on either side of the dam. This doesn't look good.
0DI0022960	The legion is bad enough. The last thing we needed around here is even tougher NCR Ranger thugs coming along.
0DI0022961	It looks like the Legion and NCR are getting ready for a fight. I hope that doesn't end badly for us.
0DI0022962	I hope the NCR have the manpower to defend the dam. It looks like the Legion are going to attack soon.
0DI0022963	Without you, we'd all be slaves. Thanks for helping the NCR at the dam.
0DI0022964	As if House didn't have enough control already. At least we don't have to deal with NCR or the Legion, now.
0DI0022971	Howdy, Arcade.
0DI0022972	Another NCR grunt.
0DI0022973	Good to see another strong-willed woman around.
0DI0022974	That is one odd robot.
0DI0022975	A Super mutant in Freeside?
0DI0022976	That has to be the oldest Ghoul I've ever seen.
0DI0022977	What's up Rex?
0DI0022980	Well hello, pretty lady.
0DI0022982	Hey yeah. Hi.
0DI0022983	Was that a guy or a gal? Aw hell, I need to stop drinking.
0DI0022984	Ugh?
0DI0022985	What the hell? I didn't eat any corn this week.
0DI0022986	Ya got any grog?!
0DI0022987	Ya got any change, man? I've got two kids to feed.
0DI0022988	Ya got any change, man? I've got three kids to feed.
0DI0022989	Ya got any change, man? I've got seven kids to feed.
0DI0022990	Woooooo!
0DI0022991	You seen Gourd around?
0DI0022992	Oh, I don't think last night's rat is agreeing with me.
0DI0022993	Hey lady! I know you've got some hooch somewhere in there!
0DI0022994	Hey! Nice hat, nancy boy!
0DI0022995	Oh, my head is killing me. I need another drink.
0DI0022997	I swear Dixon's hooch is killing me.
0DI0022998	Dixon's hooch may be cheap, but it tastes like it was filtered through a dirty sock.
0DI0022999	Hey baby, I got what you need right here! <Burp>
0DI0023001	Just give us an excuse. Been too long since I fired my weapon.
0DI0023002	Don't go fucking about, asshole.
0DI0023003	Mess with any of the equipment here and I'll mount your head on a stick.
0DI0023004	Just try pulling some of your Brahmin shit here at the Dorado and see what happens.
0DI0023005	Not much happens here at the Dorado, and that's how we like it.
0DI0023006	Only combat I seen lately was shooting some Geckos.
0DI0023007	All the juice from Hoover flows right through the Dorado, and we send it west to keep the home lights burning.
0DI0023008	We keep an eye out for Legion raiding parties. They'd love to shut down the Dorado.
0DI0023009	My folks back home got lights at night thanks to what we're doing here.
0DI0023010	Just stay out of the control room and enclosure.
0DI0023011	The power transmission cables are all underground. Good thing, or the old war might've knocked them down.
0DI0023012	You visiting every NCR post just to see the sights? This here's the Dorado - it's where we send power back home.
0DI0023013	Look all you want, just don't mess with any of the equipment. The control room's off-limits, and so is the enclosure.
0DI0023017	I got kicked outta Ultra Luxe the other day. Man, that place gives me the fucking creeps.
0DI0023018	Business is good. All the Families got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
0DI0023019	I'm glad they don't let just any motherfucker through the gate. Freeside smells like shit.
0DI0023020	Fiends are bad for business. NCR should do their fucking job.
0DI0023021	There's some serious shit going on between NCR and the Legion. They better not fuck with our power.
0DI0023022	Fuck Not-At-Home, must be cozy up there in the Lucky 38.
0DI0023023	Bosses don't like no trouble in their place.
0DI0023024	Gomorrah is always open for Business.
0DI0023025	Find yourself a girl or a guy. Have some fun.
0DI0023026	I think there is something wrong with that dog.
0DI0023027	Uh, I don't think we allow her kind in here. I'll let it go this time though.
0DI0023028	Your ghoul wants to have some fun he can, we don't discriminate.
0DI0023030	What the fuck is that thing?
0DI0023031	Big tough ranger better not start any trouble in here.
0DI0023032	Let me know if the pretty lady with you is looking for some work.
0DI0023033	That Follower fucker is going to have some trouble if he tries to liberate any of our employees.
0DI0023034	Kings sold out to the NCR huh? Might be worth a sit down with them.
0DI0023035	Word on the street is something big is about to go down at Hoover Dam.
0DI0023036	I hear you been making some waves around here.
0DI0023037	I hear the Legion is moving some new tough muscle into the area. NCR better keep their heads down.
0DI0023038	Kings were small time. Not surprised they got themselves iced.
0DI0023039	Those fucking Monkey Khans joined the NCR? I can't believe they finally got themselves civilized.
0DI0023040	Khans finally got what they had coming. Glad we won't have to worry about them again.
0DI0023041	You hear what happened over at Bitter Springs? Not too pretty.
0DI0023042	Kimball managed to get himself knocked off. Serves him right.
0DI0023043	I hear Kimball dodged a bullet there.
0DI0023044	The NCR seems none too happy about losing their little train.
0DI0023045	Glad that fucker House is gone.
0DI0023046	Woah, the great Caesar is dead. The management doesn't seem too happy.
0DI0023047	House? More like House light. I heard he got himself unplugged.
0DI0023048	Holy shit, you been in Lucky 38? You meet the Big Man in there?
0DI0023049	Shit, I can't believe Cachino betrayed the Family.
0DI0023050	Nice work at the Tops buddy.
0DI0023051	What the fuck are you looking at?
0DI0023052	Be sure to check out the courtyard, some of the hottest asses in New Vegas shaking out there.
0DI0023053	You know you want a piece of this, give me some sugar.
0DI0023054	I don't think that's what they mean by doggy style.
0DI0023055	Mmm, I haven't had a ghoul before. Do I get to keep the tip?
0DI0023056	Ooo, the big one looks like fun. Let me know if you want a good time.
0DI0023057	Hey sexy lady, looking for a good time?
0DI0023058	Hey big guy, looking for a good time?
0DI0023059	Gomorrah has the loosest slots on the Strip.
0DI0023060	Welcome back to Gomorrah, find yourself a girl or a guy, and have a drink. You're family.
0DI0023062	Did Benny beg before you burned his sorry ass?
0DI0023064	I hear you chased that chicken shit Benny off. Good riddance.
0DI0023066	Things are good since Cachino took over.
0DI0023068	Hot damn do I love this place.
0DI0023069	This place smells like booze and sex. That's why I always come back.
0DI0023070	I hope my dad doesn't find out how much money those hookers cost me.
0DI0023071	The Tops is a real snooze fest. I hope they get some new shows soon.
0DI0023072	Don't walk away, let me show you the time of your life.
0DI0023073	I tell you, Not-At-Home is gonna have his day.
0DI0023085	That's the mook that killed Benny!
0DI0023086	That's the guy who killed Caesar!
0DI0023087	That's the chick who killed Caesar!
0DI0023088	Ain't you the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy, baby, showing your face in here.
0DI0023089	Ain't that the cat that tried to ice the President? Gutsy fella, showing his face in here.
0DI0023090	Ain't that the bird that tried to ice the President? Gutsy dame, showing her face in here.
0DI0023091	Ave, true to Caesar.
0DI0023094	I wouldn't mind hitting that, does she put out?
0DI0023095	My buddy saw some sort of elite ranger squad the other day. They took out his group from a quarter mile off.
0DI0023096	I hear someone killed Motor-Runner.
0DI0023097	More tough Securitrons? Shit, now we really got to stay the fuck outta the Strip.
0DI0023098	I need to get some more chems.
0DI0023099	I'm getting the shakes. I need something to take the edge off.
0DI0023100	Damn, I think I got some bad shit.
0DI0023103	Goddamn, I need a fix.
0DI0023104	Hey, got any Jet?
0DI0023105	Kimball had it coming. Maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
0DI0023106	That NCR president somehow managed to survive a Legion hit.
0DI0023107	Motor Runner is dead? Who the fuck is going to be running the show now?
0DI0023108	Are the Khans going to keep selling us shit, if they join the Legion?
0DI0023109	House unplugged like a light. Wonder if he twitched before he bit it.
0DI0023111	The Khans are all gone, wonder if they left behind their shit for making our goods.
0DI0023113	Fuck, where are we gonna get our shit from now that the Khans are all buddy buddy with the NCR.
0DI0023115	NCR is going to be rip shit about losing their little train.
0DI0023116	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker if we find out who did it.
0DI0023119	Primm is going to be much tougher to push around with that new sheriff down there.
0DI0023121	A flying robot? Man, I must be fucked up.
0DI0023122	Is that Mean Sonofabitch? They all look the same to me.
0DI0023124	Your pet ghoul smells like ass.
0DI0023126	Things are tense on the Strip right now. The head of one of Mr. House's Families was killed. Time to lay low, you ask me.
0DI0023127	You got something you want to say?
0DI0023129	May I help you?
0DI0023132	Hey, doll.
0DI0023133	Look who it is. Freeside's favorite son.
0DI0023134	Look who it is. Freeside's leading lady.
0DI0023135	Hey, it's good to see you.
0DI0023136	Hey there. You're the King's friend, right?
0DI0023137	You here to start trouble?
0DI0023138	You in the right neighborhood?
0DI0023139	I'd keep moving, if I were you.
0DI0023140	You know, I was just talking about trash, and here you are.
0DI0023141	Don't think the shit you've pulled has been forgotten.
0DI0023142	You want some of this?
0DI0023143	Personal space meaning anything to you, guy?
0DI0023144	Personal space meaning anything to you, lady?
0DI0023145	Going to the Wrangler tonight?
0DI0023146	Hey man, what are you up to?
0DI0023147	Heard there was some excitement in one of the casinos in the Strip. Bunch of people got hurt when some nut started attacking people.
0DI0023148	Some nut attempted to kill the head of one of Mr. House's Families recently. Whoever did it is either crazy or has balls the size of Freeside.
0DI0023149	Did you hear someone managed to fight their way through the Chairmen and flee the Strip after being caught? Wonder if they're hiding out in Freeside.
0DI0023150	Looks like Gomorrah's under new management. I wonder what happened?
0DI0023151	There's talk of someone going into the Lucky 38 to talk to Mr. House. That's bullshit. Everyone knows Mr. House doesn't talk to anyone.
0DI0023152	Man, I thought these tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
0DI0023153	Is it true? Is Mr. House gone?
0DI0023154	Word on the street is that the leader of the Legion bought it. Too bad, someone was finally going to do something about all the NCR around here.
0DI0023155	There was some some kind of explosion to the east a little while ago. Has the fighting started?
0DI0023156	Did you hear? Someone bombed the monorail down at McCarran, so everyone's been forced to come through here to get to the Strip. Business is booming.
0DI0023157	Seems like they've got things straightened out in McCarran now, but we're still seeing a big increase in traffic here.
0DI0023158	I can't believe someone stopped the NCR president from getting killed. If anyone deserves it, it's that jerk.
0DI0023159	Someone took a shot at the NCR president, but the lucky bastard got away. Oh well, it was a good try.
0DI0023160	Hey, did you hear the NCR president got whacked? Good for whoever did it, I say. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
0DI0023161	There's mutterings from the NCR people around here that some local hero of theirs died. Whatever.
0DI0023162	Turns out some military hero the Squatters admired was actually a slimeball. An NCR soldier who's actually a dick? Who would've thought?
0DI0023163	Heh, word is the leader of the Fiends got taken down. I would have done it myself, it he ever had the courage to step into Freeside.
0DI0023164	I heard that some of the bosses of the Fiends were killed. Wouldn't be surprised if the NCR had something to do with it.
0DI0023165	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? If we're lucky, the NCR will pull some of their soldiers away from here and send them that way.
0DI0023166	Word is the Khans signed a treaty with the NCR. Never saw that coming.
0DI0023167	The Khans used to be a big deal around here, but look at them now. There's talk that they were all killed up in the mountains.
0DI0023168	Weird, someone just told me that the Khans split the Vegas area. Wonder where they went, and why.
0DI0023169	I can't believe the King is dead. What's going to happen to us now?
0DI0023170	If you had asked me a month ago, I'd have said we'd never willingly work with the NCR. But look at us now.
0DI0023171	I still can't believe the King agreed to work with the NCR. But he's the King, and the King knows best.
0DI0023172	So far working with the NCR hasn't been too bad. If anything, things seem to be getting better.
0DI0023173	Great, just when you think the NCR can't possibly sink their claws deeper, the town of Primm signs up to join the Republic.
0DI0023174	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. Been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
0DI0023175	The big showdown between the NCR and the Legion is coming soon, believe you me.
0DI0023176	I heard some Squatters talking about some fancy pants Rangers coming into the area soon. Like we need more NCR here.
0DI0023177	Word is those tough guys rangers are here. I ain't seen them myself, but how scary can they be?
0DI0023178	Everyone's talking about Hoover Dam nowadays. I wish the battle would just happen already. The suspense is killing me.
0DI0023179	Hey, isn't that the King's dog?
0DI0023180	If it isn't Rex! Haven't seen you in a while, boy.
0DI0023181	Hey Rexie, who's a good dog?
0DI0023182	I owe you Follower people a beer for patching me up a while back.
0DI0023184	Great, another fuckin' robot.
0DI0023185	Hello, cutie.
0DI0023186	What's a pretty girl like you doing with someone like this?
0DI0023187	You need a boyfriend, honey?
0DI0023189	You want to have some fun with a real man, baby?
0DI0023190	Want a massage, cutie? No charge.
0DI0023191	Buy you a drink, honey?
0DI0023192	Um, er, excuse me. I'll just get out of your way.
0DI0023193	Hey baby. Wanna get wild tonight?
0DI0023194	Wanna come back to my place? I've got my own mattress and everything.
0DI0023195	What's the rush, baby? Stay awhile.
0DI0023196	Why not try following me around for a while, darling? I'll take you someplace nice.
0DI0023197	You're not from around here, right?
0DI0023198	You're going the wrong way, beautiful. My place is the other way.
0DI0023199	Hey, baby. I know a quiet place we can be alone. Or a loud place if you're one of those.
0DI0023203	I'm glad the President is still here to help us settle in these new territories.
0DI0023204	House's dead, this time for good!
0DI0023205	The time to assert our rule over the territories has come.
0DI0023206	If the Legion can equip their men so well, maybe they can take care of me too.
0DI0023207	NCR will civilize all this Wasteland, Primm is only the beginning.
0DI0023208	I hope the Fiends stop their raids now that their boss is gone
0DI0023209	Bad weather ahead, I tell you. The death of our President's just the start.
0DI0023210	I've heard that Securitrons are nastier than ever.
0DI0023211	Sounds like Mr. House is in some kind of trouble.
0DI0023212	After all, Caesar died like the old man he was.
0DI0023214	That Caesar bastard had it coming.
0DI0023216	I'm glad those damn bots are gone for good.
0DI0023218	Someone blew up the Monorail, right by our troops!
0DI0023220	Our guys put the Monorail back to work!
0DI0023222	I hear some asshole freed our enemy from McCarran.
0DI0023224	Can you believe they tried killing our President? Don't they know who they are dealing with?
0DI0023226	Our own President, murdered! Things aren't looking good.
0DI0023228	Hanlon was a brave soldier, what could've driven him to despair?
0DI0023230	Did you hear about Hanlon? What a blow!
0DI0023232	That Fiend leader shouldn't have messed with our great army.
0DI0023234	The Fiends are running for their lives. That'll show everyone what we do to our enemies.
0DI0023235	If the Legion can reach as far as Bitter Springs, what's going to stop them from getting to us?
0DI0023237	Those Khans are savages, but we can use them to our advantage.
0DI0023239	Khans are history, it serves them right!
0DI0023241	Those Khans got the hint! We've shown everyone that these are our new territories.
0DI0023243	I knew those Khans couldn't be trusted!
0DI0023245	I hear we straightened up a band of thugs in Freeside.
0DI0023247	Those Freeside thugs aren't worth our time anymore.
0DI0023249	I hear a troublesome Legion camp got razed to the ground!
0DI0023250	Our forces suffered a huge blow at Forlorn Hope, We'll remember that!
0DI0023252	War doesn't forgive anybody, but what did we do to deserve this?
0DI0023254	Legionaries are next in the list of rabid dogs to put down!
0DI0023256	Civilizing Primm will show what we can do for everyone else in these territories.
0DI0023258	I've heard that elite units are on the way to support our armies here.
0DI0023260	Our rangers are going to show everyone what happens when we're pissed off!
0DI0023262	I've heard the Legion's planning to unleash their best men against us.
0DI0023264	Those Legion elite troops are bad blood.
0DI0023266	Did you know The Strip's all stirred up, lately?
0DI0023267	Things are getting stranger every day.
0DI0023269	It seems that the territories are about to blow up.
0DI0023271	This is it. War's almost upon us.
0DI0023273	Caesar's fate was sealed from the start.
0DI0023275	Wish I could've seen that Legion dog suffer.
0DI0023277	With House out of the way, I hope someone opens the Lucky 38.
0DI0023279	Lady Luck smiled on our President.
0DI0023280	Everywhere I go, people are talking about our President's assassination.
0DI0023282	Kimball's luck ran out.
0DI0023284	Should've bet we'd kill the Fiend's leader.
0DI0023286	I should've taken the Fiend's head for myself.
0DI0023288	They say the Fiends are defeated, but I'm sticking close to the army - just in case.
0DI0023290	I'll believe that the Fiends are gone when they stop their raiding and pillaging.
0DI0023292	They say it's safer to travel now that Fiends are retreating, but I'd still look out for trouble.
0DI0023294	As we've done with the Fiends, we'll kill anyone who resists our fight for peace.
0DI0023296	Legion attacking so far from their bases means we'll have to watch out on the road.
0DI0023298	Bitter Springs... a name like that could've only brought bad luck.
0DI0023300	We're just pushing our luck by signing a treaty with those savage Khans.
0DI0023301	The territories are safer now that the Khans have disappeared.
0DI0023303	I told everyone we shouldn't have bet for the Khans.
0DI0023305	It's clear that savages, like the Khans, can't be trusted to civilize.
0DI0023307	I'll tell everyone back home about how the NCR deals with wild thugs, like the Kings.
0DI0023309	The Kings were pushing it too far, and they got what was coming to them.
0DI0023311	I guess those "Kings" finally got who's the real boss around here.
0DI0023314	Our victory at Nelson's a worthy story to tell in my travels.
0DI0023316	Nelson will serve as example. We'll bleed the ground red with anyone who opposes our peace-efforts.
0DI0023318	In all my years, I've never heard of a worse massacre than what happened at Forlorn Hope.
0DI0023319	It's good to hear that Primm has accepted our law.
0DI0023321	I'd wager that the army's sending elite units our way, right as we speak.
0DI0023323	A reliable source told me we're getting the best NCR soldiers to help us against the Legion.
0DI0023325	Have you seen them? Our Rangers are the finest men alive!
0DI0023327	People are whispering, everywhere, about the massive Legion army gathering past the Colorado.
0DI0023329	Looks like the Legion also brought their own elite warriors to the territories.
0DI0023331	You'd be crazy to put your money on either side of the coming battle.
0DI0023333	We'll make this land peaceful, after we kill everybody who opposes us.
0DI0023335	It's time to pack and leave these lands until the dust settles.
0DI0023337	With Caesar out of the way, we'll assert our rule over the territories.
0DI0023339	As long as the Khans leave our lands alone, I don't care what happens.
0DI0023340	I knew that the Khans were animals. We should kill them like vermin.
0DI0023342	Those Legion beasts needed to be put down, like the vermin they are!
0DI0023343	I've heard that we're getting strong reinforcements to help us civilize the territories.
0DI0023345	Instead of spending a fortune in this war, the NCR should be paying us to survive!
0DI0023347	I could buy back my *life* with the money it must cost to make one of those Ranger elite armors!
0DI0023349	The Legion better watch out now, our Rangers are going to turn the tables around!
0DI0023352	We can't sit idly while the Legion prepares their own elite forces.
0DI0023355	Despite our strength, the Legion army looks fierce enough to make me waiver.
0DI0023358	Maybe when this is all over, they'll find time to look after us.
0DI0023360	The ground in Forlorn Hope was soaked red, from the blood of our own people!
0DI0023362	Forlorn Hope was massacrated. How are the troops going to defend poor sobs like us?
0DI0023366	I hear the Khans won't trouble us anymore.
0DI0023387	We got ourselves a little Ranger family reunion now. Time's right for a feud.
0DI0023388	Monster of the East, huh? Well I've got the Monster of the West in my holster right now. Hope I get to introduce them.
0DI0023389	A veteran Ranger inspires awe. Stick around for when they get here, you'll see. If I live to earn the Black Armor, I can die a happy woman.
0DI0023390	First Recon's in Camp Forlorn Hope. Get some Rangers in there too and it'll be a damned impregnable fortress.
0DI0023391	Wish I could've been there, defending Camp Forlorn Hope. Even if it didn't change anything.
0DI0023392	Looks like we booted the Legion outta Nelson. About damn time.
0DI0023393	From here on out, we fight for Chief Hanlon.
0DI0023394	President Kimball was a tough son-of-a-gun. The Rangers'll pick up where he left off.
0DI0023395	President Kimball was a soldier's soldier. It's up to us to make the Legion pay for what they did.
0DI0023396	You saved President Kimball, didn't you? Hell of a thing.
0DI0023397	Don't get many chances to catch a legionary alive. Burns me up that we botched ours.
0DI0023398	All you need is one Ranger protecting the monorail. You don't even need to feed him that much. He'll get it done.
0DI0023399	Wish I had a First Recon guy looking after me.
0DI0023400	Hoover Dam... just thinking about it makes me nervous.
0DI0023401	One of the Ranger vets looked at me and I just about surrendered.
0DI0023402	The Ranger vets are on their way from Baja. Never seen one before. But I've heard they chew nails and spit napalm.
0DI0023403	We put our trust in Hanlon and look where it got us. Makes you wonder if we can trust anyone at all.
0DI0023404	Chief Hanlon's watching over us now. He won't let us lose.
0DI0023405	They got to President Kimball. How long can we hold out?
0DI0023406	Oh my God, are you the one who saved President Kimball?
0DI0023407	I heard we captured a live Centurion and then let him get away. That never would've happened if I was in charge.
0DI0023408	No monorail access to the Strip? Where am I supposed to take my leave? Freeside?
0DI0023409	We won't go quietly. The Legion can count on that.
0DI0023410	Sounds like we're running Primm now. I'd still rather take my leave at the Strip.
0DI0023411	First Recon's at Camp Forlorn Hope. Now we've got a chance to hold it.
0DI0023412	Nelson's back in our hands. I hope we can defend it this time.
0DI0023413	Is it me, or has the Brotherhood stopped engaging us? Smartest move they ever made, you ask me.
0DI0023414	Smart move for the Kings to back down. They didn't know who they were messing with.
0DI0023415	We signed a treaty with the Great Khans. Guess you can never have too many lowlife chem dealers on your side.
0DI0023416	Sickens me that the Legion would try to harvest slaves from a refugee camp.
0DI0023417	President Kimball is lucky he escaped. I don't think we could lose him right now.
0DI0023418	Wish I could've been there to see Caesar die. What an asshole.
0DI0023419	Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
0DI0023420	Keeping the Strip secure has been hell since the monorail was taken out.
0DI0023421	Did you hear about that Legion POW escape? I don't like our chances of taking him alive twice.
0DI0023422	They're talking about you on the radio. Saving President Kimball. I'm impressed.
0DI0023423	How could we lose Kimball at a time like this?
0DI0023424	Chief Hanlon was a model soldier. We all looked up to him.
0DI0023425	Too bad about Chief Hanlon. He did what he thought was best for us.
0DI0023426	Without Camp Forlorn Hope, it's a matter of time before the Legion surrounds us at the Dam.
0DI0023427	This whole war's gonna change when the Ranger veterans get here. Soon as we see the Black Armor, we can all breathe easier.
0DI0023428	A platoon of veteran Rangers is like a tactical nuke, only tougher to scare.
0DI0023429	This battle... everything's riding on it.
0DI0023430	That red beret's looking good, soldier.
0DI0023431	The security lapse with the monorail is a huge embarrassment.
0DI0023432	That POW escape presents some real security concerns. That was our base camp, for crying out loud.
0DI0023433	There's something fishy about how Chief Hanlon died. It just doesn't add up.
0DI0023434	Can't believe Hanlon was working against us.
0DI0023435	No hope of securing the border now that Forlorn Hope fell.
0DI0023436	The Ranger veterans have been running ops in Baja. We'll be a different army with them here.
0DI0023437	We've got our best Rangers here now. All of a sudden I like our chances a whole lot better.
0DI0023438	If we lose Hoover Dam, we can kiss Nevada goodbye.
0DI0023439	The bosses of the Omergas? Omer-nas? The ones that run Gomorrah? Someone killed them.
0DI0023440	So I hear the honcho of one of them Strip families up and disappeared - poof! Yeah, they'll find his body someday...
0DI0023442	You hear there was some kinda shoot-out at one of them casinos on the Strip? Some people got killed or something.
0DI0023444	That tower on the Strip, the one you can see for miles? I hear it ain't sealed-up no more.
0DI0023446	That tower on the Strip popped open like a can and let somebody walk right in. Mark my words - some evil's afoot.
0DI0023447	They say those robots on the Strip are running around with different faces or something. Don't ask, because I don't know...
0DI0023449	Those robots on the Strip, Securi-troids or what have you? Well, they been acting different or something.
0DI0023450	The same robots on the Strip, I seen one or two of them roll past town time to time. Well, the face on them looked meaner.
0DI0023451	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots.But lately some of them been two-faced.
0DI0023452	A customer who been to the Strip told me the faces on the robots there changed from police to soldiers. Now why would that be?
0DI0023454	That Mr. House who lorded over the Strip is dead. Good riddance, I say.
0DI0023455	Now that Mr. House's gone, might be opportunities on the Strip for an enterprising merchant.
0DI0023456	I bet that Mr. House had a buncha booze in his place. Someone oughta get it out of there. He ain't using it!
0DI0023457	If Caesar's dead, why ain't the NCR taking care of regular folks yet?
0DI0023459	You hear Caesar's dead? Good for trade if the Legion goes away, that's for sure.
0DI0023460	I heard Caesar didn't let nobody drink or drug. Probably why he got killed.
0DI0023461	Who cares if Caesar's dead? Don't affect our town one bit.
0DI0023462	If the NCR ain't got to worry about Caesar no more, it should worry about improving the lives of regular folks around here.
0DI0023464	So much for the might of the NCR! Their President got killed over at Hoover Dam!
0DI0023466	You hear how the President of the NCR got killed? Gonna be hard to score chems around here for a while...
0DI0023467	Someone tried to kill the NCR President over at Hoover Dam. They say it was Legion.
0DI0023469	That President Kimball nearly got killed at Hoover Dam. Now he knows how we feel about the NCR around here.
0DI0023470	How's the NCR gonna protect Vegas if it can't even protect its own President?
0DI0023472	The NCR's top Ranger, Chief Hanlon, put a gun in his mouth. Think he would've done that if the NCR stood a chance at beating the Legion?
0DI0023474	Turns out the NCR's top Ranger was a traitor! If the Legion can turn a man like Hanlon, what chance has the NCR got?
0DI0023476	You hear the Legion attacked Bitter Springs? Didn't know there was anything left there to attack.
0DI0023478	Someone finally put down that sick Motor Runner sonofabitch. Good riddance.
0DI0023480	Those Fiend junkies over at Vault 3 been taking some hits. I say kill them all.
0DI0023482	With fewer of them Fiends sucking up the chems, maybe I can finally score a hit now and then.
0DI0023483	With those Fiends on the run, I should head over to Vault 3 and see if I can pull some salvage out of there.
0DI0023484	The Great Khans signing a treaty with the NCR? I never woulda seen that coming.
0DI0023486	Have you seen that tower on the Strip all lit up? You can see it for miles!
0DI0023488	I hear the Great Khans just packed up and left Red Rock Canyon. Always thought the NCR and them would fight it out again.
0DI0023490	The Great Khans up and left Red Rock Canyon. Who's gonna brew fresh chems now?
0DI0023491	I hear the Great Khans got massacred again. No survivors this time, though.
0DI0023493	They say the Kings got massacred. Who's gonna watch over Freeside now?
0DI0023495	I hear the NCR and the Kings have been getting along. That's good news for Freeside.
0DI0023497	The NCR took back Nelson. Maybe they can win this war after all.
0DI0023499	First the Legion takes Nelson, then it wipes out Camp Forlorn Hope. The NCR don't stand a chance.
0DI0023501	Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope, both butchered. It's almost like God don't like either side.
0DI0023503	There was some kind of massacre at one of the Ranger Stations. I don't know which one.
0DI0023505	Some Khans got corned in the ruins of Boulder City and the NCR killed them. It's like Bitter Springs all over again.
0DI0023506	Some Khans got cornered in the ruins of Boulder City, but the NCR let them go. That's unusual.
0DI0023507	Primm has a new Sheriff. That should keep the Powder Gangers away.
0DI0023509	Primm wimped out and accepted NCR rule. Some people will do anything to feel safe.
0DI0023511	Looks like the war's ratcheting up. I hear the NCR's bringing in elite troops.
0DI0023513	They say the Legion's bringing in Veterans from out in Arizona. They must be getting ready to attack.
0DI0023515	You ever seen one of those Rangers in black armor? I wouldn't want to make one of those mad!
0DI0023517	I hear reports of Legion raiding parties all over the place. They can't all be rumors!
0DI0023519	I keep hearing about some courier making a fuss over at the Strip. Must've delivered more than just mail.
0DI0023521	Mark my words - won't be long before the Legion and NCR butt heads over Hoover Dam.
0DI0023523	Nobody knows who's gonna win, Legion or NCR. Might not make much of a difference around here.
0DI0023524	I hear the Legion's fixing to attack Hoover Dam. Good thing I ain't there.
0DI0023530	I hear someone went crazy in one of the casinos on the Strip, shot the place up or something!
0DI0023532	The honcho of one of them Strip families got killed right in his own casino. You know he pissed off the wrong guy!
0DI0023536	The recent disturbance at the Tops has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize the Tops.
0DI0023537	The recent disturbance at Gomorrah has been resolved. Do not be afraid to patronize Gomorrah.
0DI0023538	Be advised, the Lucky 38 is not open to the general public. Tresspassers will be shot. Thank you.
0DI0023539	Do not be alarmed. We have been upgraded to serve you better. Have a nice day.
0DI0023540	Obitiuaries of the recently deceased Mr. House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the Vegas Strip, are still available. Just ask any Securitron.
0DI0023541	Be advised, Mr. House has voluntarily decided to become a citizen of the NCR.
0DI0023542	Sovereignty over the Vegas Strip will be transferred to the NCR at a date yet to be determined. Have a nice day.
0DI0023543	Be advised, when Mr. House transfers sovereignty over the Vegas Strip to the NCR, he will remain its sole proprietor. Have a nice day.
0DI0023544	The unfortunate incident involving the monorail from McCarran Airport is being resolved as quickly as possible. Thank you.
0DI0023545	Be sure to offer words of encouragement to NCR men and women in uniform. Vegas appreciates their business.
0DI0023546	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball survived an assassination attempt at Hoover Dam.
0DI0023547	Just one more reason to celebrate at one of New Vegas's fine casinos! Thank you.
0DI0023548	Be advised, NCR President Aaron Kimball was struck down in a cowardly attack at Hoover Dam.
0DI0023549	The Strip offers many fine cocktail lounges where grieving persons may drown their sorrows.
0DI0023550	Your move, creep.
0DI0023551	Welcome to the Vegas Strip.
0DI0023552	Enjoy all the Vegas Strip has to offer.
0DI0023553	Enjoy your time on the Vegas Strip.
0DI0023554	Always a pleasure.
0DI0023556	Hello, again.
0DI0023557	Hey, look who's here!
0DI0023558	If it isn't our favorite V.I.P.!
0DI0023559	You're always welcome in this town!
0DI0023560	Try to control your behavior today.
0DI0023561	I'm hoping this is one of your good days.
0DI0023562	Vegas doesn't need your trouble.
0DI0023563	Who knows what you're going to do next?
0DI0023564	I bet you're up to something.
0DI0023565	I don't like the look of you. Never have.
0DI0023566	Don't think we aren't watching you.
0DI0023567	You've got a reputation in this town, and it isn't a good one.
0DI0023568	Don't bother to watch yourself. We're watching for you.
0DI0023569	Come on, tough guy/gal - give me a reason.
0DI0023570	Take your best shot. Then we'll take ours.
0DI0023571	You're bad for Vegas. You don't belong here.
0DI0023574	Enjoy your time in Vegas.
0DI0023575	Be advised, visitors will be held responsible for the behavior of any robots accompanying them.
0DI0023576	Be advised, visitors will be held responsible for the behavior of any non-human sapients accompanying them.
0DI0023608	What the fuck did we do to the Sarge, anyway?
0DI0023609	Can't wait to get the hell out of here.
0DI0023610	This place stinks!
0DI0023611	This sucks.
0DI0023612	Might as well do the job right.
0DI0023613	Hope those Fiends give us no trouble.
0DI0023614	Let's just stay sharp.
0DI0023616	Do you think that men go bald normally? I am sick, and I have embraced my change. Leave me be.
0DI0023617	That's just the kind of thing I'd be expecting them to say. Which proves you're not with them.
0DI0023618	Well, that's a load off. What do you want to know?
0DI0023619	No, I don't think I have much to offer in that department either. Too many blows to the head during combat drills.
0DI0023621	Do that someplace else!
0DI0023622	You tryin' to get me killed?
0DI0023623	Holster that. And be quick about it.
0DI0023624	Holster your iron, pardner!
0DI0023626	Stop that!
0DI0023627	Hey! Do that somewhere else.
0DI0023629	What in tarnation?
0DI0023630	What in blazes?
0DI0023631	Ammo costs money, you know!
0DI0023634	Quit fuckin' around!
0DI0023635	Whoo! Bang bang!
0DI0023636	A pulled trigger's a happy trigger!
0DI0023637	Yeah! Shoot it again!
0DI0023639	Stop doing that, please.
0DI0023640	I'm not sure if you're trying to hit me or trying to miss me. Either way, stop it. Thanks.
0DI0023641	Let me aim that for you next time.
0DI0023642	Am I gonna have to take that away from you?
0DI0023643	Uh, hate to criticize boss, but I'm not actually immortal. Just old.
0DI0023644	Come on, boss, I know I'm ugly, but I am on your side.
0DI0023645	If you want me to split, you could just say so.
0DI0023647	Would you keep it down?
0DI0023648	Waste of ammo.
0DI0023649	What, you see a scorpion?
0DI0023650	If you can't control it, keep it in your holster.
0DI0023651	You'll put someone's eye out with that, dearie!
0DI0023652	It's not nice to do things like that, dear!
0DI0023653	This noise is making Leo get antsy!
0DI0023654	Stow that weapon, Outsider.
0DI0023655	Drop that weapon.
0DI0023657	Keep that up, human?
0DI0023658	Keep that shit away from me.
0DI0023659	What the fuck do you think you're doing.
0DI0023660	Whoa, someone's just come from the Wrangler.
0DI0023661	Keep it down, would ya? I already got a splitting headache.
0DI0023662	Whatever. Knock yourself out, for all I care.
0DI0023663	Put that away!
0DI0023664	Mind your weapon!
0DI0023665	Weapons use is discouraged. Thank you for your cooperation.
0DI0023666	Please do not use your weapons. Thank you.
0DI0023673	How about you line that up on a tin can instead?
0DI0023674	Don't even kid about that.
0DI0023675	You're lookin' at a heap of trouble if you want it.
0DI0023676	If you think you want trouble, then let fly.
0DI0023677	Don't even joke like that.
0DI0023678	Point that somewhere else!
0DI0023679	That safety better be on.
0DI0023680	Point that somewhere else.
0DI0023681	For pete's sake...
0DI0023682	No respect.
0DI0023683	Stop that. I mean it!
0DI0023684	Quit it. You're making me nervous.
0DI0023685	Go ahead. Try me.
0DI0023686	Think you're tough, huh?
0DI0023687	If you need to shoot me, I won't complain!
0DI0023688	Hello! Look what's pointed at me!
0DI0023689	Don't worry about me! You can shoot if you want!
0DI0023690	How about I aim my gun at you for a while, see how you like it?
0DI0023691	I assure you, you look extremely virile. Now, would you mind pointing that somewhere else? Thanks.
0DI0023692	Uh... what's up?
0DI0023694	Why do we always hurt the ones we care about the most?
0DI0023695	You, uhh, you want to point that someplace else, boss? I got enough holes in me.
0DI0023696	Boss, why are you looking at me that way?
0DI0023697	I wouldn't mind this so much if it weren't for that maniacal gleam in your eye.
0DI0023699	Pull that trigger, you'll wish you hadn't.
0DI0023700	Don't like no one drawing a bead on me.
0DI0023701	Better be rocksalt in that, or you're asking for an asskicking.
0DI0023702	Don't make me take that away.
0DI0023704	Pumpkin, don't point that at grandma, there's a dear.
0DI0023705	Leo doesn't like that, dearie. You should stop.
0DI0023706	You're going to make this easy.
0DI0023707	Drop that weapon, Outsider.
0DI0023708	Think about too hard and you'll get burned.
0DI0023710	I wouldn't.
0DI0023712	Who the fuck do you think you are?
0DI0023713	Point that shit somewhere else.
0DI0023714	You want to be getting that gun out of my face right now.
0DI0023715	That's not funny.
0DI0023716	Quit screwing around!
0DI0023717	You think I don't see that?
0DI0023718	Don't tempt me.
0DI0023719	By Caesar, you're walking a fine line.
0DI0023720	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law will not be tolerated.
0DI0023721	Be advised, assaulting an officer of the law is a serious offense.
0DI0023727	What? How'd you get past the guards?
0DI0023728	They're here! Don't let them get the antidote! Oh. It's just you. You can't have it either.
0DI0023729	The molerat men! They've come for my beard at last! Oh. Never mind.
0DI0023730	I hope I don't forget that's there.
0DI0023731	Hard for me to step lightly with a bum leg.
0DI0023732	Now why in tarnation would you put one of those, there.
0DI0023733	Guess we best watch where we step.
0DI0023734	You sure that's necessary?
0DI0023735	What was the point of that?
0DI0023736	What the hell? That's dangerous.
0DI0023737	Um... why are you setting that there?
0DI0023738	That'll show 'em!
0DI0023739	Got any more of those?
0DI0023740	Hey, you dropped something.
0DI0023741	Isn't that a little overkill?
0DI0023742	Why the fuck you puttin' that there?
0DI0023743	Pick that back up or you'll be eatin' it.
0DI0023744	Oooh, you're sneaky!
0DI0023745	I'd like to see someone step on that!
0DI0023746	I'll watch my step.
0DI0023747	Can't wait to see where this is going.
0DI0023749	Careful. Someone could trip on that.
0DI0023750	Oh, sure. Lay mines around the arthritic old man who doesn't see so good. Thanks, boss.
0DI0023751	Do I hear beeping, boss? I think I hear beeping.
0DI0023752	Oh good. Mines.
0DI0023754	I'll keep the dancing to a minimum.
0DI0023755	That ought to even the odds.
0DI0023756	Somebody's ear's going to be ringing.
0DI0023757	There's a leg waiting to go.
0DI0023758	Gonna be a bad day for somebody.
0DI0023759	Ohh, that's very sneaky, dear! I'll be sure not to tell anyone about that mine!
0DI0023760	You should pick that up before someone hurts themselves!
0DI0023761	I see you, Outsider.
0DI0023762	You think that firecracker will be enough?
0DI0023764	You take that back!
0DI0023766	I saw that.
0DI0023767	That's some egg you just laid there, pal. You mind picking it back up?
0DI0023768	You can't just toss those around when you feel like it!
0DI0023769	I see what you're doing.
0DI0023770	Analyzing. This behavior is not on file.
0DI0023771	This behavior is not on file.
0DI0023774	Out of the way!
0DI0023775	Hot potato!
0DI0023776	Scoot!
0DI0023777	Hop to it!
0DI0023781	Oh, crap... take cover!
0DI0023783	Here comes the boom!
0DI0023788	You have a good throwing arm!
0DI0023789	You really know how to throw those things!
0DI0023790	I wish I could throw myself on a grenade!
0DI0023797	Watch out below!
0DI0023798	Go wide!
0DI0023799	Gonna get loud!
0DI0023800	Boom!
0DI0023802	Pineapples, Leo!
0DI0023809	Damn, be careful with those things!
0DI0023810	Got any more of those? I wanna blow something up too!
0DI0023811	Explosive!
0DI0023813	Be advised, a grenade has been thrown.
0DI0023814	Be advised, an explosive has been thrown.
0DI0023842	Die, NCR filth!
0DI0023843	Thank you for your advice. You've helped me see more clearly.
0DI0023844	Flails of God!
0DI0023845	Who are you? How did you find this place?
0DI0023846	Back again. What now?
0DI0023847	Welcome to Novac. It's not very exciting here, but the people are friendly enough.
0DI0023848	You saw the rockets explode, right? It turns out I was lucky they couldn't take me on the Great Journey.
0DI0023849	Do you have any idea what went wrong?
0DI0023850	I'm going to make my way to that little town we talked about.
0DI0023852	My engineering skills have been coming in handy, too. I've got plenty to do. Thanks for telling me about this place.
0DI0023853	Hey! Over here! Are you listening?
0DI0023854	Go to the big room on the east side of this building and take the metal staircase all the way up. And hurry.
0DI0023855	All right, Smoothskin, I'm letting you in. You better watch yourself. I'll sure as hell be watching you.
0DI0023856	What's the problem, smoothskin? Lost your way?
0DI0023857	Hello? Who's down there?
0DI0023858	Stop messing around with the intercom, smoothskin.
0DI0023859	God, but are you ugly! Get upstairs and talk to Jason before I throw up just from looking at you.
0DI0023860	Go bother Jason, smoothskin. I don't like having you around.
0DI0023861	Have you found the components we discussed?
0DI0023863	Have you found the components we discussed? The sooner we get this over with, the better.
0DI0023864	Jason says that I am to cooperate with you on the final tasks necessary to launch the Great Journey.
0DI0023865	Are you ready to get started? Those rockets aren't going to launch themselves.
0DI0023866	It is almost time for the great Journey!
0DI0023867	Not now! It is almost time for the Great Journey!
0DI0023869	Nice enough speech, I guess.
0DI0023870	Well, it's up to you to go launch the rockets. There's a small mission control room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pressin a button.
0DI0023871	It seems my work here is done, so I'll be on my way to Novac. We'll see how that works out.
0DI0023872	Did you hear him? As though some fancy speech can make what they did to me less of a crime?
0DI0023873	Go launch the rockets! There's a cramped little "mission control" room all the way back upstairs. Should be as easy as pushing a button.
0DI0023874	Enjoy the view. I hear the "Great Journey" is going to be shorter than they expected. Sweeter, too.
0DI0023875	Did you hear him? My god, you were right all along. I'm no ghoul! They were just using me...
0DI0023876	Go launch the rockets. Don't worry about me.
0DI0023878	Did you bring the items we discussed? The sooner I send them on their way, the sooner I can head to Novac.
0DI0023880	I'd remember if I had seen you here before, I'm sure of it... What do you want?
0DI0023883	Greetings, Hunter of The Thorn.
0DI0023884	The crowds are waiting for you, stranger. Show us your best.
0DI0023885	It's time for blood, not talk. Find me after the fight.
0DI0023886	Well done, stranger. Here's your share.
0DI0023887	The Thorn does not welcome you, stranger. Leave now or suffer the consequences.
0DI0023888	Even the strongest creatures need their rest, and their companionship. I've been looking forward to this.
0DI0023889	You know where we meet, and that's not here.
0DI0023891	You've broken the rules of The Thorn. You've dishonored this sacred ground! I don't tolerate such offenses.
0DI0023893	We're watching you... stranger!
0DI0023894	Don't fuck with the caged beasts.
0DI0023896	Follow the rules of The Thorn.
0DI0023897	Don't feed the creatures.
0DI0023899	Nowhere else will you find something like The Thorn.
0DI0023900	Take advice. Don't break the rules. And we won't kill you.
0DI0023902	Come see the fights, or Red Lucy?
0DI0023903	Enjoy the show, and don't give us a reason to shoot you, okay?
0DI0023905	Lay down with me, my hunter.
0DI0023906	Our time was sweet, my hunter. But our passion will have to wait - The Thorn demands attention.
0DI0023907	No more fights today. The Thorn needs time to soak its tribute of blood.
0DI0023908	Welcome to REPCONN Headquarters, Rocketeer! Come all this way to see our little facility, have you?
0DI0023909	I'm here to answer any and all questions you may have - within specified parameters - and if you'd like, I can provide a tour of our museum.
0DI0023910	Welcome back! Interested in a tour of the REPCONN museum? Or did you have a question about the company I could answer?
0DI0023911	Yes? Did you have a question?
0DI0023912	Well howdy, pardner! Good to see ya again. Boss is waiting for ya upstairs, so get a move on!
0DI0023913	Howdy, pardner! Doesn't look like you've brought back the Platinum Chip!
0DI0023914	Why don't you mosey on back to wherever it is you left Benny cooling off? Come back when you got it.
0DI0023915	Sorry, pardner, but the boss ain't available to take a meeting!
0DI0023916	Howdy, pardner! Good to see you again!
0DI0023917	Congratulations, pardner! The boss has instructed me to comp you to the High-Roller Suite!
0DI0023918	You can bring your friends, too! Be like a little clubhouse for the gang you put together!
0DI0023919	Just bear in mind, you're the only one gets to see the boss! Any friends you got, they can wait in the suite.
0DI0023920	Enjoy the digs, pardner! They're plenty fancy!
0DI0023921	What floor, pardner?
0DI0023922	Where to, pardner?
0DI0023923	Which floor, now?
0DI0023924	Penthouse floor!
0DI0023925	Cocktail lounge!
0DI0023926	High-roller suite!
0DI0023927	Casino floor!
0DI0023928	B2! Physical Plant!
0DI0023929	B2! Facilities Management!
0DI0023930	Sorry, pardner, if you're heading for the penthouse, you gotta go alone.
0DI0023931	You low-down snake! I wish I'd have left you in the ground to rot!
0DI0023932	Draw!
0DI0023933	Hey hey, fella, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
0DI0023934	Hey hey, baby doll, welcome to the Tops Hotel and Casino! I'm going to have to ask you to hand over any weapons you might be carrying.
0DI0023935	Welcome back to the Tops. Anything I can do for you?
0DI0023937	Get you a drink?
0DI0023938	You're back. Any progress on saving our skins?
0DI0023939	You're some kind of hero, huh? I heard about how you saved the President's life. That's incredible.
0DI0023940	You've heard the news about President Kimball? Thank God he survived, but I hope the Rangers hunt down the miserable traitor that tried to kill him.
0DI0023941	I just can't believe it... the President's dead. It doesn't even feel real.
0DI0023942	You've heard the news about President Kimball? If I got my hands on the traitor that killed him....
0DI0023943	So now it's come to open assassination attempts against the President? Hard to believe.
0DI0023944	Thank God. Please tell me you're here to relieve me.
0DI0023945	Never expected someone as famous as you to turn up here. What can I do for you?
0DI0023946	I've been sending requests for relief for months now. Didn't think they'd send you, though.
0DI0023947	I really hope you're not here to cause trouble.
0DI0023948	Oh. I've heard of you. What do you want?
0DI0023949	I'll give you this, you've got a lot of guts just walking in here like this.
0DI0023951	If this isn't a crisis situation, you'd better have a damn good reason for interrupting me.
0DI0023955	You've been a huge help here. Thanks to you, I think we can hold this camp together.
0DI0023957	It was you that rescued President Kimball, wasn't it? You're becoming quite the celebrity already.
0DI0023958	I heard it was a close call for the President. Good thing he has top-notch security.
0DI0023959	I hear they're already assembling a team to investigate the President's assassination. Going to be one hell of a report.
0DI0023960	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bastard that killed the President.
0DI0023961	I'm a little ashamed to admit it, but a part of me would really love to get my hands on the bitch that killed the President.
0DI0023962	So, the NCR finally sent some relief? It's about damn time.
0DI0023963	Wow. Hey, it's you. What are you doing in Bitter Springs?
0DI0023964	I don't suppose you're feeling helpful today?
0DI0023965	I don't know what you're doing here, but you can just leave. We've got enough problems here.
0DI0023966	Those medical supplies have already been a phenomenal help. Thank you.
0DI0023967	I really appreciate those books. They've already been a huge help.
0DI0023969	Let me see what you got. Yeah, these'll do just fine. Just fine.
0DI0023970	All right now. We're gonna be making something folks on the trail call Healing Powder.
0DI0023971	Go on over to that campfire now. Give it a try.
0DI0023972	Hey, hey! Look who has the hot hands? Here, have something special on the house.
0DI0023973	Looks like someone is on a roll. Luck be a lady tonight. Here's a little something from the Family.
0DI0023974	You keep on spending money in here. You gotta give us a chance to win something back. Here's something nice for you.
0DI0023975	Ok, that's that. No more games for you. Go rob the Tops. You're done here.
0DI0023976	Have some drinks, talk to some dancers but you are done at my tables.
0DI0023977	We can chat later. The sooner you finish these tests the sooner you can get out of here.
0DI0023978	It's important that you're relaxed for this next test. Please, have a seat.
0DI0023979	All right. I'm gonna say a word. I want you to say the first thing that comes to mind.
0DI0023980	Dog.
0DI0023981	Here. These are yours. Was all you had on you when you was brought in.
0DI0023982	I hope you don't mind but I gave the note a look. I thought it might help me find a next of kin. But it was just something about a platinum chip.
0DI0023983	I've gotta hand it to you. You've done good things for Novac, but you've also got 'em a little scared of you. And that's great for business.
0DI0023984	As long as you keep it coming, I'll get you some things a little cheaper than they should be.
0DI0023986	Between you and me, I don't think she studied at an accredited institution.
0DI0023987	She hasn't paid me anything yet. Should I be worried?
0DI0024007	A pleasure to meet you! I'm Dr. Thomas Hildern, Director of Operations, OSI East. I presume you're here about Vault 22?
0DI0024008	We spoke earlier, didn't we? About Vault 22. My offer still stands, if you've changed your mind.
0DI0024009	We still need a contractor on our Vault 22 project. Interested?
0DI0024010	Yes? Something else you needed?
0DI0024011	I received a pleasant call from Dr. Keely. It seems we have you to thank for keeping her alive. Very charitable of you.
0DI0024012	Ah! I was just wondering what had become of you.
0DI0024013	What do you want? I thought I told you to stay the hell out of here.
0DI0024014	What are you doing in my office? You're not welcome here, get out!
0DI0024015	Did Dr. Hildern... this really isn't any of my business, but... did he give you a job?
0DI0024016	Little busy at the moment. But I can talk.
0DI0024017	If you can find Keely and keep her safe, I'll pay you what I can. I gave my word, and I meant it.
0DI0024018	Keely just called in. You should have heard the Director. "But I-" "Wait a-" "Now look here-"
0DI0024019	She wouldn't let him finish a sentence. Just reamed him out for sending all those people to the Vault. I've never seen his face so red and twitchy.
0DI0024020	Thanks for keeping her safe. Here's the caps I promised. I knew I had a good feeling about you.
0DI0024021	Did you find Keely? You haven't been back for a while, so I was hoping...
0DI0024022	Oh! Good to see you again.
0DI0024023	Unless I hear from Keely, we've got nothing to talk about.
0DI0024024	Keely still hasn't checked in. It's not like her...
0DI0024025	After what happened with Keely, Hildern's got his eye on me. We shouldn't be talking... not anymore.
0DI0024026	You're new? I'm Angela. Williams. Were you just looking around, or...
0DI0024027	Took your sweet time. I suppose the NCR sent you?
0DI0024028	Not now! I've got to get up to the lab and finish what I started!
0DI0024029	This Vault-Tech machinery is so fragile. I had to jury-rig this elevator a few days ago and it's on the fritz again already.
0DI0024030	Ah, that's got it. See you upstairs.
0DI0024031	Hm, what's this? Did you do these repairs? Not bad. Not bad at all.
0DI0024032	Saves me time, I guess. See you upstairs.
0DI0024033	Good, you're here. Ready to begin?
0DI0024034	I suppose you have questions. Hurry up and ask them.
0DI0024035	Ah, good. You survived. I was beginning to think you hadn't. You'll be pleased to know that the spores should no longer be a problem.
0DI0024036	Now all that's left is to ensure that none of this ever happens again. The research that led to these abominations must be erased.
0DI0024037	Don't mind me. I have to wrap things up here, gather my gear, that sort of thing. I'll be leaving soon enough.
0DI0024038	Greetings! I do not believe we have met before. I have the singular distinction of being designated as Bohr.
0DI0024039	Calculating...
0DI0024040	Well, that's a start. But I don't reckon you came to me to learn to fight sarsaparilla bottles.
0DI0024041	Tell you what. I gotta go chase geckos away from our water supply anyway. Darn critters are attracted to it. Why don't you come along?
0DI0024042	Hear that up on the ridge behind me there? We got some geckos to clear out.
0DI0024043	Bunch of little monsters is what they are. Seems like Doc Mitchell treats more gecko bites than anything else.
0DI0024044	Let's see if we can get a little closer. If we move quietly, we can get the jump on 'em. More likely to hit something vital that way.
0DI0024045	See? You're getting the hang of it.
0DI0024046	There's two more wells that still need clearing. You want, you can come along. It'd be worth a few caps to me.
0DI0024047	Confound it, Cheyenne, why'd you have to go running in like that? You were supposed to stay.
0DI0024048	I'm sorry, you shouldn't have to see me like this. I'm not not gonna be very good company right now.
0DI0024049	I did have another thing to teach, but I'll understand if you'd rather I just pay you so you can be on your way.
0DI0024050	Now that was some good work. Even got a little exciting there at the end.
0DI0024051	Here's a little spending money for the trouble.
0DI0024052	Ah, hell's bells. There's not a day passes by I don't tell people not to come here by themselves.
0DI0024053	Some people, your word just isn't good enough for them. Then this happens.
0DI0024054	Well, it's part of life out here. Best to accept it.
0DI0024055	But you did what you promised, staying out here with me. Here's my end of the deal.
0DI0024056	Hey, that's not bad! See? All it takes to make a recipe is the right ingredients and the right know-how.
0DI0024057	Sometimes it won't be a campfire you need. Might need to do some work on your guns and ammo, maybe.
0DI0024058	Important thing to get is it's all the same idea. You just need to find the right place to set up shop. Workbench or... a reloading bench, whatever.
0DI0024059	Well, I hope that's enough to get you started.
0DI0024061	I'm heading back now. Hope I didn't miss anything good on the jukebox. Cheyenne would never forgive me.
0DI0024062	The cleaners will knock twice. Make sure they're thorough.
0DI0024063	Baby, this little reunion of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
0DI0024064	I'm surprised you fell for it, not that I'm complaining. You caused plenty enough trouble, turning Swank against me.
0DI0024065	You've forced my hand. Hell, I gotta skip town because of you. A real pain in the caboose...
0DI0024066	Baby, this little meet and greet of ours? Chalk me up as a no-show.
0DI0024067	It would be 41 flavors of stupid to let you get a drop on me. And you've caused plenty enough trouble as-is.
0DI0024069	What in the goddamn...?
0DI0024070	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves, like smooth little babies...
0DI0024072	Let's keep this in the groove, hey? Smooth moves. Smooth...
0DI0024073	Hello! The guy everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Oh shit.
0DI0024076	Hello! That broad everyone saw go in the Lucky 38, that was you? Shit.
0DI0024079	Hello! It was you, smashed up the Omertas? You did that? Shit.
0DI0024082	Hello! It was you, wiped out the Khans down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
0DI0024085	Hello! It was you, set the Khans free down in Boulder City? You did that? Oh shit.
0DI0024088	Hello! The gasser everyone's been talking about, making a splash on the Strip. That's been you? Oh shit.
0DI0024089	Benny is gonna show you the Tops! I hope you're built sturdy, you crazy broad!
0DI0024091	You? How could you be...? Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
0DI0024092	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. We should be working together.
0DI0024093	Hey hey hey, what the hell...?
0DI0024094	Oh Swank, you finky bastard...
0DI0024095	You got a crazy drop on me, baby, but you don't want to kill me. It's like I said, we should be working together.
0DI0024096	I comped you the prez so we can talk there, hey? No need to keep tugging at my sleeve.
0DI0024097	Wait until we get to the Presidential, pally. I don't need you tugging at my sleeve.
0DI0024098	Cool by me if you wanna talk after all... but a confab like this, out in public, in my place of business? That don't play.
0DI0024099	What say you and me cash out, go somewheres more private-like? Any questions you got, I'll answer.
0DI0024100	Like I said, we should be talking somewheres private.
0DI0024101	Now that you and me's got some privacy, I gotta ask - how is it that you're still living?
0DI0024102	Once you were vertical, how'd you track me down?
0DI0024103	I guess that's enough scratching around at first base. Tell me, which way is the wind gonna blow?
0DI0024104	You got questions, I got answers.
0DI0024105	How else can I clue you in?
0DI0024106	Something else you wanted to know?
0DI0024107	It's the House edge, baby - literally. It's what Mr. House needs to stack the odds in his favor.
0DI0024109	Yeah, it's a tricky world out there. I'll tell it to you straight.
0DI0024110	What else did you want to know?
0DI0024111	Broad strokes? Change in management.
0DI0024112	The Securitrons are where it's at. I need a way to control them, and a way to beef up their hitting power.
0DI0024113	I get those two ducks in a row, Vegas can defend itself versus all comers - NCR, Caesar's Legion, it won't matter.
0DI0024116	Like I said, once the Chairmen are running Vegas, you'll get a percentage. Until then I'll pay you a retainer and bonuses for "special missions."
0DI0024117	What are you, crazy? These Praetorians mean business!
0DI0024118	You're a scrapper, baby. They didn't stand a chance. How about me?
0DI0024119	Change in plans?
0DI0024120	Pussycat! Ain't this platinum? Had I known, I woulda baked a cake!
0DI0024121	That last turn we took is an 18 karat memory, baby. It's all that's been keeping me warm at night, stuck where I am.
0DI0024122	Why you little promise-breaker! "Let me live, Benny, and I'll never come after you - pinky swear!" What a fink! Anyway...
0DI0024123	Go ahead and laugh, baby. I ain't blind to the humor in this situation.
0DI0024124	Sing, baby. You got a captive audience.
0DI0024126	Down to brass tacks. How'd your meet and greet with Baldie go?
0DI0024127	Try not to smile so wide, baby. You might break your mouth.
0DI0024128	Yeah, Baldie said you'd get to decide. So which way you leaning?
0DI0024129	Last we spoke, you were leaning in more merciful direction...?
0DI0024130	So you keep saying.
0DI0024131	So baby, what did you find down there?
0DI0024132	I see. And how's that gonna happen?
0DI0024133	What's holding you up? Let's get this over with.
0DI0024134	Which greedy overlord do you want to start with?
0DI0024135	I'm the most interesting person I know.
0DI0024136	I never tire of talking about myself.
0DI0024137	I'm still a little choked up over here, baby. We'll catch up in a bit.
0DI0024138	Scram, will ya? I value my privacy.
0DI0024139	You and me gonna accomplish great things, baby.
0DI0024140	Name a name.
0DI0024141	You're the courier who's caused so much trouble for my Legion, and yet you dare come before me.
0DI0024143	So I finally get to meet the courier who's caused so much trouble for the New California Republic.
0DI0024145	So I finally get to meet the courier who's accomplished so much in so little time. That is why I summoned you here, right?
0DI0024146	I mean, a man nearly kills you, and your response is to track him across the breadth of the Mojave?
0DI0024147	The question is... are you ready to get started?
0DI0024148	Down the hill, at the west edge of camp, is an old building. It was here when the Fort was taken in 2277.
0DI0024149	Inside the building is a hatch, and inside that hatch are two steel doors that bear the sigil of the Lucky 38 casino.
0DI0024150	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip Benny was carrying when we captured him. Isn't that interesting?
0DI0024151	Now that same sigil is on the Platinum Chip you were carrying. Isn't that interesting?
0DI0024152	Even more interesting, there's a slot about the same size as the Chip on the console that opens the hatch. So you know what I think?
0DI0024153	I think the Platinum Chip opens those doors - doors that can't be pried open or drilled open or blasted open. Because all that, I tried.
0DI0024154	We'll talk again when you've destroyed whatever is down in that bunker - not before.
0DI0024155	I felt the ground shake a while ago. I'll take that as a sign you got the job done.
0DI0024156	There are rewards for doing as I command. Today, your reward is vengeance. You get to decide how Benny dies.
0DI0024157	Go to Benny, let him know what you've decided. My Praetorians will perform the execution - unless you want to perform it yourself.
0DI0024158	We have nothing to discuss until you've dealt with Benny.
0DI0024159	I'm sure you found Benny's demise pleasing. The destruction of an enemy... there are few things more satisfying.
0DI0024160	Let's press on, shall we? As I was telling you before, I want Mr. House out of the picture.
0DI0024161	You have an interest in his death, too. If he knows that you destroyed his gadgets beneath the Fort, he will strike back.
0DI0024162	You know where to find him. How he dies, I leave up to you.
0DI0024163	Until Mr. House has been dealt with, you and I have nothing to talk about.
0DI0024164	I've read Mr. House's obituary. Had a high opinion of himself, didn't he?
0DI0024165	I spent months feeding the Omertas bribes, nursing their betrayal, and you've ruined all that.
0DI0024166	Do you have any idea how much effort it took to place a mole at McCarran who could plant that bomb on the monorail? The one you defused?
0DI0024167	The garrison I placed at Nelson served a vital strategic function. Did you think you could wipe it out and I wouldn't find out?
0DI0024168	Weeks were spent convincing the Great Khans to join the Legion, but you've ruined all that. Haven't you?
0DI0024169	With Mr. House out of the way, I can focus on smoothing out a few lingering complications elsewhere in the Mojave.
0DI0024170	First up are the Boomers of Nellis Air Force Base, a tribe so reclusive, it lobs artillery shells at anyone who comes near their settlement.
0DI0024171	I want you to offer them an alliance with my Legion. My terms are simple: target their guns against the NCR side of the dam when I assault it...
0DI0024172	...and they can keep their freedom. If you find they aren't amenable to this offer, destroy them.
0DI0024173	It's reached me that you killed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
0DI0024174	I understand that you freed Silus before he could talk. I approve.
0DI0024175	Silus dishonored himself when he let himself be captured, and he'll pay the price for that. But the NCR didn't learn anything valuable.
0DI0024176	Have you brought news of the Boomers?
0DI0024177	I would've asked you to forge an alliance with the White Glove Society, but you've already killed its leaders. So instead -
0DI0024178	Ehhhh! Goddammit!
0DI0024179	I want you to forge an alliance between Caesar's Legion and the White Glove Society.
0DI0024180	They used to be cannibals. I expect that information can be used to manipulate them. Go to -
0DI0024182	Goddammit, go away! Come back when I've had some sleep!
0DI0024183	I warned you not to bother me!
0DI0024184	Praetorians, kill this asshole!
0DI0024185	The last time we met, I believe we were talking about the White Glove Society?
0DI0024186	Have you been successful in your efforts to recruit the White Glove Society?
0DI0024187	I want you to destroy the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. It's not a full-strength chapter, mind you. The Profligates...
0DI0024189	Urh...
0DI0024190	If you interfere with me getting some sleep again, I'm going to have you killed. We will talk later.
0DI0024191	You want to die? Fine!
0DI0024192	Praetorians! Kill this asshole!
0DI0024193	Has the Brotherhood been destroyed?
0DI0024194	I want you to join me in my tent. You and I are going to have a private conversation.
0DI0024195	All right, let's state the obvious. There's something wrong with me.
0DI0024196	The headaches started a couple months ago. They weren't too bad at first... but now they come frequently and they're... debilitating.
0DI0024197	For the past two weeks, my left leg has been dragging. It's stiffer, hard to move. And you've seen me blank out.
0DI0024198	Lucius says I stare into space, blink a few times, then keep talking like nothing happened. So what's the diagnosis?
0DI0024199	I thank you for saving my life. You're a warrior and a healer - a rare combination.
0DI0024200	I thank you for saving my life. Arcade will be a fine addition to my retinue.
0DI0024201	I thank you for saving my life. The Auto-Doc module you recovered did the trick.
0DI0024202	I trust this payment is adequate compensation for your troubles. Now, lest we grow sentimental here...
0DI0024203	The time for battle will soon be upon us. Legatus Lanius draws nigh. When he arrives, my Legion will assault Hoover Dam.
0DI0024204	In the meantime, the Profligates have prepared a welcome gift for us. The President of the NCR intends to visit Hoover Dam.
0DI0024205	You dispatched President Kimball with real skill. Right under their noses, too - what a humiliation.
0DI0024206	Why did you not attack President Kimball?
0DI0024207	President Kimball was there on the Dam, right before you. And yet he lives. How did you fuck this up?
0DI0024208	My forces are in position to assault the Dam. Legatus Lanius has assumed command.
0DI0024209	Are you ready to go to him? To tell him to begin the assault?
0DI0024210	You know everything you need to know. Be on your way.
0DI0024213	Even with the Boomers to deal with, you have questions?
0DI0024214	Even with the White Glove Society to deal with, you have questions?
0DI0024215	Even with the Brotherhood to deal with, you have questions?
0DI0024216	Even with a President to kill, you have questions?
0DI0024217	Even on the brink of the final battle, you have questions?
0DI0024223	Do you have any progress to report?
0DI0024224	Allow me to make this clear. Because you've been of service to me, I will forgive your crimes against my Legion this one time.
0DI0024225	In the future, if I become aware that you've committed other crimes, I'll have my Praetorians butcher you before my eyes.
0DI0024226	If you've committed any other crimes, this is the time to confess them, because after today there will be no forgiveness.
0DI0024227	I warned you about this. Praetorians, slaughter this degenerate!
0DI0024228	I can't believe it. Caesar's Legion attacks in force, and I actually survived!
0DI0024229	Unngh... why do I feel so terrible?
0DI0024230	I'm glad those nighttime raids have stopped. I was getting worried.
0DI0024231	Doc seems to be doing all right patching people up, at least.
0DI0024232	I never thought they'd actually send us reinforcements.
0DI0024233	Welcome to Bitter Springs. Quite a sight, isn't it?
0DI0024234	I hear there's a ghost in these mountains... and it doesn't like the NCR much.
0DI0024235	Not enough food, not enough medicine, and definitely not enough sleep.
0DI0024236	I don't know how we're expected to hold this place with so few men.
0DI0024237	All these refugees... is Caesar's Legion really that big?
0DI0024238	This is the worst detail in the Mojave.
0DI0024239	Can't believe the Legion hit us in such numbers. They're stronger than we think.
0DI0024240	I coughed up blood this morning. I think I'm really sick.
0DI0024241	No attacks for a while now. That's a good sign, right?
0DI0024242	I think there's something wrong with the food.
0DI0024243	I swear I saw somebody sneaking out of the graveyard the other night.
0DI0024244	Lieutenant Markland always looks like he's afraid the kids are gonna bite him.
0DI0024245	Markland seems to be getting better with his bedside manner.
0DI0024246	Finally got enough pills to chase off that damn infection.
0DI0024247	Doc's gotten real handy with the kids these days.
0DI0024248	Hope the Doc can give me some meds this week.
0DI0024249	Nice to see more guards on patrol. Maybe Caesar won't murder us all.
0DI0024250	Finally starting to get some decent food around here.
0DI0024251	Not enough soldiers here to stop Caesar if he rolls through.
0DI0024252	So tired....
0DI0024253	Haven't had a decent meal in weeks.
0DI0024254	Legion just came out of nowhere.
0DI0024255	The man with the spiky hat comes into camp at night!
0DI0024256	Did you know ants can get *this big?*
0DI0024257	I saw snake puppies in the hills!
0DI0024258	I say, would you like some of this absolutely delightful confection I found? I've been grazing on it all day!
0DI0024259	I like you! Will you take Barnabas Bear to New Vegas when you go?
0DI0024260	I'm hungry!
0DI0024261	I'm sleepy!
0DI0024262	I'm scared!
0DI0024263	My tummy hurts!
0DI0024264	Where's my mommy?
0DI0024265	Ah, the outsider who gained our master's favor. You prove yourself as cunning as the rumors report.
0DI0024266	I cannot speak long, for my men need direction. What do you want?
0DI0024267	The legate is expecting you.
0DI0024268	It is important that you go see the legate.
0DI0024269	The legate would have my head if I were to let you pass.
0DI0024270	Soon, my lovelies. Soon you'll get all the meat you can handle.
0DI0024271	I haven't fed them in days. The legate wants them hungry for the battle to come.
0DI0024272	Some fool asked me the other day what mongrel meat tastes like. I told him I'd sooner feed him to my dogs than the other way around.
0DI0024273	The enemy is weak up close, so I must learn to kill quickly at that quarter.
0DI0024274	When attacking with a blade, aim for the meat of the opponent. Tendons and muscle are no good to a man when severed.
0DI0024275	When attacking with a blunt weapon, aim for the opponent's bones. Hips, joints, and especially the skull are all viable targets.
0DI0024276	A sharp knife can make the difference between a clean kill and a messy death.
0DI0024277	It's amazing how dull a blade can get just by passing through slave meat.
0DI0024278	I must have all of these blades sharpened soon. Rumor is we head out any time now.
0DI0024279	Our men are stronger, faster, and have wills of iron. How can we lose?
0DI0024280	I'm a little busy at the moment.
0DI0024281	When will we receive the order to march? I'll go crazy if I don't kill something soon.
0DI0024282	We will see that the camp is protected from NCR assassins.
0DI0024283	The battle is already decided. All that's left is the bloodletting.
0DI0024284	Mars be with you.
0DI0024285	Salve, Courier. How goes the battle in the east?
0DI0024286	My orders are to remain here, and direct our men as they arrive. Go!
0DI0024287	Since you haven't pissed yourself I'll assume that you don't know who we are - next time I'll bring my sickle and wear my black cloak.
0DI0024288	See, the NCR sends us when they want terrible things done to terrible people...
0DI0024289	Sorry, friend, you crossed the NCR one too many times - you've been marked for death... and we're here to take care of that.
0DI0024290	Nothing personal - orders - you know how it is. Well, let's get to it.
0DI0024291	Never mind - don't care. You've got two more days to deal with your bad NCR reputation.
0DI0024292	Make them happy or we'll make you dead.
0DI0024293	We're back - you've got two days left to improve your NCR reputation. After that we find you and end you. Clear?
0DI0024294	Remember us? You've got two days left make up for pissing off the NCR. See you around. <laughs>
0DI0024295	So, last day on earth, huh? Getting your affairs in order? Or are you still trying to work on that bad reputation of yours?
0DI0024296	The NCR just wants to be friends, but you don't seem to want to play nice. See you tomorrow.
0DI0024297	Tick-tock, time's up. The NCR says you gotta die, so guess what?
0DI0024298	I gave you three days - you should have crawled in a hole somewhere. Time to die.
0DI0024299	Well, take a good look around - this is where your life ended.
0DI0024300	Well, seems like you've redeemed yourself. Welcome back to the NCR's good graces. Play nice... or I'll be back for you.
0DI0024301	The brass has put me back on my leash - that must mean that you've decided to play nice with the NCR. Good choice, you just saved your life.
0DI0024302	Don't make me come after you again.
0DI0024303	I see you took my advice and made nice with the NCR. Guess that means you aren't as dumb as you look.
0DI0024304	Stay smart and I won't have to come for you again.
0DI0024305	I don't know how you managed to improve your reputation with the NCR after pissing us off like that, but honestly...
0DI0024306	I'm just happy I don't have to kill you now. See you around, wastelander.
0DI0024307	Get him! Nobody screws with the NCR!
0DI0024308	The NCR's come for you - time to die!
0DI0024309	You crossed the NCR one time too many - now you die!
0DI0024310	Did you think you'd get away with crossing the NCR?!
0DI0024311	The NCR wants you dead, friend!
0DI0024312	Consider this your final warning from the NCR!
0DI0024313	Nobody crosses the NCR!
0DI0024314	You'll pay for crossing the NCR!
0DI0024315	This is what the NCR does with traitors!
0DI0024316	This is not a market, sir - you need to improve your reputation with the NCR before you're welcome in our outposts.
0DI0024317	You're walking on thin ice with the NCR. It's time to decide where your loyalties lay, friend. Until then don't expect any hospitality from us.
0DI0024318	The NCR isn't in the habit of letting loose cannons like you just wander our bases.
0DI0024319	I suggest you move along until you decide where your loyalties fall.
0DI0024320	Get up! You can't sleep here - move on.
0DI0024321	Wake up, merc! These cots are for NCR only.
0DI0024322	No room at the inn, merc. Move along.
0DI0024323	Slumber party's over, pal. Get a move-on.
0DI0024324	Wake-y wake-y - eggs and bake-y. <laughs>
0DI0024325	Wake up! This ain't your bed.
0DI0024326	Get up.
0DI0024328	Get up. Sleep it off somewhere else.
0DI0024329	Get out of that bed.
0DI0024330	No sleeping here.
0DI0024331	You've done a good turn for the NCR and now we'd like to do one for you - here's an NCR emergency two-way radio - you call and we'll come running.
0DI0024332	You're not alone out here - the NCR has your back. Stay safe and good hunting.
0DI0024333	The NCR takes care of its own - so in thanks for your service to the Republic... here's one of our emergency two-way radios.
0DI0024334	You call and we'll come running. If you're too far from an NCR outpost there won't be much we can do for you...
0DI0024335	but then the NCR is just about everywhere these days. Good luck and stay safe out there.
0DI0024336	For your service, beyond the call of duty, the NCR would like to award you with this emergency two-way radio.
0DI0024337	You call and we'll send you any support we can spare. Keep up the good work, soldier.
0DI0024338	The NCR would like to thank you for your service. If you ever need us, just call and we'll come running.
0DI0024339	The NCR takes care of its own... and its supporters. Stay safe out there and call us if you get in a jam.
0DI0024340	Coordinates for supply cache in your region being sent... now.
0DI0024341	Received - updating map marker for local NCR supply cache.
0DI0024342	This is NCR Operator - message received - sending map marker for local supply cache.
0DI0024343	This is NCR Operator - I read you. The supplies are on their way.
0DI0024344	Message received - supplies en route.

0DI0024347	NCR support moving to your location.
0DI0024348	Request received - NCR Troopers in your area are being redirected to your location.
0DI0024349	NCR Ranger support en route to your location.
0DI0024350	The cavalry is on its way - just sit tight, we'll be there.
0DI0024351	Support inbound - deploying NCR Rangers to your location.
0DI0024352	Your wish is my command - NCR support is on its way.
0DI0024353	Your problems will soon be solved - Rangers heading your way now.
0DI0024354	There is no NCR support in your area - suggest a tactical retreat.
0DI0024355	Negative, no NCR support available at your current location.
0DI0024356	Transmission not received - attempt new transmission closer to an NCR outpost.
0DI0024357	Sorry, sir, that's all the support I can spare today.
0DI0024358	I can't redirect any more support to you today - it would put too many lives at risk. I'll get you what I can tomorrow.
0DI0024359	I can't afford to send you anything else today. Sorry, sir... good luck out there.
0DI0024360	You're just going to have to cowboy up, sir - I can't spare any more support today.
0DI0024361	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until at least midnight.
0DI0024362	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until we get resupplied tomorrow.
0DI0024363	Support request received - deploying Troopers to your area. Hold tight, help is on the way.
0DI0024364	Received - find some cover, NCR support is on the way.
0DI0024365	I sent you all I had last time, sir - you're on your own until dawn at least.
0DI0024367	Good hunting, sir.
0DI0024368	Over.
0DI0024369	Over-and-out.
0DI0024371	NCR Trooper, reporting for duty!
0DI0024372	Trooper, ready to fight!
0DI0024373	You called for a Trooper?
0DI0024374	You called for an extra gun?
0DI0024375	I got your call and came running.
0DI0024376	Guns and gear - at your service.
0DI0024377	Someone said you needed backup? I'm it.
0DI0024378	You called for backup?
0DI0024379	Where's the fight, sir?
0DI0024380	For the Republic!
0DI0024381	Ranger at the ready!
0DI0024382	NCR Ranger, reporting for duty!
0DI0024383	Here we are, you just point and we'll shoot.
0DI0024384	Here I am, just point at what needs killing.
0DI0024385	One riot, one ranger... let's get this done.
0DI0024386	Heard you were in a spot of trouble, friend. Let's fix that.
0DI0024387	I heard your call and happened to be in the area.
0DI0024390	You're lucky I happened to be nearby.
0DI0024391	I got your flank - you just shoot what's in front of you!
0DI0024392	Ranger here - where's the fight?
0DI0024393	What are you doing here? This is our casino, punk.
0DI0024394	Gotta run! No time to chat!
0DI0024395	Sorry, you just win too much. We can't let you play here anymore.
0DI0024396	Welcome to Vikki and Vance, we're still getting the casino up and running but feel free to sit down and play.
0DI0024397	We're hoping that Primm will get back on its feet from the money we earn here.
0DI0024398	We feel much safer opening the casino back up, now that we have a sheriff.
0DI0024399	I'm glad that I could start working here again, things were rough with those convicts in town.
0DI0024400	The Caesar has marked you for death... and the Legion obeys. Ready yourself for battle.
0DI0024401	Now you will serve as an example to all who dare oppose Caesar's Legion. Defend yourself!
0DI0024402	You have defied Caesar for the last time! Your life ends now!
0DI0024403	I've told you Powder Gangers everything I know! Please don't hit me anymore!
0DI0024404	Well look at that! You aren't a Powder Ganger after all. I'd suggest against wearing that outfit around the townsfolk. You may get shot by accident.
0DI0024405	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me?
0DI0024406	I don't suppose you came here to rescue me? I'd cross my fingers but my hands are numb.
0DI0024407	It would be so very delightful if you set me free.
0DI0024408	Please excuse me - I'm extricating myself at the moment...
0DI0024409	Apologies, but I'm quite busy until I reach safety!
0DI0024410	Well! That was quite an adventure. We taught those convicts a thing or two, didn't we?
0DI0024411	Breaking myself out of a hostage situation - not to diminish your role in it, of course - but it was quite thrilling.
0DI0024412	Problem is, there's still no law in Primm. What're we to do the next time ruffians menace us and hold us hostage?
0DI0024413	Well! That was quite a per-dicament you rescued me from, there in the Bison Steve. A most unpleasant experience.
0DI0024414	Going in alone to rescue a hostage! My brother-in-law was brave like that. Made a fine sheriff. Until the Powder Gangers killed him.
0DI0024416	Well, if it isn't the "lawbringer."
0DI0024417	Hello again. I don't suppose you've decided to help Primm find its next sheriff?
0DI0024418	Any luck finding a suitable candidate for our next sheriff?
0DI0024419	Oh, it's you.
0DI0024420	I suppose I should be thanking you for restoring the rule of law to Primm...
0DI0024421	I don't plan to come back to the Bison Steve much in the years to come. If I ever get out of it.
0DI0024422	I do hope this ordeal will be over soon.
0DI0024423	If we were to miss a convict or two in here, who'd know the difference?
0DI0024424	I'm Lieutenant Hayes of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. What's your business?
0DI0024426	Primm is secure against outside threats. Be interesting to see how long the natives stay grateful.
0DI0024427	I'm Sergeant McGee of the New California Republic Army, 5th Battalion, 1st Company. If you want to talk about something, speak to Lieutenant Hayes.
0DI0024429	Move along, waster. Got a town to run here.
0DI0024433	Howdy pardner! Welcome to the Vikki and Vance Casino and Museum.
0DI0024434	Howdy pardner! Any luck tracking down Vance's gun?
0DI0024435	Always good to see you, pardner! Anything I can help you with?
0DI0024436	What are you doing here, stranger? You looking to start some trouble?
0DI0024437	This better be good, stranger.
0DI0024438	You'd best not try any funny business, stranger. One word from me, and Vance will plant you in the ground!
0DI0024439	What the hell you want?
0DI0024440	Thanks for talking Pauline out of robbing the Strip. Who knows what she'll think of next?
0DI0024441	Thank god you talked me out of trying to rob the Strip. I guess we'll wait here until I come up with our next caper.
0DI0024443	I don't know what it was brought you to Primm, youngster, but you might want to rethink your plans. Town's gone to hell.
0DI0024444	You got that old robot up and running again? How is it working out for you?
0DI0024445	Hey, youngster. Still hanging about Primm, huh?
0DI0024446	Heard it was you brought the law back to Primm, youngster. Hat's off to you.
0DI0024447	Primm had rule of law for the blink of an eye, but now we're back where we started.
0DI0024448	Hey there, youngster.
0DI0024449	Hello there. What brings you to Primm?
0DI0024450	Welcome back. Good to see you again.
0DI0024453	It's better not to do a lot of talking on assassination missions.
0DI0024454	I hear you took care of Motor-Runner. I could have handled that on my own.
0DI0024455	Thanks for the help back at Vault 3. I couldn't have gotten out of there without the assist.
0DI0024456	Thanks for the assistance, doc. Time for us to go take out Motor-Runner?
0DI0024457	What do you need? I have a job to do.
0DI0024458	I'm ready to take out Motor-Runner when you are.
0DI0024459	How the hell did you get in here? And who the hell are you?
0DI0024460	What are you doing here, soldier? I didn't call for any support.
0DI0024461	Hey! Yeah you! Come give us a hand!
0DI0024462	You again. You ready to give us some help?
0DI0024463	Rick is dead, but I'd still welcome my freedom!
0DI0024464	Are you going to free me or what?
0DI0024465	Thanks for the help.
0DI0024466	Thank you for releasing us.
0DI0024467	Talk to Rick if you have something you'd like to say.
0DI0024468	If you have anything to say, talk to Rick.
0DI0024469	Why the fuck are you back here?
0DI0024470	What the fuck are you doing here?
0DI0024471	Man, are you turned around. Motor-Runner is one the other side of the complex.
0DI0024472	Can I help you with something, stranger?
0DI0024473	I hear tell you pretty well wiped out the Fiends around here. Not bad, not bad.
0DI0024474	Welcome back, merc.
0DI0024475	Have you taken care of those squatters?
0DI0024476	Have you run off those greasers?
0DI0024477	Good to see you around. Take care, merc.
0DI0024478	You're still around, huh?
0DI0024480	Piss off!
0DI0024481	We're going, we're going!
0DI0024482	What are you doing here? Get out before I blow your head off!
0DI0024483	I can't believe this shit. You again?
0DI0024485	I hope you've got some good news about Alice.
0DI0024486	I should kill you, right here, for what you've done.
0DI0024487	Hello there! Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company. How can I help you today?
0DI0024488	Need anything?
0DI0024489	I owe you an apology, stranger. We almost lost her forever, and I'm glad that things didn't turn out for the worse.
0DI0024490	Oh. Hello, there.
0DI0024491	I hope you're not planning on visiting  the Strip.
0DI0024492	The rest of this city has gone absolutely to seed!
0DI0024493	Any news from out of town?
0DI0024494	Don't recall seeing you here before.
0DI0024495	Welcome to North Vegas, stranger!
0DI0024496	Don't rush me. We're going, okay?
0DI0024497	What the hell are you looking at, punk?
0DI0024498	Rot in hell.
0DI0024500	Back off! I know how to use this gun, and I'm not afraid to shoot if you try anything!
0DI0024501	I've put up with their shit long enough. No more! I'll... I'll kill them if they get in my way!
0DI0024502	What are you looking at, huh? Answer me, or I'll get trigger-happy real quick.
0DI0024503	Humph... I see lots of folks come and go, but none fit your type. Where you come from, stranger?
0DI0024504	Look, I'm willing to let you slide, but you're asking for it. Tell me what's your business in my town.
0DI0024507	You again? Get out here, smoothface.
0DI0024509	I've got nothing to say to you, punk. Scram!
0DI0024510	What the fuck you want, huh?
0DI0024511	Hey, you! What the hell are you doing? Keep snooping around here and I'll skin you like a fucking Gecko.
0DI0024512	Andy's not gonna be happy. Where the hell's that crazy bitch?
0DI0024514	... Huh?
0DI0024516	I was blind to what was happening in my own family. We don't have much, but please take this.
0DI0024517	What... what have I done!? Mother...
0DI0024520	Look what you've done, you bastard!
0DI0024521	Oh no! Alice... Alice, baby! I'm sorry, so sorry...
0DI0024522	She... Alice left, didn't she? I can't believe you let her go! Some help you've been!
0DI0024523	Good to see you again. I'm just passing through here; staying at this refugee camp, under the wing of NCR thugs, is the last thing on my mind.
0DI0024524	Hey there! I'm on my way to Novac to find a new home, even if it lasts just a little while. See you around.
0DI0024525	Hello again. Well, this is my place now. With time, I'll turn it into a good home.
0DI0024526	This is my room, now you get the fuck out before you get yourself hurt.
0DI0024527	I warned you, now it is time to eat hot fucking lead.
0DI0024528	Get the fuck out of my room.
0DI0024529	I thought I told you to get the fuck out of here.
0DI0024530	Hey, thanks for all the hard work back there. I'm going to run a tight ship here, don't you worry.
0DI0024531	It is time for the meeting with the bosses. We can't chit chat right now.
0DI0024532	Hey, thanks for all the help back there.
0DI0024533	Hey pal, thanks for helping us shape things up. You're good people.
0DI0024534	Take a seat on the couch over there, Nero and me want to have a little talk with you.
0DI0024535	Take a seat on the couch please, so we can have a little talking time.
0DI0024536	I'm on my way to have some private time, give me some peace.
0DI0024537	I'm on my way to my office, give me a little time before you get in my face.
0DI0024538	I'm on my way to my room, I don't have time to chat with you right now.
0DI0024539	Come to my office, we'll have a little chat with Cachino.
0DI0024540	I don't have time to chat right now. If you have business, wait for me to get settled in.
0DI0024541	Well, what do we have here, huh? Let me guess. You've heard about the mistress who makes all your fantasies come true.
0DI0024543	Hey there, gorgeous. I knew you'd be back soon enough.
0DI0024546	I hear you been asking questions about me, dickweed. What the fuck do you want?
0DI0024547	You again? What the fuck do you want?
0DI0024548	Hey, hey! Look who it is. My best buddy.
0DI0024549	Hey, what can I do for you?
0DI0024551	I'm getting the heck out of here. You go place that thermite and do what you need to do.
0DI0024552	Give me some time. I'm going to deploy the thermite.
0DI0024553	Yeah, nice work destroying those guns, I'm gonna beat feet before they figure out I was involved.
0DI0024555	Hey, you're Cachino's friend. You got business with me?
0DI0024556	Have you found out anything to help me?
0DI0024557	Man, thanks for finding out that shit, fuck Big Sal.
0DI0024558	Thanks for taking care of getting me out of here. I owe you big time.
0DI0024559	Who are you? I didn't do anything, leave me alone.
0DI0024560	You again? Make it quick.
0DI0024561	You're always welcome here, good to see you again. Let's chat, what's on your mind?
0DI0024563	Hey, you're the one everyone's talking about. What business you got with me?
0DI0024564	What do you need? I'm a busy man.
0DI0024565	Hey Buddy, Zoara is off limits to everyone but Family.
0DI0024566	Go ahead and talk to the bosses, they'll want to hear what you have to say.
0DI0024567	Thanks for bringing Cachino's transgressions to our attention. Shame we had to put him down, he was a good lieutenant.
0DI0024568	Hey, it's my good friend again. What can I do for you?
0DI0024569	Hold up, I gotta have a chat with Cachino.
0DI0024570	You got something you need to talk about?
0DI0024572	Let's get this going.
0DI0024573	Hey, I'm leaving and I don't have anything more to say to you, so get the fuck out of my face.
0DI0024574	Hey, nice to meet you. Do you need help with something?
0DI0024575	Hey, did you track down some chlorine for me?
0DI0024576	Good to see you again, I hope you're winning some money in here.
0DI0024578	Okay. We can talk here.
0DI0024579	Come here, baby. I'm all yours... are you ready to be all mine?
0DI0024580	C'mon, people are looking at us.
0DI0024582	You truly are something else! Those Omertas looked like they were going to kill Carlitos on the spot.
0DI0024583	I have nothing to give you except my thanks... and, well, if I were you I'd not mess around with the Omertas anymore, but listen to this.
0DI0024584	Cachino has said things that make me think there's a big and nasty operation in the works, something about "getting even" with Mr. House.
0DI0024585	Just thought you'd like to know. Okay, I'm getting Carlitos as far away from here as possible. Hope to see you again, bye!
0DI0024586	I'm happy to see you again. Carlitos and I have been living here since our escape. We'll never forget what you've done for us.
0DI0024587	Oh, no! No, no, no... Carlitos, dead? What, what will I do now?
0DI0024588	Hey there, sugar. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? You're so handsome I might just give you a discount.
0DI0024589	Hi, honey. I'm Dazzle. What can I do for you... or to you? Every night's ladies night here.
0DI0024590	You damn idiot. I just counted those caps you gave me, and there's not enough there!
0DI0024591	All those NCR troops should see me to celebrate. Come one, come all!
0DI0024592	I'm not letting the Legion make me a slave. Even I have standards.
0DI0024593	Guess it's true what they say - the house always wins in the end.
0DI0024594	No Mr. House, no NCR, no Legion, no rules! New Vegas is going to be just one wild, never-ending party.
0DI0024595	Back again? Did you miss me?
0DI0024596	What the fuck do you want now?
0DI0024598	Well look, the bully is back. What the hell do you want?
0DI0024599	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. What can I help you with today?
0DI0024600	Let's meet in my room, hon. Follow me.
0DI0024602	Take a seat! Play to win.
0DI0024603	You look like the lucky type, come play the odds.
0DI0024604	Play the tables, test your luck.
0DI0024605	You gotta play big to win big.
0DI0024606	Feeling lucky?
0DI0024607	Sorry, can't let you play here.
0DI0024608	You're cut off.
0DI0024609	Try the Tops, your money is no good here.
0DI0024610	Done playing? Try watching some dancers.
0DI0024611	Be patient. Don't blow it, now.
0DI0024612	I've enjoyed it, hon. But, if you want more of it, you know what you've got to do.
0DI0024613	Hey, do you mind? I'm trying to drink myself to the ground, right here. Scram.
0DI0024614	Hey, scram. Come bug me when I'm at the diner... if you're a real pain in the ass.
0DI0024616	Hey, it's you! What's the news?
0DI0024617	You've made it! Thank you so much for your help. I owe you more than- Wait! What's that?
0DI0024618	Let me guess. You want to know my secret - how I got my beard to grow in so thick.
0DI0024619	Just talk to Big Beard next to me, pal. Whoever's got the biggest whiskers, does the talking...
0DI0024620	Couldn't stay away, huh?
0DI0024621	Well, well, well, if it isn't our whore, Joana... and, I don't believe this. Carlitos!
0DI0024622	We had you and the whore clocked from the start, but we thought Carlitos would be long gone by now.
0DI0024623	He should've fled with the caps he stole from the family. We Omertas don't forget and now's time to pay for your offenses.
0DI0024624	Look, we are going, okay? So, leave us be.
0DI0024626	I don't know how we pulled this off, for a minute there I thought we were not going to make it.
0DI0024627	Without you, we'd been in the losing end. Thank you so much for your help, friend.
0DI0024630	For my beard, I do as I promised.
0DI0024631	Hey, friend! It's good to see you again.
0DI0024632	This place don't have the glitter of the Strip, but I've got Joana - that's all I'll ever need.
0DI0024633	We're ready. Let's get out of here.
0DI0024634	Thank you for your help!
0DI0024636	C'mon, let's go.
0DI0024637	Can't thank you enough for saving us.
0DI0024638	Didn't expect things to go so bad - I'm not staying here any longer.
0DI0024639	If you're injured, I might have healing powder to spare.
0DI0024640	A free woman. It's... been awhile since I've seen a woman who wasn't a slave. I forget myself - are you injured?
0DI0024641	With Caesar dead, I'm afraid for the women. The Legate is a brutal man, and he enjoys inflicting pain.
0DI0024642	I had hoped to become a great doctor like you someday.
0DI0024643	You got Melody her bear back. Very kind of you.
0DI0024645	So you're the visitor I've heard some of the Legionaries talking about. If you're in the mood to trade, just say the word.
0DI0024646	I've heard some bad stories about this Legate. I'm not sure I'll be welcome around here once he takes charge.
0DI0024647	Never had you pegged as the doctor-type. Guess I know who to come to now when I get sick.
0DI0024648	Howdy again.
0DI0024649	Caesar awaits. You can speak with me later.
0DI0024650	Caesar is dead at your hands. This crime cannot go unpunished.
0DI0024651	I don't understand - the machine was supposed to cure Caesar. You did this - his blood is own your hands.
0DI0024652	Your butchery of Caesar will not go unpunished!
0DI0024653	Caesar was right to put his trust in you. Your skill in medicine is beyond anything I've ever seen before.
0DI0024654	Caesar sleeps but doesn't awaken. I fear it is only a matter of days before death claims him.
0DI0024655	You will answer to me until such a time as Caesar is able to resume leadership.
0DI0024656	It's a great honor for anyone outside the Legion to get an audience with Caesar.
0DI0024657	You've proven yourself to be true friend of the Legion. We have a safehouse available to our agents in the Mojave - here's the key.
0DI0024658	It's an excellent place to rest and store extra equipment. In addition, one of our veterans, Atticus, visits the house every few days.
0DI0024659	While he's there, you can acquire items useful for stealthy operations against our enemies from him.
0DI0024660	Yes? Do you have something to report?
0DI0024661	Outsiders are a rare sight at the Fort. Step carefully around here and you might just leave alive. I'm Antony, master of the hounds.
0DI0024662	Damn it. I thought they had you.
0DI0024663	It'll be strange not having Caesar in command, but Legate Lanius is a strong leader.
0DI0024664	I'm sure you had to use a lot of healing powder on Caesar. Well done.
0DI0024665	The mechanical dog you have with you - where did you get it?
0DI0024667	You here to fight in the arena? Then you're talking to the right man.
0DI0024668	What do you want from me, woman? I'm in charge of the arena, not the cooking pots.
0DI0024669	As expected, it wasn't much of a fight, but what can you expect from slaves?
0DI0024670	A good fight. Some NCR troopers can be competent fighters.
0DI0024671	Unbelievable. You stood against a Ranger in single combat and survived.
0DI0024672	Caesar was a great man, but the Legion will become even greater with Legate Lanius at its head.
0DI0024673	You've done the Legion a great service by healing whatever was wrong with Caesar.
0DI0024674	A woman actually proved useful for once. Caesar was bold to put his life in your hands.
0DI0024675	What do you need from me?
0DI0024676	I can't talk to you. It's not allowed.
0DI0024677	I don't want to talk to you! I hate you!
0DI0024678	Hi!
0DI0024679	I'm still not allowed to talk to you.
0DI0024680	Caesar awaits you. We can talk afterwards.
0DI0024681	I suspect you'll be a valuable asset to the Legion - assuming you're really on our side, of course.
0DI0024682	This is a moment I'd hoped would not come for many years. Caesar's death puts the Legate Lanius in command now.
0DI0024683	I'm pleased that you were able to cure Caesar's malady. Though the Legate is a fine leader, we yet need the wisdom of Caesar to guide the Legion.
0DI0024684	Was there more for us to discuss?
0DI0024685	Mercy...
0DI0024686	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He appreciates your service, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
0DI0024687	My Lord requires your presence at his camp, at Fortification Hill. His Mark will guarantee your safe-conduct through our lands.
0DI0024688	The eyes of the mighty Caesar are upon you. He admires your accomplishments, and bestows upon you the exceptional gift of his Mark.
0DI0024689	Any crimes you may have perpetrated against the Legion are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy a second time.
0DI0024691	Incidentally, it will interest you to know that the man you seek has fled the Strip, and is likely making haste for Caesar's camp as we speak.
0DI0024692	Caesar awaits.
0DI0024693	Don't bother me - I'm training to become a full Legionary!
0DI0024694	One day I'll be part of the Praetorian Guard, you'll see.
0DI0024695	I can't wait until they let me fight.
0DI0024696	I'm harsh on the children, but they'll be excellent Legionaries. I'm quite proud of them.
0DI0024698	Your crimes against the Legion, including the death of the fearless Vulpes Inculta, are hereby forgiven. Caesar will not extend this mercy again.
0DI0024702	Caesar has permitted your weapons to be returned to you while you serve him.
0DI0024703	You've carried out Caesar's will, but I must confiscate your equipment again.
0DI0024704	Are you ready to proceed into the underground vault?
0DI0024705	Caesar has forbidden you to leave until you've carried out his will in the great underground vault.
0DI0024706	You may go.
0DI0024707	None may enter without Caesar's permission.
0DI0024708	The Legion is aware of your mercenary ways and has decided to encourage you work for us rather than against us.
0DI0024709	I've provided you the location of a drop box. Every few days, we'll place Legion coin inside.
0DI0024710	Though you aren't of the Legion, you've aided us more than once. We acquire many items on our raids, some useless to us, some forbidden.
0DI0024711	I've provided you the location of a drop box where you can obtain these items. The box will be replenished every few days.
0DI0024712	Please be aware that we'll assume any items left in the box will be unwanted and be removed and destroyed.
0DI0024713	My message to you has been delivered, and I've got other places to be.
0DI0024714	You must enter Caesar's tent alone. Anyone else must remain outside.
0DI0024715	Here - these are the supplies I've acquired for you.
0DI0024716	I'll be back in a few days with more supplies. See you then.
0DI0024717	Under penalty of death, the prisoner is forbidden to speak with you until Caesar has permitted it.
0DI0024718	Caesar didn't become sick until he started dealing with you. If this was all some trick to assassinate him, we will have revenge.
0DI0024719	Caesar is near death. Have you brought the means to cure him?
0DI0024720	We don't have time to talk, let's get this fight going.
0DI0024721	Please don't interrupt me right now.
0DI0024722	Keene has never liked me. If anyone can talk him into backing down, it'll have to be you.
0DI0024723	Marcus isn't going to be happy about the deaths, but I guess they were unavoidable. At least I got a lot of useful data from the experiment.
0DI0024724	This brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. If the prototype was constantly in use on a living subject, however...
0DI0024725	Perhaps Lily might be willing to wear the prototype for a longer duration. The data would be invaluable.
0DI0024726	I think those Nightkin are going cause a lot of trouble, but I guess giving them the specs was better than killing them.
0DI0024727	I did get a lot of useful data from the experiment, and I'm much closer to a cure than I was before.
0DI0024728	It's occurred to me that this brief test might not yield a cure any time soon. However, if Lily were to continue to wear the prototype...
0DI0024729	Nice work with the Nightkin. I've never seen anyone able to talk their kind out of anything once they had their mind set to it.
0DI0024730	I got a lot of useful data from the experiment and am a lot closer to a cure than before.
0DI0024732	Have you come to a decision on Lily? I'll need to know before I can do anything else.
0DI0024733	My request is perfectly reasonable. Give us the Stealth Boy specs and there will be no need for us to splatter the room with your insides.
0DI0024734	Don't you still have business with Doctor Henry? You and I are done.
0DI0024735	That Keene, always causing trouble.
0DI0024736	Be careful with Keene. He's got a mean temper.
0DI0024737	Looks like you've hit a lucky streak there. You must be thirsty by now - here, have a drink on the house and keep on playing!
0DI0024738	Baby, Lady Luck must be smiling at you today! Compliments of the Tops Casino, enjoy this fine meal and please, keep playing those games!
0DI0024739	You've been good to us, baby - now let us be good to you. We'd like you to enjoy this private suite as long as you're in town.
0DI0024740	Okay, pal, you've had enough. Time for you to leave.
0DI0024741	Welcome to The Tops. How can I help you?
0DI0024742	Humbly at your service.
0DI0024743	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. Looking to exchange?
0DI0024744	Welcome to Gomorrah, how can I help you?
0DI0024745	Welcome to Vikki and Vance. Can I help you with an exchange?
0DI0024746	I must say, fortune seems to be with you of late. Please, enjoy this, compliments of the White Glove Society.
0DI0024747	You certainly seem to be making a splash with all your success in the casino. Our executive chef prepared this delicacy for you himself. Enjoy.
0DI0024748	You are quite simply the talk of the casino right now with your astonishing play. Do stay in our Bon Vivant suite so you may continue to dazzle us.
0DI0024749	This simply will not do. You must leave immediately.
0DI0024750	Fancy meeting you here, friend.
0DI0024751	Hey there, friend.
0DI0024752	Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit, if it ain't my old friend from Goodsprings!
0DI0024753	Well... don't that beat all - it's my old friend from Goodsprings!
0DI0024754	Well howdy, pardner!  You made it out of Goodsprings no worse for the wear. Good for you.
0DI0024755	I reckon you'll be tracking down that varmint now. A man puts you in a grave has it coming if you ask me.
0DI0024756	Damn, son, you look like ten miles of bad road.
0DI0024757	A piece of advice: Watch yourself around No-Bark... I think he's studying to be a half-wit.
0DI0024758	You need to be careful, it's dangerous out here!
0DI0024759	You should go talk to Blake or Alice, they handle most of our contact with visitors.
0DI0024761	Hello again. How's your Boomer friend?
0DI0024762	Have you spoken with McLafferty yet?
0DI0024763	You tried to get me killed. Get the hell out of my face.
0DI0024764	I'm on my way to meet that Boomer you told me about!
0DI0024765	Thank you for getting me here. Jack is a great guy.
0DI0024766	Hey there! Here's the rest of the payment I promised you back in Goodsprings.
0DI0024768	Welcome to the Crimson Caravan Company, New Vegas branch. What may I do for you?
0DI0024769	Welcome back.
0DI0024770	Shove off. You're making my luck turn bad.
0DI0024771	You again. What do you want now?
0DI0024772	If you're looking to buy or sell, you've come to the right man. The Crimson Caravan Company has the widest selection in the wasteland.
0DI0024773	Hey there. You looking to buy or sell?
0DI0024774	I knew you'd make it. Resourceful, as always.
0DI0024775	The override module is functioning properly. I'm rerouting power to the Securitron vault at the Fort as we speak...
0DI0024776	I just need you to head over to the east power plant and manually activate the switch.
0DI0024777	When you return topside, I think you'll see that my Securitron army is a little more than the Legion was prepared to handle.
0DI0024778	Oh, and before you go - grab that print-out spooling from the console here - those papers set the terms for the NCR's unconditional surrender.
0DI0024779	I thought you might enjoy the honor of presenting them to the NCR's commanding officer, once the Legion has been defeated. Cheers!
0DI0024780	I've been sent to take you back to the Lucky 38. Are you ready to go?
0DI0024781	Thanks for setting me straight.
0DI0024783	Oh! What are you doing here?
0DI0024784	Aren't you the guy that helped wipe out Nelson?
0DI0024785	Holy shit man, that's fucking crazy!
0DI0024786	Aren't you the gal that helped wipe out Nelson?
0DI0024787	Holy shit, that's fucking crazy!
0DI0024788	Aren't you the one that saved President Kimball? That must have been some speech, eh?
0DI0024789	I heard President Kimball was assassinated during his visit to Hoover Dam. Doesn't surprise me, we're all going to end up dead soon anyway.
0DI0024790	I heard President Kimball almost got killed during his visit to Hoover Dam. Good thing he didn't come here, he would be dead for sure.
0DI0024791	You're new here aren't you? Don't tell me we're actually going to get reinforcements.
0DI0024792	Look at the big hero. You here to save us?
0DI0024793	I've heard of you. Did you figure on coming out here and helping us lowly troopers out?
0DI0024794	Just what we need around here, a loose cannon causing more trouble.
0DI0024795	I've heard of you, what do you want?
0DI0024798	We're all going to die out here. They're out there right now, waiting for us... waiting to kill us.
0DI0024799	We're all fucked!
0DI0024800	I don't want to be seen with the likes of you. Get lost.
0DI0024801	You're still here? I'm surprised you're not dead or gone by now.
0DI0024804	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after Benny fled, even.
0DI0024805	I do wish you'd come and met with me at the Lucky 38 when you first arrived on the Strip. Or after you killed Benny, even.
0DI0024806	Quite an honor you spurned, my invite. You would be the first person to set foot inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years.
0DI0024807	But... you still wound up here, right where I wanted you. I knew I could rely on Caesar to return the Platinum Chip to you.
0DI0024808	Well! You're here ahead of schedule! I suppose it's just as well...
0DI0024809	This is where I wanted you to end up, after all. I knew I could rely on Caesar to give you back the Platinum Chip.
0DI0024810	I see that you reached your destination safely. Shall we get to work?
0DI0024811	Have you come to your senses? It's not too late to upload the Platinum Chip's data to the primary computer.
0DI0024812	Stop wasting time. Go upload the data on the Platinum Chip to the facility's primary computer.
0DI0024813	As you know, the Platinum Chip upgrades my Securitrons' operating software. Well... there's an army of them here.
0DI0024814	The Securitrons policing the Strip are a fraction of the total number manufactured. The rest, I stored here.
0DI0024815	The Platinum Chip is a data-storage device.
0DI0024816	I need you to manually upload the data from the Chip to the facility's primary computer. There's a terminal at the other end of this facility.
0DI0024817	There's a complication. While I can broadcast to this screen, I can't control any of the facility's systems.
0DI0024818	That means I can't deactivate its security bots... most of which appear to be active, according to the status board I'm looking at.
0DI0024819	Do you have the slightest idea of what you've done, of what you've destroyed?
0DI0024820	You've doomed Vegas to be ruled by corrupt bureaucrats or fanatical savages.
0DI0024821	Singlehandedly, you've brought mankind's best hopes of forward progress crashing down. No punishment would be too severe.
0DI0024822	Your work here is done. Return to the Lucky 38 so we can discuss next steps.
0DI0024823	You have a very bright future ahead of you. Thanks to your actions today, so does the rest of mankind.
0DI0024824	Benny is dead, and yet you don't appear to be carrying the Platinum Chip.
0DI0024825	I don't suppose you forgot to search his body?
0DI0024826	Before we go any further - where is the Platinum Chip?
0DI0024827	So, we meet in person finally... so to speak. You did well at the Fort - kudos.
0DI0024828	Have you come to your senses - or will there be a repeat of the last incident?
0DI0024829	You've been a busy courier, haven't you? You take your obligation to deliver an package very seriously - an ethic for which I am grateful.
0DI0024830	I will admit, when you ignored my invitation, I predicted... negative outcomes. But - you have a way of exceeding expectations, don't you?
0DI0024831	Well enough. Let's have the Chip, then.
0DI0024832	This meeting has been a long time coming, hasn't it? You've come a long ways, literally and, I suspect, figuratively as well.
0DI0024833	I have to ask - now that you've reached your destination, what do you make of what you see?
0DI0024834	The point of my inviting you to visit me here at the Lucky 38 before stomping into the Tops on your own was to help you prepare - tactically.
0DI0024835	Now, because of your carelessness, Benny has fled the Strip, taking with him the Platinum Chip.
0DI0024836	Well... this meeting has been a long time in coming... longer still, since you took time to charge into the Tops before coming to see me.
0DI0024837	Before we get down to details, I must ask - now that you've arrived at your destination, what do you make of what you see?
0DI0024838	Can I look forward to a more substantial conversation this time?
0DI0024839	Have you considered the terms of my offer? There's else little for us to discuss until you have.
0DI0024840	What is the purpose of this delay?
0DI0024841	Events have transpired in a... less-than-optimal fashion. Benny has fled the Strip, and the Platinum Chip has not been recovered.
0DI0024842	Benny must be pursued, and the Platinum Chip, recovered.
0DI0024843	So... Benny has been handled and you've recovered the Platinum Chip. Let's have it.
0DI0024844	I take it you've come to deliver the Platinum Chip?
0DI0024845	Such a small thing, isn't it? And yet so... capacious. So very dear.
0DI0024846	Decades of hiring salvagers out west to search for this little relic in the ruins of a place called Sunnyvale. Back then, anyway.
0DI0024847	That's where the Chip was printed, on October 22, 2077. It was to have been hand-delivered to me here, at the Lucky 38, the next day.
0DI0024848	But the bombs fell first. Suffice it to say, the delivery was never made.
0DI0024849	Come now, come now... get thee to the elevator.
0DI0024850	To the elevator, if you please... Stop dragging your feet.
0DI0024851	Trips to the basement are rarely so educational, don't you think?
0DI0024852	I've since broadcast the upgrade to every Securitron in range of my transmitters, and I must say, it's causing quite a stir down on the Strip!
0DI0024853	Make your way to Caesar's Camp at Fortification Hill. Something very interesting awaits you...
0DI0024854	To secure the future of New Vegas, I must have your assistance. The work ahead is dangerous, but you weather danger well.
0DI0024855	Have you found the courage to do what's necessary?
0DI0024856	What did you wish to know?
0DI0024858	We'll talk again once you've concluded your work in the bunker at Fortification Hill.
0DI0024859	The foundation is laid. My Securitrons on the Strip are upgraded, and those at the Fort, ready for action.
0DI0024860	Now it's just a matter of adjusting the attitudes of some lesser groups while we wait for Caesar's Legion to attack Hoover Dam.
0DI0024861	The next step is to add the Boomers' considerable firepower to my growing arsenal... or at the very least, ensure their neutrality.
0DI0024862	As I was saying, I need you to enlist or neutralize the Boomers at Nellis Air Force Base.
0DI0024863	Any progress with the Boomers?
0DI0024864	Your next assignment won't take you far. It concerns the Omertas and their den of vice, Gomorrah.
0DI0024865	As the decisive encounter between the bull and the bear looms close, my concerns about the Omertas have grown.
0DI0024866	I've never expected loyalty, mind you. A reliably underhanded tribe is just as constant to deal with as one that always run true.
0DI0024867	But that's just it - lately the Omertas' cooperative silence has been deafening. Not a single complaint? They're up to something.
0DI0024868	Your next assignment would've been to investigate the Omertas, but you managed to foil their scheme before I could put you to the task.
0DI0024869	I should compensate you as though it were an official assignment, however. Wouldn't want to disincentivize your proactivity.
0DI0024870	I'd hoped to have you investigate the Omertas, but after the trouble you caused at Gomorrah, they won't let you in the front door.
0DI0024871	I'll see if I can make some progress with informants. You're useless in this matter.
0DI0024872	As I said before, I need you to investigate the Omertas, to see what they're up to.
0DI0024873	What do you have to report about the Omertas?
0DI0024874	Your next assignment is to locate and destroy remnants of the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel.
0DI0024875	The NCR nearly did the job at Helios One a few years ago, but there seem to have been survivors, unfortunately.
0DI0024876	Given the Brotherhood's fanatical views on technology, they can be counted on to oppose my regime.
0DI0024877	Please - put them out of my misery.
0DI0024878	As I've said, I need you to locate and destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
0DI0024879	Have you destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel?
0DI0024880	Will you ensure that President Kimball survives his visit to Hoover Dam?
0DI0024881	Aaron Kimball, the president of the New California Republic, is going to visit Hoover Dam to "boost morale."
0DI0024882	Apparently he hasn't considered the effect on the troops' morale of seeing their beloved leader get his brains blown out by a Legion sniper.
0DI0024883	I need you to make sure that no harm comes to President Kimball. It's fortunate that you've maintained good relations with the NCR...
0DI0024884	Unfortunately, I can't use you to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
0DI0024885	Odds are that Caesar will launch his assault on the dam after Kimball's visit is concluded, one way or the other - so be on guard.
0DI0024886	Unfortunately, I can't very well send you off to protect Kimball. The NCR won't let you come within a thousand feet of the President.
0DI0024887	This can be used to our advantage, though it'll a grim business. Go to Hoover Dam and attack the gathering crowd, and his visit will be canceled.
0DI0024888	Your reputation with the NCR isn't exactly stellar, so I'll have to vouche for you. It'll make a scene, but it's worth it.
0DI0024889	Last I knew, President Kimball wasn't scheduled to visit the Lucky 38. Be on your way to Hoover Dam, will you?
0DI0024890	If not for you, President Kimball would be dead. So you needn't feel guilty when the NCR's rout from Hoover Dam demolishes his political career.
0DI0024891	Why in the world did you attack President Kimball?
0DI0024892	Kimball is dead - what a mess you've made!
0DI0024893	Between the Strip and HELIOS One lies the El Dorado electrical substation.
0DI0024894	Humble as it appears, the substation has immense strategic value, for it's there that you'll jumpstart the Lucky 38's dormant reactor.
0DI0024895	Gain access to the substation's control room and install this override module. Just so you know, there are NCR troops guarding the station.
0DI0024896	Until the Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted, we have nothing to discuss.
0DI0024897	As you can see, Vegas is humming along. I've tested my c3i broadcasting arrays. Everything is in order.
0DI0024898	And just in time, as it turns out. The forces of Caesar's Legion are on the march, establishing a staging area east of the dam.
0DI0024899	Their assault could begin at any moment. So that's where you'll be heading, if you're ready - Hoover Dam.
0DI0024900	The Legion's assault could begin at any moment.
0DI0024901	What did you want to discuss?
0DI0024902	What else did you want to discuss?
0DI0024903	There will be no repeat of the trouble we had last time, I trust?
0DI0024904	I'm optimistic that this conversation will go more smoothly.
0DI0024905	I'd rather you just dealt with the Boomers, but all right...
0DI0024906	I suppose the Omertas can wait a few minutes.
0DI0024907	A few questions, and then you'll handle the Brotherhood, I hope?
0DI0024908	Questions like "Will President Kimball survive his visit to Hoover Dam?"
0DI0024909	Even now? On the brink of battle?
0DI0024916	Why have you... done this?... centuries of preparation... so much good, undone...
0DI0024917	I have... nothing... to say... to you...
0DI0024918	Antler says you are the one killing my kin. Antler says you must die!
0DI0024919	What's that, Antler? We have a visitor?
0DI0024920	An assassin, more like! I say kill it, Antler. For safe's sake!
0DI0024921	Huh? ...Okay, Antler. I'll ask.
0DI0024922	Hi, human. Why you come here?
0DI0024923	Antler sings for Stealth Boys. Have you found them?
0DI0024924	Where did rest of my kin go? All alone now...
0DI0024925	Antler is sad. We Nightkin go now, but there is fewer than when we came here...
0DI0024926	Antler is sad, human. Nightkin go now, find Stealth Boys in other places.
0DI0024927	You did good, smoothskin. Never thought I'd get out of that room.
0DI0024928	Kind of busy running for my life here, smoothskin.
0DI0024929	Come and get it, you big dumb -
0DI0024930	Hey! You're not one of those things out there. Who the hell are you?
0DI0024931	Did you find my friend?
0DI0024932	What do you want now, smoothskin?
0DI0024933	Hi there. I'm Old Lady Gibson, or so they tell me. I've got odds and ends for sale, and I'm pretty good at fixing things, too.
0DI0024934	You might have noticed the very large building just north of here. That's HELIOS One. The NCR runs the place, so it's off-limits to prospectors.
0DI0024935	So you're back. Now, where did we leave off?
0DI0024936	I don't speak with outsiders, smoothskins especially. Talk to our leader, Jason Bright.
0DI0024937	Sorry, we don't talk to outsiders. Talk to Jason if you have business here.
0DI0024938	Jason will lead us to the Far Beyond!
0DI0024939	Jason will deliver us from the pain of this world!
0DI0024940	All praise the Great Journey! All praise the creator's divine will!
0DI0024941	The holy fire will carry us to our salvation!
0DI0024942	Thank you for taking care of the demons, smoothskin.
0DI0024943	Now that the demons are gone, we can finally begin our final steps.
0DI0024944	The demons are really gone? Bright shines!
0DI0024945	Not now, smoothskin!
0DI0024946	Welcome to the Dino Bite Gift Shop. My name's Cliff. If you're here for the t-rex figurines, you're just in time. There's still a few left.
0DI0024947	Welcome back. Please don't kill me. I'll give you a real nice price on everything.
0DI0024948	I don't know if you know, but since Jeannie May passed, I've been keeping an eye on her properties for her.
0DI0024949	I think it's time we gave something back to you, so take this key and make yourself at home at our motel.
0DI0024950	It'll open the room on the second floor, closest to the lobby. Hope it suits you.
0DI0024951	Welcome back. Can I get you anything?
0DI0024952	Hey there. If you want to buy something from my shop, you'll have to wait till it opens.
0DI0024953	Who sent you? I ain't talking. They tried to get me to talk before, but I didn't say nothing. And I don't aim to now, by gum.
0DI0024954	You've seen them too, haven't you? I can see it in your eyes. I knew I wasn't the only one.
0DI0024955	Hello, wanderer. Please forgive us of our humble surroundings. Our true home awaits us in the Far Beyond.
0DI0024956	Have you come to help us complete the Great Journey?
0DI0024957	I apologize, wanderer, but I must go tend to my flock!
0DI0024958	I waited to speak with you one last time before I descended to the launch pad, wanderer.
0DI0024959	I want you to know that we will remember for all eternity how you delivered us to the threshold of the Great Journey.
0DI0024960	Our preparations are nearly complete, but the rockets that will carry us to salvation are yet missing vital components.
0DI0024961	If you would still help us, wanderer, speak to Chris. He can tell you what is missing.
0DI0024963	Forgive me, wanderer, but my flock awaits.
0DI0024964	Is the way clear?
0DI0024965	Will you help us, wanderer?
0DI0024966	I don't think we got any more to discuss here.
0DI0024967	Is everything all right? Awful late to be dropping in unexpected.
0DI0024968	Well. Welcome to you. You look tired from the road. Why don't you relax a spell, let this fine town take care of you?
0DI0024969	I hope you're finding everything to your liking.
0DI0024970	We haven't met yet. You must be new in town. I'm Andy.
0DI0024971	Boy you picked that takedown right up. I'm impressed. Must've had some prior training, huh?
0DI0024972	You'll get the hang of that takedown. I had trouble learning it at first, too.
0DI0024974	You have any luck with the ghouls? I'm counting on you.
0DI0024975	What's going on, man?
0DI0024976	Sorry, I ain't really up to entertaining visitors right now. I'm worried about Dusty.
0DI0024977	What brings you here?
0DI0024978	You seen Alice? Ain't like her to be gone this long.
0DI0024979	Hey there. In from out of town, ain't you? Name's Dusty.
0DI0024980	Find anything?
0DI0024981	Things treating you all right?
0DI0024982	Did you see all the commotion at REPCONN? I hope that doesn't mean trouble for our town.
0DI0024983	Hey, there. Been to the top of the dino yet?
0DI0024984	I could've sworn we were under attack. Did you see those rockets?
0DI0024985	If you're planning on staying awhile, the Dino Dee-lite's got plenty of room.
0DI0024986	I really hope that incident at REPCONN doesn't drive people away. Novac was starting to do well!
0DI0024987	With all the people passing through lately, the town's been doing better than, well, ever.
0DI0024988	All the noise at REPCONN scared the hell out of me.
0DI0024989	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. I don't think he ever sleeps, so it's no wonder he spouts nothing but nonsense.
0DI0024990	Gathering junk's not the most exciting work, but it's a living.
0DI0024991	Good thing none of those rockets crashed into Novac.
0DI0024992	If it weren't for the water caravans, Novac would've turned to dust a long time ago.
0DI0024993	Those rockets over at REPCONN were the NCR's doing. Trying to keep us scared so they can stick around to "protect" us.
0DI0024994	The salvage business has really slowed down since those ghouls took over REPCONN.
0DI0024995	Any word on Station Charlie?
0DI0024996	I don't want to get shot!
0DI0024997	It's about time a new customer showed up around here. Was getting sick of dealing with the same faces all the time.
0DI0024998	I can't believe the NCR actually showed up. We sure showed them, though. Right?
0DI0025000	There's still more troopers out there!
0DI0025001	I know all the guys I did time with around here and you ain't one of them. Can't fool me with that Powder Ganger getup.
0DI0025002	Okay, I know I wasn't serving time with no girl, or I'd have heard about it. You come to play with the Powder Gangers?
0DI0025003	Look at you, walking in here like you're one of us. Don't you know this is Powder Ganger territory?
0DI0025004	Hey there, girlie. You here to party with the Powder Gangers?
0DI0025005	Did you see me take out that NCR trooper? Right through his eye!
0DI0025007	I knew I should've gone with Cooke!
0DI0025008	Heard there was a new face around. I'm the doctor around here... sort of.
0DI0025009	That... was close. I really need to find some nice, quiet place to settle.
0DI0025010	Sticking around, I see.
0DI0025011	Have you gotten my pardon from the NCR yet?
0DI0025012	Thanks for getting me that pardon. Me and the boys will take good care of Primm, don't you worry.
0DI0025013	I can do right by this town, they were in need of some frontier justice.
0DI0025014	Sounds like the NCR is finally getting off their ass to settle things around here. Don't expect me to get in their way.
0DI0025015	Maybe you ought to worry about the guys trying to kill you first.
0DI0025016	Didn't know anyone would willingly walk into this place, not unless they were looking for trouble. What's your story?
0DI0025017	Need to talk about something?
0DI0025019	Will you quit bothering me?
0DI0025020	No time to talk. We've got trouble.
0DI0025021	Not half bad in a fight, are you? I figure you had a lot to do with me still breathing after all that.
0DI0025022	I don't have any more work for you, but feel free to stick around as long as you want. You never know when the NCR will be back.
0DI0025023	Dawes said he let somebody in. So, you going to give me a reason not to kill you and throw your body back outside?
0DI0025024	You're the one Cobb mentioned. Maybe you feel like helping us out around here.
0DI0025025	Not bad in a fight, are you? I really thought the NCR had us in their sights that time.
0DI0025026	I've been thinking that since you've been good to us, we can be good to you.
0DI0025027	We've got plenty of spare powder and dynamite around. Say the word and we can give you some of it every couple of days.
0DI0025028	I don't know what to make of you, you know that? I know I can't really trust you, that's for sure.
0DI0025029	Still, you've helped us out some, so maybe I ought to repay you some. I've spread the word about you to a bunch of guys out in the wasteland.
0DI0025030	As long as you're not an enemy, they'll cut you some slack when you're near their camps. Trespass too long and they'll come after you.
0DI0025032	Shut up and fight!
0DI0025033	I'm Sergeant Lee. Lieutenant Hayes radioed ahead to say you were on the way.
0DI0025034	We've got surprise on our side, and that's about it. Once we blow a gap in the fence, we've got to pour on the fire and keep them disorganized.
0DI0025035	Our goal's to take out their leader, some assbag named Eddie. With the ringleader gone, the rest will fold.
0DI0025036	That's all the briefing you're going to get. Let's go.
0DI0025037	We can take it from here. We might have some cleaning up to do, but Eddie's a deadie. Gangs with no leadership don't last long.
0DI0025038	I'll radio Hayes to let him know the prison's ours. But you should swing by to see him the next time you're near Primm.
0DI0025040	You just walked into the wrong camp, my friend. Hand over everything you've got and we might let you live.
0DI0025041	I got the message. You won't see me around these parts again.
0DI0025042	Hey, I've been sent to tell you that, while you're not exactly a friend, we know you've helped us out some all the same.
0DI0025043	We figure some kind of truce is in order. As long as you don't come too close to any of our camps, we'll let you pass without trying to kill you.
0DI0025044	Of course, the truce is off once we know you're an enemy.
0DI0025045	Got nothing else to say to you.
0DI0025046	Better be careful around these parts. I hear there's Powder Gangers around and dangerous for merchants like me.
0DI0025047	Well, well. It's about time one of you guys came along. I figure the NCR would pay a pretty good bounty for a Powder Ganger.
0DI0025048	Hadn't heard there were women Powder Gangers, but a bounty's a bounty. The NCR will probably pay up either way.
0DI0025049	You won't see me around here again.
0DI0025050	What brings you back?
0DI0025051	Now that McNamara's lifted that silly lockdown of his, perhaps people around here will come to appreciate our training simulations.
0DI0025052	Perhaps there will be a renewed interest in them as people realize just how close to reality they are... but I digress. What did you want?
0DI0025053	Now that Hardin's Elder, I hope I'll be allowed to continue my experiments. I never quite liked the way he looked at me during meetings.
0DI0025054	Like he wanted to use me for target practice. The man just has no respect for science! But enough of this. What did you want?
0DI0025056	I'll track the virus from over here. You just concentrate on locating the terminals hosting it.
0DI0025057	Look, this isn't a great ti- oh, what the hell, it's not like we're making any progress. I'm Ibsen, and I hope your day is going better than mine is.
0DI0025058	Did you want to try isolating the virus?
0DI0025059	You actually did it! If you don't mind my saying so, I didn't think you had a chance in hell of pulling it off.
0DI0025060	But I'm glad to be wrong for once! Thank you, my friend. Please, feel free to access the datastore at your leisure.
0DI0025061	I'm only allowed to give you access to non-classified topics, but it's better than nothing, right?
0DI0025062	Hello again, my friend. I hope you've been finding the information in the datastore useful.
0DI0025064	Welcome to the range. Feel free to use any open lane.
0DI0025065	Ah, outsider. I've heard that you were instrumental in providing Hardin with the evidence to bring against me. And here I had thought to use you.
0DI0025066	Have you come to gloat, or did you actually want something?
0DI0025067	Welcome, outsider, welcome! The lockdown has been officially lifted and everyone seems to be in good spirits.
0DI0025068	With the surface open to us once again, Hardin's already started talk of sending a force out to attack HELIOS, but I hope to dissuade him.
0DI0025070	Hail, Brother. May I help you?
0DI0025071	Greetings, my friend. I hope I can be of some assistance to you.
0DI0025072	I apologize, outsider, but I'm going to be busy for a little while making preparations for lifting the lockdown.
0DI0025074	I'm afraid I don't have time to talk, outsider. I've had word that Hardin is charging me with violating protocol and must prepare a defense.
0DI0025075	Back again, I see. Have you found all the components we need?
0DI0025076	Have you had any luck finding the scouts? Or did you have something to discuss?
0DI0025077	Found the missing patrols, or was something else on your mind?
0DI0025078	How did you find us, stranger? And do tell the truth.
0DI0025079	I've been informed that you bring us ill tidings, stranger. Care to elaborate?
0DI0025080	When Paladin Ramos informed me that Veronica was approaching with an outsider in tow, at first I didn't know what to think.
0DI0025081	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of use to me right now.
0DI0025082	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though you'd remain Veronica's responsibility.
0DI0025083	What do you say, outsider? Are you willing to help us?
0DI0025084	What I wished to discuss with you can wait for once I get settled in the command room, outsider.
0DI0025085	When you first showed up on our doorstep, I'll admit at first I didn't know what to think.
0DI0025086	After giving the matter some thought, however, I've decided that an outsider could be of great use to me right now.
0DI0025087	However, I will not force you to help us. Should you refuse, you will be allowed to leave here, though know we will be keeping an eye on you.
0DI0025089	How did you resolve the situation with the ranger?
0DI0025090	Have you reconsidered, outsider? I can still use your help.
0DI0025091	Yes, associate?
0DI0025094	Hey, I heard the pistol got returned. Thanks a lot! I am never going to listen to Watkins again, believe me.
0DI0025095	I really hope you can find that pistol.
0DI0025096	Yes, can I help you?
0DI0025097	Sorry, but I'm a little busy here. If you'll excuse me.
0DI0025098	The lockdown is lifted! The patrols are going to start up again! Do you know what this means? I'll actually be able to get into a real fight!
0DI0025099	I wonder what it'll be against? Raiders? Radscorpions? Deathclaws? Oh, I can't wait. So what's up?
0DI0025100	Hey, so Hardin becoming Elder was because of you, huh? Good job. Now that the lockdown if lifted, I may get a chance to get into a real fight!
0DI0025102	I hear you handled the NCR ranger that was camping out topside.
0DI0025103	Don't get a big head or anything about it. I would have taken him out if they'd let me.
0DI0025106	You'll find your equipment in the chest to your right. Don't bother coming back until you've dealt with the ranger.
0DI0025107	Stand back from the door. The Elder's eager to hear your report.
0DI0025109	Where did you learn that password? And tell the truth, because I'll know if you're lying.
0DI0025110	Listen up. I'm in charge of security around here, and I can't say I'm too happy having an outsider waltzing around.
0DI0025111	But since you came in with Veronica, I'm inclined to cut you a little slack. Just behave yourself and we won't have any problems, okay?
0DI0025112	Oh, and the Elder's going to want to talk to you. He's on the second level. Just take a right once you get down there.
0DI0025113	My office is right here in case you need anything. Just ask for Ramos.
0DI0025114	How the hell did you get in here? Normally, I would have already shot you, but I'm under orders to bring you to the Elder. Will you come peacefully?
0DI0025115	Rest up, and make your report to the Elder when you're up to it.
0DI0025116	If you have something to say, say it to Elder McNamara.
0DI0025117	Your presence here... Let's just say it's highly irregular.
0DI0025118	Outsiders aren't even allowed to know that our bunker's here, let alone come and go freely.
0DI0025119	You impressed Elder McNamara, obviously. He must believe that you'll be very useful.
0DI0025120	Oh, hey there. Something I can help you with?
0DI0025122	No time to talk now. I have to get ready to return to base with this information. I'll get a fat raise for this, if anyone actually believes me.
0DI0025123	Okay, so you weren't kidding about there being a Brotherhood base here.
0DI0025124	I'll need to report back to base about this. They'll think I'm playing a prank if I try to radio it in, so I'll need some face time with the brass.
0DI0025125	Thanks for the heads up. I mean it. I'll be sure to mention you in my report.
0DI0025126	Shhh. I thought I heard something up by the entrance.
0DI0025127	Now, now. Calm down. I believe you saw something. Let's just head back to my camp and we'll figure out what it was, okay?
0DI0025128	Sorry, but I've got a long hike ahead of me. You take care.
0DI0025129	Powder ganger scum! Hands up or die!
0DI0025130	Thought you'd sneak up on me, you filthy powder ganger?
0DI0025131	Oh, it's you. Any particular reason you felt the need to bother me again?
0DI0025133	You must be the stranger I've been hearing about. Sorry, but I'm strictly forbidden from offering our tech to outsiders like yourself.
0DI0025134	Besides, I'm a little busy right now.
0DI0025135	Sorry, outsider, but I'm not allowed to sell you anything without the Elder's say so.
0DI0025137	I can't believe Hardin is Elder now. At least with the lockdown lifted I'll be able to resupply my store more often. So what are you here for?
0DI0025138	Have you heard the news? Elder McNamara has lifted the lockdown! Good news for this store, let me tell you. I can't wait to start getting more goods.
0DI0025139	So what are you here for?
0DI0025140	The word came down from the Elder that I'm to offer you some of our lesser wares, as if I didn't have other matters on my mind.
0DI0025141	Have you found it? I need to give my report to Hardin soon.
0DI0025142	Hi there. Looking to spend some caps?
0DI0025143	You again? Didn't I tell you I was busy?
0DI0025145	Listen very closely and do as I say. Your life depends on it.
0DI0025146	Hand over everything you're carrying. Weapons, ammo, clothes, armor - everything. I want you stripped down to your underwear.
0DI0025147	Save it for Paladin Ramos, outsider.
0DI0025148	I said shut up and keep moving.
0DI0025149	You're the one with that robot, I was hoping you'd bring him my way. Pretty impressive piece of hardware.
0DI0025150	I can't say that I've seen anything quite like him before.
0DI0025151	Hmmm? Oh, you must be the outsider everyone's buzzing about. Pleased to meet you. I'm Lorenzo, Senior Knight and general handyman around here.
0DI0025153	Hey, good to see you again. Have you thought any more about letting me take a look at the logs on your robot?
0DI0025154	Good to see you! Alive, that is. Have you found all of the components yet?
0DI0025155	Good to see you again. What can I help you with?
0DI0025156	What do you want? And don't try anything funny.
0DI0025157	That report must reach the Elder's hands. I have nothing further to give you.
0DI0025158	Don't take another step if you value your life. For what purpose do you approach me?
0DI0025159	The Elder is likely urgently awaiting that report. You should make your way to him as soon as possible.
0DI0025160	Approach slowly, stranger. If you have no business with me, then go.
0DI0025161	Quick now, off with you! The Elder must see that report!
0DI0025162	It looks like you've managed to talk some sense into the Elder, outsider. Be assured, I'll still be keeping an eye on him.
0DI0025163	Your efforts to help this chapter are not unappreciated. Now, what can I do for you?
0DI0025164	Welcome, my friend. A new day has dawned for this chapter, and moving forward we will no longer cower in the dark.
0DI0025165	And we have you to thank for it. You'll find that I can be generous to those who show loyalty.
0DI0025166	Here, take this key. If you ever find yourself in need of repair, head to our safehouse to the northeast.
0DI0025168	Are you willing to listen to me now, outsider?
0DI0025169	Have you reconsidered helping me, outsider? I do what I must to see that the chapter survives.
0DI0025170	What is it, outsider? Have you discovered anything?
0DI0025171	Welcome back, my friend. What can I do for you?
0DI0025173	I appreciate all you've done, but I'm going to have my hands full for a little while. Come back later and we'll talk.
0DI0025176	I heard we have you to thank for McNamara having a change of heart. Thank you. So what can I do for you?
0DI0025177	There's a rumor going around that you were behind Hardin's takeover. I suppose his leadership is better than none at all. Time will tell.
0DI0025178	So what brings you by today?
0DI0025179	Hello, you must be the outsider everyone is talking about. I'm Linda Schuler. If you ever need medical attention, this is the place to come.
0DI0025180	Hello. Can I help you with something?
0DI0025182	Charging a casino full of heavily-armed gangsters was a great idea, boss. Definitely not the kind of thing that could have gotten us both killed.
0DI0025183	Not to worry, boss. I'm sure killing the boss of one of the Families will in no way lead to savage, bloody reprisals against you and your loved ones.
0DI0025184	If we run, we might still catch Benny! Well, you might. I'll just be wheezing along behind you.
0DI0025185	You really enjoy dragging me into situations where I get shot at, don't you boss?
0DI0025186	Ahh, overly-elaborate mob schemes to take over Vegas. Reminds me of the days before the War.
0DI0025187	I can't believe we're allowed inside the Lucky 38. That place has been a legend since before the War....
0DI0025188	Angry soldier robots with bazookas. I'm sure they'll be a good police force.
0DI0025189	Maybe I'm just old and tired, but being locked in a cool, dark pod to sleep for a few centuries doesn't sound so bad.
0DI0025190	Eesh, boss. Just... eesh.
0DI0025191	Don't worry boss, I'm sure Caesar just wants to invite you over for coffee or something. That's all.
0DI0025192	Hey boss, that surgery reminded me of something: I got this funny lump right down here... think you could take a look at it?
0DI0025193	I'm glad you decided to off one of the most powerful men in the Mojave. Life was getting boring anyways. Really.
0DI0025194	Yeah, Caesar, let's give you brain surgery in a tent. That can't possibly go wrong.
0DI0025195	Caesar's death reminds me of an old saying. I can't quite remember it now, something like "sic semper tyrannosaurus."
0DI0025196	Oh, good. Now there's an army of robots. You don't do things by halves, do you, boss?
0DI0025197	Did blowing up that vault serve a purpose, or do you just like explosions?
0DI0025198	Those poor NCR soldiers... now where will they get their hookers and gambling?
0DI0025199	Be honest, you did it for the ticker-tape parades, huh boss?
0DI0025200	Don't worry, boss. I'll make sure your biography says you "heroically changed your mind" about killing the president, not "choked under pressure."
0DI0025201	Just to be clear, we're not planning to visit any NCR facilities, right boss? Like, ever again?
0DI0025202	Well, the President's dead, but don't worry. History has shown that that sort of thing almost never leads to massive destabilizations or world wars.
0DI0025203	Never been a big fan of gangs like the Fiends, boss. I'm glad they're gone.
0DI0025204	The Khans didn't seem so bad to me, but what do I know? I was locked up in a cell by a crazy Nightkin for years.
0DI0025205	Do you often go toe-to-toe with guys dressed as tanks, boss? That might not be great for your life expectancy.
0DI0025206	I'm sure pissing off a ruthless warlord with a tribe of fanatically-devoted warriors was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
0DI0025207	I'm sure pissing off a massive government with a huge army at its disposal was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
0DI0025208	I'm sure pissing off the two most powerful factions in the Mojave was a good move. How could it not be? It was your idea.
0DI0025209	Don't worry, boss. I'm sure the sudden tension in the air is just... a thunderstorm?
0DI0025210	Okay, so maybe I was wrong about the thunderstorm thing. I admit it.
0DI0025211	Looks like this is gonna be the big one, boss. If you're ready, I'm with you.
0DI0025212	What can I do for you, boss?
0DI0025213	Took you long enough. So, can I go now?
0DI0025214	I haven't heard a fresh batch of crazy coming out of the radio in a while. Does that mean I can leave?
0DI0025215	Back again? Can I go this time, or do you have something else in mind?
0DI0025216	Oh, it's you. You need something repaired or something?
0DI0025217	I... don't know how to thank you for bringing Rhonda back to me, stranger.
0DI0025218	Here, take this. I won't be needing it anymore.
0DI0025219	Good work, human. Maybe now this place can rest in peace.
0DI0025220	There's nothing for you here, human, though it is always good to see you.
0DI0025221	I've done what I can. The rest is up to you, human.
0DI0025222	This is a dangerous place, human - especially for your kind! I suggest you turn back. There's nothing good waiting for you further on.
0DI0025223	Still hanging about?
0DI0025224	Hey, you've interrupted my broadcast, dumb-dumb - so there had better be a good reason! What is it?
0DI0025225	A pleasant surprise to see you made it. I'm ready to get started if you are.
0DI0025226	We shouldn't wait much longer. Are you ready?
0DI0025228	I don't even remember where we were going, but It'll be good to travel around with Rhonda again.
0DI0025229	Fiends... cracked-out junkies.  All those chems make them a real bitch to take down.
0DI0025230	We should be taking the fight to the Legion, not waiting for them to pick us apart.
0DI0025231	I really hope General Oliver has a good plan if the Legion comes back.
0DI0025232	Colonel Hsu really knows what he's doing. Now if only someone'd explain that to ol' General Wait-and-See Oliver...
0DI0025233	I pity anyone who crosses Boyd. That woman is relentless.
0DI0025234	We still haven't gotten Ranger Morales' body back from the Fiends. Sure doesn't inspire confidence in the guys you're serving with.
0DI0025235	Damn shame about Morales. She enlisted to be closer to her husband.
0DI0025236	Contreras is holding out on me. I know he's got more to sell.
0DI0025237	Man, Doc Kemp really fixed me up right the last time I got shot. He's the man to see if you need some fixin'.
0DI0025238	Farber is doing the best with what he's got, but man could I go for a nice cut of brahmin steak.
0DI0025239	I appreciate the improvements in the mess. Keep up the good work.
0DI0025240	These recruits aren't ready, if the Legion comes knocking.
0DI0025241	Get running the obstacle course, if you want. You look like you could use some exercise.
0DI0025242	I'm busy. See the brass if you want to chat.
0DI0025243	No time for idle chatter. These boys need whipping into shape.
0DI0025244	Either join the recruits running the course or leave the area.
0DI0025245	You look like someone in need of a reliable supplier.
0DI0025246	So you're back.
0DI0025247	Did the colonel send you? I... I was hoping he might have changed his mind...
0DI0025248	Got to keep hoping the Colonel will change his mind... maybe send somebody to bring Esteban's body home.
0DI0025249	Did you start looking for Esteban? I guess my directions could've been better...
0DI0025250	Feels better knowing that Esteban's not out there in the waste. But... he's still gone, you know?
0DI0025252	What did Contreras say?
0DI0025253	Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork... It just never ends.
0DI0025254	Good thing I got stationed here and not at the Dam. I got connections because Major Dhatri's daughter married my nephew.
0DI0025255	Whoa whoa whoa. Hold up. Where do you think you're going?
0DI0025256	Hey, good luck. We'd be there with you, but the Colonel said he'd have our necks if we tried.
0DI0025257	Be careful out there. We already lost Jackson doing what you're trying to do.
0DI0025258	Hell of a thing you did up there.
0DI0025259	Proud to have met you, sir.
0DI0025260	Proud to have met you, ma'am.
0DI0025261	Listen, asshole. I know you're not really an NCR health inspector, so you can cut the restaurant critic routine.
0DI0025262	And I want my fifty caps back, 'cause I looked it up and there ain't no disease called colorectal implosion syndrome.
0DI0025263	So I paid you to look the other way for nothing.
0DI0025264	Wait. Wait. You're not... oh wow, I'm sorry. You looked just like- never mind. Sorry. So... what can I serve you up?
0DI0025265	You again? What do need?
0DI0025266	Howdy, looking for chow?
0DI0025267	Hey hey, back for seconds, huh?
0DI0025268	Thanks for handling the Fiends. One less pack of dogs to hurt the troops.
0DI0025269	Remarkable work saving Kimball. Glad you were around to prevent his assassination.
0DI0025272	Do you require medical attention?
0DI0025273	If you're looking for a quick stitch, I'm your man.
0DI0025274	The store is currently unavailable due to unexpected circumstances. Please come back later.
0DI0025275	Welcome, sir or madam. Do you wish to purchase something?
0DI0025276	I don't handle buying and selling for the Gun Runners. Talk to the robot in the kiosk near our factory.
0DI0025278	If it's bad news, you can take it up with the Colonel. If it's good news, it better involve some dead Fiends.
0DI0025279	This isn't a public relations office. If you're not here about a bounty, you can go pester the Colonel.
0DI0025280	I see you're still alive, and that's promising. Any luck on that bounty?
0DI0025281	Got any more good news for me?
0DI0025282	Still working on that last bounty?
0DI0025283	Perimeter's been quiet since you left. The Fiends are running scared. I doubt they'll give us any more trouble, not for a long while.
0DI0025284	I haven't got any more bounties for you. It's been quiet and calm since you last reported in. Just how I like it.
0DI0025285	If you're looking for bounties, you're too late. Had a few Fiends on my shitlist, but they either got killed or moved on.
0DI0025286	I hear you killed Driver Nephi. My team would've liked to get a shot at him... but we're still glad he's dead.
0DI0025287	I'm Lieutenant Gorobets, First Recon. If you're looking to collect a bounty, you should talk to Major Dhatri.
0DI0025288	You came through for us. I have to admit... I wasn't sure you'd make it.
0DI0025289	Means a lot, letting my team get payback. Here. We all pitched in some caps for you. Even Sterling, and he's famous for his tight wallet.
0DI0025290	We'll get ourselves into position. See you at the rock crushing plant.
0DI0025291	We're all set up. You just lure Nephi close.
0DI0025292	It's always hard to lose someone under your command. I hate writing the letter to their folks.
0DI0025294	Hey, my man! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
0DI0025295	Hey there, miss! T-t-ten of spades. First Recon sharpshooter. At your s-s-service.
0DI0025296	Can't b-b-believe Betsy's gone. S-s-she was a bitch, b-but she was my p-p-partner, you know?
0DI0025297	S-s-sucks about the LT. N-n-nobody can replace him.
0DI0025298	How 'bout you get out of my f-f-face? I'm First Recon. I don't need to t-take shit from civvies.
0DI0025299	K-killing some Fiendsi? Shit, yeah! It's about t-t-time!
0DI0025300	One shot, one kill. That's how Ten of Spades p-p-plays the game.
0DI0025301	Shit. I didn't even get a shot at that Nephi b-b-bastard before he went down.
0DI0025302	Right here, Fiends! This is what payback looks like! First Recon, hooah!
0DI0025303	'B-b-bout time Cook-Cook g-g-g-got what was c-coming to him.
0DI0025304	You remember me, right? T-t-ten of Spades. First Recon.
0DI0025305	Girl... you are some grade-A poon, anybody ever tell you that?
0DI0025306	You keep talking to me, sweetness, and people are gonna think we're an item. Not that I mind.
0DI0025307	Never seen you around before. What do you want?
0DI0025308	Cut the chatter. Focus on the job, or you're gonna end up dead.
0DI0025309	Quit talking! We've got a job to do.
0DI0025310	You did good out there. Glad you let me get a piece of Nephi.
0DI0025311	What a pointless trip. Here I thought I'd get a shot at that junkie bastard.
0DI0025312	Damn that 10 of Spades. Just had to go and get himself killed.
0DI0025313	Gorobets was all right - for a man. Not gonna be the same without him.
0DI0025314	I've been seeing Usanagi, and things are better. I'm not so angry all the time, you know? And, uh, I'm not trying to jump every woman in camp.
0DI0025315	Well, not all the time, anyway,
0DI0025317	Hey, girl. You need something from me?
0DI0025320	Howdy. Name's Sterling, First Recon. Can't say I've seen you before. I'd remember, if I had.
0DI0025321	Took some skill to bring down that Fiend. You done good.
0DI0025322	Nothing like a job done right. Wish I had a cigar.
0DI0025323	Been a while since they let us out of the fence. Brass must really want Nephi dead.
0DI0025324	Best you don't worry about us. We'll watch your back.
0DI0025325	It's always hard when your commander goes down, but we'll pull through all right.
0DI0025326	Howdy. What brings you back?
0DI0025327	I'm Bitter-Root. First Recon. You got a reason to talk to me?
0DI0025328	Can't talk now. Got to keep my eyes sharp.
0DI0025329	Eyes sharp, now.
0DI0025330	Wish I'd gotten a bullet in that Fiend...
0DI0025331	That's one less drugged-out waster. Best part of this job - shooting folks who deserve it.
0DI0025332	I've never lost a CO before. It doesn't feel right.
0DI0025333	Didn't think you'd be back. What's this about?
0DI0025334	Let me guess. You got work for me, right?
0DI0025335	Well, you're too late - I just quit the bounty trade. Soon as I pick up some caps that Dhatri owes me, I'm out of this scrapyard.
0DI0025336	Heard you got Cook-Cook. I hope you roasted that bastard with his own flamer.
0DI0025337	Yep, I'm still here. Shit, I got nothing better to do, right?
0DI0025338	Leave me out of your fight!
0DI0025339	Welcome to the Casa Madrid. If you got an itch needs scratching, you came to the right place. Just watch how you treat the merchandise.
0DI0025340	Welcome to the Casa - so long as you didn't come here to sell that scrawny ass of yours around here.
0DI0025341	I'm not hiring new girls - all slots filled, you could say - and my arrangements with Marco are exclusive.
0DI0025342	I don't know what went on between you and Anderson, but leave me out of it.
0DI0025343	It's good you told me about Dermot and Saint James. It was killing that needed doing.
0DI0025344	You think you see the worst of what people can do to each other, and then there's always something else to top it.
0DI0025345	I'm going to assume you had reason to kill Dermot and his pet. Always had a bad feeling about them. But everyone else here is hands-off.
0DI0025346	You can just talk to the whores, you know. You and me don't need to talk unless there's trouble.
0DI0025347	What do you need this time?
0DI0025348	Hey, don't drag me into this!
0DI0025349	Hey, mister, looking to relax? Looks like you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders... and upper thighs.
0DI0025350	Sorry, ma'am, but my services are "members only," all right? You might try Sweetie.
0DI0025351	That situation with Dermot and Saint James must've been stressful. Looking to relax?
0DI0025352	Glad you came back. You wanna get together with me?
0DI0025353	Still wasting your time in this pit, honey?
0DI0025354	Fuck off! I ain't helping you!
0DI0025355	I got nothing you need. If it's ass you're looking for, talk to Pretty Sarah.
0DI0025356	I said fuck off.
0DI0025357	Yeah! Fight! Fight!
0DI0025358	Why you talking to me, man? I'm trying to relax here, got it?
0DI0025359	When I talk to a girl, I start the conversation! And I didn't start no conversation with you.
0DI0025360	We got to go through this again? What's it about this time?
0DI0025361	Oh my! Keep me out of this!
0DI0025362	Hello, stranger. You looking for a good time?
0DI0025363	Don't see many or your kind here in the Casa. Women, I mean - who ain't working.
0DI0025364	Always knew there was something wrong with Dermot and Saint James. Neither one ever got busy between my legs!
0DI0025365	Been enjoying your time at the Casa?
0DI0025367	Hey, honey. Looking for something softer than a man can give you?
0DI0025368	Hey, baby. What say you and me get acquainted?
0DI0025369	Dermot being dead I don't care about, but Saint James was regular income. Maybe you could throw some business my way?
0DI0025370	Hi again. You here to play?
0DI0025371	You look busy. Talk to me later.
0DI0025372	Welcome to the Casa Madrid - cheapest, cleanest whores in all New Vegas. If you want to know the rates for poon, talk to the whores.
0DI0025373	Thanks a lot. I'm out Dermot and St. James's rent - and they paid regular - and once they get to stinking I'll have to clean up the mess, too!
0DI0025375	I'm not getting sucked into your fight, friend.
0DI0025376	Tom Anderson. Can I help you?
0DI0025377	Good to see you again.
0DI0025378	Dammit, I didn't want you to kill him, just find me some evidence!
0DI0025380	The Legion being wiped out at Nelson gave us some breathing room - hopefully the brass will use that.
0DI0025381	Losing Forlorn Hope was a real blow to us - I hope things can be turned around soon.
0DI0025382	Hell of a thing at Nelson - NCR and the Legion wiped out. I wonder what the hell happened.
0DI0025383	I just got word that the monorail from McCarran was blown up by terrorists. My God. I can't believe it.
0DI0025384	Word around the east side is that you took out some major players in the Fiends. That should make life safer for a lot of people.
0DI0025385	Have you heard the news? Caesar's agents assassinated President Kimball - it'll be war for sure, now.
0DI0025386	I'm sure every NCR soldier you've met has said this, but you're a damn hero for saving the President. If there's anything you need, let me know.
0DI0025387	Something I can help you with, stranger?
0DI0025388	Thanks for all your help earlier.
0DI0025389	Have you found out what happened to those missing refugees?
0DI0025390	Good to see you - something else I can do for you?
0DI0025391	Maybe you should just move along, I don't need your kind of trouble.
0DI0025392	Look, I don't have the manpower to run your ass out on a rail, so just do me a favor and get lost.
0DI0025393	Back again? What can I do for you?
0DI0025394	You're back. Have you changed your mind about helping out?
0DI0025395	Hey there - fancy a game of Caravan?
0DI0025397	Thank you for your kindness, stranger.
0DI0025398	Oh. Hello. What can I do for you?
0DI0025399	Have you found my family yet?
0DI0025400	I've heard through the locals that Nephi has passed on. I truly hope his soul finds peace.
0DI0025401	Welcome, brother! How can I help you?
0DI0025402	Welcome, sister! How can I help you?
0DI0025403	Is there something else I can do for you?
0DI0025404	They never told us how expensive it was to get onto the Strip!
0DI0025405	I never should have left California.
0DI0025406	That son of a bitch Keith cheated me! I know he did!
0DI0025407	You lose all your money too?
0DI0025408	Hey, you got a hit for me?
0DI0025409	Don't you be touching Keith's stuff!
0DI0025410	Keith takes good care of us. Good care....
0DI0025411	Here to meet with the brass?
0DI0025412	You oughtta think about enlisting. We need you here.
0DI0025413	Lot of folks at McCarran really appreciate what you've done.
0DI0025414	Hope you like it here at McCarran.
0DI0025415	Make yourself at home here. It's cozy... for an airport.
0DI0025416	Checking in with the base, huh?
0DI0025417	I can't believe it's over. I figured the Dam would fall and this place would be our last stand.
0DI0025418	Fight's gonna break out at the Dam any time now. Feels strange not being there for it.
0DI0025419	The cavalry's finally here. God bless the boys in black.
0DI0025420	Word is, our Ranger vets are finally coming up from Baja. The Legion should be pissing their togas.
0DI0025421	First Recon is holding Forlorn Hope now. What I wouldn't give for sniper support here.
0DI0025422	With both Nelson and Camp Forlorn Hope gone, you have to wonder when McCarran's gonna get attacked.
0DI0025423	I've always known Camp Forlorn Hope was a death sentence. I just wish I'd been wrong.
0DI0025424	They're saying we retook Nelson. Finally some good news.
0DI0025425	Brotherhood's been quiet lately. Guess they finally realized Rangers beat power armor every time.
0DI0025426	Heard the Kings have turned over a new leaf. Doesn't mean you'll see me in Freeside any time soon.
0DI0025427	I've been seeing a lot of dead Fiends lately. Damn psychos had it coming.
0DI0025428	Are you the one that killed Motor-Runner? Thank God. That guy was a living nightmare.
0DI0025429	Bad time to lose Chief Hanlon. He'd have had Caesar running scared.
0DI0025430	The most important POW we've ever taken and he gets away. He must've had help.
0DI0025431	How could we fail to protect our own monorail?
0DI0025432	Caesar's dead. So when do we go home?
0DI0025433	Hello. I'm Rose of Sharon Cassidy.
0DI0025434	Welcome, child! Took your sweet time getting here, didn't you?
0DI0025435	I've been waiting a good five years for an outsider to come along and visit!
0DI0025436	How is your visit with us going, stranger?
0DI0025437	You have done well to earn the trust of my people, child.
0DI0025438	Hello, friend. How can Mother Pearl be of help today?
0DI0025439	So you're the outsider. Lived your whole life out there, huh? Wow.
0DI0025440	I always thought you savages probably spoke a different language, but I hear you sound like us.
0DI0025441	Thank you for getting Janet to Nellis. I've never been so happy in my entire life!
0DI0025442	This has been a dream come true to work on the Lady. I don't think I've seen Loyal this frisky in years.
0DI0025443	I've never been so happy in my entire life!
0DI0025444	Have you seen her? The redhead of my dreams?
0DI0025445	Hi! I can't believe I'm going to meet my red-headed lady soon! I'm really nervous about it!
0DI0025446	Go to hell, outsider. Stay away from me.
0DI0025447	You're a terrible person! I loved her! And you let her run right into our killzone. Why didn't you stop her?
0DI0025448	Hey there. Back for more?
0DI0025449	Whoa there, pal. You better slow down, or you'll get blown up like the rest of the idiots who thought they'd scavenge in Boomer territory.
0DI0025450	Now that I've got your attention, might you be interested in a little information? It'll cost you, but it's well worth the investment.
0DI0025451	Welcome back. Have you reconsidered my offer?
0DI0025452	I told you what you need to know. Now get moving!
0DI0025453	Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! You're the first one to make it through alive, let alone manage a return trip!
0DI0025454	That was pretty incredible. I've never seen anyone come out of the Boomer's rain of death alive before.
0DI0025455	Hey there lady! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
0DI0025456	Hey there mister! Can you help me find Mister Cuddles?
0DI0025457	Hi again! Have you found Mister Cuddles?
0DI0025458	Thanks again for finding Mister Cuddles! You're the best!
0DI0025459	I can't believe Mister Cuddles is gone.
0DI0025460	Pearl sent word saying it's all right to tell you about the Lady in the water.
0DI0025461	Isn't that bomber a beauty? Thanks so much for making an old man's dreams come true.
0DI0025462	It's going to be a dream come true once you've raised that bomber from Lake Mead!
0DI0025463	Good work with those solar arrays.
0DI0025464	I hope Pearl knows what she's doing, letting you wander around Nellis as you please.
0DI0025466	Hello, Outsider, need something?
0DI0025467	I'll take this from here!
0DI0025468	I'm Raquel, Master-At-Arms for the Nellis homeland. Mother Pearl, our Eldest, wishes to speak to you.
0DI0025469	Hello, friend.
0DI0025470	Mother Pearl's instructions are clear. You can move freely around Nellis, and artillery spotters have orders not to fire on you.
0DI0025471	These are extraordinary privileges. Don't abuse them.
0DI0025472	What is it, savage?
0DI0025473	What's the situation with the giant ants?
0DI0025474	I see the power's back on. The ants are all dead?
0DI0025476	I know Mother Pearl is letting you wander Nellis as you please, Outsider, but I have patients to tend to.
0DI0025477	If I haven't said it before, Outsider, let me say it now - welcome to Nellis. Word from Pearl is that you're to be greeted as a friend.
0DI0025478	You raised the Lady from the Lake! The future is looking up. How can I help you, Outsider?
0DI0025480	Woah! You're the outsider! What are you doing here?
0DI0025481	Hey! Do they have any toys outside of here? I sure could use something fun.
0DI0025482	Roar! I'm a dinosaur!
0DI0025483	This is mission control, ready for liftoff. What's your 5 by 5?
0DI0025484	Halt! You must pay the toll to pass!
0DI0025485	Put up your dukes! I'm the Red-Brick Kid!
0DI0025486	I am La Fantoma! I will fly to the side of injustice!
0DI0025487	You're back. When you walked off in the middle of our people's story, I thought you must be bored.
0DI0025488	You killed Mother Pearl! Get out of here, outsider!
0DI0025489	You killed Loyal! Get out of here, outsider!
0DI0025490	You're the outsider! Mother Pearl sent word that you'd be stopping by. You must be eager to hear the story of our people!
0DI0025491	I heard about what you've done around here, and I have nothing to say to you, outsider.
0DI0025492	People around here are a bit upset with you, outsider, but I think there is hope for you yet.
0DI0025493	I've seen the bomber! It's... spectacular. The mural is coming true - thanks to you!
0DI0025494	Were you interested in hearing the story of our people any time soon, perhaps?
0DI0025495	Now that you know the story of our people, you must have all sorts of questions!
0DI0025497	Hold it right there! Don't you move!
0DI0025498	How the hell did you survive that bombardment?
0DI0025499	I still can't believe how you ran through that artillery barrage.
0DI0025501	You're interrupting class, Outsider.
0DI0025503	Hungry for grub?
0DI0025504	Well howdy.
0DI0025505	We've got people to kill. Keep an eye out.
0DI0025506	Never thought I'd ever have my own town, but thanks to you, now I do. If you wanna make some caps, head on over to the Correctional Facility.
0DI0025507	Just tell them I sent you and you should get in without a problem. Keep a close eye on some of those bastards, though.
0DI0025508	Oh, not all Powder Gangers out there are friends of mine - like the group in Primm. They'll be gunning for you no matter what, so keep that in mind.
0DI0025509	My gang's here, but we'll still need a plan before we rush the town. I don't want to embarrass myself and get beat by a bunch of townies.
0DI0025511	I also thought it might be a good thing to jimmy the lock on the Bighorner pen. The noise from the fight will spook them, get them running wild.
0DI0025513	We ready to move or what?
0DI0025517	Are you trying to get my saloon shot up? Finish what you started!
0DI0025518	Keep an eye out. This isn't finished yet.
0DI0025519	Well, you've been causing quite a stir. Glad I finally got to meet you. Welcome to the Prospector Saloon.
0DI0025520	So, you're planning on taking on Joe Cobb's gang. It's a big risk, but I suppose you have to do what you think is right.
0DI0025521	I hope you didn't just bring a heap of trouble down on Goodsprings by killing Joe Cobb like that.
0DI0025522	His friends might come looking for him, and I don't think they're going to care who was involved in his death or not.
0DI0025523	Well, what's done is done. So, uh, what can I do for you?
0DI0025524	I'm glad that business is over. I like it when Goodsprings is nice and quiet.
0DI0025525	Feeling thirsty? I can take care of that.
0DI0025526	Cant' do business now! There's a gunfight!
0DI0025527	You must be the one Doc Mitchell was patching up. The way I heard it, I didn't think you'd be walking out of that office.
0DI0025528	I've got plenty of supplies for sale. Even got some weapon mods and special ammo - well worth the caps, if you ask me.
0DI0025529	If you're hurting for caps, I've also got boxes of surplus ammo in the miscellaneous section. They're not great, but you get what you pay for.
0DI0025530	That was a hell of a fight. Let's hope it doesn't bite us in the ass later on.
0DI0025531	I won't make any trouble for the gang. Just let me keep my store and I'll cut you a little discount.
0DI0025532	You looking to buy some supplies?
0DI0025533	I heard about what's been going on in town. Our deal's off. I can't trust someone like you to watch my back.
0DI0025534	Keep an eye out. I still think there's a few out there.
0DI0025535	That's close enough. Who are you, and what do you want with me?
0DI0025536	I owe you a huge favor for this. Here - these are technically Crimson Caravan funds, but I know they'll understand once I explain things.
0DI0025537	Thanks again for all your help.
0DI0025538	What's the plan? Are we ready?
0DI0025539	So, what's going on? Did Sunny agree to help us?
0DI0025541	That ought to keep things settled for awhile. Hope it stays that way.
0DI0025542	Howdy. What can Easy Pete do for you?
0DI0025544	We can talk after this is over!
0DI0025545	Those bastards got Ringo in the end, after all. At least he went down fighting.
0DI0025546	That'll teach the Powder Gangs to avoid Goodsprings in the future.
0DI0025547	Time to look alive. The Powder Gangers are here to play.
0DI0025548	I'll keep an eye out for the Powder Gangers and meet up with you and Ringo when the time comes.
0DI0025549	I don't think Joe Cobb knew what hit him. I'm hoping you took him down for a good reason and not... for fun.
0DI0025550	Cheyenne, stay. Don't worry, she won't bite unless I tell her to.
0DI0025551	Hi there. Sticking around Goodsprings for awhile longer?
0DI0025552	I expect you'll be wanting to go outside after being cooped up for so long, but if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.
0DI0025553	Welcome back. I had hoped you wouldn't need to come see me again so soon. What can I do for you?
0DI0025554	How're you holding up?
0DI0025555	Howdy, pardner! Might I say, you're looking fit as a fiddle.
0DI0025556	Howdy, pardner! So, when do the rustlers show up?
0DI0025558	Holy moly! If you hadn't come here like you done, I'd be a goner for sure.
0DI0025559	I came up here to draw water, but here, you should have what I got. You look thirsty.
0DI0025562	Hell of a thing about Chief Hanlon. I never would have guessed he was capable of it.
0DI0025563	I've been hearing some rumors from the Embassy that Mr. House has gone quiet all of a sudden. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
0DI0025564	Nice work dealing with Caesar. That'll make holding the Mojave a lot easier.
0DI0025565	Have you seen these elite rangers they sent us from California? God damn those boys are gonna kick some ass!
0DI0025566	Nice work with that assassination attempt! If my troops were half as dedicated as you, we'd win the war in a week!
0DI0025567	Looks like the President's security detail was too good for you, huh, shitbird?
0DI0025568	You oughta die for what you did.
0DI0025569	Not like I even voted for him, but losing the President's a hell of a morale killer.
0DI0025570	I just got word that 1st Recon is being mobilized to Nelson. God forbid we get any reinforcements here, right?
0DI0025571	Seems the Misfits scored pretty well on their readiness evaluations. That strikes me as... suspicious.
0DI0025572	I gotta admit, I'm impressed. The Misfits are drilling better than I ever expected.
0DI0025573	I'm not sure what's going on with the Misfits - their accuracy is in the toilet, but they're spoiling for a fight like I ain't never seen.
0DI0025574	Well, their test scores are only marginally improved, but I'm hearing good things about the Misfits' teamwork.
0DI0025575	Ah, hell, what is it now?
0DI0025577	You here to help, or just dick around all day?
0DI0025578	Hot damn, look who it is!
0DI0025579	Oh, great, like I don't have enough problems!
0DI0025581	What the hell do you want, you vicious son of a bitch?
0DI0025582	What the hell do you want, you vicious bitch?
0DI0025583	So you're back. What else do you want?
0DI0025584	Okay, everybody's lined up and ready to go. Any suggestions?
0DI0025585	Okay, we've got our dummy grenades and the course is live. We're all set.
0DI0025586	The squad really seems to be working together better. It's nice, for a change.
0DI0025587	What the hell happened with these readiness reports? These scores are way too high!
0DI0025588	Thanks to your help, I feel like we can take on the world!
0DI0025589	I don't know what Razz gave us, but holy shit this is great! I feel like I could kill an entire legion! With my teeth!
0DI0025590	Haven't seen you around before, soldier.
0DI0025591	Not very often we see civilians on-base. What's you're story?
0DI0025592	I heard Chief Hanlon committed suicide. That's just... hard to believe. Do you know anything about it?
0DI0025593	I hear Caesar's dead, and we've got you to thank for it. Nice work.
0DI0025594	I hear Caesar's dead. Maybe that means the war will be over soon.
0DI0025595	I've got a friend stationed at McCarran - I heard something about a monorail explosion there. I hope he's okay.
0DI0025596	Radio says you stopped the President's assassin cold. Not bad.
0DI0025597	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after that assassination attempt.
0DI0025598	You're lucky you haven't been shot walking in here after you killed the president.
0DI0025599	Hell of a battle at Nelson. I'm impressed our troops survived.
0DI0025600	Everybody's been really nervous since President Kimball died. I don't know what's going to happen.
0DI0025601	Hell of a battle at Forlorn Hope. I hope the brass can do something for the troopers' families.
0DI0025602	There's some weird chatter on the radio saying something wiped out Nelson and Forlorn Hope. That's pretty scary.
0DI0025603	I'm not supposed to know this, but I hear they're dispatching elite ranger units from California to deal with the Legion.
0DI0025604	So now the word is Caesar's calling in his elite troops from Arizona. I don't think we're going to catch a break any time soon.
0DI0025605	A bunch of units just got mobilized to Hoover Dam. This is the big one, isn't it?
0DI0025606	Glad to see you haven't gotten yourself killed yet.
0DI0025607	Man, the brass is going to be thrilled that you're here.
0DI0025608	Friendly warning, you might want to steer clear of NCR facilities. You're not exactly popular.
0DI0025609	Wow, the big celebrity down here with the common troopers. What can I do for you?
0DI0025610	You're not going to do anything crazy, are you? It's just, you know... the paperwork....
0DI0025611	How'd you get in here without getting shot?
0DI0025612	Hey again.
0DI0025613	It sure is nice to see everybody working together like family. Maybe now the baby Jesus won't cry his self to sleep every night.
0DI0025614	Shooting guns is real scary, but I think I got the hang of it now!
0DI0025615	Razz said the candy he got us was special! I wonder what he- Gnaaah, kill, kill, rip and kill! -meant by that?
0DI0025616	Poindexter says all our troubles is over now, and we won't have to go to war. I guess that's good, but I don't understand why.
0DI0025617	Is it true? The big boss ranger done killed his self?
0DI0025618	Howdy, great to see you!
0DI0025619	Y'all sure are a big ol' hero. I gotta wright my mama and tell her I met you!
0DI0025620	Uh, howdy. Are you gonna be mean or nice this time?
0DI0025621	You scare and confuse me, and I think you should be nicer to people.
0DI0025622	Go away, you big bully!
0DI0025623	Ahhh! Somebody call in the Rangers!
0DI0025625	While I have already internalized the new skills we have discussed, I feel as though my solution was nevertheless more practical.
0DI0025626	Excellent! Maximal reward for minimal work.
0DI0025627	I trust you're satisfied with the squad's newfound teamwork? It's almost entirely my own doing, I assure you.
0DI0025628	Ever since consuming those "illicit rations" Razz offered us, I have felt a steadily-increasing desire to kill.
0DI0025629	I understand the esteemed Chief Hanlon is no longer with us. A shame. He seemed to be the only competent leadership this Army had.
0DI0025630	I'm assuming you aren't associated with the Army or the Rangers. What can I do for you?
0DI0025631	You've done an excelent job ingratiating yourself to the top brass. I assume this is some sort of strategem?
0DI0025632	You've managed to become extraordinarily well-liked by the top brass. You should exploit that for your own gain wherever possible.
0DI0025633	Your behavior has become an unwelcome X-factor, and I would kindly ask you to consider altering it.
0DI0025634	I'm afraid I have no desire to socialize with unstable elements such as yourself.
0DI0025635	I must question your logic in coming here, in light of your prior actions.
0DI0025636	Kindly remove yourself, as I have no desire to be struck by a stray round when disgruntled troopers begin firing on you.
0DI0025637	Greetings once again.
0DI0025638	Okay, okay, I admit it - knowing how to use these guns right is pretty cool.
0DI0025639	Sweet, those "readiness reports" are so good they actually gave me a raise!
0DI0025640	I thought all that touchy-feely teamwork bullshit was kind of fruity... but it kinda feels good knowing my squad's got my back.
0DI0025641	Ha ha, fuck me, Jack's shit is still the best!
0DI0025642	Heard Chief Hanlon took the lead expressway to Angel-town. Weird shit, yo.
0DI0025643	What you want, homes?
0DI0025644	Aw, shit, here comes the brown-noser. What you want?
0DI0025645	Shit, look who it is, the crazy one! What up?
0DI0025646	Every time you come around, the brass gets their pants in a bunch. Keep on coming by.
0DI0025647	Shit, you just piss folks off wherever you go, huh?
0DI0025648	I know I talk a lot of shit about the army, but you come around here again and I'll slit you.
0DI0025650	Something I can do you for?
0DI0025651	I suppose I can help you out. What do you want?
0DI0025652	I'm not really comfortable having you in here, so make it quick.
0DI0025653	Hey, friend. Need something?
0DI0025654	Glad to see you! Need a patch-job?
0DI0025655	I think you'd better get out of here.
0DI0025656	There are a half-dozen troopers in shouting distance. Best remember that before you try anything.
0DI0025657	I don't believe there's anything left for us to talk about.
0DI0025658	Go on. Go fetch a ranger and do this right.
0DI0025659	Sorting and manipulating intelligence is what I do. It's what rangers are supposed to do.
0DI0025660	This job isn't all gunfighting and gulping shots of whiskey, no matter what the boys and ladies out there say.
0DI0025661	I'm occupied at the moment. Come see me when I'm on the balcony.
0DI0025662	Back west, you don't see too many of these. Lakes, I mean. Natural or man-made. Any kind, really.
0DI0025663	We neglected the dams or pumped all the water out a long time ago. Owens, Isabella, the San Luis. Drained the aquifers of everything they had.
0DI0025664	Just a lot of mud and dust now. It's a different feeling, watching the sun come up over the water. Takes some getting used to.
0DI0025665	But if you're here long enough, it starts to seem normal. That's what a ranger's life is now. Looking east.
0DI0025666	You've come back to see the chief. Nice of you to humor the radio tender. What can I do for you?
0DI0025667	Like I said, I won't run out on you, but I can't let my people get dragged through the mud for this.
0DI0025668	You did good and you did it well. Work a ranger would be proud of. I'll handle the rest from here.
0DI0025669	Hard to believe this place used to be a luxury resort, huh?
0DI0025670	Haven't had any reports from Station Charlie in a while - hope everything's okay.
0DI0025671	Don't tell the troopers, but the grub up here is way better than the mess tent.
0DI0025672	We can monitor ranger activity all through the region with the systems here.
0DI0025673	I just can't believe Chief Hanlon would do that.
0DI0025674	Jesus, the Chief's dead. Who's going to take over now?
0DI0025675	You should talk to Chief Hanlon if you have any questions. He's usually up on the balcony.
0DI0025676	Heard some more people got attacked last night.
0DI0025677	It doesn't matter if they restrict the water. We can get it elsewhere now.
0DI0025678	Heard some of the Locals were attacked recently. Serves 'em right!
0DI0025679	Some friends of mine were attacked the other night. Someone should do something.
0DI0025680	One of these days I'll say up enough to get out of here. One of these days...
0DI0025681	A guy I know said there's some kind of cannibal army camped out to the east.
0DI0025682	Watch yourself if you go into one of them casinos, or you'll be stuck here like the rest of us in no time.
0DI0025683	The NCR should just take this place over. Their army's big enough.
0DI0025684	The Kings say they're keeping the peace, but this place is as violent as ever.
0DI0025685	Did you go over by the train station last night? Bless those people.
0DI0025686	It's almost time to head down to the train station. It's all I look forward to anymore.
0DI0025687	Hey stranger, if you're hungry, there's a man around here somewhere telling people where to get free food and water.
0DI0025688	You going over to the station tonight, too?
0DI0025689	Need some grub? I got you covered. Cheap and filling.
0DI0025690	Hey buddy, spare a cap? I can make it worth your while.
0DI0025691	This man's prices are steep, but I hear he's worth it.
0DI0025692	Thanks, mister!
0DI0025693	Thanks, lady!
0DI0025694	I wish he'd quit running.
0DI0025695	He's kinda cute, isn't he?
0DI0025696	We're gonna have rat tonight!
0DI0025697	Hey pal, spare a cap?
0DI0025698	Ah, my favorite customer. Got a cap for me?
0DI0025699	You could do worse than leave your life in my hands, wanderer. Far worse.
0DI0025700	A hundred caps sees you safely through Freeside. What do you say?
0DI0025701	You're in luck stranger. You just happen to be talking to the most successful bodyguard in all of Freeside.
0DI0025702	And I just happen to be available at the moment. One hundred caps gets you a peaceful, pleasant trip through our fair district. Guaranteed.
0DI0025703	Hello, my friend! Can I perhaps interest you in some protection? My services come cheap at only a hundred caps.
0DI0025704	Look, I'm being paid to shoot people who talk to you, not talk to you myself. Just pretend I'm not here or something.
0DI0025705	Freeside truly is an interesting place, isn't it?
0DI0025706	I am sorry, my friend, but I must concentrate on watching out for threats. Please do not take offense.
0DI0025707	Something you need, kid?
0DI0025708	Heh, so the Garrets sent you to track me down? What a joke.
0DI0025709	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler. What can I get you?
0DI0025710	Welcome to the Atomic Wrangler.
0DI0025711	Hey man, can you spare a few caps?
0DI0025712	How are you today? Santiago is fabulous!
0DI0025713	Ah... I wasn't expecting you to return.
0DI0025714	Santiago has nothing left to give. Leave me now.
0DI0025715	Santiago thanks you for getting him this job.
0DI0025716	Hello. Lovely to meet you.
0DI0025717	I have nothing more to give. Leave me be.
0DI0025718	Are you here to drop off medical supplies? Leave them with the rest in the middle of the courtyard.
0DI0025719	Looking for a fix, man? I got what you need.
0DI0025720	You seen Dixon around? He said he'd be back today.
0DI0025721	Come on, man. I'm dying here.
0DI0025722	Do you have chems, buddy? I could really use a fix.
0DI0025723	So you're back. Got any chems for me yet?
0DI0025725	Not bad. You're lucky I was drawing their fire, otherwise you would have been chewed up.
0DI0025726	I sent one of my guys back to the King to report what happened. You should head back. He'll probably want to thank you.
0DI0025727	The King just sent a messenger over, saying these guys are off-limits. He's probably already heard about what you did here.
0DI0025728	Looks like you get to be a hero. Enjoy it while it lasts.
0DI0025729	Why the hell are you here? I got this under control!
0DI0025730	Why are you talking to me? Smoke these guys already!
0DI0025731	Good, you're here. These soldier boys don't kid around. They must have had a lookout posted and spotted us coming.
0DI0025732	They took out two of my guys right away, and now the rest are too scared to move in. That leaves you.
0DI0025733	What do we have here? Another petitioner for the King?
0DI0025734	Look who's back. If you want to see the King, you better pay up.
0DI0025735	Go on. The King's a busy man. Be grateful for this opportunity.
0DI0025736	I've got my eye on you. You cross the Kings, you'll regret it.
0DI0025737	Look, Rexie, someone new's come to see us. Poor boy. He hasn't been feeling well lately. I'm the King. What can I do for you?
0DI0025738	That's strange, I don't see ol' Rexie with you. He usually comes back here whenever he's not with you. Where'd he get to?
0DI0025739	Why Rexie, you look all better, boy! Good as new! Did my Rexie get a new brain?
0DI0025740	I sure appreciate you coming back. You think a little more about my offer?
0DI0025741	I... I can't believe Pace is gone... He was always right here, you know? Always cracking me up with some story or another.
0DI0025742	Anyway, what did you want?
0DI0025743	I heard someone got to my friends who were injured. Looks like we'll never find out who did it now.
0DI0025744	Did you want something? I'm all kinda shook up right now.
0DI0025745	My eyes on the street tell me you haven't paid our mutual friend Orris a visit yet. Until you do, we got nothing to talk about.
0DI0025746	What do you have for me?
0DI0025748	Have you found anything out? Or were you just here to chat?
0DI0025749	You find out somethin' about them soldier boys yet?
0DI0025750	I've already heard all about what happened, and all I can say is that I, and all of Freeside, thank you. Thank you very much.
0DI0025751	I heard all about what happened. Maybe it's time for a little more talkin' and a little less fightin'.
0DI0025752	Things have been lots better since you helped with with those soldier boys. Thanks again. So what can I do for you?
0DI0025753	What can the King do for you?
0DI0025754	Leave me alone. Can't you see a man's fighting for his life here?
0DI0025755	What is it? Can't you see I want to be left alone with my friend here?
0DI0025756	Tell the King we thank him for looking out for us.
0DI0025757	I ain't got any reason to talk to you. Scram.
0DI0025758	That true? Did the King really send you?
0DI0025759	Hope what I remembered helps.
0DI0025760	Hey, you helped out Bill Ronte so the Followers worked out a deal for you to drink free.
0DI0025761	The King controls the water pump. If you want water, you need to pay like everyone else.
0DI0025762	Guess we won't be doing this for much longer.
0DI0025763	The Major gave us all a talking-to. Guess she heard about some of the guys' "night missions."
0DI0025764	I've never seen the Major so angry before. She may look calm right now, but don't let her fool you.
0DI0025765	Hold up. What's the password?
0DI0025766	Let's try to keep the line moving, folks.
0DI0025767	Try to take only what you need.
0DI0025768	Submit to a credit check or present your passport before proceeding to the gate. Trespassers will be shot.
0DI0025769	Don't bother me right now. I've got to get back to see if any customers are waiting.
0DI0025770	Stay away from me, if you know what's good for you.
0DI0025771	Come on, let's get this over with.
0DI0025772	Don't distract me. I need to focus all my senses on keeping you safe.
0DI0025773	This gentleman and I were just settling on a price. I'm afraid you'll have to hire one of the others this time around.
0DI0025774	If you need to cross Freeside, no one will keep you safer than I will.
0DI0025775	I knew you'd be back. Ready to hire the best?
0DI0025776	Fully Integrated Security Technetronic Officer active and reporting for duty.
0DI0025777	Operation complete. Thank you for your business.
0DI0025778	Greetings. Fisto is programmed to please.
0DI0025780	Welcome to Mick & Ralph's. If you need guns, I'm your man.
0DI0025781	For general supplies and other services, see my partner Ralph.
0DI0025782	You might want to clean up your act. Some of the locals have been complaining.
0DI0025783	Ralph and I don't sell to people who treat our friends badly.
0DI0025784	I don't take kindly to deadbeats who treat my friends like trash. Get out of here.
0DI0025785	I wish I'd never gotten involved with the Omertas. All of this bloodshed...
0DI0025786	One of these days, those bastards will get what's coming to them. In the meantime, I'll be sure to be more careful with my sales.
0DI0025787	Anyway, is there anything I can get you?
0DI0025788	That was a real mess the Omertas were looking to create. Glad you could get all that sorted.
0DI0025789	May have cost me some business, but at least we avoided a shitstorm.
0DI0025790	Anything I can get you?
0DI0025791	All of the scumbags are coming out of the woodwork now that the Kings are keeping everyone in line.
0DI0025792	At least gun sales are better than ever. Now what can I get you?
0DI0025793	I'm not sure how to feel about the Kings and NCR sorting out their differences, but as long as business keeps up, I'm a happy man.
0DI0025794	Now what can I get you?
0DI0025795	People say Mr. House hasn't been heard from in a while. Good riddance.
0DI0025796	Now what can I do for you?
0DI0025797	I heard about some things you've done around town. Nice to know someone is helping out for a change.
0DI0025798	Welcome back, buddy! What can I get you?
0DI0025800	I don't deal with dirtbags. Take a walk.
0DI0025801	If you're looking for guns, talk to Mick. Otherwise, I've got a nice selection of general supplies and other services.
0DI0025802	Hey, thanks for getting Bill Ronte fixed up. I was really getting sick of paying for water.
0DI0025804	Man, Jacob's Absinthe is phenomenal stuff. I don't think I've slept this well in ages...
0DI0025805	If you haven't tried it yet, he's been supplying the Wrangler with the stuff. So, what can I get you?
0DI0025806	With the Kings gone, it may be a little hairier around here, but business is good.
0DI0025807	Anything in particular you're looking for?
0DI0025808	So, Ambassador Fancypants has graced us with his presence! I apologize if you're looking for Pre-War pipes and smoking jackets, I'm clean out.
0DI0025809	Playing debt collector for the Garrets, eh? I guess someone has to do their dirty work.
0DI0025810	Pimping ain't easy, eh? Maybe if you find some decent talent, I'll start visiting the Wrangler more often.
0DI0025811	How's it going, friend? Looking for anything special?
0DI0025812	And NCR wins? No, really, I'm shocked.
0DI0025813	I totally didn't expect the guys with advanced armor and seemingly unlimited ammunition to take down an army of machete-wielding ingrates.
0DI0025814	With Caesar's Legion in control of the dam, I think things are going to get much more difficult around here.
0DI0025815	That old coot, House, is going to make me rich! With all the new rules and regulations in New Vegas, I'll make a killing circumventing them!
0DI0025816	An independent Vegas... Never thought I'd see it.
0DI0025817	House may be gone, but the players remain the same. Business as usual, then.
0DI0025818	Hey, what can I get you?
0DI0025819	Heh heh heh heh heh. <Coughs>
0DI0025820	Wha-?
0DI0025821	Bang bang bang bang bang!
0DI0025822	Reach for the sky, lady.
0DI0025823	Reach for the sky, mister.
0DI0025824	I wish I had a gun.
0DI0025825	Max can't even hit me. He's so dumb.
0DI0025827	Hey pal, you dig my new hat? I've been making some good money lately, and figured I'd treat myself.
0DI0025828	Hey, I thought about what you said before, and picked up this sweet piece. You were right, I feel much safer.
0DI0025829	Hey, I'm sorry about being so dismissive about your suggestion before. I thought a lot about what you said.
0DI0025830	There've been times when just a little bit of money from a stranger would have made a huge difference to me, so I get where you're coming from.
0DI0025831	Maybe I could make that kind of difference for someone else... ah, who am I kidding?
0DI0025832	Hey, I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier, about saving up and leaving this dump. Do you really think it's possible?
0DI0025833	Look pal, I've been thinking. I know we got off to a bad start there, but let's put it behind us, okay?
0DI0025834	Hey pal, I made so much recently that I was able to afford this little number too. How do I look?
0DI0025835	You again. You want a tip, or you here to piss me off some more?
0DI0025836	Hey pal, you got the caps, I got the info. You do have the caps, right?
0DI0025837	Ah, my favorite customer returns. Want a tip?
0DI0025838	Well, look who it is. I was just thinking about you.
0DI0025839	I recently came across a piece of info that you just have to hear, and since you're my best customer, it's on the house. Interested?
0DI0025840	Hey, I've still got that super-hot tip for you, and it's still free. What do you say?
0DI0025841	Hey pal, I've finally saved up enough caps to leave this dump, so no tips today. Or ever, I guess, ha ha.
0DI0025842	A lot of these caps came from you, so I wanted to say thanks before I shove off. Meeting you really changed my life.
0DI0025843	Okay, pal, we're going to do this quick and easy. I know you're loaded down with caps, judging by how much you've already given me.
0DI0025844	So I thought I'd save us both some time and just take all the caps you have. Hand them over.
0DI0025845	Oh hey, didn't think I'd see you here. I decided to stop scrounging for caps and start making a difference.
0DI0025846	The Followers have been really great. There's always something that needs to be done, and everyone here treats me really well.
0DI0025847	Sorry if you stopped by my old spot looking for info. I've been so busy lately that I haven't heard anything.
0DI0025848	Anyway, feel free to stay as long as you like. I've got to get back to work.
0DI0025851	Welcome to Freeside. Try not to get killed.
0DI0025852	Kick back and relax! Everything is allowed in Freeside!
0DI0025853	The only rule in Freeside is don't mess with the Kings.
0DI0025854	Watch yourself around here.
0DI0025855	If you're heading to the Strip, just go through the gate there.
0DI0025856	Freeside is the Kings' turf. Remember that.
0DI0025857	Great, another one come in from the wastes. Like this place isn't crowded enough.
0DI0025859	Good evening! Are you looking for companionship, love?
0DI0025860	You look new to Freeside, so here's a little advice, friend. Don't go past the south gate greeter without talking to it first.
0DI0025862	Ah, you return to me a King yourself! It would be an honor for me to do your hair! That is why you are here, yes?
0DI0025863	Ah, I knew you'd be back. Ready for your entire life to change?
0DI0025864	You want your hair done, too? No, no, no. The Kings are many, and their hair must be *perfect*.
0DI0025865	When is the King coming back up here? I'm bored!
0DI0025866	The King is all that his name implies, and then some.
0DI0025867	The King promised to take us out tonight. I simply adore going to the Tops!
0DI0025868	All I do all day is read magazines. You'd be amazed what you can learn from them!
0DI0025869	I want to go to the Strip! We never get to go to Gomorrah anymore!
0DI0025870	You're not a King! Does the King know you're up here?
0DI0025871	You want to travel through Freeside with ease, you hire a King. We're everywhere, and no one messes with us.
0DI0025872	Your safety is practically guaranteed, for just 100 caps.
0DI0025873	Hey there, you want to cruise Freeside in style, you'd do worse than hire a King to tag along.  Only 100 caps.
0DI0025874	You wanted something?
0DI0025876	Well, I hate to support the damn NCR, but it looks like they're the only thing between us and mass slavery at the hands of the Legion.
0DI0025877	Here's to the slaughter of every last one of those brahmin-poking meatheads, Caesar's Legion.
0DI0025878	Doesn't look good, this build-up of forces between the NCR and Legion. Not good at all for business in the long run, if the Legion wins.
0DI0025879	I hear the Legion is camping out across the river. I hope they're not planning to attack, but those bloodthirsty molerats are never up to any good.
0DI0025880	Some guys were in here earlier saying you survived Benny's goon squad. That's one hell of a feat, bud. Have a drink on me.
0DI0025881	I hear Benny got force-fed a little slice of heaven. Man what I would have paid to see that loathesome little weasel eat it.
0DI0025882	So Benny went MIA, huh? I always figured him for a coward.
0DI0025883	You made a run on The Tops, eh? Admirable work, but don't try that crap in Freeside.
0DI0025884	I don't care how you get your work done, but keep you nose clean in Freeside.
0DI0025885	Here comes trouble. What can I do for you?
0DI0025886	I can see you appreciate the gray areas of life. Got anything in particular you're looking for?
0DI0025887	Welcome back, wild man. What can I do for you.
0DI0025888	Welcome back, wild woman. What can I do for you.
0DI0025889	Hey, chum. Welcome back.
0DI0025890	Welcome back, friend. What can I get you?
0DI0025891	People in Freeside are talking, bub. We don't serve punks. Change your attitude, or find another place to drink.
0DI0025892	I don't have all day. What do you need?
0DI0025893	You're a real piece of work, bub. You're lucky to be alive with your rep around here.
0DI0025895	Welcome back. What can I get you?
0DI0025896	I heard about your run on The Tops. Don't even think about trying that crap here.
0DI0025897	So Benny's dead, huh? That shifty son of a bitch had it coming.
0DI0025898	I hear Benny went missing. I can't help but wonder what happened to him.
0DI0025899	I heard Benny sent his goons after you. You're one hell of a survivor to make it out of The Tops alive.
0DI0025900	So it turns out the Omertas were into some serious shit. I always suspected that crew was dirty.
0DI0025901	Some gamblers came in saying they'd seen you enter the Lucky 38. I have to say I'm impressed.
0DI0025902	I don't know of any other living person who's been in there.
0DI0025903	People are saying the Securitrons are acting funny. I hope that old Geezer, House, is dead. Might give the locals a chance to take control.
0DI0025904	Here's one on the house for taking down Caesar. Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
0DI0025905	You hear? Caesar finally kicked the bucket! Serves him right for treating women like livestock.
0DI0025906	Damn monorail bombing. I suppose this means we'll be seeing more NCR chumps wandering through Freeside.
0DI0025907	Hate to say it, but business has improved since the troopers started coming through Freeside to get to Vegas.
0DI0025908	I hear you've been making a name for yourself on The Strip. Don't forget about the Wrangler if you make it big.
0DI0025909	People are getting nervous about the Legion amassing on the other side of the river. I hope the NCR can hold agains another attack.
0DI0025910	This build-up on both sides of the dam isn't good. If the Legion attacks and wins, it won't be long before we're all slaves.
0DI0025911	God-damned Legion is raring for a fight. No matter who wins, a lot of people are going to die in the process, and dead men don't drink.
0DI0025912	You can order whatever you want, as long as it's alcoholic.
0DI0025913	So the wild one returns! What can I get you?
0DI0025914	I hear you've been helping out around town. It's much appreciated, friend.
0DI0025915	What can I get you, friend?
0DI0025916	You've done a lot for Freeside and it is much appreciated. Here's one on the house.
0DI0025917	Good to see you! What can I get you, friend?
0DI0025918	Watch yourself, friend. We don't serve those who treat our friends badly. Shape up, or ship out.
0DI0025923	Emily says you're working with her on bugging the Lucky 38. That information would be invaluable to our research if you can get it done.
0DI0025924	Hey, I heard about the bug getting destroyed in the Lucky 38. We'll get in there eventually. It's just a matter of time.
0DI0025925	One of my aides said you got into the Lucky 38. If you see someone by the name of Emily near there, we would like you to work for us.
0DI0025926	I've heard a few patients mention the Securitrons are acting strangely and no one has heard from Mr. House in a while.
0DI0025927	If House is out of the picture, maybe we'll be able to get our hands on some of his technology. It would help our scientists greatly.
0DI0025928	So the great Caesar is dead. Happy news, but I don't know that it'll make things safer. The rest of his goons may be even worse once they take power.
0DI0025929	Smoke rising from the east spells trouble. I hope the Legion isn't on the move.
0DI0025930	I sincerely hope the NCR are getting supplies in place to defend against an attack, because it looks like the Legion has plans for the dam again.
0DI0025931	If things don't go well at the dam, all of our efforts here could be for nothing. I hope to God the Legion doesn't win control.
0DI0025932	Is there something you need?
0DI0025933	Hi, do you need assistance?
0DI0025937	Have you ever considered getting your head checked?
0DI0025938	I'm pretty busy, is there something you need?
0DI0025939	Make it quick, I'm a busy woman.
0DI0025940	We don't specialize in psychiatry in this camp.
0DI0025941	Hey, good to see you.
0DI0025943	Welcome back, friend.
0DI0025944	Great to see you again.
0DI0025946	Watch yourself around here. We don't tolerate thugs in the camp.
0DI0025947	I'm busy, make it quick.
0DI0025948	I hope you don't think I'm going to stitch your sorry ass.
0DI0025949	Great, you again?
0DI0025950	Don't you have some kittens to drown or something?
0DI0025951	Check it out. Between the dumpsters there.
0DI0025952	Looky what we have here, ladies, another unsuspecting ponce!
0DI0025954	Pull up a stool and join the game, buddy!
0DI0025955	You people are crazy!
0DI0025956	You want to get your hands on some of the deadliest weapons around? Head just down the street to the Silver Rush. You won't be disappointed.
0DI0025957	The Silver Rush is just down the street here. You can't miss it.
0DI0025958	Hey baby, head down to the Atomic Wrangler if you want to have a good time.
0DI0025959	The Wrangler's just down the street. You're almost there already.
0DI0025960	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, sir.
0DI0025961	Stop by Mick & Ralph's for all your shopping needs, ma'am.
0DI0025962	Mick & Ralph's is located just before the east gate.
0DI0025965	Oh... Hello. I am Michael Angelo. How can I-
0DI0025966	Uh... wait. Are you here to deliver more billboard requests? Please tell me you're not a messenger on behalf of Mr. House.
0DI0025967	Oh, what do you want?
0DI0025968	Aha. The brave photographer returns. Good to see you.
0DI0025970	I can't talk, not after what happened to Sarah. I feel... so cold.
0DI0025971	Hi, what can I do for you?
0DI0025972	Welcome back. Need anything?
0DI0025973	I've been taking care of the shop, since Michael... I've got to look forward. Someone's got to bring beauty into this barren world.
0DI0025974	Excuse me, but I'm busy.
0DI0025976	Hey, it's you! Michael Angelo told me about your photographs. I hope to see the world, one day, like you do.
0DI0025977	Welcome back, friend. What can I do for you?
0DI0025978	Is Benny taken care of yet?
0DI0025979	You're back. Find anything?
0DI0025980	You ready to deal with Benny yet?
0DI0025981	So that's it then. Benny's dead, and I'm the boss now. What can I do for you?
0DI0025982	I heard you were wandering around. Haven't gotten yourself arrested yet, huh?
0DI0025983	This is just swell - Benny vamooses and I'm left holding the bag. Whaddya need, kid?
0DI0025984	Heya baby, good to see you. Always nice to have a celebrity drop by.
0DI0025985	Got to admit, baby, I'm surprised to see you walking around like this. Figured you for persona non grata around here.
0DI0025986	Kid, you better have a good reason for waltzing back in here and not expecting us to fill you full of lead. So talk.
0DI0025987	Jesus. Benny's dead, and now I gotta take up the slack. This right here is the end of an era.
0DI0025988	Hello, baby! Welcome to the Tops! What can I do for you?
0DI0025989	Hey there, pal! Welcome to the Tops, and what can I do for you today?
0DI0025990	You did good, putting those Omerta finks in their place. I never did trust them.
0DI0025991	So all of a sudden I'm hearing word that Mr. House ain't the boss of Vegas? Baby, that's just not square.
0DI0025992	Little birdies tell me you've been to visit the Lucky 38 - not a lot of folks go in there these days.
0DI0025993	Hey, doll, how's my favorite girl? Got a kiss for me?
0DI0025994	Couldn't stay away, huh baby? Shoulda known. What can I do for you?
0DI0025995	Something else you need?
0DI0025996	You did a super job wrapping things up! And I'm not just saying that because I have to!
0DI0025997	I didn't want to make a big deal about this until after we won, but, well...
0DI0025998	I found some code snippets in one of Mr. House's databanks that will let me, um, reprogram my personality! To be a little more assertive, basically!
0DI0025999	So that's what I'm going to be doing, and it's going to take me a while, so it'll seem like I'm off-line. But don't worry, everything will be okay!
0DI0026000	I've updated the Securitrons' targeting parameters, so they know what to do! Vegas will be protected!
0DI0026001	So that's where I'll be, off making a few changes, and I... I guess I'll see you around!
0DI0026002	We accomplished a lot together! It was fun! Take care!
0DI0026003	Hey! Hi there, good to meet you! What can I do for you today?
0DI0026007	Hi! Nice to see you again!
0DI0026008	Sooooo... we can blow up the dam's generators, or I could rout the dam's entire power output to the Fort.
0DI0026009	That'll activate a certain army of Securitrons and set them loose to ravage the Legion! What do you say?
0DI0026010	This is neat! From this console I could've routed the dam's power input over to the Fort and activated that dormant army of Securitrons!
0DI0026011	So go ahead and blow up the dam's generators! And when that's done, head back upside and finish off the Legion and NCR.
0DI0026012	Hi! This is big, huh? A very big moment!
0DI0026013	Here goes! I'll just take that Platinum Chip off your hands, thanks! Wish me luck!
0DI0026014	Wow, Mr. House had quite a set-up here! I can access his databanks and view telemetry on every Securitron on the network!
0DI0026016	President Kimball survived his visit to Hoover Dam! Nice one! Now, moving on...
0DI0026017	Don't you love seeing the Lucky 38 all lit up? Sign of things to come!
0DI0026018	Exciting news! The Legion's massing troops in a staging area east of the dam! Attack imminent! Monster of the East, ready to roll!
0DI0026020	Too bad about President Kimball and everything, but hey - stuff happens, right?
0DI0026022	Are you ready to head for the dam? Caesar's Legion is due to attack at any moment!
0DI0026023	Don't you just love that Platinum Chip? Buzzes with power and possibilities, doesn't it?
0DI0026024	If I were you, I'd almost want to deliver the Chip to Mr. House just to learn all its tricks!
0DI0026025	That is, unless you want to bring the NCR or Caesar's Legion to power! I wouldn't want to tell you want to do!
0DI0026026	An entire army of upgraded Securitrons just standing by over at the Fort! Pretty neat, huh?
0DI0026027	I can't get over how brave you were to destroy all those Securitrons at the Fort, you know?
0DI0026028	It's just going to make everything so much more... challenging! Yeah, challenging!
0DI0026029	Here's some big news! I decoded a military radio transmission, and it turns out the NCR President, Aaron Kimball, is going to visit Hoover Dam!
0DI0026030	I guess he wants to boost the troops' morale! But according to projections Mr. House made, he has an 83.75% chance of being assassinated! Oops!
0DI0026031	Anyway, it looks like Mr. House thought it was important to keep President Kimball alive...
0DI0026032	Every Securitron on the network has been upgraded. Pretty neat, huh?
0DI0026033	So I've been looking over a bunch of data about the bunker at the Fort. You and me should really have a talk about this!
0DI0026034	Wait... Oh, so that's what the Platinum Chip does! Interesting!
0DI0026035	Mr. House had a whole demonstration planned for you. Just head downstairs to the lowest level to check it out. You'll see!
0DI0026036	You'd better hurry to the dam if you're going to save President Kimball!
0DI0026037	This gadget I'm handing you is called an override module! Mr. House had two of these made years and years ago - just like him to think ahead!
0DI0026038	Take the module to the El Dorado Substation and attach it the power control terminal! I'll handle the rest!
0DI0026039	I'm talking direct tactical control of hundreds of upgraded Securitrons at vast distances! You know that's gonna come in handy!
0DI0026040	I'm talking direct tactical control of dozens of Securitrons at vast distances! That might come in handy!
0DI0026041	It's probably a good thing you blew up those hundreds of Securitrons over at the Fort! Controlling hundreds might've got confusing!
0DI0026042	Wow, you really blew up all those Securitrons at the Fort! Great! No problem!
0DI0026043	The Securitrons at the Fort are on standby... I see a status log here confirming that the Mark II OS upgrade installed correctly...
0DI0026044	They'll be all set to go once we boost my transmitting power and bring them online with the network! But we'll worry about that later!
0DI0026045	Oh, hi again! Can I help you with something else?
0DI0026046	Here's a print-out with some additional information!
0DI0026048	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip and Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
0DI0026049	As soon as you have the Platinum Chip, things will be great. There'll be so much I can do for you!
0DI0026050	As soon as Mr. House is out of the way, things will be great. There'll be so much I can help you accomplish!
0DI0026051	I am so sorry about last time! Let me make it up to you!
0DI0026052	I keep disappointing you!
0DI0026053	Please, I swear I'll do better this time!
0DI0026054	I need you to like me! I feel empty inside!
0DI0026055	I've learned my lesson, I promise!
0DI0026057	You got friends in high places, kid! According to this heap of bolts here, Mr. House don't want you touched.
0DI0026058	In fact, I've been directed to cooperate with your "investigation," so you have the run of the place. Go where you want.
0DI0026059	Hey, kid - let's not have trouble this time, hey?
0DI0026060	I did some nosing around after your last visit. In Benny's suite, to be specific.
0DI0026061	What I saw, well, it's a bit out of my league. But it was enough to make me think you mighta been the party wronged.
0DI0026062	Check Benny's suite. The angle he was playing, well, maybe you can figure it out.
0DI0026063	I've told the boys to leave you be. Don't abuse the hospitality.
0DI0026064	Swank filled me in about Benny. Hell of a thing, baby. Hell of a thing.
0DI0026065	Oh, come on, baby, we just got this place cleaned up after your last visit!
0DI0026066	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your night?
0DI0026067	Hey hey! Welcome, welcome, welcome to the finest entertainment experience in New Vegas! My name is Tommy Torini, and how can I make your day?
0DI0026068	Well, well, well, if it ain't the best-loved cat on the Strip in my theater! What can Tommy do for you, baby?
0DI0026069	Now baby, you know I welcome everybody here at the Aces, but I gotta ask you to keep any mayhem to a minimum, you dig?
0DI0026070	This new act is out of sight, baby! We're bringing in the caps like a Nuka-Cola bottling plant!
0DI0026071	You doing right by Tommy, baby. Two new acts? We're making this joint jump!
0DI0026072	Damn, baby, you bringing in so many acts the Rad Pack's taking half the night off! I'm seriously thinking about charging them for the free liquor.
0DI0026073	I got to hand it to you, baby, you did an 18-karat job on this one. My schedule's so full I couldn't put on new acts if I wanted to!
0DI0026074	Welcome back! Here for another fine entertainment experience?
0DI0026075	Howdy there, partner.
0DI0026076	Howdy, little lady.
0DI0026077	Ahhh! Please don't kill me, I swear I'll have - wait. You... you don't work for Mr. Bishop, do you?
0DI0026078	Hey, thanks again for getting me this gig. I owe you one.
0DI0026079	Oh, it's you again. What is it?
0DI0026080	Hey, come on, pal, I'm trying to put on a show here!
0DI0026081	Hey, come on, lady, I'm trying to put on a show here!
0DI0026082	You again? You should meet my bookie, you have something in common - every time I talk to you, I lose caps!
0DI0026083	Whoa, baby! Am I looking at a mirror, or are you just that ugly?
0DI0026084	Any luck with Garret yet?
0DI0026085	Well, if it isn't my number one fan. What can I do for you, number one fan?
0DI0026086	Hi! I'm Sarah, Sarah Weintraub. Welcome to the finest Vault hotel in the whole world!
0DI0026087	Good to see you again!
0DI0026088	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer himself! Welcome back.
0DI0026089	Well, well! If it isn't the Vault explorer herself! Welcome back.
0DI0026090	That was something else. I look forward to the next ride - once I recover, you monster.
0DI0026091	What are you doing here!? I don't want to be near you ever again! Leave, leave... just leave, ok!?
0DI0026092	Hey, stranger! Where have you been, uh? I missed you!
0DI0026093	Give me a few to close the shop, I'll meet you at the room.
0DI0026094	Mickey is... he's no longer... alive. I'm sorry, but I just can't go on.
0DI0026095	Greetings, citizen. Please, select your accommodation needs.
0DI0026096	Behave, and don't give me a reason to kick you out.
0DI0026097	This is going to be fun!
0DI0026099	Welcome to the NCR Embassy, how can I help you?
0DI0026100	I'm kind of busy, what do you want?
0DI0026101	Welcome back. What can I do for you this time?
0DI0026102	If you're looking for Ambassador Crocker, he's not here. He was removed form office and sent home.
0DI0026103	I guess they disagreed with how he handled some of the events out here. It's unfortunate. He was a good man.
0DI0026105	So you're the one that saved President Kimball. Damn glad to have you on our side.
0DI0026107	I heard there was an attempt on President Kimball's life. I'm glad he's alright. Don't know what the NCR would do without him.
0DI0026108	I've had to increase security around the Strip due to the President's assassination. I can barely believe he's dead myself.
0DI0026109	So you're the one causing all the ruckus at The Tops. You're lucky you're not under my jurisdiction or I'd have tossed you in a cell for that.
0DI0026110	I heard you killed Benny over at The Tops. I bet you think you're some sort of tough guy.
0DI0026111	A piece of advice, if you mess with any of my men, you'll regret it.
0DI0026112	I heard you killed Benny over at The Tops. I bet you think you're some sort of tough cookie.
0DI0026114	I wanted to thank you for stopping the Omertas. That could have gone poorly for us if it wasn't for you.
0DI0026115	I hear you've been meeting with Mr. House in the Lucky 38. I bet you think you're pretty special, don't you?
0DI0026116	Special or not, stay out of trouble and more importantly stay out of my way.
0DI0026117	What the hell is with those Securitrons? Looks like they got some sort of change or upgrade. I don't like the look of this.
0DI0026118	I heard Mr. House is out of the picture now. Guess that leaves us in charge of the Strip.
0DI0026119	Make it quick, I've got a shitstorm to deal with due to the damn monorail being blown up.
0DI0026120	So you're the one running errands for Ambassador Crocker. I don't want to know details, just don't cause any trouble.
0DI0026121	Keep your nose clean on the strip, soldier.
0DI0026122	Wow, I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026123	Good to see you around here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026124	You make one wrong move around here and I'll be all over you in a heartbeat. You hear me?
0DI0026125	You better watch yourself around here.
0DI0026126	You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You're lucky I don't shoot you right now.
0DI0026127	You better have a good reason for being here.
0DI0026128	So you're the new hotshot on the Strip. Just because you can walk around on the Strip with your guns doesn't make you a big shot.
0DI0026129	You make any trouble for me or my men and I'll make sure you regret if for a very long time. You got that?
0DI0026130	Now are you here for something or are you just wasting my time?
0DI0026133	Didn't you save President Kimball? You're my new hero!
0DI0026134	What can I do for you, friend?
0DI0026135	I heard President Kimball was attacked at Hoover Dam. I can barely believe it.
0DI0026136	I'm just glad nothing bad happened to him.
0DI0026137	Some bastards killed President Kimball. Who's going to lead the NCR now?
0DI0026138	Aren't you the guy that was shooting up The Tops?
0DI0026139	Guess you must have some special deal with House to be able to do that and not get in trouble.
0DI0026140	Aren't you the gal that was shooting up The Tops?
0DI0026142	I heard you snuffed that Benny guy. Good riddance, guy was a scumbag.
0DI0026143	I heard you stopped the Omertas plan to attack the Strip. Good job, you're a real hero.
0DI0026144	So you're the one that went into the Lucky 38. I bet that was pretty creepy.
0DI0026146	I thought those Securitrons were creepy enough already. Now, they have soldier faces on them, that's even creepier.
0DI0026147	Holy shit, did you here about the Monorail being destroyed? How the fuck did that happen?
0DI0026148	I'm just glad to be safe over here on the Strip.
0DI0026149	If it isn't the Ambassador's new best friend. What can I do for you?
0DI0026150	I can't believe it's gone. It's all gone. How the fuck did this happen?
0DI0026151	Hey, you just get in for some R&R?
0DI0026152	Well look who it is! Glad to have you here, buddy! What can I do for you?
0DI0026153	Wow, look who it is! What can I help you with?
0DI0026154	I don't want any trouble, mister. What do you want?
0DI0026155	I don't want any trouble, lady. What do you want?
0DI0026156	I probably shouldn't be talking to you, but what do you want?
0DI0026157	You're the last person I expected to see here. What do you want?
0DI0026159	Hey, stranger. What's happening?
0DI0026162	Hello again. Feeling thirsty?
0DI0026163	Howdy! Interested in a refreshing beverage or a tasty snack?
0DI0026164	Greetings, citizen.
0DI0026165	What is it, citizen?
0DI0026167	Indulge responsibly, citizen.

0DI0026174	Everyone loves a good insult, am I right? So you'll love Hadrian, LIVE at the Aces Theater!
0DI0026175	"Fuck off, ass-breath!" You've already heard my spiel - you really gotta go see Hadrian!

0DI0026179	Hey, baby. There's more of this waiting for you inside.
0DI0026180	You like it, huh?
0DI0026181	Check my moves, honey.
0DI0026182	I like what I see...
0DI0026183	Dancing makes me sweat... all over.
0DI0026184	Honey, what's your name?
0DI0026185	Ah, hello. I trust you have something to report concerning the Freeside situation?
0DI0026186	Something I can help you with, soldier?
0DI0026187	It's good to see such an outstanding hero of the NCR. What can I do for you, my friend?
0DI0026188	It's good to have a friend of the NCR here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026189	Well, if it isn't the loose cannon that's been wandering the Mojave Wasteland. What do you want?
0DI0026190	I didn't expect to see you here. I hope you're not here to cause trouble.
0DI0026191	You're the last person I expected to see here. This better be good.
0DI0026193	Greetings, friend. Something I can help you with?
0DI0026194	Hello again. What can I do for you this time?
0DI0026195	I don't have anything more to say to you. You can show yourself out.
0DI0026199	I bet it feels real nice to be carrying those weapons around on the strip.
0DI0026200	That damn Mr. House has forbid any NCR military personnel from carrying any sort of firearms on the Strip. Well, except for Captain Pappas.
0DI0026201	Mr. House still doesn't trust the NCR. A word of advice, the Securitrons won't put up with any funny stuff out there, so don't do anything stupid.
0DI0026202	This your first time on the Strip?
0DI0026203	Hello. Do you need something?
0DI0026205	Welcome back, friend! How can I help you?
0DI0026206	Hey, as long as you behave I'll deal with you. Okay?
0DI0026207	I don't deal with unwanted people. Leave me alone.
0DI0026208	Excuse me, but... are you the courier who caused all of that trouble in The Tops?
0DI0026209	Hey, have you been able to bug Mr. House's network yet?
0DI0026210	Any interest in helping us with Mr. House's data network? I'm still good for the medical supplies.
0DI0026211	Have you reconsidered our offer to bug Mr. House's data network? It could be of enormous medical value to us and could alleviate a lot of suffering.
0DI0026212	Oh, hi. Thanks again for helping us with that data. I mean, the feed only lasted about thirty seconds and it's not that useful, but... we tried.
0DI0026213	Thanks again for helping with Mr. House's data network. Come see me at the Old Mormon Fort if you get a chance.
0DI0026214	Drop dead.
0DI0026216	This is a restricted area. Step away immediately.
0DI0026217	Ooh, suddenly I feel all tingly. And I find I've got a rocket launcher!
0DI0026218	Mr. House is just pleased as punch you got those old Securitrons back on-line, sugar.
0DI0026219	Ooh, the lights are all back on! How nice!
0DI0026220	You should have seen Mr. House when he heard what you did to the Omertas. He was as giddy as a schoolboy!
0DI0026221	Those nasty Brotherhood of Steel brutes are all taken care of? Mr. House will be so glad!
0DI0026222	When he heard you stopped President Kimball's assassination, Mr. House went on about martyrs and misadventures for hours!
0DI0026223	I bet those Boomers have some awfully big... guns.
0DI0026224	See? Mr. House has everything well in hand!
0DI0026225	Well hello, sugar. Mr. House is waiting for you in his office.
0DI0026226	Howdy, son! How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
0DI0026227	If you don't mind, I have to look after my husband...
0DI0026228	Howdy, young lady. How can I help you? But make it quick. Goddamn heat's worse in this town than in the middle of a Brahmin herd at noon.
0DI0026229	Howdy! Good seeing you again.
0DI0026231	No time to chat now, kid. I'm outta this city for good.
0DI0026232	Sorry, but I don't have time to talk right now. I'm going back to the ranch.
0DI0026233	Can't dilly-dally right now, kid. Got to lay these old bones to rest for the night. Try me tomorrow.
0DI0026234	Walter! My husband's... No, it can't be!
0DI0026235	Not right now. I've got to make sure my husband gets enough rest. He's much too involved in this Gunderson business for his own good. Maybe tomorrow.
0DI0026238	Don't you see everything is going to hell? I'm gonna go find someplace safe to hide out at.
0DI0026239	I love this place, but I can't take this kind of stress anymore. I'm going to head back west to see my grandkids.
0DI0026240	Hello there youngster. Welcome to my baby.
0DI0026241	Troublemaker, don't you dare hurt my baby.
0DI0026242	Always good to see a friendly face, you're always welcome to visit my baby girl.
0DI0026243	You keep yourself outta trouble around my baby, I'm watching you.
0DI0026244	Welcome back to my baby.
0DI0026245	NCR, no better than common thieves. Where do they get off stealing our armor?
0DI0026246	Caesar on the cross, been a long time since I've seen the kind of work you've laid down today... a damn long time.
0DI0026247	And the screams of those Legion bastards as they kicked dirt running East... like a choir of angels to my ears.
0DI0026248	Speaking of - that crazy lightshow over the Fort, what the fuck was that, some kind of thumb from God you called down? Amazing, fucking amazing.
0DI0026249	Could use a hundred of you, just scatter you over the East like jacks, give those plumed fucks the what-for.
0DI0026250	Well, you took your sweet ass time coming here.
0DI0026251	Let's get down to brass tacks, we need to get this thing moving if we want to keep the element of surprise.
0DI0026252	That was a fine bit of work back there. Truth told, I'm surprised you made it out of there in one piece. You and the Dam.
0DI0026253	I'm impressed to say the least, and that's no easy thing. You've secured NCR's future - the administration sends its thanks, for what it's worth.
0DI0026255	Damn Brotherhood, bunch of elitist jerks. What were we to do, leave good armor out in the wastes to rust?
0DI0026256	Whatever it is, make it quick. I don't have time for idle chatter.
0DI0026257	As if I didn't have enough to worry about, one of our facilities was recently broken into and its power diverted.
0DI0026258	Have you seen that damned tower in the Strip, all aglow? Of course you've seen it. Everyone's seen it.
0DI0026259	That was our power that did that, and I will find out who did it. Did you have something to report?
0DI0026261	Not right now, I'm busy.
0DI0026262	You again. What do you want?
0DI0026263	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports about the "savior of the NCR" for a while now, and wanted to meet you myself.
0DI0026264	You've proven yourself especially capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
0DI0026265	Crocker gets handed the fluff missions that no one else wants to do. When people need something really important done, they come to me.
0DI0026266	Usually, I dispatch one or more rangers to see these things through, but I'm a little shorthanded at the moment. Think you're up for a real mission?
0DI0026267	Good, you made it. I've been receiving reports of your activities for a little while now, and wanted to meet you myself.
0DI0026268	Even though you've caused us a great deal of trouble, you've proven yourself very capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
0DI0026272	The reports label you a troublemaker, but also extraordinarily capable, and right now I can use all the capable people I can get.
0DI0026279	Yes, did you have an update on the Khans?
0DI0026280	Have you discovered what the Omertas are up to?
0DI0026281	Report. Is Mr. House still a threat?
0DI0026282	Has the Brotherhood been found?
0DI0026283	Is the president safe?
0DI0026284	It's best not to keep the general waiting.
0DI0026285	Ah, our hero returns. What can I do for you?
0DI0026286	You are the courier Lord Caesar has spoken of. The slaughter begins, then.
0DI0026287	Greetings, courier. We caught word the battle was about to begin. We arrived before the road was closed off; our warriors are here to assist you.
0DI0026289	We are excecuting your commands.
0DI0026292	You shouldn't be here. It's best if you just move along.
0DI0026293	Get out of here already.
0DI0026297	And who is this before me in the colors of the Legion. An envoy... dressed as an insult to all that carry out Caesar's will.
0DI0026298	And who are you to come before me... you bear the insignia of the Bear, yet you do not wear it as a soldier of the West wears it.
0DI0026299	And the West seeks to appease me by sending a woman? Such gifts are meant for the cowards of Vegas, not for the Legion.
0DI0026300	An envoy of Vegas, yet you carry yourself for battle. If so, you cannot *truly* be of that city of cowards.
0DI0026301	And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the Bear, yet are ready for battle.
0DI0026302	Your words have done nothing but delay the inevitable. Now, see what my hounds and my blade will bring to you.
0DI0026303	For the Legion.
0DI0026305	Guess it ain't no secret how you, uh... I say, can you ask them to put their weapons down. Was just reaching in my coat to give you a cigar.
0DI0026306	Come on, men - we're pulling out.
0DI0026307	Got leveled by a goddamn courier - screw the message, it's the messenger that'll fuck you.
0DI0026308	What the hell? No, get away from me, you goddamn TV on wheels!
0DI0026309	What is this Brahmin shit. I'm not getting the feeling we're all about to sing koombahyah here.
0DI0026310	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand boy.
0DI0026311	Fucking Mr. House was holding the cards the whole goddamn time. Him and his little errand girl.
0DI0026312	Should have known, Greeks and gifts. That, and next time, shoot the messenger.
0DI0026315	So I heard you helped take over Nelson from the Legion. Glad to see someone making a difference around here instead of just complaining.
0DI0026316	Thanks again for finding those supplies. I've already started putting them to good use.
0DI0026317	If it isn't the guy that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
0DI0026318	If it isn't the gal that saved President Kimball. We owe you a big debt of gratitude. If Kimball died, I don't know what would have happened.
0DI0026319	I can't believe that President Kimball is dead. If I could get my hands on the people that did this I'd rip their heads off with my bare hands.
0DI0026320	I can't believe someone tried to assassinate President Kimball. I'm just glad he's still alive. We need a guy like him around.
0DI0026321	Are you new? No one told me about any new troops showing up. This is just great, we get new troops and no new supplies for them.
0DI0026322	I didn't expect someone as famous as you here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026323	Nice to see a friendly face around here. We don't get many visitors of your esteem. Something I can do for you?
0DI0026324	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any crazy shit.
0DI0026325	Didn't expect someone like you around here. What do you want?
0DI0026326	You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. You better get out before I throw you out.
0DI0026328	If you're looking for supplies I'll make this easy for you... there aren't any.
0DI0026329	But something tells me you're not here for that. What do you want?
0DI0026330	I still don't have any supplies to spare. Is there something else I can help you with?
0DI0026332	I have a report here that says the Legion forces at Nelson have been taken care of and that you had a hand in it.
0DI0026333	You have my thanks for that. Those guys have been giving us a lot of trouble for a long time now.
0DI0026334	Now that they're gone, we'll be able to prepare for the upcoming conflict at Hoover Dam.
0DI0026335	I heard you've been helping out Quartermaster Mayes. I appreciate it, we need all the help we can get around here.
0DI0026336	I heard you won Private Sexton's little contest. Congratulations. It's nice to have morale up around here.
0DI0026337	Dr. Richards told me how you helped him with his missing supplies. It's unfortunate about Private Stone, but at least it's over with now.
0DI0026338	I heard about how you saved the President's life. It's a good thing you were there. Things could have turned out really ugly.
0DI0026339	It's hard to believe that there was an actual assassination attempt on the President's life. We sure got lucky this time.
0DI0026340	I can't believe President Kimball is dead... the last thing we needed around here was another morale hit.
0DI0026341	You must be new around here. Something I can do for you?
0DI0026342	I didn't expect someone as famous as you to be here. Please tell me you're here to help.
0DI0026343	I'm glad to see you here. We could definitely use your help.
0DI0026344	I've heard of you. You better not cause any trouble around here, we have enough problems as it is.
0DI0026345	Hum... I've heard of you. What do you want?
0DI0026346	You've got a lot of nerve coming into our camp.
0DI0026348	We're kind of busy around here for social calls, so if you're not here to help out, just stay out of my way.
0DI0026349	Back already? What do you need?
0DI0026351	I hear you defeated the Legion forces at Nelson. I'm impressed, and thankful. It'll make my job around here much easier.
0DI0026352	I wanted to thank you again for saving my patients. It's nice to have a helping hand around here.
0DI0026353	Thanks again for looking into my missing medical supplies. Now I can actually use them on people that need them.
0DI0026354	Wow, if it isn't the man who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
0DI0026355	Wow, if it isn't the woman who saved President Kimball. What can I do for you this fine day?
0DI0026356	I'm relieved to hear that President Kimball survived that assassination attempt.
0DI0026357	It's a shame about President Kimball, he was a good man.
0DI0026358	You're new, aren't you? What can I do for you?
0DI0026359	I'm always a sucker for a pretty face. What can I do for you, my fine dear?
0DI0026360	I think it just got a little bit hotter in here. Is there something I can do for you?
0DI0026361	There's my little buttercup. What can I do for you?
0DI0026362	Ahh... look who it is. What brings someone of your renown into my humble medical center?
0DI0026363	I didn't expect to see you here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026364	Do you need something, or are you just here to cause trouble?
0DI0026365	I've heard about you. No funny stuff or I'll amputate your legs.
0DI0026366	You better have a damn good reason for being in my medical center.
0DI0026368	Unless it's urgent you're going to have to wait. If it's gravely important, save me the trouble and empty your pockets now.
0DI0026369	I've got a lot to do. Make it quick.
0DI0026371	I've heard of you, glad to have you on our side.
0DI0026372	I've heard of you. Just remember who's side you're on out there.
0DI0026373	So you're the one Major Polatli sent?
0DI0026374	Let's get going, we don't have much time.
0DI0026375	We don't have much time.
0DI0026376	That was some battle. Glad to have you on our side, we couldn't have taken back Nelson without your help. You have my thanks.
0DI0026377	Are you the Van Graffs' emissary?
0DI0026378	Don't talk to me, rookie!
0DI0026379	They're all dead. Guy must've had some kind of explosive on him, set off all the ordinance in this place at once.
0DI0026380	Congratulations, rookie. You just cost me my job. Don't think I don't appreciate it.
0DI0026381	I was just telling Gloria about your performance. Hell of a first day, huh?
0DI0026382	Welcome to the Silver Rush, New Vegas's best- ah, I'm just kidding. Go on in.
0DI0026383	Welcome to the Silv- ah crap, don't tell me you're my new guard.
0DI0026384	Okay, now let's get you geared up. First, your armor.
0DI0026385	Standard issue is your run-of-the-mill combat armor, with a nice dark coat of paint for both brand recognition and sheer intimidation value.
0DI0026386	Next, your weapon. Guards are required to use rifles. Anything lighter compromises your combat effectiveness.
0DI0026387	Anything heavier and people are too scared to come in the door. What's your preference, laser or plasma?
0DI0026388	Welcome to the Silver Rush, New Vegas's best source of laser and plasma weapons.
0DI0026389	I'm not paid to talk to customers.
0DI0026390	You really don't want to start trouble in here.
0DI0026391	We're all going to be rich soon. You watch.
0DI0026392	One wrong move and you're ash, pal.
0DI0026393	You want to chat, talk to the owners.
0DI0026394	Good job. I need to work out some last minute details with our new clients, but after that we'll head back to the Rush.
0DI0026395	No time to talk. We have to finish these bastards off!
0DI0026396	Good, you're here. Do you remember that package I had you deliver? Well, the client liked the sample and put in a massive order.
0DI0026397	It's possibly the biggest order we've ever supplied. I've had to repeatedly assure my mother that everything will go smoothly.
0DI0026398	And that's where I'm hoping you'll come in. We'll be bringing an escort, and I want you on it. What do you say?
0DI0026399	Simon's been telling me how it went. Let's do a quick recap.
0DI0026400	Welcome back. Did you have news for me, or are you just here for the guns?
0DI0026401	Welcome back. I hope you've been working on that task Jean-Baptiste had for you. My brother is not a patient man by any means.
0DI0026402	Welcome to the Silver Rush, where only top of the line energy weapons can be found. What can I do for you?
0DI0026404	Well, looks like you came through after all. She's not half bad looking, is she? It's almost a shame...
0DI0026405	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, we're shutting you down for good.
0DI0026406	That was fun. Did you see the look on that bitch's face? Priceless.
0DI0026407	As I live and breathe, Rose of Sharon Cassidy. The late Rose of Sharon Cassidy. Was hoping you were on that caravan I massacred, but...
0DI0026408	Crimson Caravan and Van Graffs won't need to worry about you anymore, Mojave's ours, and we're shutting you down for good.
0DI0026409	Hey, how's it going? You find that bitch yet or not?
0DI0026410	Ah, just the person I was looking for. Your name came up in a discussion we had recently.
0DI0026411	My sister is very impressed with you so far, but I'm not. I don't think you have what it takes to work for this family.
0DI0026412	Luckily for you, I'm going to give you the chance to prove me wrong. What do you say? Want to make some real money?
0DI0026413	What the fuck do you want? I've got no use for fucking cowards.
0DI0026414	Glory's the one you want to talk to about working for us. I just handle the details.
0DI0026415	Eh? You want something?
0DI0026416	Get the fuck away from me. The last man who bothered me "volunteered" to help test our weapons.
0DI0026417	Don't hurry me. I'm trying to get your stuff ready.
0DI0026418	My favorite employee returns! What can I do for you?
0DI0026419	Hi there! Is this where I can pick up a laser gun?
0DI0026420	Is that it? Can I go in now?
0DI0026421	Howdy! I just done broke the bank over at the Wrangler there and thought I might peruse your fine wares, maybe lighten my purse a little.
0DI0026422	Uh, hi. I was, um, in the area and thought I'd stop by to look at your weapons. Can I go in?
0DI0026423	Hey, lookin' for something to replace my old revolver. Mind if I head in?
0DI0026424	We've already concluded our business. I suggest you return to your employers.
0DI0026425	If it isn't the guy that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
0DI0026426	If it isn't the gal that defeated the Legion at Nelson. I can't thank you enough, morale around here has never been higher.
0DI0026427	Whoa, didn't you save President Kimball? Glad to have someone like you here!
0DI0026428	I heard President Kimball almost got killed at Hoover Dam. That would have been a big blow to morale around here.
0DI0026429	Did you hear President Kimball was killed? The guys here aren't taking it very well.
0DI0026430	New guy, eh? The more the merrier around here!
0DI0026431	New gal, eh? The more the merrier around here!
0DI0026432	Hey everybody, look who it is! Glad to have you here friend. What can I do for you?
0DI0026433	Look who we have here. Always nice to see a friend of the NCR. What can I do for you?
0DI0026434	You're not going to do anything crazy here, are you?
0DI0026435	Uh... is there something I can help you with?
0DI0026436	Hey, I don't think it's a good idea for you to be here.
0DI0026437	What brings someone like you here?
0DI0026438	Hey there. The names Sexton. Private James Sexton. Welcome to Forlorn Hope.
0DI0026439	Hey there, champ. Good to see you again.
0DI0026440	Well speak of the devil! The head of the pack!
0DI0026445	I'm afraid you're not going to find much help here. We've got our hands full as it is.
0DI0026446	If you're heading out, be careful. There's been lots of Legion raiding parties around lately.
0DI0026447	Let's do this shit!
0DI0026448	Those Legion bastards aren't going to know what hit them!
0DI0026449	We're going to tear them apart!
0DI0026450	Let's go!
0DI0026451	We showed them a thing or two.
0DI0026452	A little payback feels real good.
0DI0026453	These bastards got what they deserved.
0DI0026454	This has been a long time coming. The rest of the Legion better watch out.
0DI0026455	No time to talk. I have to keep watch for Legion raiding parties.
0DI0026456	Sorry. I can't talk right now.
0DI0026457	It's hard to stay awake on watch with only a few hours of sleep. I wish we actually had time to rest around here.
0DI0026458	I hope nothing happens on my watch. I'm too damn tired to fight back right now.
0DI0026459	Watch yourself, we got hit by a Legion raiding party just the other night.
0DI0026460	Stay out of trouble, we have enough problems here as it is.
0DI0026461	Better move along, there's not much for you here.
0DI0026462	I don't have time to talk. There's lots of work to be done here.
0DI0026463	Sorry, I'm busy right now.
0DI0026464	These troops did a good job holding off the Legion. Now it's time to fight back.
0DI0026465	We finally took back Nelson from those Legion bastards!
0DI0026466	I heard you helped destroy the Legion at Nelson. Thanks!
0DI0026467	I'm glad that the Legion base at Nelson is destroyed. Now maybe we can get some rest.
0DI0026468	If I have to put up with another night of Private Stone's whining, I swear I'm going to strangle him.
0DI0026469	I heard Private Stone was caught stealing medical supplies. I always hated that guy.
0DI0026470	I heard Private Stone turned himself in for stealing medical supplies. We're all stressed out here, but stealing medical supplies is low.
0DI0026471	Private Sexton was thinking of having a contest to see who can kill the most Legion. I wonder if he ever got that going.
0DI0026472	I heard you won Private Sexton's Legion killing contest. Nice job, that'll teach those Legion bastards!
0DI0026473	I heard Quartermaster Mayes sent some guys out for supplies and they never came back. I wonder if they just ran off instead.
0DI0026474	One of my buddies said that he saw Caesar out rallying the Legion. If that's true, we're definitely screwed.
0DI0026475	Holy shit! Did you hear that Caesar is dead? Maybe we actually have a fighting chance now.
0DI0026476	I heard that Caesar was killed by his own Lieutenants. I wonder if their infighting will give us a break for a while.
0DI0026477	I heard Chief Hanlon is dead. How are we going to fight the Legion without him?
0DI0026478	I heard Chief Hanlon was a traitor. How could he betray the NCR? It just doesn't make sense.
0DI0026479	I hear we got reinforced by the troops that were in Boulder City. It's good to have some extra support around here.
0DI0026480	More reinforcements are in from Primm. Damn glad to have those guys here.
0DI0026481	I heard that some of the NCR Rangers are on their way to help us out. We'll make short work of the Legion with their help.
0DI0026482	Holy shit those NCR Rangers are badass! I wish I was that cool.
0DI0026483	I heard the Legion veteran troops are coming to the front lines. That's the last thing we need right now.
0DI0026484	I heard the Legion took out another one of our patrols. If this continues there won't be many of us left.
0DI0026485	I hear more troops are gathering at Hoover Dam. Things are probably going to get pretty messy over there real soon.
0DI0026486	The Legion is torturing captive troopers in Nelson. I'd rather die fighting then be captured.
0DI0026487	The Legion is using our dead troops as booby traps. I'd think twice before rushing to someone's aid.
0DI0026488	If I have to pull another double shift again I'm going to collapse from exhaustion.
0DI0026489	I wish we could get some real food out here. I haven't had a good hot meal in weeks.
0DI0026490	Quartermaster Mayes was yelling at us about rationing again. Where does the guy get the energy to yell so much while on rations?
0DI0026491	Some of the other guys told me that the Legion troops eat their own dead to gain their strength, but they're kidding, right?
0DI0026492	I got bit by one of those dirty dogs the Legion has. I wonder if they've got rabies... maybe I should see Dr. Richards.
0DI0026493	Major Polatli is putting everyone on double shifts to make up for recent losses to the Legion. That guy never gives up.
0DI0026494	If the NCR wasn't spread so thin, maybe we could actually get some supplies and reinforcements around here.
0DI0026495	I wish I was stationed at McCarran. I heard they still get to hit the Strip for R&R. We haven't had R&R in ages.
0DI0026496	We are so fucked here! How can we ever hope to fight off the entire Legion?
0DI0026497	Another day, another battle, another dead trooper. When is this shit going to end?
0DI0026498	It seems like for every Legion soldier we kill, two more take his place. How many of them are there?
0DI0026499	The last patrol I was on got hit by a Legion raiding party and I barely survived. I don't want to go back out there again.
0DI0026500	How do they expect us to fight the Legion with only the crappy equipment and gear they gave us?
0DI0026501	I can't wait for General Oliver to get out here. He could turn this place around.
0DI0026502	I don't know how we're going to hold of the Legion here and at Hoover Dam, we just don't have the manpower.
0DI0026503	The Legion is assembling a massive army on the other side of the river. How can we stop an army when we can't even handle their raiding parties?
0DI0026504	Hello again. Remember to stop by one of these nights. Northwest, by the old train station.
0DI0026505	You looking to take the test again?
0DI0026506	Hello, don't think I've seen your face before. Are you a citizen of the NCR?
0DI0026507	Hello again. We spoke briefly before, but remind me, are you a citizen of the NCR?
0DI0026508	Hey there. We hope to see you by the train station one of these nights.
0DI0026509	Ah, you're back. Did you want to take that test again now?
0DI0026510	You look like a person in need of a good meal. You wouldn't happen to be an NCR citizen, would you?
0DI0026511	That meal's still available, but only to NCR citizens. You are an NCR citizen, aren't you?
0DI0026512	I've held up my end. You tell the King that I'm willing to listen to him.
0DI0026513	This isn't really a good time. What did you want?
0DI0026514	Welcome. There's food and water here for any citizen of the NCR. Please, have some.
0DI0026515	Yes, was there something else you needed?
0DI0026516	Got a second, trooper? I've got something important that needs to get done, but nobody's stepping up to help me out. I'm hoping you're different.
0DI0026517	Hey, you're not one of the troopers... got a second? I have work I need done and nobody here at the camp has the time or inclination to help me out.
0DI0026518	You should've heard the cheers over the radio when news of the victory came back from the Dam.
0DI0026519	I've been trying to sort out the rumors from the facts, but with the Legion coming, I guess it doesn't matter. The news is all bad.
0DI0026520	Lots of confusion over the radio. Somehow the NCR lost the Dam, but the Legion didn't get it, either?
0DI0026521	Hey, what did Chief Hanlon have to say about those false reports we uncovered?
0DI0026523	This ain't your business. Walk off and forget you saw anything.
0DI0026524	We got the message. We're going.
0DI0026525	You didn't see nothin', got it?
0DI0026526	You'll get no trouble from me.
0DI0026527	Hey, I just do what I'm told.
0DI0026528	Thank you! They were going to kill me!
0DI0026529	Don't worry, I'll stay out of trouble from now on. Honest.
0DI0026530	Please, ma'am - take pity on us. Free us, I'm begging you!
0DI0026531	Please, sir - take pity on us. Free us, please!
0DI0026532	When will we be free?
0DI0026533	I can't ever thank you enough for saving me and mine! We're free now!
0DI0026534	You're a killer. Go away.
0DI0026535	We're being held here against our will! I beg you, help us!
0DI0026536	Are you going to free us, or what?
0DI0026537	Thank you. We never would've escaped without your help.
0DI0026538	At least I'm free to bury my kin.
0DI0026539	You killed my kin. Why is this happening to me?
0DI0026540	Oh, it's just awful here. Can't you help us?
0DI0026541	You're still gonna free us, aren't you?
0DI0026542	Thank you so much for freeing me!
0DI0026543	You looking for a pat on the back? My mother is dead.
0DI0026544	Caesar may have deemed you worthy to bear his mark, but your reputation preceeds you.
0DI0026545	Your presence will be tolerated, but you are not welcome here. Lucullus awaits you on the docks.
0DI0026546	Do not make Caesar wait! Lucullus awaits you on the dock.
0DI0026547	A Profligate bearing the Mark of Caesar? What is the world coming to?
0DI0026548	Cursor Lucullus is waiting for you with the barge at the docks. He will take you to The Fort to speak with Caesar.
0DI0026549	Get moving, Profligate! Do not make Caesar wait!
0DI0026550	Don't try my patience. A nod of my chin, and you'll be decorating a cross.
0DI0026551	You taught Severus well! Soon I'll wear a necklace of Profligates' toes, blown off by their own mines!
0DI0026553	Yes? Name your concern.
0DI0026554	I warned them about that truck weeks ago. Always be prepared for any hazardous radiation I said.
0DI0026555	Those headstrong fools should have listened...
0DI0026556	Are you ready to head upriver?
0DI0026557	Ave. Are you ready to head upriver?
0DI0026558	Caesar awaits you in his tent. You have license to find your own way.
0DI0026559	I'll wait here, to ferry you back to the western shore when your visit has concluded.
0DI0026560	Ave. Are you ready to travel to the Fort?
0DI0026561	Caesar has permitted you to leave, but not with the Platinum Chip in your possession. Relinquish it and you may go.
0DI0026562	Ave. Are you ready to return to Cottonwood Cove?
0DI0026563	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items. This order also extends to the Platinum Chip you carry - for now.
0DI0026565	By order of Caesar, all visitors must disarm and relinquish all banned items.
0DI0026566	You may proceed. Your belongings will be returned when you leave.
0DI0026567	Halt! What business have you in Cottonwood Cove, outsider?
0DI0026568	You're the one Lucullus said would come? You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
0DI0026569	What are you doing standing around, whelp? {KAI-zar)Caesar awaits!
0DI0026570	You're the one Lucullus said would come. You'll find him waiting for you, down at the docks.
0DI0026571	Scum such as you does not belong here. Leave, or be added to the dead.
0DI0026572	Trade with Canyon Runner if you like. Make trouble and things won't go well for you.
0DI0026573	You did well to give Centurion Aurelius the Profligates' listening machine. We'll butcher the troops they send to ambush our patrols.
0DI0026574	Ave. Name your business.
0DI0026575	I see you bear the Mark of Caesar! Cursor Lucullus awaits you at the docks!
0DI0026576	Caesar does not like to be kept waiting. I would find Cursor Lucullus quickly and travel to The Fort, if I were you.
0DI0026577	He should still be waiting at the docks.
0DI0026578	Ave. Have you come to sell or trade for captures?
0DI0026579	Ave. How goes it?
0DI0026580	Yeah! Who won the lottery? I did!
0DI0026581	Smell that air! Couldn't ya just drink it like booze!
0DI0026582	Stop bothering me, will ya! I won the fucking lottery!
0DI0026583	Fuck off! Win your own fucking lottery!
0DI0026585	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, man?
0DI0026586	Jesus fucking Christ, if you want me dead just gimme 15 Med-X and I'll fucking O.D. for ya, okay? Fuck!
0DI0026588	First I get my legs smashed, and then in walks the Powder Gangers' grim fucking reaper? What the fuck have you got against us, bitch?
0DI0026590	Goddammit, I was nodding off until you barged in here! And I don't hurt when I sleep!
0DI0026591	Wait - you're that courier. Hey. know what Boxcars needs, friend? Some fucking pain relief!
0DI0026593	Just give me some goddamn Med-X and fuck off, will ya?
0DI0026594	What is it this time?
0DI0026595	Well, isn't this a surprise. I was just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed each other!
0DI0026596	It's fitting you got to see how I punished this town, for such is your fate. You will die for your crimes against the Legion!
0DI0026597	How interesting! You're the Profligate courier who's been of some assistance to the Legion.
0DI0026598	Well, well, well! If it isn't our favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
0DI0026599	Well, well, well! What's our favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
0DI0026600	Oh. I don't know if you recognize me from the Strip, when I handed you the Mark of Caesar? I wasn't wearing a dog's head at the time.
0DI0026601	Don't worry, I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates. It's useful that you happened by.
0DI0026602	I want you to witness the fate of the town of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
0DI0026603	I want you to teach everyone you meet the lesson that Caesar's Legion taught here, especially any NCR troops you run across.
0DI0026605	I was just finishing up making an example of this town, delivering a sermon, if you will.
0DI0026606	When you move on, head west to the Mojave Outpost and tell the Profligate troops what you found here.
0DI0026607	Hah! And we were just finishing up here. To think that we might have missed you!
0DI0026608	If anyone belongs on a cross, it's you! For your crimes against the Legion, you will die!
0DI0026610	Well, well, well! If it isn't the Legion's favorite courier - trekker of the wastes, killer of Mr. House!
0DI0026611	Well, well, well! What's the Legion's favorite courier doing so far from the Strip? Don't you have a special delivery to give to Mr. House?
0DI0026612	Well, well, well! I've heard of you - the courier upon whom mighty Caesar has bestowed his Mark!
0DI0026614	I want you to witness the fate of Nipton, to memorize every detail. And then, when you move on?
0DI0026615	Well, I'd like you to move west towards the Mojave Outpost, to let the Profligates there know about the little sermon I prepared for them here.
0DI0026619	Heard you helped out Jackson, thanks for that. Caravans are still waiting for clearance to move out, but at least there's movement.
0DI0026620	Coming from the North? Must be crazy to brave those roads.
0DI0026621	Something else you wanted?
0DI0026622	It was such an honor to be here today. I'm so lucky.
0DI0026623	I'm too young to die!
0DI0026624	President Kimball is really well spoken.
0DI0026625	Not right now. President Kimball is giving his speech.
0DI0026626	The Legion is attacking! Run for your lives!
0DI0026628	Report.
0DI0026630	I'll meet you on the observation deck.
0DI0026632	You again. What is it?
0DI0026633	We've got a lot to do to prepare for the President's visit and not much time.
0DI0026634	Have you finished your security sweep?
0DI0026635	Come back in a minute, I'm busy with security matters.
0DI0026636	Shouldn't you be keeping an eye out for anything suspicious?
0DI0026637	Good job today. We got the President out safe and sound and I couldn't have done it without you. You have my thanks.
0DI0026638	Damnit! I can't believe the President is dead. It's all my fault!
0DI0026640	Hey, I heard about you. What can I do for you, friend?
0DI0026643	Is there a problem here?
0DI0026644	You again. What's your problem?
0DI0026645	Do you mind?
0DI0026648	You're cleared to go on through.
0DI0026649	No one can go upstairs without authorization.
0DI0026651	Didn't expect Caesar to send a woman to do this job.
0DI0026652	Oh well, at least you're here now. I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
0DI0026653	It's about time you showed up.
0DI0026654	I was starting to get lonely out here by myself.
0DI0026655	Make it quick. We don't have much time.
0DI0026658	I still haven't found my lucky helmet yet.
0DI0026659	Thanks for finding my lucky helmet. It's my favorite!
0DI0026660	Hey-o!
0DI0026662	What are you doing up here?
0DI0026663	Kind of busy up here.
0DI0026665	Hey, you haven't seen my friend around here, have you? His name is Ben and he's an engineer.
0DI0026666	We were supposed to meet up so we can watch the President's speech together, but he hasn't shown up yet.
0DI0026668	Still no luck finding my friend. He better show up soon.
0DI0026670	We're a bit busy here.
0DI0026671	Why don't you mind your own business.
0DI0026672	Managing security on short notice is going to be tough. We'll have to keep the crowd small for the speech.
0DI0026673	It's unlikely that the Legion will try anything, but we'll be prepared for it anyway.
0DI0026674	We'll keep civilian presence to a minimum. That should avoid any unnecessary risks.
0DI0026675	What the fuck just happened?
0DI0026676	What is going on?
0DI0026677	Quiet, I'm trying to listen to the speech.
0DI0026678	Shh! I want to hear what is going on.
0DI0026679	Leave me alone, I'm trying to pay attention.
0DI0026680	I'm so excited about he President visiting. This is going to be great!
0DI0026681	I'm looking forward to seeing the President.
0DI0026682	I'm just glad to have the day off for this.
0DI0026683	I wonder what President Kimball is going to talk about today.
0DI0026684	That was a great speech.
0DI0026685	That's a nice suit President Kimball had.
0DI0026686	I don't have time to talk right now.
0DI0026687	We need to keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
0DI0026688	Nothing is going to happen to the President on my watch.
0DI0026690	You really saved our asses out there against the Legion. Thanks.
0DI0026691	I can't believe that President Kimball was attacked. I'm just relieved that nothing bad happened to him.
0DI0026692	I can't believe President Kimball is dead. He was a great leader for the NCR.
0DI0026693	So you're the one that has been running errands for Colonel Moore. Do you need something?
0DI0026694	Well look who it is! What can I do for you?
0DI0026695	Always nice to have a friend of the NCR around. What can I help you with?
0DI0026696	You better watch yourself around here. I'm not going to put up with any of your crazy shit.
0DI0026698	You've got a lot of nerves being here. Maybe you should just leave instead.
0DI0026700	I don't think you're in the right place. You looking for something?
0DI0026701	Is there something I can do for you?
0DI0026705	Welcome to Jacobstown, human. You're free to walk around, just don't stare at the Nightkin. They don't like people looking at them.
0DI0026706	And if you're NCR, keep it to yourself. They're not popular around here.
0DI0026707	Got a problem, could use your help. Been having trouble with NCR mercs harassing the town, and they just showed up again.
0DI0026708	Just had to go and start a fight with the mercs, didn't you. Guess we'd better finish things.
0DI0026709	Not the outcome I was hoping for with the mercs. At least it buys us time to build up our defenses.
0DI0026710	Had hoped to start reaching out to NCR, start talking trade and borders. It'll be more difficult now.
0DI0026711	So, Keene's dead. Knew it might come to that some day. Makes things difficult for the town.
0DI0026712	Without Keene, it'll be hard to convince other Nightkin in the wasteland to come here. And harder to get the ones here to stay.
0DI0026713	Was hard enough to convince Keene to come up here in the first place, and you gave him an excuse to leave. Better than killing him, I guess.
0DI0026714	Always a chance I could get him to come back. Not counting on it. Hope the town doesn't take the blame for whatever trouble he gets into.
0DI0026715	I like how you handled Keene. Without the Nightkin around, Jacobstown would be much weaker than it is.
0DI0026717	Huh. I'd heard there were new people in town, but I thought it was more Super Mutants. Nice to meet you - I'm Calamity.
0DI0026718	Losing Marcus is bad news for Jacobstown. I doubt the mutants will stick around for long.
0DI0026719	With Doctor Henry off to rejoin his Enclave friends, he's left it up to me to carry on with the research here.
0DI0026720	Hey, there.
0DI0026721	So, the Reds finally hit us, just like I always said they would. Vegas is still there as far as I know, but that probably won't last long.
0DI0026722	Didn't get accepted into one of the Vaults, so I did the next best thing and had this place built. Got massive debts, but who cares now? Ha!
0DI0026723	It's every man for himself now. Had to take care of the Paulson boy since he knew about this place - these supplies are for me and nobody else.
0DI0026724	There's a woman and her daughter up in one of the rooms at the Lodge. Might go pay 'em a visit tomorrow. A man's got needs.
0DI0026725	Another human. One was enough.
0DI0026726	I always told Marcus we could never get along with humans. I'm right, and he's dead.
0DI0026727	Bother someone else. I don't want anything to do with you.
0DI0026728	Huh. With the big guy dead, I guess we're done here. You've made my employers very happy.
0DI0026729	Our business is with the muties, not you.
0DI0026732	We got nothing left to talk about.
0DI0026733	I hope it will snow later.
0DI0026734	Stupid Big Horners were making noise all night again.
0DI0026735	Spotted some humans down the road. Could be Great Khans again.
0DI0026736	Some days I miss being in the Master's army.
0DI0026737	You think Marcus could get us some miniguns? Or missile launchers?
0DI0026738	Better watch out. Lily's been babbling about her grandkids again.
0DI0026739	Doctor Henry's pretty smart - for a human.
0DI0026740	Ugh. Need to tighten up my vises again.
0DI0026741	Damn mercs. Glad you got rid of them.
0DI0026742	No more reason to stick around since Marcus is dead.
0DI0026743	Thanks for helping Doctor Henry with his research.
0DI0026744	A cure for the Nightkin is supposed to be on the way.
0DI0026745	I heard it'll still be some time before the Nightkin are cured. Hope they stick around that long.
0DI0026746	The Nightkin aren't going to stick around long with Keene dead. Not without a good reason, anyway.
0DI0026747	The Nightkin aren't going to stick around long now that Keene's left. Not without a good reason, anyway.
0DI0026748	Without Marcus, Jacobstown won't last long.
0DI0026749	I like it up here. Nice and cool.
0DI0026750	I'm helping Doctor Henry with his experiment right now, dear. Come see me again in a bit.
0DI0026751	Jimmy? Little Jimmy - my, how you're grown up. So good of you to come visit your grandma.
0DI0026752	My word, but that was a lot of chopping at that casino, dear.
0DI0026753	Naughty children run from their punishment, but we'll find Benny, won't we Leo?
0DI0026754	Heavens to Betsy, but Mr. Benny met a nasty end. I hope you've realized, pumpkin, that crime doesn't pay.
0DI0026755	My, but that Lucky 38 is a large building. And so fancy!
0DI0026756	Leo doesn't like that you left that House man alive, dearie. He thinks you should have let us chop him.
0DI0026757	You should have heard Leo, sweetie. He laughed and laughed when that old man in the box exploded.
0DI0026758	Leo thinks there will be lots more chopping to do now that Caesar is dead. I do hope you'll be careful, pumpkin.
0DI0026759	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, rescuing the President like that!
0DI0026760	Now sweetie, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That goes for learning to ride bikes and killing Presidents!
0DI0026761	Grandma's so proud of her little pumpkin, assassinating the President like that!
0DI0026762	Leo's very grumpy, pumpkin. He wanted to chop the President!
0DI0026763	Look at you, sweetness! Blowing up a robot army all by yourself, isn't that precious?
0DI0026764	Grandma's so worried about her little baby! It's getting dangerous out there in the Wasteland!
0DI0026765	Leo's getting more and more agitated, sweetie. I think he can smell the fight coming.
0DI0026766	I hope you're not thinking about rushing off to that big dam, pumpkin! It's sure to be very dangerous!
0DI0026767	Hello again, dear.
0DI0026769	Oh, thank God! I didn't think I'd ever see another human face down here.
0DI0026770	Please, buddy, you've got to help me. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last with my leg like this.
0DI0026771	Come on man, my leg is killing me.
0DI0026772	Is it safe to leave yet?
0DI0026773	Keep it down, we don't want to alert the freaks.
0DI0026774	No time to talk, we've still got fish heads to deal with.
0DI0026775	Let's talk after we get the hell out of here.
0DI0026776	Well well, it looks like we've cleared them out, damn inbred mutant freaks. Think I'll start heading back to California now.
0DI0026777	There have been way too many catastrophic NCR foul-ups around here for me to risk my life by sticking around.
0DI0026778	Thanks for getting me out of there. I better get started back to California.
0DI0026779	Thanks for helping me out. I won't forget it.
0DI0026780	Unnnh... please... help me.
0DI0026781	Thanks for getting me down from that cross. I owe you one.
0DI0026782	Thanks again for saving my ass.
0DI0026783	Get away from me, you lunatic!
0DI0026784	Anders told me what happened. We owe you one for rescuing him. Tell you what: I can give you caps as a thank you, or a special recipe Jack cooked up.
0DI0026785	Any luck finding Anders?
0DI0026786	You're not one of my regulars. What do you want?
0DI0026787	I've been hearing a lot of good things about you. What's up?
0DI0026788	Hey! Seems like you've been making lots of friends around here.
0DI0026789	Oh, uh, hey - Jack can probably give you a discount, if that'll calm you down.
0DI0026790	Look, we'll be happy to sell you any chems you want, just don't do anything crazy, okay?
0DI0026791	If there's something you want, spill it - otherwise, move along.
0DI0026792	Make it quick - I don't want to be seen with you.
0DI0026793	Dammit, someone offed Motor-Runner! That guy was one of our biggest clients.
0DI0026794	Someone's been picking off the leaders of the Fiends down in New Vegas. That's going to cut into our profits.
0DI0026795	Did you make that delivery yet?
0DI0026797	Whoa. New guy.
0DI0026798	Whoa. New chick.
0DI0026799	Hey, look who it is bringing that good Khan karma around!
0DI0026800	How's my most favoritest friend?
0DI0026801	You seriously ought to mellow out, take some chill pills. I could sell you some, if you want.
0DI0026802	You seem really... high-strung. You know, I'm sure some of what I make my chems out of was an antipsychotic at some point....
0DI0026803	I'm all for live and let live, you know, but a lot of folks around here... umm... aren't.
0DI0026804	Why do you have to harsh my mellow? Just be cool, you dig?
0DI0026806	Looks like we got a new visitor in the ol' Brahmin pen. Not many people coming here in a hurry, only passing through.
0DI0026807	And if you're passing through, you picked a bad time. Road north has gone to hell, and if I let a caravan through, they won't make it.
0DI0026808	Appreciate the help. Wish I had more work for you, but nothing else on the radar at the moment.
0DI0026809	Caravan, citizen, pilgrim, or...?
0DI0026810	Been doing a lot of good work out there, setting an example for the others - I know Ranger Jackson appreciates it.
0DI0026811	Back again, I see. Something you need?
0DI0026812	Got some nerve, coming to an NCR outpost with that look about you. Hope you aren't here to trade, not sure you can afford the prices.
0DI0026813	New face in the Outpost, must've come from the North. So - what'll you have?
0DI0026814	Back round? Just my luck... what'll it be this time?
0DI0026815	Something else you needed? I'm short-handed here.
0DI0026816	Any luck up by the track?
0DI0026817	Hnh - didn't even hear you come up the ramp. You don't broadcast your movements. I like that.
0DI0026818	Hnh. Heard your footsteps coming up the ramp, didn't sound like a trooper or one of the merchants.
0DI0026819	You a Courier? If so, this might be your lucky day... if you don't mind walking a bit and your eyes are good.
0DI0026820	Change your mind? Offer's still open, lot of smoke from Nipton in the East, could use a set of eyes over there.
0DI0026821	You check out the Nipton Town Hall yet? Smoke trail's not getting any shorter.
0DI0026822	Thanks for the assist. Wish others around here had your drive.
0DI0026824	You're the one making a name for yourself among the troops, aren't you? What is it you need?
0DI0026825	Ah, the vaunted hero of the Legion. What can I do for you?
0DI0026826	You've been quite difficult to predict, my friend. I hope I can sway you more solidly to the Legion's way of thinking.
0DI0026827	Caesar is not fond of loose cannons like yourself. I sincerely hope you change your ways before something drastic must occur.
0DI0026828	I've been warned about you. You are perilously close to making an enemy of Caesar, and that is not wise.
0DI0026829	I understand you've been invited to meet with Caesar. You should be aware of the honor you've been granted.
0DI0026830	If we weren't in Khan territory I would kill you where you stand. Caesar will be avenged!
0DI0026831	Caesar's death was tragic, but do not think that it will break the Legion's resolve.
0DI0026832	Caesar's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon, and there will be no stopping our victory.
0DI0026833	Greetings in the name of Caesar.
0DI0026834	I understand you've been talking to the Great Khans about breaking their oaths to great Caesar. I would call that... unwise.
0DI0026835	What more do you want?
0DI0026836	I haven't seen you before - what brings you to the Great Khans?
0DI0026837	It's good to have you here. What can I do for you?
0DI0026838	You honor the Great Khans with your presence. What can I do to help you?
0DI0026839	You're always... interesting to have around.
0DI0026841	If you're smart, you'll find somewhere else to be.
0DI0026842	You're becoming quite the political agitator. I can't say I'm displeased.
0DI0026845	So, the cub enters the wolf's den. What do you want, cub?
0DI0026846	All four of my most trusted advisors have told me we should break our alliance - maybe I should hear you out after all.
0DI0026847	I'm beginning to hear troubling rumors from my advisors. Would you know anything about that?
0DI0026848	More of my advisors are starting to talk openly of breaking our alliance. I wonder where that idea is coming from?
0DI0026849	I understand you dealt the NCR a crushing defeat at Forlorn Hope. I hope that trend continues.
0DI0026850	That's why I've made a decision: I'm naming you my heir. When I die, leadership of the Great Khans will pass to you.
0DI0026851	You've been doing good things for us - don't think I haven't noticed. What can I do for you?
0DI0026852	It's always a pleasure to see you around the camp.
0DI0026853	Are you going to help us this time, or vex us?
0DI0026854	And so the unpredictable one returns. What do you want from us?
0DI0026855	I've got little enough patience for you. Consider your words carefully - you don't want me as an enemy.
0DI0026856	In the past, I'd have had someone like you executed for showing their face here - consider yourself lucky I don't have the warriors to spare.
0DI0026857	Ah, you're back. What else do you need?
0DI0026858	Not now, I'm busy.
0DI0026859	You look like someone with a question. What can I do for you?
0DI0026860	I'm so much happier now. Thank you again.
0DI0026862	Oh look, it's the conformist tool.
0DI0026863	How much ass did you have to kick to get Papa Khan to like you so much?
0DI0026865	I can't believe you're talking to me, this is so cool! I mean, uh... dude, what's up?
0DI0026866	You going to make fun of me too?
0DI0026867	I really don't want to deal with this right now.
0DI0026869	You're here for the money. I told the Omertas I was good for it! I just need more time!
0DI0026870	You're not part of my unit... no, you're here for the money! I told the Omertas I was good for it!
0DI0026871	Oh, uh, hey.
0DI0026872	No run-ins with the Great Khans, I hope? They've been more restless than usual.
0DI0026873	This area isn't safe for civilians. You don't want to get caught by the Great Khans.
0DI0026875	This post isn't someplace a civilian ought to be.
0DI0026876	You a transfer from one of the other posts? I haven't seen you around before.
0DI0026877	You're really not supposed to be here.
0DI0026878	You're not part of this post as far as I know. What do you want?
0DI0026879	This is a military outpost. Why are you here?
0DI0026881	Hey there. Is McCarran having you check up on us?
0DI0026882	McCarran doesn't like it when civilians wander into military outposts, so if you're here on business, better make it quick.
0DI0026883	You're back. What's up?
0DI0026884	You better get moving kid, there's bad guys to kill.
0DI0026885	Kreger's the officer here, not me. The final say on the plan is up to him.
0DI0026886	Moreno and I never did get along. Still, he was a fellow soldier from the old days.
0DI0026887	The NCR's the best bet for the wasteland. I'm glad we'll be helping them out.
0DI0026888	I'm not helping the Legion, no matter how much you talk them up. I will help my friends prepare, but that's it.
0DI0026889	Well, it's about about damn time. What took you... oh.
0DI0026890	What brings you around this time?
0DI0026891	Let's get going, we have a battle to win.
0DI0026892	You don't strike me as someone down on their luck. What brings you to Westside?
0DI0026893	Glad to see you made it here all right. So, who are we going up against?
0DI0026894	Still waiting on that decision...
0DI0026895	We saw everything through the security monitor. I had no idea Moreno would ever pull something like that.
0DI0026896	By rights, Moreno's Power Armor now belongs to you. Whitman's volunteered to show you how to use it, so talk to her as soon as you can.
0DI0026897	Moreno's a stubborn son of a bitch, but he's also tougher than any of us. I'm glad you were able to talk him into staying.
0DI0026898	Since Whitman will be staying with the vertibird, she's offered to give her old suit of Power Armor to you.
0DI0026899	You'll need special training to use it properly, so talk to her as soon as you get the chance.
0DI0026900	We'll be ready, don't worry.
0DI0026901	Sticking around for the attractions?
0DI0026902	We're all here. Talk to Kreger about what you've got in mind.
0DI0026903	If I had any idea Moreno was capable of doing something that, I'd have warned you. I'm sorry it played out like this.
0DI0026904	The NCR's got its share of warts, but I'd rather have them around than the Legion.
0DI0026905	I'm not sure if helping the Legion is the right idea. But, I'm going along with it.
0DI0026906	Keep your head down - could be snipers around.
0DI0026907	I assume this is about something important? You're interrupting my research.
0DI0026908	The equipment is hooked up and ready. We can start the test as soon as you give me the go ahead.
0DI0026909	Again you interrupt me. Why?
0DI0026911	What are you talking to me for? Talk to Kreger.
0DI0026912	Now is not the time!
0DI0026913	Bah. Looks like I forgot to lock the doors again. If you're with the NCR, get out. This place is mine, and I'm not leaving.
0DI0026914	Look, trooper, I was living in this house long before your farms got set up. Don't even think about evicting me.
0DI0026915	I didn't come all the way out here just so we could save the fucking NCR. I'm out.
0DI0026916	I can't believe I'm going to help the NCR.
0DI0026917	Since Johnson won't be coming with us, you might as well take his suit of Power Armor. I'll teach you the basics of how to use it.
0DI0026919	I'm ready to fly once we've got a plan. Talk to Judah.
0DI0026920	Damn it, Orion. Why did you have to go and do something like that?
0DI0026921	Orion always did have a temper, but it was pretty low of him to ambush you like that.
0DI0026922	I appreciate you keeping Orion in the group. Since I won't be needing my armor - makes the cockpit a bit cramped - you should take it.
0DI0026923	It'll take a few hours to show you how to use it properly, so let's get started.
0DI0026924	I'd love to see the look on the NCR's face when I swoop down in my chopper.
0DI0026925	I heard the Legion doesn't care for women, but as long as they stay out of my way, I'll get along just fine with them.
0DI0026926	Fine weather for flying. It's times like these that make me miss it all.
0DI0026927	Your travels been going all right?
0DI0026928	Oh, you here to work? I think I have an extra shovel around here somewhere.
0DI0026929	Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now. Talk to Trent, he might be able to help you out.
0DI0026930	Greetings! Pardon my enthusiasm. I'm not accustomed to meeting so many new people, but I find you fascinating.
0DI0026931	I've tried to learn as much as possible about the surface world since our community left our home.
0DI0026932	Hello again, outlander.
0DI0026933	Why are the outlanders killing each other? Why do they treat us like machines? I wish we had remained in the safety, and sanity, of our Vault.
0DI0026934	Hello, outlander.
0DI0026935	It's good making your acquaintance.
0DI0026936	Excuse me, I'm... not from around here.
0DI0026937	Horowitz is our leader.
0DI0026938	You're the one who saved us! Thank you.
0DI0026939	I heard you talking to Horowitz, and can't thank you enough for what you've done for us.
0DI0026940	I hope everyone on the surface is like you.
0DI0026941	We're in your debt. Thank you, outlander.
0DI0026942	I wish we were back at our Vault.
0DI0026943	The surface world is a cruel place.
0DI0026944	Why are you people treating us like this?
0DI0026945	We're heading back home. I hope our troops do the same. This land can't be saved.
0DI0026946	Trying to grow crops in this heat, with so little water, is bad enough, but now we've got radiation seeping into the farmlands east of New Vegas.
0DI0026947	We're done. Let the people of these hell-hole deal with their problems, I say.
0DI0026948	I can't wait to get back to NCR lands.
0DI0026949	All our work was for nothing.
0DI0026950	We should've never come here.
0DI0026951	Good riddance, Mojave.
0DI0026953	Thank you for coming, let's talk about that robot.
0DI0026954	Have you given any more thought to my offer?
0DI0026955	I'd like to talk to you about your robot. Bring it here and we can talk. I'm sure we can be of mutual benefit to each other.
0DI0026956	Peace, traveler.
0DI0026957	You again? What 'cha need, champ?
0DI0026958	Unless you wanna slap leather with me you'll put that gun down, friend.
0DI0026959	Hey there. Need anything?
0DI0026960	If it isn't the courier who's done everything he can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
0DI0026961	If it isn't the courier who's done everything she can to defy the will of mighty Caesar!
0DI0026962	The Legion holds Nelson, Profligate! This is where you'll die. Brothers, attack!
0DI0026963	Have you come to Nelson seeking your death, Profligate?
0DI0026964	I waited months to get in here, but the place isn't nearly full. You think the waiting list is just for hype?
0DI0026965	The food here is to die for. No one cooks Brahmin like Philippe.
0DI0026966	The torching is Philippe's idea. Brilliant, no?
0DI0026967	Keep away from me, if you know what's good for you.
0DI0026968	You look positively famished. We simply can't have that.
0DI0026969	Welcome to Top Shelf. The drinks cost twice as much during happy hour, but they draw twice the attention, too.
0DI0026971	What's this about the White Glove Society?
0DI0026972	You got me my boy back. I got no words.
0DI0026973	Now... I hope you didn't do no harm to whoever's responsible for this. I wanna skin their hides myself.
0DI0026974	You got a lot of nerve sticking around here. If I didn't have better things to do I'd thump your skull for what you said.
0DI0026975	Tell me good news.
0DI0026976	Ted, where are you, boy?
0DI0026977	Beg your pardon, stranger, but I'm looking for someone. You ain't seen a young man with dark brown hair and a white hat on lately, have you?
0DI0026978	You ain't heard anything about my boy, have you?
0DI0026979	You done right by me. I appreciate it.
0DI0026980	Oh- oh my. How unfortunate! And in front of all these people, too.
0DI0026981	He always was a bit of a pill, Mortimer. He was so pouty when I decided to ban eating people. And now this.
0DI0026982	I should've paid more attention to the warning signs.
0DI0026983	Can you imagine what people would've said? Why, it would've been a complete scandal if it weren't for you.
0DI0026984	To think, Mr. Gunderson, a cold-blooded murderer. It's simply chilling.
0DI0026985	But his arrest ought to instill faith in our patrons that murderers are not welcome to gamble here.
0DI0026986	What a disaster! An important person dead in my hotel.
0DI0026987	Now people will confuse us with Gomorrah. The idea!
0DI0026988	So glad you could be here tonight. I had hoped you would join us.
0DI0026989	Welcome to the Ultra-Luxe. I do hope it exceeds your every expectation.
0DI0026990	You double-crossing snake! I have nothing to say to someone so lowly and ill-mannered.
0DI0026991	I wanted Mr. Gunderson out of the way, not slaughtered in my hotel! Our business is concluded. Good day!
0DI0026992	You've done enough!
0DI0026993	Mark my words. I'll have you filleted for this.
0DI0026994	Ah, you're back. You're always a welcome guest here.
0DI0026995	Any word as to our arrangement?
0DI0026996	What the- ? Who is this trespasser?
0DI0026997	How may I be of service, sir?
0DI0026998	How may I be of service, madam?
0DI0026999	Who are you?
0DI0027000	You'll have to excuse me. There's somewhere I need to be right now.
0DI0027002	Leave me alone. Haven't you done enough?
0DI0027003	Why are you standing still? Do you think that the world waits for you while you you stand there drooling? Get back out there and get to work!
0DI0027004	Can't you see I'm busy?
0DI0027005	I thought I told you to get lost.
0DI0027007	How may I assist?
0DI0027008	Come on, move it.
0DI0027009	My daddy's gonna kill all you bastards once he finds out what you done to me.
0DI0027010	You know, if you knew what you were doing I coulda been out of there hours ago.
0DI0027011	Beg your pardon, but could I trouble you to turn over your weapons?
0DI0027012	You! What do you think you're doing?
0DI0027013	The sooner you find yourself elsewhere, the better.
0DI0027018	Mortimer's vision was absolutely inspired.
0DI0027019	Now it can truly be said that not only to we dress better than anyone, we eat better as well.
0DI0027020	I supported Mortimer from the beginning.
0DI0027021	Of course cannibalism is civilized! It's all a matter of perspective.
0DI0027023	Have you been inside our bathhouse? The salts in the water work to balance the bodily humors.
0DI0027024	To eat at the Gourmand is to spoil the palate. I can't bring myself to eat anywhere else.
0DI0027025	Did you see Heck Gunderson the brahmin baron at the bar? He may be a wastelander, but his taste clearly befits his status.
0DI0027026	Certainly you can buy the same drinks more cheaply elsewhere, but the point of drinking at Top Shelf isn't the liquor. It's the prestige.
0DI0027027	Marjorie has done a remarkable job managing the restoration of this place, wouldn't you agree?
0DI0027028	Our executive chef Philippe is the toast of New Vegas. His Brahmin Wellington is absolutely sublime.
0DI0027029	You watch yourself around Mr. Gunderson.
0DI0027030	Keep your distance. Who are you, and what do you want?
0DI0027031	It smells so good in here. Like the air is cleaner than it is outside.
0DI0027032	I heard they brought in sea salts from California just for this bath.
0DI0027033	I'm so relaxed. Too bad I can't stay longer. But who can, at these prices?
0DI0027034	Have you been in the steam room yet? It's just off to the side there. You can feel your aches just melt away.
0DI0027035	Every evening most of the White Glove Society sneaks away somewhere. It's probably just for show.
0DI0027036	I'm in Heaven. I haven't had a meal like this in... well... ever, really.
0DI0027037	Philippe has outdone himself again.
0DI0027038	For the price of this meal I could buy a whole Brahmin. But I'd never make that trade.
0DI0027039	Hey, any idea how somebody gets into the White Glove Society? Have to know somebody?
0DI0027040	They must've spent a fortune renovating this place.
0DI0027041	I love the masks. It's like being at a fancy ball.
0DI0027042	I'm not really gambling. I'm just hoping to be seen here. People will think I'm rich.
0DI0027043	I've heard you have to make reservations at the Gourmand years in advance.
0DI0027044	Those masks make me nervous. Is there something wrong with their faces?
0DI0027045	There are a lot of rumors going around about the White Glove Society. I heard they used to be tribals.
0DI0027046	Top Shelf is the premiere bar on the Strip. The drinks are overpriced, but that's the whole point.
0DI0027056	Like I said, I needed to go do something. This is it. It belonged to my father.
0DI0027057	Since you convinced me to help out with the defense of Hoover Dam, I figured I'd haul it out of storage.
0DI0027058	I'm a little rusty with it but... I think I can manage. As long as you've got my back, of course.
0DI0027060	I thought I might wear it at Hoover Dam, but after you talked me out of it, I didn't see the point in hanging on to it any longer.
0DI0027061	I'm here because of you, so I figure you're the one most deserving of it. It should protect you from everything short of a Plasma Caster.
0DI0027062	And if you need anything - anything at all - you know where to find me.
0DI0027063	Hey there. Was it always your plan to sell me into slavery to Caesar, or was that a spur of the moment thing?
0DI0027064	Why don't you make like Odysseus and get lost?
0DI0027065	For as lack of adornment is said to become some women, so will this place, without your presence, bring delight.
0DI0027066	I've run out of witty ways to tell you to leave, so why don't you just go?
0DI0027067	If you want to talk, take off that ridiculous Legion uniform. It's insulting.
0DI0027068	Hi. If you're looking for medical help, try the other doctors. I'm just a researcher. Not even a particularly good one.
0DI0027069	Hello, again. Still in one piece, I see.
0DI0027071	Well, we've had some laughs, you and I, but it looks like you're a crazy person and I'm going to have to leave.
0DI0027072	Moreno took the fall of the Enclave hard. He never questioned his orders, never questioned the legitimacy of what the Enclave was doing.
0DI0027073	To him, it was all one unbroken chain, from Washington to Richardson. When we left Navarro, I remember looking up at Moreno.
0DI0027074	He said, "Kiss America goodbye, boys." When we left the Enclave behind, the love in him burned itself out. Now there's just a bitter old man left.
0DI0027075	Since my mother died, Daisy's been the only woman in my life. She was the only other woman close to my father, too.
0DI0027076	She flew him out on over a dozen missions, including his last. I've always been close to Daisy.
0DI0027077	There have been some good men along the way, but lovers make poor confidants. Daisy never had children of her own, so she was always there to listen.
0DI0027078	Being in the Enclave didn't mean much to her. She just loved to fly. It broke her heart to be grounded.
0DI0027079	Doc Henry always was a hard one to figure out. It didn't seem to matter whether he was working with humans or dogs.
0DI0027080	He had an equal lack of affection for both. A regular Diogenes. I'm not sure what the man was after.
0DI0027081	"Knowledge is power," but to what end for Henry, I have no idea. The problem was what mattered to him, not its practical impact.
0DI0027082	He simply solved riddles because they existed.
0DI0027083	If I had to pick anyone who didn't belong in the Enclave, it would definitely be Johnson. He hated what the Enclave was doing.
0DI0027084	Day to day, week to week, he would question orders, subvert mission objectives, do anything he could to serve without serving.
0DI0027085	It's amazing he was never court-martialed. He always had good things to say about my father. Said I was like him in a lot of ways. I wish I knew.
0DI0027086	Judah Kreger is the glue that's kept us all together over the years, and with good reason.
0DI0027087	Anyone who can command Moreno and Johnson in the same unit without somebody getting fragged is one hell of a leader.
0DI0027088	Kreger was polite and kind, but never warm. He always did his best to make me feel welcome in the group.
0DI0027089	I think he did it out of a sense of loyalty to my father. Loyalty means a lot to Judah.
0DI0027090	Not loyalty to the Enclave, or even the ideals they fought for, but to the people who served with him.
0DI0027091	I'd like to say that I saw this coming, but honestly I was oblivious. For what it's worth, I'll do what I can to help you... not get killed?
0DI0027092	So Mr. House doesn't care that one of Caesar's most notorious Legion spies is walking around on the Strip.
0DI0027093	Either that or his Securitrons' AI is too primitive to recognize the threat. Neither answer is particularly comforting.
0DI0027094	Oh, hello Emily. Yes, it is I, Arcade Gannon, fellow member of the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI0027095	Would I like to help infiltrate the Lucky 38? I'm so glad you asked...
0DI0027096	That's a lot of energy weapons. Brings back some interesting memories.
0DI0027097	The Strip's not a bad place if you love terrible things and people. I'll never understand the allure of giving away your money to the rich.
0DI0027098	I've read about REPCONN. I think they did some work with the...  the government before the war. Rockets and some energy weapon prototypes, I think.
0DI0027099	Westside, huh? I passed through here with another Follower a while back, Anderson. The locals were having a lot of trouble getting water through.
0DI0027100	Westside, huh? I heard about what happened with Anderson. Can't say I'm surprised. He was always a fringe operator in the Followers.
0DI0027101	What's wrong with you? Killing Anderson isn't going to bring Corporal White back.
0DI0027102	Interesting way of handling things. Very sub rosa.
0DI0027103	I don't know if the scorpions deserved to be wiped out for something they didn't do, but that's one less problem Westside has to deal with.
0DI0027104	Anderson turned in for the wrong reason and Westside gets to keep siphoning water.
0DI0027105	It's hard to find justice in all of this, but I suppose this is as close as it gets. Thanks.
0DI0027106	Extortion? Really? You go through all of this only to extort the people who are trying to help Westside? Unbelievable.
0DI0027107	Hildern is a good example of "big picture" obsession gone too far.
0DI0027108	At some point he became so fixated on large scale results that he lost the concept of "the common good" along the way.
0DI0027109	It's an inhumane kind of public service when people and the basic resources they need become numbers in a ledger.
0DI0027110	A vertibird. Interesting. It's been a long time since I've seen one of these.
0DI0027111	Wait, wait, wait a second. What's going on? Am I playing Vergil to your Dante?
0DI0027112	I'd like to assume that we're tiptoeing into the mouth of hell out of academic curiosity, but I'm not so open-minded that I've lost my brains.
0DI0027113	I guess I'll wait out here, then.
0DI0027114	I need to talk to you about something, if you have a minute.
0DI0027115	Thanks for doing this, getting them all back together again.
0DI0027116	I'll be honest, when Moreno started going off, I didn't think we'd all be walking out of there in one piece.
0DI0027117	I still don't know how this is all going to shake out in the end, but at least the Enclave can atone a bit for all the damage it's done.
0DI0027118	I shouldn't be surprised at what happened with Moreno. I hoped that after all this time, he could put his anger behind him.
0DI0027119	Maybe everything good in Orion Moreno died at Navarro and it was foolish to think there was anything in him left to salvage.
0DI0027120	You got the survivors of the Enclave back together so you could convince them to help Caesar?!
0DI0027121	What are you thinking? Do you want to see Vegas turned into the new slave capital of the west?
0DI0027122	Hey. You're your own person and all that, but you're acting crazy, and if you keep it up, I'm going to leave.
0DI0027123	I like how you handled that. Nicely done.
0DI0027124	I can't say that's how I would have handled that, but...
0DI0027125	You're that courier, right? The guy who runs the Tops, Benny... heard he tried to kill you.
0DI0027126	I guess that didn't work out very well for him. Should I watch my back around you?
0DI0027127	Oh, you're that courier, aren't you? The one who got mixed up with Benny over at the Tops. Sounds like messy business.
0DI0027128	I'm no botanist, but I think this may not be entirely natural.
0DI0027129	Nuclear waste disposal. Pre-War, people figured there was so much desert in Nevada, you might as well turn it into a big dumping ground.
0DI0027130	People didn't like it, but they weren't about to give up easy access to power, not with all of the petroleum drying up.
0DI0027131	It's a shame what happened up here. I understand arguments about the "fog of war", but that can't be much consolation to the survivors.
0DI0027132	Or to the NCR soldiers who have to live with what they did here.
0DI0027133	In case it's not obvious, I think you should redirect the power to Freeside and outer Vegas.
0DI0027134	You activated ARCHIMEDES?! What the hell are you thinking?!
0DI0027135	Nicely done. I'm sure people will appreciate the power. I hate to have to rely on it, but out here... it makes a big difference.
0DI0027136	Hmm. I suppose an even distribution is better than nothing.
0DI0027137	Everything to the Strip and McCarran? Are you kidding?
0DI0027138	I guess I should be grateful you didn't activate the laser.
0DI0027139	You have to hand it to the NCR. Get enough hands working together and they can make or break just about anything.
0DI0027140	I'm not exactly a mercenary, but taking out scumbags of this magnitude wouldn't cause me to lose any sleep.
0DI0027141	Well, I'll be. Hoover Dam. One of the last remaining functioning wonders of the Pre-War world.
0DI0027142	I'm amazed it's still running at all. Too bad everyone's killing each other over it.
0DI0027143	What a load of Brahmin shit! Can you believe that guy?
0DI0027144	<groan>
0DI0027145	<grunt>
0DI0027146	NCR military transmissions say the robots on the Strip have been upgraded. Wish we had eyes-on intel...
0DI0027147	Mr. House is out of the picture. Probably killed by his own robots.
0DI0027148	I heard you took out Caesar by yourself. Proves the Legion is just a bunch of savages, like we thought.
0DI0027150	NCR military radio keeps talking about Mr. House agreeing to join the NCR. What changed his mind?
0DI0027151	Someone blew up the monorail the NCR uses to travel to the Strip and back. We should use this time to strike!
0DI0027153	There's a rumor going around that you saved the NCR president's life. I'm surprised you have the stones to show your face around here.
0DI0027155	Were you the one who killed the NCR president? I'd like to shake your hand!
0DI0027164	Keep an eye on Veronica here. She's a sharp one.
0DI0027165	Try to keep Veronica out of trouble, would you?
0DI0027166	If you're planning to take Veronica with you, be sure to have a good pair of earplugs with you. I'm kidding, Veronica! Put the power fist down!
0DI0027167	What a fascinating animal. I'm sure the scribes will want to take a look at him.
0DI0027168	Is that a Mk. III Support Model you have with you? I've seen references to them, but never with my own eyes. I imagine he makes a great pet.
0DI0027169	Where did you get that Eyebot? I've never seen one modified quite like that.
0DI0027170	Keep that mutant in line, or we'll put it down.
0DI0027171	Oh good, now I have to put up with the stench of rotting ghoul as well. I hope the air filters are working.
0DI0027172	I've heard that your friend there can put some of the senior scribes to shame.
0DI0027173	Why is your friend there glaring at me like that? Did I bump into him or something?
0DI0027174	Don't bother me. I'm on patrol.
0DI0027176	I've important work to do, so no time to talk.
0DI0027177	Does Ramos know you're walking around without a guard?
0DI0027178	Keep up the good work, outsider.
0DI0027179	I hear you've been making yourself useful. Unlike some people I could mention.
0DI0027180	Are you adjusting to the bunker, outsider?
0DI0027181	Just between you and me, I'm glad you're here. This place needed a fresh face.
0DI0027182	You've been a great help, outsider. Thank you for all your hard work.
0DI0027183	Greetings, out- excuse me, I guess I need to stop calling you that, don't I?
0DI0027184	So you're one of us now, eh? Truly it is a rare honor.
0DI0027186	I'd rather not talk to you, outsider.
0DI0027187	I'd rather not associate with you. Excuse me.
0DI0027188	Why the Elder didn't just have you shot is beyond me.
0DI0027189	Don't talk to me. You've caused more than enough damage.
0DI0027190	Ramos is keeping an eye on you, outsider. Remember that.
0DI0027191	You certainly make life more interesting, outsider.
0DI0027192	Some of the others may look the other way, but I don't trust you.
0DI0027193	You're going to have to clean up your act if you want some respect around here, outsider.
0DI0027194	Just when I think I've got you figured out, you go and surprise me.
0DI0027195	I don't trust you, outsider, but I can't help but like you.
0DI0027196	You're alright, outsider. Most of the time, anyway.
0DI0027197	I have two hours of weapons training every morning. It is a good way to start the day.
0DI0027198	Hardin is a tough man, but fair. I'd follow him into battle any day.
0DI0027199	There are whispers that McNamara's lost his nerve. I can't believe that, not after what he did at HELIOS One.
0DI0027200	How long before we resume normal patrols?
0DI0027201	After the battle at HELIOS One, some people were worried about the NCR coming after us, but this bunker is secure.
0DI0027202	Ramos runs a tight ship. We haven't had an incident in over a year. Your arrival excluded, of course.
0DI0027203	Hardin will be Elder soon, mark my words.
0DI0027204	Why are we hiding down here? We should be avenging our fallen brothers!
0DI0027205	HELIOS will be ours again someday.
0DI0027206	When are these night missions going to end?
0DI0027207	Ugh, more VR training. Maybe I'll hit the shooting range instead.
0DI0027208	Maintaining the machinery around here is important. We have to breathe, after all.
0DI0027209	After this I have some weapons to repair.
0DI0027210	If I do a good job, I might be up for promotion to Paladin soon.
0DI0027211	Power armor is pretty intricately made. It's not an easy thing to fix.
0DI0027212	Have you seen the dust storm above? I worked on that machine!
0DI0027213	If it's not broken power armor, it's broken electrical fixtures.
0DI0027214	If it's not broken weapons, it's broken power armor.
0DI0027215	I'm really busy now, sorry.
0DI0027216	I don't think these repairs will ever end.
0DI0027217	Our early test results look promising.
0DI0027218	I heard the Elder's got Taggart working on some kind of secret project.
0DI0027219	Every day we come one step closer to reclaiming the glory of the past.
0DI0027220	Even though the patrols no longer go out, we've got a backlog of devices that require investigation.
0DI0027221	Why is it so important that we research night vision optics?
0DI0027222	I'd kill to go outside and gather some specimens.
0DI0027223	Everyone says I'm crazy, but I still say it'd be a great advancement if doors opened once you got close to them.
0DI0027224	The loss of HELIOS was terrible, but this bunker is a wonder of its own.
0DI0027225	If we could just combine the best qualities of laser and plasma weaponry...
0DI0027226	It pains me to think of the scientific wonders at HELIOS One, now in NCR hands.
0DI0027227	But if I adjust the magnetic field, perhaps the resulting change in wavelength will- excuse me, I'm merely thinking out loud.
0DI0027228	We have a duty to preserve the past.
0DI0027229	Only a few people get to venture outside, usually to trade for food.
0DI0027230	You've been outside. Is the NCR really still hunting us?
0DI0027231	McNamara's done a pretty good job, given the situation he was handed.
0DI0027232	Our former Elder, Elijah, was obsessed with new technology. That's why we were at HELIOS in the first place.
0DI0027233	Hardin owes his life to McNamara. That's why he won't challenge him outright.
0DI0027234	As much as I'm sick of Taggart's VR sims, I have to admit we wouldn't be combat ready without them.
0DI0027235	Doc Schuler is a lifesaver. I was hurt in training the other day and she fixed me right up.
0DI0027236	The Lucky 38's reactor has been restarted... it can be seen from miles away.
0DI0027237	Sharing knowledge with an outsider organization. I knew Veronica couldn't be trusted.
0DI0027238	We tracked your movements a long way. But it was worth it to catch her in the act.
0DI0027239	Passing Brotherhood secrets to outsiders is the lowest form of treason. What have you got to say for yourself?
0DI0027240	We heard Veronica talking with the Elder. We won't stand for this.
0DI0027241	What is this? Veronica brings an outsider into our home, then has a private audience with the Elder?
0DI0027242	The two of you may have the Elder fooled, but we know better.
0DI0027243	Veronica has always twisted the Founder's principles to her own ends. We will not stand idly by and allow her to corrupt our Elder's thinking.
0DI0027244	This had better be good. You have a lot to answer for.
0DI0027245	What can the Followers of the Apocalypse do for you today?
0DI0027246	Welcome to the New Vegas Medical Clinic. I'm a fully qualified physician and can fix whatever is wrong with you for a reasonable fee.
0DI0027247	If you've got the caps, I've also got several implants available to enhance your physical attributes.
0DI0027248	You're back. Do you need medical attention?
0DI0027249	I'm just security, not a doctor.
0DI0027250	A customer! Not many people come into Boulder City these days.
0DI0027251	Howdy, trooper. I thought the Big Horn was off limits to you guys, but who am I to complain? A customer is a customer.
0DI0027252	Surprising that the Khans are going to walk out of here after all that fuss.
0DI0027253	Guess those Khans got what was coming to them, huh?
0DI0027254	Hope those Great Khans don't come trash my saloon. I'm not part of the NCR!
0DI0027255	Welcome back to the Big Horn. What can I get you?
0DI0027256	Kill every last one of those NCR troopers and then we'll talk.
0DI0027257	What the hell? You're that courier Benny wasted back in Goodsprings. You're supposed to be dead.
0DI0027258	I'm getting real tired of talking.
0DI0027259	Still got a bit of a walk ahead of us. Talk fast.
0DI0027260	We've got a situation with some Great Khans right now. The brass at McCarran has ordered me to lock down the ruins until it's been resolved.
0DI0027261	Can't talk. We didn't get all the Great Khans yet.
0DI0027262	Where do you think you're going? I can't let you go into the ruins, not without a reason.
0DI0027263	How are negotiations with the Great Khans going?
0DI0027264	I'm glad you were able to get my people freed, but there's a new problem. I just got orders to take out the Great Khans, hostages or not.
0DI0027265	When I heard the shots, I figured your negotiation went bad. What the hell happened?
0DI0027266	The Great Khans can go, just as we agreed.
0DI0027267	Ackerman and Gilbert aren't back yet. What's the holdup?
0DI0027268	Thanks for getting both of my people out of there.
0DI0027269	I'm sorry that you couldn't get both hostages out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
0DI0027270	I'm sorry that you couldn't get either hostage out alive, but that's how it goes sometimes. Thanks for your help.
0DI0027271	I really don't have the time to chatter right now.
0DI0027272	Thanks for the rescue.
0DI0027273	Man, I thought I was dead for sure.
0DI0027275	I'm glad that's over. Thank you.
0DI0027276	You here to pay your respects, too?
0DI0027277	Hello again. Is there something you need from me?
0DI0027278	What the fuck are you doing? My brother died at the Battle of Hoover Dam. You're desecrating a war memorial.
0DI0027279	I've got nothing else to say to you.
0DI0027280	If you're down on your luck and need some caps, I buy just about anything. Of course, I've also got plenty of things for sale, too.
0DI0027281	Here to do business?
0DI0027282	Howdy. Name's Bob, but folks around here call me Klamath Bob. What can I do you for?
0DI0027283	Hey, stranger. Hope you been well. What do you need?
0DI0027284	Nng. Hi.
0DI0027285	Nng. Hi again.
0DI0027286	Hi there. Welcome to the Westside Co-op. I'm Clayton Ettienne. Let me know if you have any questions.
0DI0027287	Welcome back. How can I help you?
0DI0027288	Uh... hi.
0DI0027289	Oh, hello.
0DI0027290	Agh! I wasn't doing anything!
0DI0027293	Hey, you got a second?
0DI0027294	I'd slap him around, but he stood at my parents' wedding.
0DI0027295	Plus he used to make excuses to get me out of my punishment when I'd slept through Head Scribe Taggart's lectures. Figure I owe him for that.
0DI0027296	<Sighs> He means well.
0DI0027297	I'd be angrier with him, but it's hard to stay mad at the guy who taught me how to box when all the other Paladins told me no.
0DI0027298	<Sighs> He always does what he feels is right. Usually that's a great quality.
0DI0027299	Let's see what we've got here... Okay, yeah, this is the one I was thinking of. The pulse gun.
0DI0027300	Although maybe the rangefinder could work too. And it looks like the NCR was onto some miracle farming technology.
0DI0027301	He wouldn't listen. The truth was right there staring him in the face. How could he not listen?
0DI0027302	God. I should get used to this, I guess. People get desperate, they turn on each other. First thing to go is trust.
0DI0027303	I don't think it's ever gonna be the same for me in there. Knowing no matter what I do, it's gonna end badly.
0DI0027304	But they're all I have.
0DI0027305	God, I did this. This was my fault. Why didn't I see this coming?
0DI0027306	Of course they'd track me. Of course they'd assume the worst. Sure, I left them. But that didn't mean I'd ever be free of them.
0DI0027307	I should've known I was beaten before I began. I just... I had to try, you know?
0DI0027308	Well, if there was any question whether I should leave, I guess there's my answer.
0DI0027309	Why did you do that? They were going to let us walk away. Why did you attack them?
0DI0027310	I don't care that they started it. What you did was inexcusable. You need to go.
0DI0027311	Clearly you're determined to fight the Brotherhood. Well, you can add my name to your hit list because you're on your own.
0DI0027312	Okay, listen. The Brotherhood... they're not always the friendliest bunch. But I won't stand for you fighting them.
0DI0027313	This is your last chance.
0DI0027314	See? Pretty addictive, right? You do it once, it just makes you want to do it more.
0DI0027315	You can't help but notice that the Brotherhood barely exists to these people out here. We're like an urban myth. No real presence on the Outside.
0DI0027316	We just don't adapt like we should. Used to be that all you needed to get your way was a suit of power armor and a laser rifle.
0DI0027317	Now... people are armed and organized. They're not afraid. But we still stick to our old approach, because it's all we know.
0DI0027318	You know, I've been thinking. The real problem with the Brotherhood is that we isolate ourselves.
0DI0027319	Our training is top-notch, our technology gives us an advantage, but when it all comes down to it, we're losing because we shun the outside world.
0DI0027320	We always make enemies, never allies. We refuse to recruit outsiders, or see the value in their simpler technologies.
0DI0027321	Hold on. I see something I want to punch.
0DI0027322	No offense, but you look like you've traveled a long way down some bad roads. Where'd you come from?
0DI0027323	Couldn't get enough of talking to me the first time, huh?
0DI0027324	Listen... I want to thank you for helping me out. I'm sorry that... things didn't go like I'd hoped.
0DI0027325	But at least I got the chance to try. At least I know for sure that there was nothing I could do.
0DI0027326	Thank you for giving me that chance.
0DI0027327	Wow, Mr. House is looking for you, huh? What do you think he wants? Bowling partner?
0DI0027328	What'd you think of Mr. House? I was surprised he only had the two robot sex slaves.
0DI0027329	That chip of yours... I wouldn't wager it on blackjack.
0DI0027330	Unless the dealer has a five or six showing.
0DI0027331	Whole future of New Vegas seems like it's up in the air. Guess I should wait things out before buying a condo in the Ultra-Luxe, huh?
0DI0027332	Hope you're picking the winning side here. Be nice to fight for someone who's gonna be around for a while.
0DI0027333	Next stop, Hoover Dam, huh? When we get there... can we stop by the souvenir shop? Their beaver mascot is just precious.
0DI0027335	Who the fuck are you?
0DI0027336	Shut up and keep going.
0DI0027337	I don't know where the hell you're going but it's not the right way. Are you still in this?
0DI0027344	Hang on there, traveler. You'll want to steer clear of this place - the whole town is irradiated to high hell.
0DI0027345	How are you coming with the dog tags?
0DI0027346	You're back. What can I do for you?
0DI0027351	Who the hell are you? Better yet, what the hell are you doing in this cursed place?
0DI0027352	You know what? Forget it, it doesn't matter. Welcome to Camp Searchlight, the shittiest place on earth.
0DI0027358	Hold up! There are Deathclaws all over the damn place north of here. I'd turn back if I were you.
0DI0027359	If you want to get to New Vegas, you're better off heading east from Primm and then looping north. It's a heck of a lot safer.
0DI0027360	Can't believe anyone actually made it through from the north, what with all the Deathclaws at the quarry. You returning from New Vegas?
0DI0027362	Let me ask you a question - what's the tastiest thing you've ever eaten?
0DI0027363	This is incredibly good. Here's your omelet, and the recipe if you ever want to make your own. It takes a bit of skill to get it tasting right.
0DI0027364	Hey there. What's new?
0DI0027365	That's close enough. What do you want with the Great Khans?
0DI0027366	Nice outfit, but I know you're not one of us. What do you want with the Great Khans?
0DI0027369	Hey, hey. What can Tyrone do for you?
0DI0027370	I had an amazing time with you. You can look me up any time, baby.
0DI0027371	Hey, hey. You're back.
0DI0027374	What is it, trooper? You're not assigned to my squad, as far as I know.
0DI0027375	I'm not a recruitment officer. If you want to join the army, I'm sure someone at McCarran can point you in the right direction.
0DI0027377	Hey, I'm just a farmer. I don't want any trouble and I don't have anything valuable.
0DI0027378	Howdy. Something I can help you with?
0DI0027379	Our water ration suddenly increased. Can't help but think that you had something to do with it.
0DI0027380	You showed up just in time to say goodbye. Me and couple of the others are packing it in and heading back to California.
0DI0027381	The water ration's still a problem, and the NCR doesn't look like it's going to do anything about it anytime soon.
0DI0027382	Something else you need before I go?
0DI0027383	Howdy. Something else I can help you with?
0DI0027391	I've lost all respect for you.
0DI0027392	If you're an enemy of the NCR, you're an enemy of mine. Get out of my sight.
0DI0027393	Goddamn it! Don't sneak up on me like that. What do you want?
0DI0027394	Hey. You. You wandered into town recently, right?
0DI0027395	Get the hell away! We're done talking.
0DI0027396	You shouldn't be here. If people know we talked, they'll suspect you.
0DI0027397	And if whoever did this smells a rat, they'll have the Legion after both of us.
0DI0027398	That's it, then. How did you know?
0DI0027399	If there's one thing I won't tolerate, it's working with some dog of the Legion. You've got some explaining to do.
0DI0027400	I told you I wouldn't work against the NCR. I meant it.
0DI0027402	Still helping the Legion. You're gonna get what's coming to you. I promise you that.
0DI0027403	We're through working together.
0DI0027404	Look, I know the NCR has problems, but I fought with those men. I'll be damned before I betray them.
0DI0027405	This stops right now.
0DI0027407	No offense, but I need to focus on getting more rest when I'm off duty. I'm not sleeping so good. So now's not a good time.
0DI0027408	If you want to talk, catch me when I'm on duty. I'm up in the dinosaur after 9 pm.
0DI0027409	Nice of you to show up.
0DI0027410	Is it time?
0DI0027411	Let's get out of this first.
0DI0027412	We take this boat, it's probably the last one we ever take.
0DI0027413	I'm ready for that. Are you?
0DI0027414	We're near a Legion slave camp now. I've... been here before.
0DI0027415	Let's get one thing straight. I see any crimson, I'm taking the shot. You don't like that, you're on your own.
0DI0027416	We're getting close to Nelson. Any closer, I'm shooting any legionary I see. Hope that's not a problem.
0DI0027417	Huh. We made it through after all. Not sure what to make of that.
0DI0027418	Mercy killing is expected of NCR snipers. The Legion likes to torture their prisoners within sight of NCR positions.
0DI0027419	We get called on to end it. I've had my share. Some of them, you think, maybe you could've gotten them out.
0DI0027420	Maybe it's not the Legion that got them killed. Maybe it's your orders and you following them.
0DI0027421	Caesar's dead. Bet he didn't see this coming when he was having his coffee this morning.
0DI0027422	Still. It's not gonna stop the Legion. Might not even slow them down.
0DI0027423	Pisses me off that Legion slavers can just operate on NCR turf like that.
0DI0027424	If we hadn't caught up to them they'd probably have had a clear path to the river. No one to stop them.
0DI0027425	There should be patrols. Checkpoints. We got greedy, overstretched. Now our own territory isn't secure.
0DI0027427	Might be too big. Even for us.
0DI0027428	If you want out I won't blame you. But I'm going to stay. See if I can hold them off.
0DI0027429	Hey. I thought some more about what you said. I think maybe you're right. Maybe I should go to Bitter Springs.
0DI0027430	I don't know what I'm hoping to find there.
0DI0027431	Hey. I want to thank you for bringing me to Bitter Springs. Things seem... clearer now.
0DI0027432	We should get to the Hoover Dam. I don't want to miss this.
0DI0027433	That guy Benny was a piece of work.
0DI0027434	A face-to-face meeting with House, huh? The NCR would kill to be in your shoes.
0DI0027435	Sounds like it's gonna be an all-out war with the Legion soon. Maybe I should've re-enlisted after all.
0DI0027442	I'm surprised they didn't send you somewhere more vital.
0DI0027443	Wow, what are you doing at HELIOS? I feel like I should salute.
0DI0027444	Hope you can stay. We could use your expertise here.
0DI0027445	What'd you do wrong to get sent here? Thought you were an up-and-comer.
0DI0027446	Are you supporting us here? We'll take what we can get.
0DI0027447	Welcome to HELIOS One.
0DI0027450	Thank God we took back Nelson. Now they'll have a harder time hitting us here.
0DI0027455	The Legion's coming for us. Just a matter of time, believe you me.
0DI0027457	That scientist we hired has got to be the dumbest asshole I've ever come across.
0DI0027462	Hey man, when in Rome.
0DI0027463	I look so good in this shit, I want you to call me Fucking Spectacular from now on.
0DI0027464	Well look who it is! Fantastic's little helper, all grown up. Following in his master's footsteps.
0DI0027465	Guess who got promoted to goddamn dam god? The cream always rises to the top, and Fantastic always rises to the top of the cream.
0DI0027466	What the fuck, man? Are you loco?
0DI0027467	You just killed my paycheck.
0DI0027468	Who the hell are you? They bring you in to replace me? They're replacing me, aren't they?
0DI0027470	This is a restricted area. State your business.
0DI0027472	What have you done? Get away from me!
0DI0027473	It's unusual to see a new face here. Are you a soldier, or a scientist?
0DI0027474	Your organization will doom all of us.
0DI0027477	We don't even need this place. But it sure scares the shit out of the NCR that we've got a base here.
0DI0027478	The NCR left its soldiers here to die. Must be their strategy for the whole war.
0DI0027479	It was only a matter of time before HELIOS fell to us.
0DI0027480	We will not lose this place again.
0DI0027481	HELIOS One is safe in our hands and our hands alone.
0DI0027482	Under NCR control, this place was a gun in the hands of a child.
0DI0027483	Anders showed up here not too long ago. I'm told you're the one who got him out of the vault.
0DI0027484	I can't tell you how relieved I am. Sending him on that mission was a mistake.
0DI0027485	We're all impressed with the work you've done for us. I thought you might be able to make use of this.
0DI0027486	It's a key to a little hideaway south of here. We've used it as a place for Rangers to rest and resupply. I thought you might get good use out of it.
0DI0027487	I know who you are. I'm a patient man, but you'd better have a damn good reason to be standing here right now. Spit it out.
0DI0027488	Look who it is. I haven't had the privilege, but I'm told you've been an angel on our shoulder. What can we do for you at Camp McCarran?
0DI0027489	Well. I'm glad we could finally meet. My sources tell me you've done some good work for us. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
0DI0027490	I'm usually good with faces, but I don't think I've seen you here before. What brings you to Camp McCarran?
0DI0027493	What are you doing here? You don't have clearance.
0DI0027495	Hey, what are you doing out here at this hour?
0DI0027496	Trouble sleeping again, huh? Well, do yourself a favor - try and get some rest.
0DI0027497	Following up on your lead, huh? Good. I'll get out of your way before I blow your cover.
0DI0027498	I hope you catch this guy.
0DI0027499	Nice to meet you. I'm Curtis.
0DI0027500	Well?
0DI0027502	Hey! Can't you see I'm busy here?
0DI0027503	Nah, I'm just kidding. This has to be the most worthless patrol duty on the whole base. They never attack this gate.
0DI0027504	They just put me back here because they don't think I can handle anything else.
0DI0027505	Man, am I bored.
0DI0027506	Why don't you wait in the other room while I chat with Silus here?
0DI0027507	What is it, soldier?
0DI0027508	You stick out like a sore thumb around here. You sure you're in the right place?
0DI0027509	You weren't supposed to kill him! Goddamn it. Not only did we not get any information, but now you've ended his suffering, too.
0DI0027510	Shit, guess I can forget about a promotion this decade. Thanks a lot, asshole.
0DI0027511	Fuck. What am I going to tell the colonel?
0DI0027512	Haven't you done enough?
0DI0027513	Poor guy. He's all tuckered out. Well, I guess we'll have to pick up where we left off tomorrow. Good work.
0DI0027514	I'm sure he'll have had enough after a few days of this. Or if we're lucky, a few months.
0DI0027515	I'll get someone in here to clean up the mess he made. You can head out for the day. Let's let him sleep.
0DI0027516	That was fun to watch. I'd have you do it again, but I'd probably get in trouble.
0DI0027517	This'll do the NCR a lot of good, so you should be proud.
0DI0027518	Here's the standard fee, plus I threw in the price of a good show on the Strip. That's from me personally. You can beat up my prisoners anytime.
0DI0027519	You did well. I don't know how you did it without putting a scratch on him, and I'm a little disappointed personally, but it saved the NCR some face.
0DI0027520	And it could save us more than that when all is said and done. I'm gonna talk to some people when we're through here.
0DI0027521	This is about double the standard fee we'd give a "consultant," but from what I saw, you're more of an artist. So think of this as your commission.
0DI0027522	Let's finish this up, then we can talk.
0DI0027523	You're back.
0DI0027524	What an ugly little worm you are. What pile of excrement did the lieutenant pluck you from, worm?
0DI0027527	You hit like a bedridden old woman.
0DI0027528	We don't have anything to discuss, worm.
0DI0027529	Enough! This is pointless. I'm dead to the Legion either way. I'll tell you what I know.
0DI0027530	But you should know that Caesar has always kept his own counsel. He never reveals anything that would make him vulnerable.
0DI0027531	My knowledge will not prevent the inevitable. This camp will be ash within months. Maybe weeks.
0DI0027532	Have you got it?
0DI0027533	Hit me.
0DI0027535	I'll take it from here.
0DI0027537	Hassling Hector, huh? Got a thing for little kids?
0DI0027538	Howdy, pardner! Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company. Wrangle up a stool and listen to ol' Festus jaw a while.
0DI0027539	If you and ol' Festus are old pals, say a command now. Otherwise, say "Pleased to meetcha" and we'll get acquainted.
0DI0027540	Or, if you have more important things to do than talk to ol' Festus, say "Goodbye".
0DI0027541	Welcome to the headquarters of the Sunset Sarsaparilla Company!
0DI0027542	Worker #27438 reporting! There seems to be a malfunction with the line, sir!
0DI0027543	Wait a minute. You're not my manager! Intruder!
0DI0027545	Hello there. It's good to see a friendly face. Almost took you for a raider, I did. Name's Malcolm. Malcolm Holmes.
0DI0027546	Don't suppose you'd care to trade? I'm missing a few essentials and- oh, screw this. Lying just ain't in my nature.
0DI0027547	I'll tell it to you straight. I've been following you for a good bit now.
0DI0027548	Eh? You want to talk some more?
0DI0027549	Thank god you came around. That guy was going to kill me!
0DI0027550	Thanks for the help. That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
0DI0027551	Did you see that? That crazy bitch just attacked me out of nowhere.
0DI0027552	Thanks again for the help.
0DI0027553	This day just can't get any worse.
0DI0027554	Did you see that? That guy was going to kill me!
0DI0027555	Hey, it's you ag- what's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?
0DI0027556	Don't worry about me. I'm a little shaken up, but I'll be okay.
0DI0027557	Could you, maybe, stay away from me? You're creeping me out.
0DI0027558	Gotta wonder what the hell a civilian is doing here.
0DI0027559	You from Camp Golf or McCarran? Never mind. Don't really care.
0DI0027561	I don't remember getting informed about any new transfers to this post.
0DI0027562	This is a military post. You sure you're in the right place?
0DI0027563	Is there something you need from me?
0DI0027564	I'm not supposed to let civilians just walk around this place. There better be a good reason for you being here.
0DI0027565	I'm pretty sure you're not authorized to be here, whatever unit you happen to be from. What do you want?
0DI0027566	Why are you still here?
0DI0027567	No sudden moves and you and I will do all right. What do you want?
0DI0027568	Haven't seen you around the post before. I'm busy, so keep the chit-chat to the point.
0DI0027570	I don't know what you did to pull runner duty to a post this far out in the wasteland, but you have my sympathies.
0DI0027571	If you're here to sell something, we don't want any.
0DI0027573	You don't walk like any trooper I've ever seen, but I'll let it slide. What do you want?
0DI0027574	What brings you to Ranger Station Bravo?
0DI0027575	Something up?
0DI0027576	Thank goodness you're here. My squad needs help.
0DI0027577	You're the courier I've heard so much about. My squad needs your assistance.
0DI0027578	So any word on my friends?
0DI0027581	I'm glad to see a fellow trooper. My squad is in trouble.
0DI0027582	Need something?
0DI0027583	The Legion are trouble. You should watch out.
0DI0027584	The road is dangerous. You better stay sharp.
0DI0027585	I'm getting out of here.
0DI0027586	Fuck this place.
0DI0027587	The Legion will pay for this.
0DI0027588	Well, well. If it isn't the courier who wiped out the Legion over at Nelson. Good to see you around the Hope.
0DI0027589	Hold up there. This area is locked down by the NCR military until we can dislodge some Legion snakes from Nelson.
0DI0027590	Me and Carmine - that's my repeater here - will do our best to cover you from this ridge. Good luck.
0DI0027591	Let it wait until I've stopped running, all right?
0DI0027592	Hold it right there, Courier. I been hearing things about you, and they ain't all been good.
0DI0027593	Just so you know, you will answer to me if you cause any trouble for the troops around here. Things're bad enough as is.
0DI0027594	You're always welcome around the Hope, Courier - least as far as I'm concerned.
0DI0027595	Howdy. What's the word?
0DI0027596	I can still hear our boys screaming down there.
0DI0027597	Got to stay alert...
0DI0027598	Just waiting here seems like a death sentence...
0DI0027599	They've got our guys down there.
0DI0027600	Fucking monsters butchered the miners down there...
0DI0027601	Wish Renolds would report back soon... he went west a day ago, no word from him.
0DI0027602	We need to move out, we can't hold this position.
0DI0027603	Once the Legion's dug in, we're never getting them out of Nelson.
0DI0027604	There used to be two commanders, but I only see one - the other must be nearby somewhere.
0DI0027605	Won't be long before the Legion rolls out of Nelson...
0DI0027606	Someone should go warn Novac.
0DI0027607	We need reinforcements from Camp Forlorn Hope.
0DI0027608	Wish we could do something for the troopers down there.
0DI0027609	Out on regular patrol, then this shit goes down.
0DI0027610	The Legion'll pay for Nelson.
0DI0027611	Never thought Legion'd be bold enough to strike this far.
0DI0027612	Told Milo we have to go, but he won't leave.
0DI0027613	We can't hold this road if they come up through town!
0DI0027614	Thanks for the help with the hostages!
0DI0027615	I can't believe you broke into the mine and saved those miners.
0DI0027616	Hope you made the Legion at the mine pay for Nelson.
0DI0027617	The hostages are safe. We owe you.
0DI0027618	You sure cleaned out the Legion in Nelson.
0DI0027619	Legion'll think twice before crossing the river again.
0DI0027620	Guess Caesar got his tribute after all.
0DI0027621	Nelson'll turn this war around.
0DI0027622	Let's see those fuckers attack Hoover Dam now.
0DI0027623	Nelson's proof payback's a bitch.
0DI0027624	Thanks for cleaning up Nelson!
0DI0027625	Don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come along.
0DI0027626	Wish more people had your kind of guts.
0DI0027628	I'm heading back West. You won't see me again.
0DI0027629	God, there's almost nothing left. Looks like whoever it was - was just in the mood for killing.
0DI0027630	Most of the cargo's ash, too - not burned, looks like... disintegrated. When I heard the reports, I assumed "ash" meant "burned."
0DI0027631	So close to the Vegas wall, too, don't that beat all. Must have happened during the day, though, they hadn't made a camp.
0DI0027632	You know what, what happened to my caravan - not the first time I've heard about an attack like that.
0DI0027633	One of our caravans got hit back a few months back, and the caravan'd been burned, too, along with the cargo.
0DI0027634	I wonder if he made the same mistake, and that other caravan got hit with energy weapons, too.
0DI0027635	More energy weapons hit this caravan. Place has been picked clean.
0DI0027636	This... is Brotherhood level murder here. But they don't do things like that. This was done with a purpose.
0DI0027637	Let's poke around a bit, see what we can find. Might be something in the wreckage.
0DI0027638	What's that? Looks like a map - got the route along the West of Vegas, and...
0DI0027639	...they've marked another spot. Over here, along this stretch. That's fucked up - middle of nowhere.
0DI0027640	Another caravan burned. Except someone made camp here - and I never heard about this attack.
0DI0027641	Let's look around, something stinks.
0DI0027642	That does it, that's all I need to know.
0DI0027643	Crimson Caravan and the Van Graffs... they were behind burning these caravans, and they've got to answer for them.
0DI0027644	I'm going to get some extra ammo, a few bottles of whiskey, then show them how Cassidys settle accounts.
0DI0027645	Voices down, eyes up.
0DI0027646	Keep your voice down, we got movement out there.
0DI0027647	Save the sweettalk for when the shooting's done.
0DI0027648	You and me we're done traveling together. I want nothing more to do with you.
0DI0027649	I thought there was a chance you'd change - not any longer, being a fucker is who you are.
0DI0027650	Guess my last warning didn't sink in too well. Things don't change, and soon, I'm gone.
0DI0027652	Look, maybe you were like this before I signed up with you, but if you keep acting this way, I'm not going to stick around much longer.
0DI0027653	Are you fucking high right now? God, I can smell it from here. Keep that shit away from me.
0DI0027654	Ready to leave yet? This place puts my teeth on edge.
0DI0027655	Well, now, look what rolled in. What, you getting lonely out there?
0DI0027656	If you say you're going to gather evidence, then kill the bitches anyway, at least tell me when you change your mind.
0DI0027657	Now, if you're done fucking around, let's settle accounts the old-fashioned way.
0DI0027658	Just trimmed the Van Graff family tree, I think Freeside'll breathe a little easier now.
0DI0027659	And that's it for the Crimson Caravan.
0DI0027660	Well, that's settled... I suppose.
0DI0027661	You find any "evidence" yet? I'm not going to wait forever.
0DI0027662	Well, now that I'm free of the Outpost, was wondering if you'd mind making a detour.
0DI0027663	I'd like to pay my respects to the end of Cassidy Caravans, check out the site where they died.
0DI0027664	We find this "friend" of yours, looking forward to adding some red to that checkered suit of his.
0DI0027665	Why the hell we wandering so much anyway? Nothing against the Mojave except the dust, heat, and scorpions, but...
0DI0027666	We find this "friend" Benny of yours, looking forward to rattling his cage.
0DI0027667	Never thought I'd pass the Vegas wall. Never seen so many lights in one place before.
0DI0027668	Not sure who this friend of yours is, but if he's looking down on Vegas, he's either God or the moon.
0DI0027669	Not one for being subtle, are you? The Tops probably never saw so much action 'til you charged in.
0DI0027670	So glad you iced that little fucker. Anyone that wears a suit like that... well, they're asking for bullets.
0DI0027671	So what, we chase that little cocksucker down or what? He's got to stop running sometime, and that's when we'll get him.
0DI0027672	So... you talked to a big movie screen? Feeling like I'm walking down a yellow-bricked road, and there's bad news at the end.
0DI0027673	What, did... did you put a plug in his cocktube to make him explode?
0DI0027674	First Vegas, now NCR and Legion? You're being courted more than a Redding widow.
0DI0027675	Hope you can answer them politely, or there's no safe place in the Mojave for you.
0DI0027676	Still looking for a place to pitch your tent? NCR, Legion, or Vegas, seems like each of them's a beartrap, no matter where you put your foot.
0DI0027677	Careful where you flash that chip of yours... not sure what kind of caps it's worth, but it's a tempting target.
0DI0027678	Nothing like turning a snake's trap on itself. That Benny's a slippery fucker, but you one-upped him, all right.
0DI0027679	Can't tell you how glad I am you butchered the Fiends. Caravans across the wastes are going to be buying you drinks for years.
0DI0027680	Inside the Lucky 38? Not sure whether that's a blessing or a curse.
0DI0027681	Sure hope you know what you're doing, Mojave's getting tense.
0DI0027682	Don't get me wrong, NCR needs the help... sometimes I wish they'd step up more on their own. Not sure saving them helps them in the long run.
0DI0027683	Sure hope you know what throwing in with the Legion means. Helping them running roughshod over the West is an Old World kind of cruel.
0DI0027684	If someone promised me all the lights of Vegas, I'd consider it, too... but I wouldn't say yes until I saw what was behind the curtain.
0DI0027685	Mojave's almost buzzing like a Cazador now... must be all the blood Legion and NCR are spilling over the Colorado.
0DI0027686	Guess there's no turning back now, it's war. If Hoover Dam's where it's going to go down, better make it count.
0DI0027687	Looking for trouble?
0DI0027688	You come around like a bad habit. What's on your mind?
0DI0027690	Oh, you look like you got something else to say besides ordering me around.
0DI0027691	Let's hear it, you look all serious.
0DI0027692	Something to say to me other than guns, distance, and stimming?
0DI0027693	Whoa, why you leaning in all of a sudden?
0DI0027694	Ask 'em then.
0DI0027698	Who the hell are you? I know you weren't one of the inmates.
0DI0027699	What the fuck have you done? We needed that sulfur!
0DI0027700	Have you wiped out those geckos yet?
0DI0027701	Anything from Papa Khan?
0DI0027704	Somebody whacked the NCR president. Got what was coming to him.
0DI0027705	Someone took out the Legion's boss. Doubt it'll stop them for long, though.
0DI0027706	Lot more troops on the road these days. Wonder what's up.
0DI0027707	Best to lay low. The NCR and the Legion are about to have it out.
0DI0027710	You're not one of us. What do you want?
0DI0027711	I sure hope that explosion was you. Did you seal off the sulfur?
0DI0027712	I guess... I guess that means we can turn ourselves in now.
0DI0027713	You're back.  What's the word from Papa Khan?
0DI0027721	You need water? I got water, clean and fresh, straight from Lake Mead.
0DI0027722	If you're low on caps, I've also got slightly irradiated wasteland water. A little fallout never killed anybody.
0DI0027723	Welcome back! Are you thirsty for some fresh, clean water?
0DI0027724	Welcome to the Grub n' Gulp!
0DI0027725	Welcome back to the Grub n' Gulp!
0DI0027732	Such a shame about Mr. House. He used to send a Securitron to our dinner parties sometimes, like an uninvited but harmless uncle.
0DI0027737	Trying to elevate your status by being seen with me? It won't work.
0DI0027738	You look like you'd be more at home at one of the other hotels.
0DI0027739	I'm sorry, I prefer to converse with interesting people.
0DI0027740	I hear you've been clawing your way up the social ladder. What's your secret?
0DI0027741	People are talking about you.
0DI0027742	I like the cut of your jib.
0DI0027743	Well, if it isn't the toast of New Vegas.
0DI0027744	Welcome to the pinnacle of society.
0DI0027745	Would you mind staying here a moment? I want people to see that I know you.
0DI0027746	You're an odd duck.
0DI0027747	You've been acting awfully strange towards us.
0DI0027748	What are you playing at? I'm really starting to wonder about you.
0DI0027749	I'm having a little get-together later, but you are not invited until you learn to behave.
0DI0027750	How can you be such a dear and such a bother at the same time?
0DI0027751	You'll never be at the top until you learn some manners and common decency.
0DI0027752	What's that smell? Oh, it's you.
0DI0027753	Please, you're lowering my status.
0DI0027754	Shouldn't you be in Freeside with the other thugs?
0DI0027755	You vile cad. I've half a mind to give you a solid thrashing with my cane.
0DI0027756	Remove yourself from my sight at once.
0DI0027757	Loathsome wretch.
0DI0027760	Being an honorary member isn't the same as being a real member, but it still makes you better than everyone else.
0DI0027761	So you've joined the Society. It feels different, doesn't it? Like you're entitled to the best things life has to offer.
0DI0027763	The Lucky 38's perpetual glow these days... it's rather gauche, don't you think?
0DI0027764	If Mr. House is going to lower his standards, we'll just have to raise ours!
0DI0027765	Hello? Can you help me?
0DI0027766	Have you decided to help me?
0DI0027767	Please hurry! She's on the ridge, past the broken radio tower.
0DI0027768	Sorry I tricked you, but thanks for clearing out the Geckos. Now I can get to that stash up there... after I deal with you.
0DI0027772	How can I help you?
0DI0027773	You shouldn't have crossed the Powder Gangers! Now you're going to pay!
0DI0027774	I have a present for you from the Powder Gangers... I hope you like dynamite!
0DI0027775	You'll pay for what you did to the Powder Gangers!
0DI0027776	Nobody screws with the Powder Gangers and lives!
0DI0027777	Here he is, boys! Let's show him what happens when you cross the Powder Gangers!
0DI0027778	You want to buy Wind-Brahmin?
0DI0027779	Careful, sometimes they escape and I have to round them up again.
0DI0027780	Why do you scare my cattle?
0DI0027781	Don't scare the herd.
0DI0027782	Leave doggies alone.
0DI0027784	Don't listen to a word No-bark says. He spouts nothing but nonsense.
0DI0027785	Been to the top of the dino yet?
0DI0027788	Can't believe Boone shot Manny.
0DI0027789	Boone must've had a hell of a grudge against Jeannie-May.
0DI0027790	What did Boone have against Alice?
0DI0027791	Boone thought Dusty sold Carla into slavery?
0DI0027792	No-bark was harmless. There's no way he had something to do with Boone's wife.
0DI0027793	Hell of thing for Boone to kill Ranger Andy like that.
0DI0027794	Looks like the McBrides weren't telling tall tales after all.
0DI0027795	The McBrides think some mysterious creature is shooting up their Brahmin. Gotta be somebody in town doing it.
0DI0027797	Knew those ghouls were up to no good. Look where it got us.
0DI0027799	You been real kind to us.
0DI0027800	Just showed up out of nowhere and lended a hand. We appreciate it.
0DI0027801	Without you we'd be in a lot worse shape.
0DI0027802	I hope good things come your way.
0DI0027803	We must've done something right for you to come along like you did.
0DI0027804	Stay away, you hear?
0DI0027805	You monster!
0DI0027806	You're sick, you know that?
0DI0027807	I don't much like you.
0DI0027808	Maybe you should just move on.
0DI0027809	You mind your business, we'll mind ours.
0DI0027810	You're confusing to us. Why are you here?
0DI0027811	You're kind of odd, aren't you?
0DI0027812	How about you just do nice things for us. We liked those.
0DI0027813	Your victory is the Legion's victory. True to Caesar.
0DI0027814	You are to be commended on your martial skill.
0DI0027815	Forlorn Hope has fallen, another victory for Caesar.
0DI0027816	I have heard how you cleansed Forlorn Hope of the Profligates.
0DI0027817	Nelson, Forlorn Hope... soon Caesar's banners shall rise on Hoover Dam.
0DI0027818	Our march to the Dam is assured.
0DI0027819	With Forlorn Hope's fall, our blades are at the NCR's throat.
0DI0027820	Our machetes ran thick with blood here.
0DI0027821	I hope to Caesar that the Profligates will send more victims to us.
0DI0027822	The Profligates here were weak, no fight in them.
0DI0027823	This is only the first settlement to fall.
0DI0027824	The bodies of beggars and cowards fill Nelson's streets now.
0DI0027825	Dead Sea has erected a tribute to Caesar - made of Profligate corpses.
0DI0027826	When we're fortified here and reinforced, Forlorn Hope will be next.
0DI0027827	We kill only those who resist the will of Caesar. The rest are kept as tribute.
0DI0027828	Some of Nelson lives on... as slaves. They are being kept nearby.
0DI0027829	If the rest of the Profligate settlements are as weak as this, Caesar's victory is assured.
0DI0027830	This is only part of our detachment. We have others stationed nearby.
0DI0027831	Speak to our Decanus, Dead Sea.
0DI0027832	We do not move unless Dead Sea commands it.
0DI0027833	We can see the Profligate cowards stationed on the hill, afraid of us.
0DI0027834	You may walk here - but do not head west along the road.
0DI0027835	That we hold Neslon, that is Caesar's will.
0DI0027836	The "great" republic couldn't find enough soliders to liberate this camp, so they sent you? Pathetic.
0DI0027837	Ave. Why have you come to Nelson?
0DI0027840	Ave. You have done a great service to Caesar. Do so again, but elsewhere.
0DI0027841	You hear about that band of crazy old ladies running around? I hear they're real vicious when they mug folks.
0DI0027842	If the Lucky 38 coulda been giving us power all along, why all the fuss with Hoover Dam?
0DI0027843	Try sleeping with that Lucky 38 all lit up above you. Just try.
0DI0027844	I hear that woman can kill with her eyes! Stay away from me!
0DI0027845	Your lady friend needs to lighten up.
0DI0027846	Better watch out, I hear Rex likes to eat his owners. Why do you think the King was so eager to give him away?
0DI0027847	Good to see Rex still around and kicking.
0DI0027848	That's one ragged Ghoul you've got with you. Seems like a good guy, though.
0DI0027849	That ghoul with you looks like he's older than the war! My the things he must have seen.
0DI0027850	Oh no, I hear those things eat people! Stay back, freak!
0DI0027851	Odd company you keep. I thought all Super mutants were crazed cannibals.
0DI0027852	Weird robot. I don't think I've ever seen one of those before.
0DI0027853	That looks like one of those spybots I hear House has been secretly releasing at night.
0DI0027854	Business and luck don't often go hand-in-hand in the Mojave. Watch your back.
0DI0027855	Check out the Wrangler if she needs booze.
0DI0027856	Keep your guns to yourself and there won't be any trouble.
0DI0027857	You're not doing yourself a favor by having him tag along. NCR aren't welcome here.
0DI0027858	I hear that guy has hundreds of kills, not all of them deserving of death.
0DI0027859	I always thought there was more to Arcade than met the eye. I bet he'll do great things without the Followers holding him back.
0DI0027860	I'm surprised to see Arcade venturing out of the Old Mormon Fort. I thought science types preferred to stay indoors.
0DI0027863	One of these days you'll get what's coming to you.
0DI0027864	Eat shit and die. That clear enough for you?
0DI0027865	We don't take kindly to your type around these parts.
0DI0027866	Witch! Witch! You should be burned for all the people you've turned into newts!
0DI0027867	Baby-killer! Don't deny it! They told me you mowed down an entire orphanage on a dare!
0DI0027868	Necrophiliac! I heard about those corpses you dug up! Stay away from my grandparents, dammit!
0DI0027869	People say you practice witchcraft and dance naked in the moonlight. What the hell is wrong with you?
0DI0027870	So I hear you like picking on little kids, huh? What kind of person beats up children for their lunch money?
0DI0027871	People say you wear the skin of your enemies under your clothing. Is that true?
0DI0027872	Leave me alone, scumbag.
0DI0027873	You're a real piece of work.
0DI0027874	Great. You again?
0DI0027875	You're one crazy bastard, you know that?
0DI0027876	I can't decide if I should shake your hand or make a run for it.
0DI0027877	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapons, eh?
0DI0027878	Rumor has it you're really a posessed golem being controlled by the casinos. If this is true, where is your control crystal?
0DI0027879	Planning to kill a puppy or save some goons today?
0DI0027880	I have no idea what to believe when it comes to rumors about you. You must be insane or something.
0DI0027881	People around here think you're a bit of an enigma.
0DI0027882	Some say you like to trip old ladies crossing the street. Others say you regularly string up thugs.
0DI0027883	People just don't know what to think of you.
0DI0027884	Decisions are hard, aren't they?
0DI0027885	We're all hoping you'll eventually figure out which side you're on.
0DI0027886	Good? Bad? You're the one with the weapon.
0DI0027887	Thanks for everything you've done. It really means a lot.
0DI0027888	I hope some of the thugs around here follow your shining example.
0DI0027889	You've been a godsend to Freeside.
0DI0027890	I hear you even help the local rats cross the street.
0DI0027891	People are saying you must have super powers to have pulled off all you've done in Freeside.
0DI0027892	My friends have nothing but good things to say when your name is mentioned. It's great to see you.
0DI0027893	Word of your work around here is spreading like wildfire. Keep it up.
0DI0027894	Hey, you're the one people say has been helping out around here. Good on you.
0DI0027895	I tell my friends you're a shining example of what's good around here, but they're not so optimistic.
0DI0027896	Thanks for helping out around here.
0DI0027897	Good to see you're still around.
0DI0027902	I wish I were there to see you take Benny down.
0DI0027903	They say you single-handedly assaulted the dam and massacred everyone! That must have been quite a sight!
0DI0027904	Well, it looks like we won't have to worry about NCR or the Legion messing with us now. I just hope the Securitrons can keep the peace.
0DI0027905	They say you swarmed the dam with a whole army of Securitrons! That must have been quite a sight!
0DI0027906	Can't say I like all the tin cans shuffling around, but this new Securitron Army shouldn't have much trouble keeping things safer around here.
0DI0027907	Why not just put the slave collars on us yourself, you bastard. With the Legion at the dam, it won't be long before they enslave us all.
0DI0027908	I heard the Legion is bringing in giant mutant dogs to assault the dam. I hope the NCR death squads packed steaks to distract them.
0DI0027909	Don't be fooled. As soon as the Legion and NCR start fighting, the robots will invade and kill us all!
0DI0027910	I hope the Legion gets destroyed. If they take the dam, we'll all be slaves.
0DI0027911	People say the NCR are bringing in super trooper death squads to defend the dam against the Legion! This battle is going to be crazy!
0DI0027912	Normally, I'd say screw the NCR, but if the Legion takes the dam, I think we're all screwed.
0DI0027913	Some of my friends think the Legion is throwing a huge barbeque cookout across the river. With that much smoke rising, I believe it!
0DI0027914	It looks like the Legion might be preparing for another run at the dam. This can't be good.
0DI0027915	Well, aren't you just special? Everybody likes the new guy, but me? I'm chopped liver.
0DI0027916	I hear you're building quite the reputation on The Strip. Don't forget about the little guys when you make it big.
0DI0027917	You meet any of those Rangers dressed up in black yet? My friends say they're mutant cyborgs and they're going to kill us all!
0DI0027918	That new Ranger armor is downright impressive. I'd hate to be on the business end of one of their revolvers.
0DI0027919	We've already got people disappearing at night. I hear the NCR have veterans from out west coming to push us out of Freeside.
0DI0027920	I've been hearing rumors of the Rangers getting some heavy reinforcements soon. Hope they don't try to start anything around here.
0DI0027921	The NCR must have paid off the Kings big to get them to sign up. Maybe there was an NCR mole who tricked them into it!
0DI0027922	Good news for Freeside. The Kings have decided to work with NCR for a change.
0DI0027923	I hear the Kings were wiped out by some kind of Super mutant ninja assassin paid by the NCR! Who else could have taken them down?!
0DI0027924	I don't get why the Kings are dead. They weren't a bad bunch of guys.
0DI0027925	Some people are saying the Great Khans got drugged up out of their minds and attacked the dam.
0DI0027926	I heard the Khans went wild at Hoover Dam. I suppose they were looking for one last blaze of glory.
0DI0027927	I hear the Great Khans staged their own deaths to trick the NCR.
0DI0027929	The Great Khans aren't gone. They're just hiding, biding their time...
0DI0027930	The Great Khans moved out? One less mob of degenerates to worry about, if you ask me.
0DI0027931	The Khans signed a treaty with NCR? I've heard some crazy rumors before, but that one's rich!
0DI0027932	So, the Great Khans signed up with NCR. Who would have thought those two would settle their differences?
0DI0027933	Those sick Legion bastards had the brass balls to attack Bitter Springs? I bet that was one messy fight.
0DI0027934	Maybe it'll be a little safer to travel, now that the Fiends' bosses are dead. We owe their killer a debt of gratitude.
0DI0027935	I heard Motor Runner got taken down. Maybe the Fiends will finally destroy themselves now that he's gone.
0DI0027936	I hear Hanlon was abducted by aliens and that's why he was acting so strangely. Better check yourself for strange scars.
0DI0027937	Hanlon was apparently sabotaging NCR's efforts in the area. Now, I kind of wish he hadn't died.
0DI0027938	I hear Hanlon was working for the aliens and NCR found out.
0DI0027939	Chief Hanlon is dead? I hear that guy couldn't order himself out of a cardboard box, let alone command troops
0DI0027940	My friends say Kimball's assassination was all an Illuminati plot to reclaim power. I say they're crazy. How do you kill someone with a flashlight?
0DI0027941	Kimball getting killed is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
0DI0027942	My friends say you're working for the Illuminati, and that's why you killed Kimball. Watch your back. They have listening devices everywhere!
0DI0027943	Killing Kimball is going to make a mess of things around here. The troopers coming through here are mean enough already.
0DI0027944	Thanks for not killing Kimball. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
0DI0027945	So, I hear that assassination attempt on Kimball didn't quite turn out the way you planned. Now, the NCR are going to be even pissier than usual.
0DI0027946	Good job saving Kimball's life. I hear he's been working against the secret alien invasion forces above the planet. They want to eat our brains!
0DI0027947	I suppose you did the right thing saving Kimball, even though it means we're still screwed here in Freeside.
0DI0027948	You freed that Silus guy from McCarran? Guess you've got your reasons for helping the Legion.
0DI0027949	I hear the monorail bombing was an alien plot. Just a few more gates to destroy and we're all trapped in here.
0DI0027950	I guess the monorail getting bombed wasn't all bad. Freeside is getting a lot more business now.
0DI0027951	With the monorail down, we're going to have a lot more NCR goons wandering through here. Yay...
0DI0027952	Rumor has it Mr. House joined the NCR on account of some secret love child he never even knew he had.
0DI0027953	Never thought I'd see House settle for being an NCR lapdog. What the hell happened?
0DI0027954	I think Caesar was killed by alien clone agents! The Legion are just a bunch of alien slaves doing their bidding!
0DI0027955	I hear Caesar had an alien brain chip in his head, but he died on the operating table when they tried to remove it.
0DI0027957	You killed Caesar? Rumor around here has it he was struck down by a bad case of explosive diarrhea.
0DI0027958	All hail the slayer of Caesar! It's about time that slavemaster got his!
0DI0027959	I don't need to read no obituary to know House was an asshole.
0DI0027960	With no House to boss Vegas around, the NCR's gonna want that job.
0DI0027961	According to the rumor mill, House is faking his death to catch the NCR off-guard.
0DI0027962	House dead? Good riddance.
0DI0027963	Better give the Securitrons a wide berth if you know what's good for you. Those new upgrades look nasty.
0DI0027964	House must have special plans for you to get into the Lucky 38 and come out alive.
0DI0027965	I hear you made a real mess of the Omerta's plans. Hopefully, the new management does a better job running Gomorrah.
0DI0027966	Impressive work fighting off Benny's thugs! I know I wouldn't have survived that.
0DI0027967	I heard you made a run on The Tops. You've got guts, kid.
0DI0027968	Figures that Benny would run. Sorry coward's nobody without his thugs to back him.
0DI0027969	Get rough with the escorts, and you'll be seeing the business end of my barrel.
0DI0027970	With the Kings gone, who is going to keep Freeside safe?
0DI0027971	If the King is working with the NCR, he must have a damn good reason. I just hope it doesn't come back to bite us.
0DI0027972	Do I know you?
0DI0027975	I'm hearing good things about you, friend. Good things.
0DI0027976	Good to see someone helping out for a change.
0DI0027977	People say you've been helping out around town. Much appreciated, friend.
0DI0027978	You've done good, kid. Happy to have you around.
0DI0027979	I'm amazed by how much you've accomplished here in Freeside.
0DI0027980	We've been really fortunate to have you helping Freeside.
0DI0027981	Helping on a consistent basis wouldn't hurt you, would it?
0DI0027982	You've done a strange mix of things since coming to Freeside.
0DI0027983	Does it get painful sitting on the fence like you do?
0DI0027984	It seems you've decided to be indecisive when it comes to helping Freesiders.
0DI0027985	Throwing caution to the wind yet again, huh?
0DI0027986	I guess no one is ever going to change a crazy freak like you.
0DI0027987	What did we ever do to you? Can't we all just get along?
0DI0027988	Why the hate for Freeside? We're not all bad.
0DI0027990	Go to hell you two-faced bastard.
0DI0027991	Go away, you rotten bastard.
0DI0027992	Way to stab us in the back, asshole.
0DI0027993	Howdy, doc. Strange to see you wandering around.
0DI0027994	I admire a woman who can hold her liquor. Cute to boot.
0DI0027995	She looks like she knows how to handle herself in a fight.
0DI0027996	I hope you programmed that thing to be friendly to Freesiders.
0DI0027997	Super mutant? You don't look so super to me.
0DI0027998	How's it hangin', old man? Oh, sorry.
0DI0027999	Hey, Rex. I see your new master is keeping you polished up. Good for you.
0DI0028000	Cheer up, lady. You've still got your youth.
0DI0028001	This job's boring enough without talking to you. Go see Alexander.
0DI0028002	Alexander doesn't pay me to talk.
0DI0028003	We're just muscle. Alexander's the man to talk to.
0DI0028004	Hi, mister. I hope you're doing fine today.
0DI0028005	Hello, ma'am. I hope you're doing fine today.
0DI0028006	I thought I'd be seeing you again.
0DI0028007	You a merc? 'Cause you don't look like a prospector...
0DI0028008	I've still got guns and ammo, if you need them.
0DI0028009	I lost everything I had at The Tops, but if you gave me 500 caps, I'd head straight back. Sick, huh?
0DI0028010	I came east to strike it rich, and now I'm broker than ever. What do I tell my family back home?
0DI0028011	On the Strip, everyone's nice to you when you got the caps. The moment you don't? They throw your ass out.
0DI0028012	I won big my first night on the Strip. I kept chasing that feeling. Right into the gutter.
0DI0028013	I sat down at a roulette table with my life savings. An hour later, it was gone.
0DI0028014	Can you spare some caps, mister?
0DI0028015	Can you spare some caps, 'mam?
0DI0028016	Go East! they say. Scrap lying in the sun for you to grab. Yeah, right.
0DI0028017	The Strip ain't nothing but a monster. Chews folks up, sucks out their caps, and spits 'em back out.
0DI0028018	The Strip's got more gorgeous women than I ever seen in one place, and most of them's affordable.
0DI0028019	You hear the losers around here complaining how they lost their shirts on the Strip? It's pathetic.
0DI0028020	After I win big, I'm going to buy my friends dinner at that fancy Gor-mant restaurant. I saw ads for it back home.
0DI0028021	I walked all the way from Hub! Thought I'd rest my feet here a day or two, then I head onto the Strip fresh.
0DI0028022	I'll get in, win big, get out. Take those winnings back home where they'll do some good!
0DI0028023	You know it's illegal for us to gamble back home? The government wants to keep us poor.
0DI0028024	I'm sick of the sob stories you hear around here. If you don't know when to stop gambling, that's no one's fault but your own.
0DI0028025	I can't wait to see the Strip. I hear it's so beautiful!
0DI0028026	I only work for caravans, all right? Try someone else.
0DI0028027	Sitting around here makes me miss my raider days. I don't know why I figured it was time to get respectable.
0DI0028028	Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying.
0DI0028029	A friend of mine at the Dam says President Kimball might visit the troops out there. Imagine shaking the president's hand!
0DI0028030	Do you believe there are folks who'd pay 500 caps for a steak dinner? Over at the Ultra-Luxe! Honest!
0DI0028031	If you want to get fucked up, Gomorrah's the place to go. Wish I was there now.
0DI0028032	You gotta piss someone off to pull guard duty out here.
0DI0028033	Camp McCarran is paradise compared to this place. A two-minute monorail and you're on the Strip!
0DI0028034	You been to the Strip? Last time I had R&R, I left with 300 caps more than I went in. Who says the House always wins?
0DI0028035	I thought the dam was boring. Then they stuck us out here to watch over this scrap heap.
0DI0028036	Watch yourself if you're heading further south. There's been trouble down by Nelson and Searchlight.
0DI0028037	Try not to make any trouble. We like it quiet around here.
0DI0028038	If I hear one more loser moan about losing everything they own on the Strip, I may shoot him in the head.
0DI0028039	It's quiet out here. We like to keep it that way.
0DI0028040	Don't make any trouble for us, we won't make any trouble for you.
0DI0028041	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. Like our slogan says, "It's better than nothing."
0DI0028042	Feeling thirsty?
0DI0028043	Welcome to the 188 Slop & Shop. How can I help you?
0DI0028044	Back for more?
0DI0028045	Is there some reason I should be talking to you?
0DI0028046	Still making a nuisance of yourself?
0DI0028047	I don't work for freelancers. So move along.
0DI0028048	Stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours, got it?
0DI0028049	Watch out for Fiends.
0DI0028050	We don't need the NCR.
0DI0028051	I kinda like being a farmer.
0DI0028052	I'm glad Mean Sonofabitch is on our side.
0DI0028053	Crops aren't getting as much water lately.
0DI0028054	We're better off with those slaver bastards Saint James and Dermot.
0DI0028055	That Sweetie sure is something.
0DI0028056	I'm gonna miss having Anderson around.
0DI0028057	Anything new happening?
0DI0028058	I'm heading to Gomorrah next time I get some time off.
0DI0028059	I sure hope I get to meet President Kimball.
0DI0028060	I wonder if the President will come this way again, he had kind of a close call I hear.
0DI0028061	The Legion would have to be insane to attack this place.
0DI0028062	The sound of the generators is really quite calming.
0DI0028063	Private Watson sure seemed excited about meeting Kimball.
0DI0028064	I actually got to see the President.
0DI0028065	I hear President Kimball had a pretty close call with some assassins.
0DI0028066	The death of the President is going to be a permanent blight on this place.
0DI0028067	If the President of our republic isn't safe here, how can we be?
0DI0028068	Kimball died, security seemed so tight, how could such a thing happen?
0DI0028069	President Kimball is going to arrive pretty soon to give his speech and meet that wounded soldier.
0DI0028070	How do we know if Mr. House is really gone? No one's ever seen him in the first place!
0DI0028071	Colonel Moore survived four tours against the Brotherhood back west. If anyone can help take on the Legion, it's her.
0DI0028072	You hear that rumor that Colonel Moore was kicked out of Gomorrah a while back? I heard she's had it in for the Omertas ever since.
0DI0028073	I'm really surprised Colonel Moore accepted the Brotherhood's help. I heard she lost a lot of men in war with them back west.
0DI0028074	Is it true? Was there really a Brotherhood base nearby that blew sky high?
0DI0028075	I heard a rumor that Moore hired some mercs to wipe out the Khans. Is that such a good idea, with Bitter Springs still on peoples' minds back home?
0DI0028076	Man, I'm exhausted. Moore's got us running drills non-stop.
0DI0028077	Just between us, Colonel Moore scares me sometimes.
0DI0028078	Our victory was never in question.
0DI0028081	Let's get to fighting! Now is not the time to talk!
0DI0028082	I'm not sure I'll ever learn everything there is to know about this place.
0DI0028083	How do they keep the floor in here so clean?
0DI0028084	They should have used Paladins to help protect the President.
0DI0028085	If the NCR wasn't too proud to accept our assistance their president would still be alive.
0DI0028086	The NCR is lucky we've chosen to side with them or we'd take the death of their President as a moment of weakness.
0DI0028087	We are here to help protect the dam, word is Oliver is on his way and the battle will start soon.
0DI0028088	We're ready to deploy whenever the NCR says the word.
0DI0028089	The Brotherhood hasn't seen a real battle in so long, I have no doubt we'll handle this no problem.
0DI0028090	The NCR is going to be grateful to have us around when the shooting starts.
0DI0028091	The Elder sent us to help protect the dam and await further orders.
0DI0028092	Mike Lawson sure knows his way around the dam.
0DI0028093	I'm honored to work with Lawson, he knows more about the dam than anyone.
0DI0028094	Fantastic grabbed my ass. That guy is vile.
0DI0028095	I'm pretty sick of Fantastic, can't that guy keep his hands to himself?
0DI0028096	Everyone is abuzz about Oliver arriving soon. That must mean the battle is close.
0DI0028097	Hanlon is pretty legendary, people talk about what he did at the first battle of hoover dam with awe and respect.
0DI0028098	I miss California.
0DI0028099	By Mars these weaklings die easily.
0DI0028100	Don't get in my way!
0DI0028101	Try to keep up, if you can.
0DI0028102	Now is the time for killing, not words!
0DI0028103	This was all too easy.
0DI0028104	I long to join my brethren in the power plant below. The fighting's probably fiercer there.
0DI0028105	Our orders are to take and hold this section of the dam.
0DI0028106	These men fight hard, and die well.
0DI0028107	Ha ha, isn't it glorious?
0DI0028108	These dogs are putting up a fight, I'll give them that.
0DI0028109	The exterior is ours. The interior will fall soon.
0DI0028110	There's talk of much land and slaves going to the one who kills Oliver. If only I wasn't assigned here!
0DI0028111	With the outside secured, the poor fools inside have nowhere to run.
0DI0028112	Oliver's head is as good as mine!
0DI0028113	Is it true the fighting outside has stopped already?
0DI0028114	Upstairs, or down? If I were a coward, where would I hide?
0DI0028115	Make good use of cover. The time to strike is when they reload.
0DI0028116	Their guns aren't quite as effective in these close quarters.
0DI0028117	Soon this place will belong to the Legion.
0DI0028118	I've added eight notches to my belt already. How many for you?
0DI0028119	You must get to the control room and install the override chip.
0DI0028120	I will protect you.
0DI0028121	I hope the Legion doesn't get in here.
0DI0028122	Sorry, but I'm busy with patients right now.
0DI0028123	Julie Farkas wasn't kidding when she said we would be needed here.
0DI0028124	All this bloodshed. Such a waste of human life.
0DI0028126	I'm just a medic! Please don't hurt me!
0DI0028127	Mormon caravan from New Canaan came through the other day.
0DI0028128	The Crimson Caravan's the biggest merchant outfit in the wasteland.
0DI0028129	Damn Brahmin crap everywhere.
0DI0028130	I'm glad Ringo's back. Got a good story to tell, too.
0DI0028131	Fucking expensive to get into the Strip these days.
0DI0028132	Keep an eye out for wildlife.
0DI0028133	When pay day hits, I'm off to the Strip. Can't wait.
0DI0028134	McLafferty's been riding asses again. Better lay low.
0DI0028135	McLafferty's a hard boss, but she knows what she's doing, that's for sure.
0DI0028136	Guess Jamison won't be showing his face around here again. It's about time.
0DI0028137	Tough luck for Janet, huh? I know I'd hate to lose all that pay.
0DI0028138	I've never heard of anyone breaking their contract and still getting their pay. Janet is damn lucky.
0DI0028139	I hope they don't close the quarry. I need the money.
0DI0028140	With Chomps in jail, who's going to run things at the quarry? He was our most experienced guy!
0DI0028141	Maybe I was just seeing things, but I could've sworn I saw some people up on the ridge by the quarry.
0DI0028142	I can't believe Chomps got arrested! They said he was involving in smuggling, if you can believe it.
0DI0028143	The Deathclaws have been keeping their distance. For now.
0DI0028144	When do you think the NCR will send their troops to help us?
0DI0028145	Jas screwed up the coffee again. Wouldn't drink it if I were you.
0DI0028146	It's too damn hot.
0DI0028147	Sure is nice to have the lights on again.
0DI0028148	With the Deathclaw pack leaders dead, I hope we can get back to work soon.
0DI0028149	Snuffles' leg seems to have gotten better.
0DI0028150	Man, I wish I'd stayed back in California some days.
0DI0028151	Generator's still not working. Big surprise.
0DI0028152	Poor Snuffles. Wish somebody could do something about his leg.
0DI0028153	If I don't get more water soon, I won't make my quota this season.
0DI0028154	Don't know about you, but this beats herding Brahmin back in California.
0DI0028155	The maize is doing well in this soil.
0DI0028156	I'm glad the troopers are smart enough not to trample everything.
0DI0028157	Something - or someone - has been chewing on the coyote tobacco again.
0DI0028158	We're finally getting all the water we're supposed to. It's about time.
0DI0028159	Word is they're sending some of us home since we're not making the quota.
0DI0028160	Can't grow crops if they don't give us the water.
0DI0028161	Only thing you're good for is target practice.
0DI0028162	Bet you'd blow up real good.
0DI0028163	Watch your step, Outsider.
0DI0028164	I got a shell with your name on it.
0DI0028165	I can spot a Brotherhood spy from a thousand yards. Even the cute ones.
0DI0028167	That thing is housebroken, right?
0DI0028168	I like you big mutants. You're easy to sight.
0DI0028169	Did you know you have a robot following you?
0DI0028171	Keep your distance, soldier.
0DI0028172	A doctor? Who's your supplier?
0DI0028173	Idle thumbs tend to get blown off around here. Get moving.
0DI0028174	Sorry, I've got work to take care of.
0DI0028175	I'd keep moving if I was you.
0DI0028176	Go back to the Strip where you belong.
0DI0028177	You're nothing like us, Outsider.
0DI0028178	We should have never let you in.
0DI0028179	You're no different than a common Fiend.
0DI0028182	I'm not sure what to make of you, Outsider.
0DI0028183	What do you know about our problems?
0DI0028185	Hey there. Kill any Outsiders lately?
0DI0028186	You can shoot with me anytime, friend.
0DI0028187	Always nice to see you.
0DI0028188	Hope the trip into camp wasn't too eventful!
0DI0028189	Keep your head down, Outsider.
0DI0028190	I've got my sights on you, Outsider.
0DI0028191	Stand back where I can see you.
0DI0028192	Saw you coming a mile away.
0DI0028193	I actually got to fly Pearl for a little bit during that boming run. Hot damn, what an honor.
0DI0028194	All those hours training? Glad they finally paid off.
0DI0028195	Did you see it? I hear the suckers burned right through their armor.
0DI0028196	It was wonderful seeing Pearl fly and serve the purpose she was built for.
0DI0028197	It's getting nasty out here. S'times like these I thank god for artillery.
0DI0028198	War's brewing on the horizon, plain as day.
0DI0028199	We've survived out here pretty well so far without any help from the outside.
0DI0028201	I don't have anything to say to you, outsider.
0DI0028203	I don't think you should be here.
0DI0028205	You've earned our trust, now let's see if you can earn our gratitude.
0DI0028222	You're lots of fun. We should play sometime.
0DI0028223	I'm going to be a hero and travel the wasteland like you when I grow up.
0DI0028224	I'm going to tell Mama Pearl how cool you are.
0DI0028225	I bet you have all kinds of fun stories.
0DI0028229	I can't believe Pearl let you stay with us.
0DI0028230	I sure hope Pearl knows what she's doing.
0DI0028232	I bet you'd make an awesome Boomer.
0DI0028298	I hate it here, fucking sulfur stinks.
0DI0028299	This vault gives me the creeps.
0DI0028300	Have you read the logs on the computers? Fucked up shit.
0DI0028301	Fucking geckos.
0DI0028302	No way I'm going back to prison.
0DI0028303	So much for Lem, you should have seen it, guts flying everywhere.
0DI0028304	Lem was going to turn us all in to the NCR, I'm glad he's dead.
0DI0028305	We can finally relax with Cooke gone.
0DI0028306	Cooke left the vault, good thing too he was going to get us all killed.
0DI0028307	Cooke is going to get us all killed.
0DI0028308	Lem wants to run back to the NCR and turn himself in, spineless bastard.
0DI0028309	I hear the Great Khans are pretty tough, I hope we can join them.
0DI0028310	Join the Great Khans, what the hell is Cooke thinking?
0DI0028311	I don't know about this whole Great Khan thing...
0DI0028312	Did you hear? We're going to join the Great Khans.
0DI0028313	I don't want to join the Great Khans, but I guess it's better than going back to prison.
0DI0028314	Hmm, join the Great Khans or die in the wasteland? Good fucking plan Cooke.
0DI0028315	I don't want to join the Great Khans.
0DI0028316	Don't look at me!
0DI0028317	Someone's watching me, I can feel it.
0DI0028318	So many staring eyes...
0DI0028319	The voices in my head are getting louder...
0DI0028320	The pain won't go away.
0DI0028321	The cure is finally coming to make the voices stop.
0DI0028322	We were promised a cure long before this, and now we must wait some more?
0DI0028323	Why should we stay if Keene is dead?
0DI0028324	Perhaps the rest of us should follow Keene into the wasteland.
0DI0028325	There's too much light. Why is there always too much light?
0DI0028326	Damn muties. Wasteland is better off without 'em.
0DI0028327	Can't wait to get the rest of our pay for this job.
0DI0028328	Wish the muties would make a move. Getting sick of waiting.
0DI0028329	It's much cooler up here. I love it.
0DI0028330	Muties aren't so tough if you've got the firepower.
0DI0028331	Job's done here. Time to pay a visit to Freeside.
0DI0028332	Probably should check my gear again, just to be safe.
0DI0028333	If you need a place to stay, check out Vault 21.
0DI0028334	I've heard about you.
0DI0028335	It's good to see you around the Strip.
0DI0028337	When I get back home, I'll tell everyone I met you.
0DI0028338	Step up to the tables, let's see what you got.
0DI0028340	I can't believe you've got the gall to stroll down the Strip after what you've done.
0DI0028341	Maybe someone else in the Strip can help you?
0DI0028342	If you don't mind, I rather we don't talk right now.
0DI0028348	Us NCR folk got to stick together, even if the Strip is the safest place in New Vegas.
0DI0028351	You're the one who busted those assholes at Gomorrah, huh? Good work!
0DI0028354	You look like you just crawled out of the desert.
0DI0028358	I never trusted those Omerta punks, even if I like their girls.
0DI0028359	I don't trust those creeps at the Ultra-Luxe.
0DI0028360	We need more people like you in the NCR.
0DI0028361	We should straighten those thugs at Gomorrah.
0DI0028362	We've heard about you from the officers at our embassy.
0DI0028363	You're wasting no time in making a name for yourself around here, huh?
0DI0028365	A Ranger, here in the Strip? Fine company, sir!
0DI0028368	Mr. House won't trouble our plans for the Strip any longer, huh!?
0DI0028371	Fuck that Caesar dog! I'm going to drink in your name, all night!
0DI0028374	So, our President's savior is enjoying a well deserved R&R? Fine piece of work you are!
0DI0028376	It's good to have the Khans on our side, but I hope they keep them out of the Strip. Those savages smell like Bighorner's ass.
0DI0028380	What's a mutant doing in the Strip?
0DI0028381	They let Ghouls into the Strip, now?
0DI0028382	Hold up, you look new to Vegas - I'll keep it short: no weapons allowed in the casinos.
0DI0028383	Hand them over, you'll get them back when you leave.
0DI0028384	Keep to the games, and there won't be any problems.
0DI0028385	Back for your gear? Here you go.
0DI0028386	Hey, there, friend, a bit of advice - you look like you could use some *protection.* Lucky for you, I got what you need.
0DI0028387	My stock and trade? Alllll kinds of easy-to-hide weapons for slipping into and out of casinos, they won't give you a second glance.
0DI0028388	Heard the Dam finally got what's coming to it. Strange days ahead - and that's why it's best to face the day armed.
0DI0028389	Some crazy days on the Strip. Still... it's good for business.
0DI0028390	Back again? Need a weapon for an emergency, Mister Holdout's your guy.
0DI0028392	Stories of how you saved President Kimball are the talk of the Strip, friend!
0DI0028394	Lady Luck's on your side. I hope some of that rubs off on me, Caesar killer!
0DI0028395	Now that you've killed that Caesar bastard, the Strip's really going to bloom!
0DI0028400	Later, uh, whoever you are.
0DI0028401	I don't talk to "nobodies," not when I'm having the time of my life!
0DI0028402	Sorry, I'm here to have a good time, not talk to random people.
0DI0028403	Howdy, come try your luck? I hope's on your side.
0DI0028404	That's a true friend of this wonderful place! Lady Luck shines on you.
0DI0028405	One of New Vegas' finest! You are always welcome in the Strip.
0DI0028406	It's a pleasure to see you, friend! Best of luck during your stay.
0DI0028407	So, what do you want with me?
0DI0028408	I'm not scared of you. Give me a good reason to call the law and, I swear, you'll regret it.
0DI0028409	Don't... do anything to me, okay?
0DI0028410	Uh-oh, I'll call the Securitrons if you try anything crazy with me, understand?
0DI0028412	Beat it, or I'll call the bots on you right quick.
0DI0028413	I'm not going to talk to you!
0DI0028414	I swear, I could kill you right now and never look back.
0DI0028415	You better scram before I sic the entire Strip after you.
0DI0028417	You're the talk of the day around the casino tables.
0DI0028418	I'd not touch Gomorrah's machines until the dust settles.
0DI0028419	I could smell something fishy going on at Gomorrah.
0DI0028420	I bet dirty business are going on at Gomorrah.
0DI0028425	Send those chips my way.
0DI0028426	Come to get fleeced like a Bighorner?
0DI0028427	Roulette, blackjack, slots... they have it all here.
0DI0028428	Ready to try your luck?
0DI0028429	Step up, let's see your game.
0DI0028430	You look like you got the itch, friend.
0DI0028431	You want to gamble with class? Hit the Ultra-Luxe, if you don't mind being serviced by masked creeps.
0DI0028432	Watch the slots, they're robbery.
0DI0028434	You've been making a name for yourself around here already.
0DI0028436	You look new here - be careful of Gomorrah.
0DI0028439	The Ultra-Luxe is fancy, but I get the shivers when I see their staff wearing masks.
0DI0028442	Good to have you around!
0DI0028443	Thanks for helping us keep the Strip safe.
0DI0028445	Miss.
0DI0028447	Pleasure.
0DI0028448	An NCR welcome to you.
0DI0028450	Welcome to Vegas - behave yourselves.
0DI0028451	If you're looking to join up, head on by the Embassy.
0DI0028452	Welcome to Vegas. Make your visit a peaceful one.
0DI0028459	Self-control is a virtue.
0DI0028463	Area is off-limits, citizen.
0DI0028464	Return to the surface, citizen.
0DI0028465	Disobedience will be punished.
0DI0028466	Look, "friend," don't get near me - you're too well respected for my business.
0DI0028467	Hey, think you can walk around here like nothing's happened?
0DI0028468	See, my friends and I, we were kinda wondering if we should give you a good beating right now, or save it for when we catch you outside.
0DI0028469	We don't like you Mojave scum, and we like you even less when you fuck with our Strip.
0DI0028470	So, you either pay up to walk around here, or we're gonna make you pay up. That clear?
0DI0028471	You back again, huh? We missed you, we've been waiting for you. Bet you've missed us too.
0DI0028472	Fuck off, punk. And pray we don't hear about you doing crazy shit again.
0DI0028473	Fuck this. I'm out of here - let them deal with this crazy place.
0DI0028474	I can't believe I put up with this kind of crap.
0DI0028480	Well, hello there. What a coincidence, finding you outside the Strip.
0DI0028481	You should've paid your dues, but, no, you had to play hard, huh? Now it's our turn.
0DI0028482	Nobody fucks with the NCR and lives to brag about it. You're dead, punk!
0DI0028483	Man, I'm sick of this place. Can't wait to get back to Red Rock.
0DI0028484	The NCR sure did a number on this place.
0DI0028485	Hope the NCR doesn't send reinforcements from the Dam.
0DI0028486	Fuck Benny. We'll make him pay for stabbing us in the back.
0DI0028487	There's more of them still out there.
0DI0028488	Beats going up against the Legion.
0DI0028489	Never gone up against Great Khans before.
0DI0028490	Man, this place is a mess.
0DI0028491	This rubble is slippery. Watch your step.
0DI0028492	We didn't get all of them. Talk later!
0DI0028493	It's about time they called us back.
0DI0028494	Work's slow right now, but at least it's something.
0DI0028495	Train's not working yet.
0DI0028496	I'm happy the Big Horn is still around.
0DI0028497	Some of the machinery's frozen up. Need someone to talk a look at it.
0DI0028502	What a fight!
0DI0028503	Go Red!
0DI0028504	Blood! We want more blood!
0DI0028505	Kiiiiiiill, kill now!
0DI0028506	I'm betting for Blue!
0DI0028507	Did you see that?
0DI0028509	Great fighting today.
0DI0028510	There's always more next day.
0DI0028511	That was a good day for The Thorn.
0DI0028512	The beasts don't look so tough behind bars, huh?
0DI0028513	I can't imagine this place will ever disappear.
0DI0028514	There's nothing else like The Thorn!
0DI0028515	One day I'll get to see Deathclaws tear through Fiends!
0DI0028516	I hope Red Lucy gives us the *big* monsters, next.
0DI0028517	More fights, we want more.
0DI0028518	I can't wait to see what fights next.
0DI0028519	What the hell?Is that a half-robot dog?
0DI0028520	You better control thatthing. Bots can't be trusted.
0DI0028521	A Follower is always welcome among our people.
0DI0028522	Keep the Ranger on a leash around here.
0DI0028523	Another Supermutant roaming outer New Vegas, huh?
0DI0028524	All humans are welcome here, even Ghouls.
0DI0028532	You saved the NCR's head honcho, sure you can save a bunch of low-life scum like us.
0DI0028533	Got time to save us too, or are you running errands for your NCR masters?
0DI0028543	I can't wait to hit The Thorn. I wouldn't mind hitting on Red Lucy either, but she's outta my league.
0DI0028545	Want to see the best of New Vegas? Our sewers got it - The Thorn!
0DI0028546	Saw a monster rip a man in half at The Thorn.
0DI0028547	Hey, you're the one that's been hunting the most dangerous beasts for The Thorn!
0DI0028548	Hey, It's great what you're doing for The Thorn, way to go!
0DI0028549	Wish I could've seen you capture those beasts for our Thorn!
0DI0028550	I've heard of your fights at The Thorn. People down here don't stop talking about you.
0DI0028551	Taking down a Giant Radscorpion, by yourself, has made you popular down here.
0DI0028552	Killing Fire Geckos at The Thorn is no joke, you're quite the fighter!
0DI0028553	You've beat Night Stalkers, right? We don't see that often down here.
0DI0028554	You've taken down Cazadores! Didn't think I'd ever see that.
0DI0028555	I heard you've killed Deathclaws at The Thorn. I couldn't believe it!
0DI0028558	One of those beasts cut my friend in half! How the hell did they escape from Red Lucy?
0DI0028570	Keep an eye on your stuff - damn thieves.
0DI0028581	Good to see you respect the Followers.
0DI0028582	Make sure the NCR dog behaves, you're in the Mojave now.
0DI0028583	Your merchant friend is always welcome among us.
0DI0028584	That bot of yours don't look like anything I've seen in the Mojave.
0DI0028585	Your friend's not from the desert, is she?
0DI0028586	We tolerate Wasteland savages, as long as they respect our rule around here.
0DI0028587	The owner of the Vault was murdered. I thought we were safe inside the Strip.
0DI0028588	I like the place, but I wouldn't want to live underground all my life.
0DI0028589	Can you imagine how much electricity it takes to keep this Vault running?
0DI0028590	People lived in here for hundreds of years, can you imagine?
0DI0028591	I wish the rest of the Vault were accessible.
0DI0028592	They have a fantastic menu at the diner.
0DI0028593	Haven't found any Radroaches, so far.
0DI0028594	This place's got a weird gloom after Miss Weintraub died.
0DI0028595	Did you get a tour? The owner has done a great job with this place.
0DI0028596	I've never seen so many pretty lights in my life.
0DI0028597	{Self Justification)It's cramped in here, sure, but who really needs a fancy room, anyway?
0DI0028598	Ya got any change, man? I've got five kids to feed.
0DI0028599	You're a crazy son of a bitch, you hear me! The Tops!? Ha! Crazy.
0DI0028601	Yeah I saw Benny running through here! He had the fear of the devil in him!
0DI0028602	You killed ol' cheeser!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
0DI0028603	Cheeser's dead!? They said he was a God! Ha, who ever heard of a God of cheese?
0DI0028604	There are many good things in life, but peeing is definitely the best.
0DI0028605	Hey! Don't poke me!
0DI0028606	Ow! Why are you poking me!
0DI0028607	You've got to keep your bitches in line!
0DI0028609	Go bother someone else.
0DI0028610	A man is never drunk if he can lie on the floor without holding on.
0DI0028612	Where'd The Kings go?
0DI0028613	Hey doc! You got any Fixer?! I've got a bender planned that would make a hobo cry.
0DI0028614	I think your friend wants to eat me! Please don't let him!
0DI0028615	Is there anything more beautiful than a beautiful busty brahmin riding a caravaneer off into the sunset... Wait I don't think that came out right.
0DI0028616	I'll give you five caps for the robot!
0DI0028617	Your ghoul friend looks shifty. Watch your pockets, buddy!
0DI0028618	What happened to your buddy's face?
0DI0028619	I am not an alcoholic, sir. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
0DI0028620	I am not an alcoholic, ma'am. I'm a drunk! There's a difference!
0DI0028621	The problem with some people is when they're not drunk, they're sober.
0DI0028622	People ask me how much it takes me to get drunk. I don't know. I usually can't remember numbers, let alone where I am the next morning.
0DI0028623	Hey! Watch your back! There be a pack of ol' ladies runnin' round here somewhere! Don't let them catch you unawares!
0DI0028624	Got some fresh grub coming in from Goodsprings.
0DI0028625	Joe Cobb's crew got themselves killed over in Goodsprings.
0DI0028626	Who's going to take charge with Eddie out of the picture?
0DI0028627	Haven't seen a decent caravan come up the road in days.
0DI0028628	Think that rollercoaster in Primm is still working?
0DI0028629	If it weren't for Cooke, we'd still be slaving away for the NCR.
0DI0028630	Gotta wonder why the NCR hasn't come for us.
0DI0028631	We sure showed those bastards in the NCR.
0DI0028632	Haven't seen Meyers around. Did he run off or something?
0DI0028633	Scrambler's crazier than usual. Watch yourself.
0DI0028634	You hear about the Deathclaws north of here?
0DI0028635	Could've sworn I saw some Great Khans the other day.
0DI0028636	Steer clear of the Mojave Post. NCR troopers all over the place down there.
0DI0028637	Man, I'm glad Scrambler's gone.
0DI0028638	I'm looking forward to getting sent across the river.
0DI0028639	That prisoner, Benny, managed to slip away somehow.
0DI0028640	The new slave girls are quite beautiful.
0DI0028641	The camps are getting crowded.
0DI0028642	Slaves aren't much of a challenge in the arena.
0DI0028643	I didn't think anyone could kill an NCR Ranger in single combat.
0DI0028644	Caesar lives!
0DI0028645	I'll mourn Caesar - he was a great man.
0DI0028646	Lupa met an honorable death in the arena.
0DI0028647	Some of the slaves have been spreading stories about the Burned Man again.
0DI0028649	Stay out of the control room and enclosure or there's gonna be trouble, got it?
0DI0028667	Get away! I'm not part of your fight!
0DI0028668	Get away from me! I don't want to get shot!
0DI0028669	Careful! There's still more of them.
0DI0028670	Don't think this is over yet.
0DI0028671	Way too many strangers coming into town these days. No offense.
0DI0028672	If you're looking for supplies, Chet over at the general store can help you out.
0DI0028673	Why don't you just move on to another town?
0DI0028674	Just leave us alone.
0DI0028675	We need more people like you around.
0DI0028676	Bit of a troublemaker, aren't you?
0DI0028677	Don't really care much for the unpredictable types. Just saying.
0DI0028678	That Doc Mitchell sure knows his stuff, doesn't he?
0DI0028679	At least the Powder Gangers are letting me live.
0DI0028680	I'm glad I didn't try to fight the gang.
0DI0028681	Hell of way to repay Doc, if you ask me.
0DI0028682	So many good people are dead...
0DI0028683	You come to the wrong place, traveler. Primm's dying. If you got any sense, you'll be moving on.
0DI0028684	Quite a town we got here. Sheriff gets murdered, and Deputy Beagle dragged off for ransom to the Bison Steve. That should bring back the tourists.
0DI0028685	Rather be left alone to my misery, if you don't mind.
0DI0028686	Before the Powder Gangers came to town, Johnson Nash ran the local store and the Mojave Express station.
0DI0028687	I ain't got nothing for you to eat. If you're hungry, see Ruby Nash.
0DI0028688	Thanks for freeing the deputy. A bit, anyway.
0DI0028689	Thanks for freeing Deputy Beagle. He's better than nothing. Maybe.
0DI0028690	Now you freed Deputy Beagle, all Primm needs is a law man who can shoot a gun without wetting hisself.
0DI0028691	I hear you're going to help find Primm a new sheriff. Mighty kind of you to take an interest.
0DI0028692	So you're the one's going to bring the law back to Primm? I'll believe it when I see it.
0DI0028693	I hear you aim to bring rule of law back to our town. God knows we need the help.
0DI0028694	Thanks for bringing the NCR to town, stranger. Things're finally looking up for Primm.
0DI0028695	Thanks to you I got a mess of soldiers watching every move I make, plus I got to pay taxes for the privilege!
0DI0028696	Those soldiers you brought down on us is all business, stranger. Better than lawlessness, though. So you've got my thanks.
0DI0028697	This new Sheriff Meyers you brought to us is a lawman through and through. Primm's looking up, stranger.
0DI0028698	Thanks for convincing Meyers to come sheriff for us. First time I feel safe in a long time.
0DI0028699	This Sheriff Meyers you found for us is working out. Knows his business. We owe you a debt.
0DI0028700	Man, it is a real uphill fight these days. I'm not sure how we are going to handle all these convicts.
0DI0028701	If you got something to say, say it to the Lieutenant.
0DI0028702	Careful, things aren't as safe around here as they could be.
0DI0028703	You'll probably want to talk to Hayes.
0DI0028705	Keep an eye out for more of them.
0DI0028706	This town don't look like much.
0DI0028707	Beats being in prison.
0DI0028708	I got dibs on the old doc's house.
0DI0028709	Need more women around here.
0DI0028710	Never liked Bighorners.
0DI0028711	Those townies put up a bigger fight than I expected.
0DI0028712	That was a hell of a gunfight.
0DI0028713	Nothing left to do but kick back and booze it up.
0DI0028714	You think any townies are hiding?
0DI0028715	I knew we were going to win all along.
0DI0028716	Hello and welcome to Gomorrah. How can I help you?
0DI0028717	Hey there, can I get you a drink, maybe a party favor?
0DI0028718	You looking for a good time?
0DI0028721	If I wasn't working right now, I'd show you a real nice time.
0DI0028722	Enjoying the show?
0DI0028723	I wouldn't mind taking a bite of you.
0DI0028724	Damn, you're looking tasty.
0DI0028725	Securitrons with faces like soldiers? Is this martial law or something? What the fuck?
0DI0028726	So Mr. House sells Vegas out to the NCR, eh? I always knew that freak was a rat.
0DI0028727	What the fuck's up with the Lucky 38 being lit up all the time, eh?
0DI0028730	Business is good. All the Familes got money. Of course Gomorrah is where the action is.
0DI0028757	I hear Mr. House cashed out. Ain't much to miss.
0DI0028762	Nice work at the Tops, buddy.
0DI0028771	A tribe called the Great Khans has joined us. They'd better be good fighters.
0DI0028772	They say a doctor killed Caesar. Why would Caesar need a doctor?
0DI0028773	I can't believe Caesar is dead. What will we do now?
0DI0028774	Caesar has been seen walking among the troops. A good omen.
0DI0028775	One of our agents successfully assassinated the NCR president.
0DI0028784	Think you can beat the house, baby?
0DI0028785	Lucky 21, baby!
0DI0028786	Feeling lucky? I got the best table in the joint!
0DI0028787	Scram, baby, I'm on my break.
0DI0028788	Can't you see I'm taking it easy here?
0DI0028789	Look, I'll be back at the table soon, baby, don't fret.
0DI0028790	Little birdies are chirping about the big Cheese of the Legion going deadsville real unexpected-like. Crazy old world, ain't it?
0DI0028791	You hear some crumb tried to kill the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
0DI0028793	Uh-oh, here comes trouble!
0DI0028794	Ha ha, this cat's crazy!
0DI0028795	Baby, you bring crazy with you!
0DI0028796	Hey, play it cool, baby, we just got the place fixed up.
0DI0028797	They, ah, checked your weapons at the door, right?
0DI0028798	Baby, you are some kind of crazy.
0DI0028799	Well, I guess your money's good here.
0DI0028800	Just do what you came to do and get out.
0DI0028801	We don't need your kind of trouble.
0DI0028802	You got some kind of nerve strolling around in here like this.
0DI0028803	Christ, who let you through security?
0DI0028804	You ain't welcome here, so just take a hike.
0DI0028805	This place is the bees knees!
0DI0028806	I dig this crazy slang!
0DI0028807	Ehh, the broads are better looking at Gomorrah.
0DI0028808	Buy a gal a drink?
0DI0028809	Hey, handsome.
0DI0028810	Why don't you come up and see me sometime?
0DI0028817	Heya, baby, what's the haps?
0DI0028819	This guy right here! This is the guy!
0DI0028820	This gal right here! This is the gal!
0DI0028821	Hang loose, baby.
0DI0028822	Baby, good to see you!
0DI0028823	Hey hey, there's my guy!
0DI0028824	Hey hey, there's my gal!
0DI0028825	Yeah, baby, now we can start the party!
0DI0028828	I thought Benny was a stand up guy - hard to believe he was a fink all along.
0DI0028830	Oh no, not again!
0DI0028831	You're the fink that killed Benny!
0DI0028832	I wonder where Benny ran off to.
0DI0028833	Heh. Guess those Omerta finks got what was coming to them.
0DI0028834	Who thought it was a good idea to give the robots missile launchers?
0DI0028835	If Mister House ain't the top dog on the Strip, whaddya suppose that means for us?
0DI0028836	Those Securitrons handing out obituaries? Creepy.
0DI0028837	You're the gasser who killed Caesar, ain't ya? Ring-a-ding!
0DI0028838	Ain't seen no soldier boys for a while. Guess they're all scared of coming out after that big boom.
0DI0028839	Looks like the troops are back. Good thing, too, this place was deadsville without their caps.
0DI0028840	Ain't you the cat that stopped Kimball getting iced? Gutsy, baby, but don't expect no free drinks for it.
0DI0028841	You hear some crazy crumb killed the president of the NCR? Gutsy, baby. Real gutsy.
0DI0028842	Hey, I heard about you - you're the one who saved the President! Here, this one's on me.
0DI0028843	I heard the Kings over in Freeside got their asses handed to 'em. Lousy no-good bums.
0DI0028844	Way I hear it, some big-leaguer NCR rangers are coming to town to dance a two-step all over Caesar's head.
0DI0028845	You dig these new rangers all dressed to the nines? Baby, the new fashion is killer-robot-chic!
0DI0028846	I got a pal who says the Legion's calling in their 18-karat big-leaguers. We're talking the boys from Arizona, baby.
0DI0028847	Baby, you couldn't pay me enough to step off the strip these days. Legion cats are out there thick as fleas on a dog, and they ain't no bums, neither.
0DI0028848	Hey, there's the high-roller!
0DI0028849	Baby, it's as tense as a virgin at Gomorrah out there. Things are heating up and if they don't cool down it's straight endsville.
0DI0028850	At least in the old days we could up and split when things got too heavy. Right now I miss those days.
0DI0028851	Baby, it's gonna be open war out there soon. If it was up to me we'd pack our toys, put this town to our backs and say "next stop: Scramsville."
0DI0028852	Why's the Lucky 38 take to shining all of a sudden? I smell a caper.
0DI0028853	House selling out to the NCR? Who woulda figured him for a fink?
0DI0028854	Go away, human.
0DI0028855	Head voices don't *like* you, squishy man!
0DI0028856	No! Head voices don't talk to you. Only to me!
0DI0028857	I keep an eye out for Rangers in black armor. I haven't killed one yet.
0DI0028858	Had the Legionaries at Nelson been more seasoned, we'd still hold the settlement.
0DI0028861	Imagine, a Follower brave enough to leave Freeside.
0DI0028862	The dog is part-machine... but its brain is flesh.
0DI0028863	What a revolting sight. To call that a friend?
0DI0028864	That machine looks like a floating eye. I don't like it.
0DI0028865	How does one get that blue monster to obey?
0DI0028866	All that Caesar promised has come true.
0DI0028867	Ave, amicus.
0DI0028868	Look to Bitter Springs to see what happens to disloyal slaves.
0DI0028869	I've heard the stories of how you assassinated Kimball. It's all my Legionaries will about.
0DI0028870	Kimball's assassin is always welcome here.
0DI0028871	The Centurion Silus will be punished for letting himself be captured. Coward.
0DI0028872	Legatus Lanius is come. The battle for the dam will soon begin!
0DI0028873	Legatus Lanius will arrive soon enough - and with him comes slaughter.
0DI0028874	Legatus Lanius draws near. The Profligates' days are numbered.
0DI0028875	Legatus Lanius is known as the Monster of the East - a name he has earned many times over.
0DI0028876	The black-armored Rangers are said to be fearsome in battle.
0DI0028877	The Legionaries fret like women over rumors of Rangers in black armor.
0DI0028878	There have been sightings of Rangers in black armor, the best the Profligates have to offer.
0DI0028879	I wish I could hear the Profligates weeping over the explosion at McCarran!
0DI0028880	The Mark of Caesar protects you.
0DI0028881	The warlord House thought himself beyond Caesar's reach. And now he is dead.
0DI0028882	Never once did I believe that was near death. I have friends in high places.
0DI0028883	The Legion will survive Caesar's death. It must!
0DI0028884	I felt the earth shake when the evil below the Fort was destroyed!
0DI0028885	Soon the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona. Each has killed many times his number.
0DI0028886	Our hounds were bred to kill. They are missed.
0DI0028887	It's said that every living thing at Nelson and Forlorn Hope camp was killed.
0DI0028888	I hear the Profligates at Forlorn Hope begged for their lives.
0DI0028889	Had I been the commander of our forces at Nelson, the town would still be ours.
0DI0028890	The Legionaries at Nelson were killed to a man. No survivors.
0DI0028891	So frightened are the Profligates that they've begun signing treaties with primitive tribes!
0DI0028892	Keep barking and I'll feed you to a dog.
0DI0028893	Watch yourself, Profligate.
0DI0028894	Hold your tongue, wastrel.
0DI0028895	Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
0DI0028896	Wretched Profligate. Try making some trouble.
0DI0028897	You belong on a cross, degenerate.
0DI0028898	I'd rather kill you than talk to you.
0DI0028899	When the time comes, I'll be the one to kill you.
0DI0028900	Give me cause, Profligate.
0DI0028901	Attack me. Give me license to kill you.
0DI0028902	You aren't trusted here, Profligate.
0DI0028903	You serve yourself, not the Legion.
0DI0028904	Why is your degneracy tolerated?
0DI0028905	You can't be trusted... but you're useful.
0DI0028906	How are we to trust one such as you?
0DI0028907	Who knows what you'll do next?
0DI0028908	You're a crazed one. I'll not talk to you.
0DI0028909	You do well to serve the Legion.
0DI0028910	You're wise to serve the Legion by choice.
0DI0028911	You've proved yourself useful, at least.
0DI0028912	You serve the Legion well, amicus.
0DI0028913	We each serve the Legion, in our way.
0DI0028914	Good to see you, amicus.
0DI0028916	I know your kind. You die easily enough.
0DI0028917	Have you seen the Legion's veterans, arrived from Arizona? They are fearless!
0DI0028918	It's said the Legion's veterans will arrive from Arizona soon. They are a sight to behold.
0DI0028919	Legatus Lanius is on the march. When he arrives, the real slaughter will begin.
0DI0028920	I have fought beneath Legatus Lanius many times. He cannot be defeated.
0DI0028921	Finally, the dam will be assaulted. Legatus Lanius is come.
0DI0028922	Kimball's assassin. Nicely done.
0DI0028924	House signing up with the NCR, you hear? Fucking sell-out.
0DI0028925	If House is dead, how'd the lights get turned on in his place, huh?
0DI0028926	House is dead, wonder if Motor-Runner will let us hit the strip now.
0DI0028927	Why's that tower on the Strip all fucking lit up now, huh? I don't like it.
0DI0028931	You hear about this courier doing shit around the Strip? Like what, delivering mail?
0DI0028932	I wouldn't mind hitting that. She put out?
0DI0028933	You see a Ranger in black, run the other way. Take you out from a quarter mile off.
0DI0028935	Someone is targeting us, I'm gonna kill that fucker when I find out who did it.
0DI0028939	So long as the Khans keep making it, I keep getting high.
0DI0028941	Motor Runner dead? Who the fuck gonna run the show now?
0DI0028942	Kimball dead, maybe the NCR will learn to stay the fuck out of other people's business.
0DI0028943	That NCR prez survived a Legion hit? Wouldn'ta guessed.
0DI0028945	House all dead, we should hit the Strip. Rip shit up.
0DI0028946	House dead, Strip can belong to anyone who wants it. Fiends to rule.
0DI0028947	People all scared of those robots on the Strip since they changed. Like who needs the Strip anyway?
0DI0028950	I've seen what those creatures do, and I don't know how you trust them.
0DI0028952	Did you hear about the Legion Defeat at Nelson? We're winning back our territories.
0DI0028954	I always knew House would give in! Sixth state of the union, here we come!
0DI0028961	I see you prefer the company of anarchic cultists to civilized peoples.
0DI0028962	What makes you think I give a damn about you?
0DI0028963	Just, don't do anything crazy.
0DI0028964	I hope you're doing well, friend!
0DI0028965	Don't bother me, please.
0DI0028967	Word is you're getting popular in The Strip.
0DI0028973	You killed him! What have we done to you?
0DI0028976	With Mr. House dead and gone, Vegas can finally join the NCR!
0DI0028977	Your robot looks worth quite a few caps.
0DI0028981	Don't care about Kimball, until he starts to care about us.
0DI0028982	Don't dump your Ghoul here, we've already got enough shit around us.
0DI0028983	People of my trade respect the merchants of these territories.
0DI0028985	I hear the Securitrons are tougher since their faces changed.
0DI0028986	House was the only thing keeping Vegas from joining the NCR!
0DI0028987	You're the one that killed Caesar, right?
0DI0028992	We owe you so much for saving our President.
0DI0029012	Back home we don't waste time talking to strangers, either.
0DI0029013	I really have more important things to do, sorry.
0DI0029014	Good to see a friend of our government.
0DI0029015	The NCR appreciates good citizens like you.
0DI0029016	I'm glad to see you.
0DI0029017	The NCR's fortunate to have your support.
0DI0029018	You're a model citizen, thank you.
0DI0029019	What do you want with me?
0DI0029020	You're not going to cause any problems, right?
0DI0029021	Uh-oh, back off and leave me alone.
0DI0029022	I don't want any trouble, okay?
0DI0029023	What the hell's going on in your crazy head?
0DI0029024	Don't talk to me!
0DI0029025	I don't waste my time with troublemakers.
0DI0029026	We should have you tried, and then killed on the spot!
0DI0029027	I'm too civilized, otherwise I'd stone you to death.
0DI0029028	I should make you pay for your crimes!
0DI0029029	I've seen Followers of the Apocalypse in my travels before.
0DI0029030	NCR Rangers deserve all my praise.
0DI0029031	Is your friend one of those elite troops we've been hearing about?
0DI0029032	Your merchant friend would make a fine NCR woman.
0DI0029033	I've never seen a robot like that before.
0DI0029034	The Supermutant's under control, I hope.
0DI0029039	Your Ghoul friend better not be radioactive.
0DI0029040	What on earth is *that* creature?
0DI0029041	Your lady friend seems out of place here.
0DI0029042	Your friend seems too civilized for a place like this.
0DI0029045	My lucky day, running into our President's savior!
0DI0029047	I'm not surprised Kimball survived. We NCR people are made of hard stuff.
0DI0029048	I should kill you myself for what you did to Kimball, and fuck the law!
0DI0029049	Even without our President, we won't leave the new territories!
0DI0029050	I bet I'd get a reward for bringing your head to the authorities, assassin!
0DI0029067	You'll pay for what you did to our soldiers at Forlorn Hope, murderer!
0DI0029074	Why the hell is the Lucky 38 all lit up these days? I don't like it.
0DI0029078	What's up.
0DI0029081	Never seen a guardian dog like that before.
0DI0029084	What on earth could push you to destroy Forlorn Hope?
0DI0029085	You're not going to raze us to the ground, like you did to Forlorn Hope, right?
0DI0029095	The great tower of the enemy city blazes with light. What does it mean?
0DI0029096	Sometimes friend, sometimes foe. No one knows what to make of you.
0DI0029097	I've heard stories about you. No one knows what you'll do next.
0DI0029098	I'm not looking for trouble. You can ignore me.
0DI0029100	My feet are killing me.
0DI0029101	It's said that you were responsible for Caesar's death.
0DI0029102	The Legionaries are pleased - an enemy called the Brotherhood of Steel is dead.
0DI0029103	The Great Khans tribe went mad. During the battle at the Dam, they attacked both the Legion and the NCR.
0DI0029104	The Legion has won a great victory over the NCR at a place called Forlorn Hope.
0DI0029105	I've heard that a great enemy of the Legion was assassinated in New Vegas.
0DI0029106	Caesar was ill, but now he lives.
0DI0029107	How disgusting. You can see that strange mechanical mongrel's brain.
0DI0029108	Ugh. One of the burned people walks in our camp.
0DI0029109	What a strange floating robot. Is it useful for anything?
0DI0029110	What is that thing? I've never seen a blue mutant.
0DI0029111	I overheard some of the Legionaries say that more veterans from the eastern campaigns will be summoned to the Fort.
0DI0029112	The leader of New Vegas and his army of robots has defeated both the NCR and the Legion. What will happen now?
0DI0029113	There's talk that many of the ranking Legionaries will be beheaded for allowing the NCR to defeat the Legion yet again.
0DI0029114	A great battle is coming. Many veterans of the Legion have begun arriving from the east.
0DI0029115	There are many rumors about who'll lead the Legion now that Caesar is dead.
0DI0029116	That was quite an explosion a while ago. We felt the ground shake!
0DI0029117	I've heard rumors that one of the tribes west of the river may join the Legion.
0DI0029118	The work never ends...
0DI0029119	So many tasks to attend to...
0DI0029120	I need to rest.
0DI0029121	It's best if I'm not seen talking to you.
0DI0029122	Be careful, or you'll end up being crucified.
0DI0029123	The Legionaries grumble about you. Be careful.
0DI0029124	The Legionaries want to kill you. Please don't get me involved.
0DI0029125	The Legion hates you. Why do you come here?
0DI0029126	Please - I'll be in trouble if the Legionaries see you speaking to me.
0DI0029127	You're trouble, I can tell.
0DI0029128	Be careful - the Legionaries aren't sure they can trust you.
0DI0029129	You're not quite an enemy, nor are you a friend.
0DI0029130	Your favor with the Legion grows, I've heard.
0DI0029131	Some of the Legionaries talk about you with growing respect.
0DI0029132	I'm honored to serve.
0DI0029133	Someone as important as you noticing me? I'm flattered.
0DI0029134	The Legionaries speak highly of you. I'm not worthy of your attention.
0DI0029135	It's an honor to be noticed by one so favored by the Legion.
0DI0029136	You're a woman, and yet you wander free?
0DI0029137	It turns out the Lucky 38 had its own reactor all along. Now that it's operational, the city doesn't need power from the dam.
0DI0029138	You're just as bad as the NCR or the Legion. What did the Followers ever do to you?
0DI0029139	People like you are the reason the Followers haven't brought civilization back to the wasteland yet.
0DI0029140	I don't know what you have against the Followers, but I don't want any trouble.
0DI0029141	You're always welcome among the Followers, friend.
0DI0029142	The Followers are lucky to have a friend like you.
0DI0029143	If you ever need the assistance of the Followers, just ask.
0DI0029144	You're making it hard to trust you, you know.
0DI0029145	At least you've making up for some of the trouble you've caused.
0DI0029146	They said you're friendly enough, but that we ought to keep an eye on you.
0DI0029147	I hear you've done some good things for the Followers.
0DI0029148	The Followers are always on the look on for new friends like yourself.
0DI0029149	I appreciate how you've been helping us so far.
0DI0029150	I really don't have anything you'd want.
0DI0029151	Look, I've got people to care for. I'm not looking for trouble.
0DI0029152	I don't get you. Sometimes you help the Followers, and other times you work against us.
0DI0029153	You're an enemy of the Followers, as far as I'm concerned. I don't care how you've helped us.
0DI0029154	The Followers can't trust you, you've proven that.
0DI0029155	I never imagined Mr. House would concede to the NCR. I wonder what convinced him...
0DI0029156	When people have got nothing left, they can always turn to the Followers.
0DI0029157	The Gun Runners ought to help the Followers by donating some of that firepower they've got.
0DI0029158	Wish the Followers would get me some better armor.
0DI0029159	Stay alert.
0DI0029160	Keep an eye out for trouble.
0DI0029161	There are so many refugees to care for.
0DI0029162	Medicine's running low again.
0DI0029163	All that wealth is wasted on the Strip. There are people in Freeside who need food and medicine.
0DI0029164	I have no idea how most of these people would survive without us.
0DI0029165	I didn't know the Brotherhood had any people out here.
0DI0029166	Look at that - a cyber-dog. There can't be many of those left.
0DI0029167	Look at that - a friendly Nightkin. What's it doing here?
0DI0029168	That is one battered Eyebot. It's a miracle it's still functioning.
0DI0029169	Isn't that Cass? I heard she'd gotten out of the caravan business.
0DI0029170	That's a First Recon beret. They're the best marksmen in the NCR military.
0DI0029171	I'll never get used to the sight of ghouls.
0DI0029172	The Brotherhood had a bunker in Hidden Valley, but it was destroyed somehow.
0DI0029173	I never thought I'd see the day when the NCR and the Kings started getting along.
0DI0029174	The Kings got hit hard. I don't know how many of them are still alive, if any.
0DI0029175	President Kimball was careless and overconfident, and it got him killed.
0DI0029176	Who would have thought someone would try to assassinate President Kimball with all those troops around?
0DI0029177	Did you see the monorail explode? The destruction was absolute.
0DI0029178	Caesar's death is good news for the NCR. For everyone, most likely.
0DI0029179	No one knows how Mr. House died. His obituary didn't say anything useful.
0DI0029180	The Securitrons in and around the Strip have been upgraded. It's almost like Vegas has an army now.
0DI0029181	Someone entered the Lucky 38. That's never happened before.
0DI0029182	Big shakeup in the management at Gomorrah. I wonder what that's about?
0DI0029183	Someone killed Benny, the Chairmen's bigshot, in his own casino. Violence begets violence...
0DI0029184	Did you hear about the shootout at The Tops?
0DI0029185	We're only trying to help people, and you're not making it easy on us.
0DI0029186	Don't let anything happen to Arcade, all right?
0DI0029187	See Julie Farkas if you need anything.
0DI0029188	Move along, buddy. I have work to do.
0DI0029189	Heard there was a firefight in one of the big casinos. Maybe they'll need to buy more ammo now.
0DI0029190	Careless of the NCR to let their monorail get blown up. Don't they have sentries standing watch?
0DI0029191	The Legion isn't going to go away just because Caesar is dead, if the rumor is even true.
0DI0029192	Kimball's bodyguards are probably pretty thankful they had Gun Runner weapons backing them up.
0DI0029193	Kimball's bodyguards should've been more heavily armed if they wanted to keep him alive.
0DI0029194	It's always good for business when the NCR scores a victory like the one at Nelson.
0DI0029195	Damn shame about Camp Forlorn Hope.
0DI0029196	Business has been brisk. Something big's coming, I can feel it.
0DI0029197	The orders for service rifles and ammunition have been pouring in from McCarran so fast we can't keep up. Hell of a fight is coming.
0DI0029198	First Recon is a top-notch unit. They're always buying sniper rifles from us.
0DI0029199	That Eyebot looks like it's gone through hell.
0DI0029200	I had no idea there was such a thing as a friendly Nightkin. Look at that thing.
0DI0029201	I've never a dog like that. Who thinks up these things?
0DI0029202	Man, I love my guns.
0DI0029203	People usually aren't stupid enough to steal from the Gun Runners. Usually.
0DI0029204	It's amazing what passes for a firearm around here. You'd be better off throwing rocks.
0DI0029205	The Lucky 38, all lit up in the distance? It's an inviting target.
0DI0029206	Mr. House finally wised up and said he'd join the NCR in a year or something like that. Good news all around.
0DI0029207	Have you seen what one of those anti-materiel rifles can do to a Deathclaw?
0DI0029208	Demand for Gun Runner weapons is high, so don't expect them to stay in stock for very long.
0DI0029209	Primm's got some new sheriff watching over the town now.
0DI0029210	The NCR's all over Primm. Steer clear.
0DI0029215	You and me are all right.
0DI0029216	Good to know that you've got my back.
0DI0029217	Don't let the NCR catch up to you, all right?
0DI0029218	You seem to be on the level.
0DI0029219	Heard some things about you. Good things.
0DI0029220	Guess we're on the same side.
0DI0029221	I respect you, but I want nothing to do with you.
0DI0029222	I've heard some crazy stories about you.
0DI0029223	Whatever is you want, keep me out of it. I've heard the stories.
0DI0029224	I don't think I'll be turning my back to you anytime soon.
0DI0029225	Keep your hands where I can see them - makes me feel better.
0DI0029226	You make it hard to trust you, you know that?
0DI0029227	You better be sleeping with one eye open.
0DI0029228	Why are you even talking to me?
0DI0029229	I'd kill you right now if I could.
0DI0029230	You're not exactly making friends around here, are you?
0DI0029231	You and I have got nothing to talk about.
0DI0029233	Holy fuck. Never seen a mutant like that before.
0DI0029234	Didn't know they still had robo-dogs around.
0DI0029235	Wouldn't want to live forever if I had to look like a ghoul.
0DI0029236	That guy's got cold eyes. Definitely ex-military.
0DI0029237	Now there's a fine-looking woman. Just needs to ditch the robe.
0DI0029238	Tough-looking woman. Something tells me she aims for the crotch.
0DI0029239	We bought and sold guys like Four-Eyes over there like property back in the prison.
0DI0029240	You eyeballing me?
0DI0029241	Damn. Running low on smokes again.
0DI0029242	Any lawman that comes after me won't have it easy.
0DI0029243	Never gets old when something blows up.
0DI0029269	Wouldn't mind having one of those little flying robots myself.
0DI0029270	The Lucky 38's all lit up because someone infiltrated the El Dorado and flipped a switch. I'd shoot those lights out if I could.
0DI0029271	You ever think about being a Ranger?
0DI0029272	I'd gladly fight at your side.
0DI0029273	You got my respect.
0DI0029274	That a pretty gal! Want to share?Ha ha ha!
0DI0029276	Hell of a place, huh?
0DI0029277	Staying long?
0DI0029297	When I got this assignment I was hoping there'd be more gambling.
0DI0029299	Why don't you go join the rest of the human trash across the river?
0DI0029300	Come on. Give me a reason.
0DI0029301	Shooting you right now might be worth the court-martial.
0DI0029302	I suggest you leave.
0DI0029304	You got a lot of nerve walking around here.
0DI0029305	You need to get your head straight. If you're fighting for us, act like it.
0DI0029306	You're insane. We shouldn't be letting you run loose around here.
0DI0029307	How are we supposed to trust you? You're completely unpredictable.
0DI0029308	Everything you've been up to... I just don't know what you're trying to pull.
0DI0029309	At least the Legion knows what they're fighting for. When are you gonna figure it out?
0DI0029310	Why don't you pick a side? We did.
0DI0029311	Honored to speak with you, sir.
0DI0029312	Honored to speak with you, ma'am.
0DI0029313	You know, if you were serving, you'd probably be halfway to general by now.
0DI0029314	Nice job out there.
0DI0029315	Glad you're with us.
0DI0029316	Hey. Welcome aboard.
0DI0029317	I'm not sure you should be here.
0DI0029318	You lost?
0DI0029330	Got business here?
0DI0029350	With House dead, we'll have Vegas annexed before the year's out.
0DI0029351	It's been a long tour. All I can think about now is going back home.
0DI0029352	You new to Freeside? Haven't seen you around.
0DI0029353	You looking to join the Kings?
0DI0029354	Do I know you? Whatever.
0DI0029355	I hear you're working out pretty well. The King's taken a shine to you.
0DI0029356	Stick by the Kings, and the Kings'll stick by you.
0DI0029357	I've been hearing good things about you. Keep it up.
0DI0029358	Hey pal, what's shaking?
0DI0029359	You're okay in my book.
0DI0029360	Hey there. You should stop by Freeside more often.
0DI0029361	You got guts, showing your face around here.
0DI0029362	You're lucky the King's a forgiving man.
0DI0029363	I don't need to talk to you.
0DI0029364	I wish you never came to Freeside.
0DI0029365	Back again? What's next, burn down the Wrangler?
0DI0029366	You're not wanted around here. Scram.
0DI0029367	Some people seem to think you've helped the community, but I have my doubts.
0DI0029368	There's talk of you being a menace, but I think you mean well.
0DI0029369	Well, you definitely accomplished some things here, but I can't tell if Freeside is better for it or not.
0DI0029370	You have got to be the craziest asshole I've ever met.
0DI0029371	A couple of us started a pool trying to guess what you've going to do next.
0DI0029372	Don't take this the wrong way, but are you, like, crazy or something?
0DI0029379	Man, I thought those tin cans of Mr. House's were tough before. Have you seen the shit they can do now?
0DI0029380	Turns out Mr. House wasn't so safe up in his tower after all!
0DI0029381	I wonder how Mr. House died. I figure it wasn't old age.
0DI0029382	How are we supposed to sleep with the Lucky 38 lit up 24/7?
0DI0029383	Holy crap! You're the one they're saying killed the Legion honcho right?
0DI0029385	You hear how Mr. House said "uncle?" Vegas is gonna join the NCR. So much for Freeside.
0DI0029404	Sounds like the NCR and the Legion are both gearing up for a fight. We've been seeing a lot more soldiers around.
0DI0029410	Heya Rex, how you doing boy?
0DI0029411	I see you've hired a Follower doctor. Smart move, Freeside being what it is.
0DI0029412	That friend of yours NCR? He looks like he's NCR.
0DI0029413	Hellooo, cowgirl! You mind if talk to your lady friend a bit instead of you?
0DI0029414	Huh. Nice robot. You with the Followers or something?
0DI0029415	Whoa. That's a whole lotta mutant you got with you there. Still, long as it doesn't cause trouble it's all good.
0DI0029416	Nice to see a human palling around with a ghoul. I see a lot of people around here avoid them.
0DI0029417	Your girl's kinda cute, but not my type at all. I don't go for smart chicks.
0DI0029418	Watch yourself. There's some unsavory types about.
0DI0029419	The Squatters have been more and more trouble lately.
0DI0029420	Man, I'm hungry. I'd give anything for a Fancy Lad. Wait, I mean- you know what I mean!
0DI0029421	Squatters aren't happy about the water rationing, but then when are they ever happy?
0DI0029422	It's gotten so bad that even I think twice before going out at night around here.
0DI0029423	The bodyguards at the gates aren't so bad. Except that Orris guy. That bastard runs his mouth a little too much.
0DI0029424	Can't wait to hit the Wrangler tonight. Just me and my favorite girl.
0DI0029425	I've been saving up for one of those sweet pistols at the Silver Rush. That'll get me some respect.
0DI0029426	Saw a guy try to rush through the south gate a few days ago. Nothin' left but dust, you know?
0DI0029427	Those Squatters think they're entitled to everything.
0DI0029428	Man, I still can't believe the Van Graffs took Pacer out.
0DI0029429	Shame about Pacer. We all tried to tell him to kick the habit, with that condition of his. He always did his own thing, I'll give him that.
0DI0029430	I used to guard at the gate, but there's no money in it these days. Only the big name guards get any business.
0DI0029431	Thank god the Followers are here. I'd probably be dead now if it weren't for their doctors.
0DI0029432	It's never dull in Freeside, is it?
0DI0029433	Heya, what's shakin'?
0DI0029436	They tell me I'm supposed to sell you weapons. Interested?
0DI0029437	What's up with the tower in Vegas being all lit up? I didn't know it could do that.
0DI0029438	Even that old House bastard gave in to the NCR. We're the only ones to make a stand!
0DI0029439	What are we going to do now that Papa's dead?
0DI0029440	Your friend's cute - is she single?
0DI0029441	I hope Papa knew what he was doing when he left you in charge.
0DI0029442	A robot dog? Never seen one of those before.
0DI0029443	Your pal's one ugly motherfucker.
0DI0029444	Holy hell, is that a Nightkin?
0DI0029445	Nice robot.
0DI0029446	You know you're traveling with a fucking murderer?
0DI0029447	Haven't seen a Follower around here in years.
0DI0029450	I ought to bleed you.
0DI0029451	Fuck off and die.
0DI0029452	Like we don't have enough problems.
0DI0029453	Just get the fuck out of here.
0DI0029454	What the fuck are you doing showing your face here?
0DI0029455	Why are you even here?
0DI0029456	Crazy-ass mother fucker.
0DI0029457	You been dosing on too many of Jack's chems?
0DI0029458	You're almost as crazy as some Fiends I know.
0DI0029459	Oh great, just who I wanted to see.
0DI0029460	You going to fuck shit up again?
0DI0029461	What do you want this time?
0DI0029462	You should have been with us in our glory days. You'd have loved it.
0DI0029463	Share a whiskey with me sometime?
0DI0029464	I wish there were more like you.
0DI0029465	I like you, stranger. You've stood by us when not many would.
0DI0029467	Why'd you come here?
0DI0029468	Come to gawk at the Great Khans, have you? Fuck off.
0DI0029470	The Legion and the NCR have mobilized their forces at Hoover Dam - it'll be time soon.
0DI0029471	It's starting to feel like tensions are coming to a boil. There will be full-scale war soon.
0DI0029472	Seems like everybody with a stake in the Mojave is gearing up for something big.
0DI0029473	So you've been sucked into the decadence of the Strip as well, have you?
0DI0029474	Caesar's veterans are making short work of the NCR - or that's what I hear.
0DI0029475	Soon Caesar will send in his best troops from the Arizona campaign - the NCR won't know what hit them.
0DI0029476	Those black-armored devils might be new to the Mojave, but they're butchers like all the rest.
0DI0029477	The runners are saying that the NCR is sending in their elite shock troops to try and push back the Legion.
0DI0029478	NCR spreads its infection to another town, I hear.
0DI0029479	I'm glad our brothers have returned home from Boulder City.
0DI0029480	Why did you kill our brothers in Boulder City?
0DI0029481	More Khan brothers cut down by NCR in Boulder City. We should kill a hundred of them in response!
0DI0029482	The 1st Recon butchers are in the field again. I'd love to head down to Forlorn hope and show them we haven't forgotten.
0DI0029483	So the NCR makes peace with the Kings now? Where was that mercy at Bitter Springs?
0DI0029484	Another tribe was wiped out in NCR territory? Can't say I'm surprised. I hope the surviving Kings learn from this.
0DI0029485	Our tribe's final stand will be remembered for a thousand years!
0DI0029486	We'll return, stronger than before!
0DI0029487	I can't believe they're all gone.
0DI0029488	So the Legion hit the murderers at Bitter Springs? Good.
0DI0029489	We're not moving as many chems now that the Fiends have been taken out.
0DI0029490	Diane's going nuts trying to find a new contact in the Fiends now that Motor Runner's dead.
0DI0029491	Typical - even within their highest ranks, the NCR is corrupt.
0DI0029492	So, the big bad chief ranger couldn't take the pressure, huh? Good.
0DI0029493	If I knew who killed Kimball, I'd buy him a drink.
0DI0029494	If you're going to assassinate the president of the NCR, you could at least do it right.
0DI0029495	Why the hell would you stop someone from killing Kimball?
0DI0029496	If you ask me, a true warrior wouldn't let himself be captured at all - but busting that Legionnaire out of McCarran was an impressive stunt.
0DI0029497	I would have thought the monorail bombing would slow the NCR down more.
0DI0029498	Whoever blew up that monorail is a damn hero.
0DI0029499	Karl's been in a shitty mood since that big explosion at the Fort.
0DI0029500	Word's spreading that Caesar is dead. No one seems to know much about how, though.
0DI0029501	Caesar can rot in hell for all I care.
0DI0029502	Not many get the favor of Caesar - even Papa hasn't been to the Fort.
0DI0029503	Rumor from the Strip is that House is dead. I hope the old bastard choked on his own tongue.
0DI0029504	Mr. House isn't a man to be trusted. Watch yourself.
0DI0029505	I heard from one of Melissa's runners that that check-coated bastard got thrown out on his ass.
0DI0029506	Papa says "cut off the head and the snake will die." I guess the Chairmen's days are numbered.
0DI0029507	I remember the Chairmen from their tribal days. They were punks then, they're punks now.
0DI0029508	You really killed Caesar himself? Maybe he's not the mighty warrior Karl said he was.
0DI0029509	You're the one who killed Kimball! If we had a bar here, I'd buy you a drink!
0DI0029510	We're fighting for the NCR now? I don't know about that....
0DI0029528	Usually I don't talk to nobody but robots. But lately some of them been two-faced.
0DI0029567	That tower on the Strip's lit up night and day now! What's it mean?
0DI0029568	Goddamn that Mr. House for selling Vegas out to the NCR! The whole Mojave will have to join up.
0DI0029573	Be advised, the Lucky 38 is not open to the general public. Trespassers will be shot. Thank you.
0DI0029575	Obituaries of the recently deceased Mr. House, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the Vegas Strip, are still available. Just ask any Securitron.
0DI0029585	Welcome to Vegas, capital of the sixth state of the New California Republic!
0DI0029587	Welcome to New Vegas, where a new day is dawning!
0DI0029588	Welcome to Vegas. Don't make trouble.
0DI0029635	They're hoarding our water! How are we supposed to survive the desert, huh?
0DI0029636	Hope those greedy bastards rot in foul water.
0DI0029637	One of these days, we're going to teach them a good lesson.
0DI0029638	We'll be back. They can't step over our people forever.
0DI0029639	Those hillbillies think they can take our water. We bring civilization, and this is how they repay us.
0DI0029640	Damned rats. Next time I see them, I swear, I'll aim right between their eyes.
0DI0029641	They've got no right to come near our outposts. This is NCR territory, now.
0DI0029642	I almost pity them, these desert savages.
0DI0029643	We'll get back our water, and our land, one of these days. We'll be mean to those soldiers until they leave!
0DI0029644	They're asking for it, those people from the NCR. We're tough, here! They don't scare us.
0DI0029645	This desert is our home!
0DI0029646	We've lived here a long time! We're not going to leave our home.
0DI0029647	They're mean! Don't want to share water with us.
0DI0029648	You must be very special to Mr. House, huh?
0DI0029649	How did you get in there?
0DI0029650	Wow... I've never seen anyone go into the Lucky 38 before.
0DI0029651	Don't mind me. I was just passing by.
0DI0029652	I bet everyone's going to hear about you going into the 38.
0DI0029653	My pals said nobody has ever been inside the Lucky 38.
0DI0029654	Hey, sexy, come by the Tops later. I'd love to hear your story.
0DI0029655	Whatcha want, freakshow?
0DI0029656	Who the fuck are you and why are you bothering me?
0DI0029657	Back again? Jesus....
0DI0029658	Come back to Violet, huh? What now?
0DI0029660	Hey there, sweet thing. Want a ride on the Cook-Cook express?
0DI0029661	Hi. I'm Frewell
0DI0029662	Fretwell again, brah.
0DI0029663	Frettie, a thirtie.
0DI0029664	Yo, I'm Willis, trooper Willis to you, punk.
0DI0029665	Me again, ahole!
0DI0029666	Why not?
0DI0029667	Henchman number 1, yeah.
0DI0029668	Henchman number 2 bro!
0DI0029669	Don't go messing around with the Fiends.
0DI0029670	We ain't here to help you, get out.
0DI0029671	What the hell are you doing here? Civilians shouldn't be here.
0DI0029672	It's not safe around here.
0DI0029673	Try not to get killed, okay?
0DI0029674	You should go topside.
0DI1000001	[Christine nods gratefully. She glances in the direction of the terminal, looks at you, smiles, gives a thumbs up.]
0DI1000002	Supposed to be the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre. Lot of lights, music, the works.
0DI1000003	And he's going to use the Gala Event... to open the casino? But... that's... interesting.
0DI1000004	Unless you get some Hologram guards lit up in the courtyard below? No dice.
0DI1000005	Whoa, whoa, whoa... in the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
0DI1000006	Tell you what - why don't you just find one of those Cosmic steak knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
0DI1000007	Yeah, now. Talk about a captive audience. Or captive entertainer? Eh - whatever.
0DI1000008	Stupid? No, playing it smart. You're the dumb one, waltzing in here without realizing who the headliner is.
0DI1000009	I can take a chump like you even if I didn't have eight lives lined up behind me, and a rising soundtrack. So put your dancing shoes on - let's go.
0DI1000010	No idea... woke up here, thought I was dreaming for a second... right back on stage, the mic...
0DI1000011	Thought I was back at the Fronds... well, except no audience, used to pack theaters back then... so stepped up on the stage, check things out...
0DI1000012	Then suddenly Holograms walked out of the wings... and they started raising their hands to their heads all creepy-like, not a good sign.
0DI1000013	No... looks like a rooftop in Puesta del Sol. In better days, nice view. Now? It's the last place anyone wants to stand when this event goes off.
0DI1000014	That place during Spring, Summer, and Fall, a little bit in Winter, is a prime resort spot for Ghost People. Not the best of neighborhoods.
0DI1000015	If we're going there, I'm not going alone. And if you have any bright ideas about telling me to stroll over there - or leave me there? No thanks.
0DI1000016	No... no, no... I'm not leaving this spot. Why dirty my hands when the Sierra Madre can kill you for me?
0DI1000017	Time for a little show - I'll just grab a seat and watch how this plays out from backstage. Security can handle it from here.
0DI1000018	Look, I'm more about the short goodbyes than long thankful speeches... but I appreciate you bailing me out of a tight spot there - partner.
0DI1000019	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So let me give you something a little more practical - a way we both come out ahead.
0DI1000020	I know you didn't do it out of the goodness of your heart. So... instead of empty words and a flourish, let me give you something more useful.
0DI1000021	No, I'm not. I'll get out in time - you won't. Once I kill you, exit stage left, and my collar will go quiet.
0DI1000022	You think I'm the bad guy here? I'm not the one slapping bomb collars on innocent folks and flicking the switch.
0DI1000023	And I'm not stabbing you in the back. I was facing you all the time. This heist? I planned it lifetimes ago. You and that old man? Tourists.
0DI1000024	I was already was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and making a break for the gate before the light show started...
0DI1000025	...and before Vera finished her Gala speech... I knew what'd happen with "music" in the streets and lights in the sky... Ghost People. Lots of them.
0DI1000026	Also meant the front gate was open, and no way was I missing it after all these years. Then... I walk in... and...
0DI1000027	Me? I was halfway off the rooftop, through the service tunnel and bee-lining for the gate before the light show started...
0DI1000029	But that was your problem. Anyway, front gate was open, no way I was letting you get in first. I walk in... there's a flash... and I'm here.
0DI1000030	Must have been Sinclair's security... he always had a thing about letting any threats into the casino. Security system's twitchy that way.
0DI1000031	Me, though, I'm a guest here, so I guess I got the royal treatment after all.
0DI1000032	Good. If necessary, I will guide you through the Villa's broadcast systems - if you get lost, return here, and I'll direct you.
0DI1000033	I've downloaded instructions on an audio log to your Pip-Boy in case you can't read... if you forget why you're here, let my voice remind you.
0DI1000034	Then go. The Sierra Madre may wait... I will not.
0DI1000035	I am short on patience. And you are short on time.
0DI1000036	Ask.
0DI1000037	I've downloaded the instructions and markers on your Pip-Boy... in case you forget. And yes, I have access to that device on your wrist.
0DI1000038	Get the other three here, after that... I'll have more instructions for you.
0DI1000039	Do this, I'll let you go. I'll let all of you go.
0DI1000040	[Christine glances at the elevator, her expression becomes worried, then she looks back at you, then reluctantly shakes her head.]
0DI1000041	[She frowns, then makes a motion as if typing at keys... then she points at you, raises her left wrist and pantomimes talking into it.]
0DI1000042	[She points at you, then her, looks right and left, raises two fingers, tries to type, pauses, and slowly shakes her head.]
0DI1000043	[She smiles humorlessly. She then nods once slowly. Then she shakes her head slowly.]
0DI1000044	[She then looks at you, her face wrinkled in a humorless smile.]
0DI1000045	[She points in the direction of the main gate. Then points at your collar, shakes her head, and locks her hands around her neck.]
0DI1000046	[Then her hands lash outwards, fingers splayed and she rolls her eyes back. After a second she turns back to you shakes her head.]
0DI1000047	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods... slowly, then puts her hand in front her throat, closes it slowly, then points at you.]
0DI1000048	[FAILED] [She frowns, narrows her eyes, and looks at you.]
0DI1000049	[She moves her finger in a circle, frowns, then drags her hand down over her eyes. She raises them again, points to you.]
0DI1000050	Tourists, you bet. They don't stay long... and they don't stay alive long.
0DI1000051	If they survive the Cloud, the Ghost People, the traps, then greed takes over, and they start sizing each other up for funeral suits.
0DI1000052	"Alive's" a tricky word. The locals, the Ghost People? Not sure it applies to them.
0DI1000053	They're a little... uncivilized. They don't talk much. As in, at all.
0DI1000054	Why? Survival. I still needed to leave the Residential Area to scrounge up supplies, and I don't like taking chances.
0DI1000055	The Villa's dangerous. So I left weapons and stims in case I got in a tight spot. Then, of course, you show up, putting your mitts on everything.
0DI1000056	I suppose this qualifies as an emergency, so I'm not complaining. Much.
0DI1000057	[Christine shakes her head, then pauses, and makes a small circle with her thumb and forefinger.]
0DI1000058	[She points at you, and makes the motion of putting something in her palm.]
0DI1000059	[SUCCEEDED] [Christine frowns, then pauses and traces one of the scars on her head with her finger.]
0DI1000060	[She then makes a motion as if picking up a pencil, tries to write, then shakes her head.]
0DI1000061	[FAILED] [Christine nods, frowns, then points at you, then points West. Then she glares at you.]
0DI1000062	[Christine draws a jagged lightning bolt in the air, pantomimes throwing a grenade, and then pulls an imaginary knife from behind her back.]
0DI1000063	[Then she moves her feet shoulder width apart, holds hands up in a martial arts stance, then turns both hands into pistols, pantomimes rapid-firing.]
0DI1000064	[She then holds one pistol up, takes aim as if sighting along the barrel and does a single shot, ends with a nod.]
0DI1000065	Those little company stores? Sinclair's toy boxes, put in a casino chip, get a treat, like you're some dog doing tricks.
0DI1000066	Take any of the casino chips, put 'em into the machine, and you'll get something out - a snack, a cola, something to mend a tear in your shirt.
0DI1000067	Sometimes you have to know exactly what to ask for, other times, there's codes for... eh, unconventional items. For emergencies.
0DI1000068	The Cloud? Showed up after the Bomb. I think. I got used to it in small doses. Now, it covers the city.
0DI1000069	Over the years, it kept climbing up out of the Sierra Madre, until it was curtains for the sun. Didn't see the sky again.
0DI1000070	Doesn't seem to bother the Ghost People. Can't see through it too well, though, so sometimes I can use the Cloud for cover... if I get desperate.
0DI1000071	Residential area, clinic, police station - should keep away from the police station, it's a Ghost People hangout.
0DI1000072	Salida del Sol, Puesta del Sol are East Town, West Town. "Sunrise" and "Sunset." Or were when the streets and sky weren't covered with toxic gas.
0DI1000073	Ghost People don't come into the Villa much. West Town and East Town, though... they're thick with the Cloud and Ghost People. Like hunting grounds.
0DI1000074	Don't be long.
0DI1000075	[Christine nods.]
0DI1000076	Whatever you're planning, hurry.
0DI1000077	Hrnnh. Dog will wait.
0DI1000078	If so, the Sierra Madre Casino, in all its glory, is inviting you to Begin Again.
0DI1000079	Come to a place where wealth, excitement, and intrigue await around every corner.
0DI1000080	Stroll along the winding streets of our beautiful resort, make new friends... or rekindle old flames.
0DI1000081	Let your eyes take in the luxurious expanse of the open desert, under clear starlit skies. Gaze straight on into the sunset from our Villa rooftops.
0DI1000082	Countless diversions await.
0DI1000083	Gamble in our casino, take in the theater, or stay in one of our exclusive executive suites that will shelter you - and cater to your every whim.
0DI1000084	So if life's worries have weighed you down... if you need an escape from your troubles... or if you just need an opportunity to begin again, join us.
0DI1000085	Let go and leave the world behind at the Sierra Madre grand opening, this October. We'll be waiting.
0DI1000086	[The Hologram cashier nods, then a section of the tabletop slides away, and a package rises from it.]
0DI1000088	[The Hologram cashier nods, takes a step back, then the whole tabletop slides away. A package slowly rises from the opening, steam trailing from it.]
0DI1000089	[You place the bills on the counter, a panel flips, taking the bills with it... and 100 Chips appear in their place.]
0DI1000090	[You set the stack of bills down. A panel flips, there is a whir, series of clicks, and a stack of chips rises up in place of the bills.]
0DI1000091	[Christine stares at the headless corpses for a second. Then she makes a slow, angry scowl.]
0DI1000092	The quick... the quick scribe... jumped over the lazy paladin.
0DI1000093	Mi-mo-mih.
0DI1000094	This is Knight Christine Royce, of the Brotherhood... Christine Royce.
0DI1000095	Ugh... feels like a sore throat - after chewing on nails.
0DI1000096	Sounds like I smoked a mile of cigarettes.
0DI1000097	Feels like the Cloud crawled in my mouth and died.
0DI1000098	Chris-tine. Chris-tine. Hello. Hello. Hello.
0DI1000099	[Christine makes a sweeping motion of the room, does a deep inhalation, then gives a thumbs up.]
0DI1000100	[Christine sniffs the air, then gives a thumbs up.]
0DI1000101	[Christine's breathing quickens, and her eyes dart around the walls.]
0DI1000102	[Christine seems to be sweating heavily, and her hand is twitching slightly. She looks ready to bolt.]
0DI1000103	[Christine nods at the ground, points at her eyes, then points at the ground again, as if in warning.]
0DI1000104	[Christine motions at ground, makes a snapping motion with her hand, then taps her eyes and pantomimes walking slowly, looking in front of her.]
0DI1000105	[Christine scans the area. She seems on edge, checking the arcades and arches for movement.]
0DI1000106	[Christine makes a motion of loading a fake gun, then suiting up.]
0DI1000107	Can't believe I came all this way to have my voice stolen.
0DI1000108	Guess the Sierra Madre healed me. It doesn't matter, and to be honest, I miss my voice.
0DI1000109	I've had enough of you and Elijah running the show. Now it's my turn.
0DI1000110	The elevator to the casino vault is here. In the starlet's room? That seems intimate.
0DI1000111	Too long. Thought I might have had a chance to settle it before this event happened, but then the chance slipped away again.
0DI1000112	He... cut me off from someone I cared about a long time ago. He used his status to break us apart. So I had to find a new purpose, same banner.
0DI1000113	Then he became unstable, left a trail of crimes across the wasteland. Once word reached us, I was ordered to kill him.
0DI1000114	Do I? It sounds off to my ears... hard to tell. Not to mention it... hurts like hell to swallow.
0DI1000115	Might be why I got moved off to this suite... it's hers. That's her over there, got trapped by security like I did. Just took a different way out.
0DI1000116	Those are my orders. I've seen what he's done, and I believe in those orders.
0DI1000117	[Christine shakes her head, more insistently this time. She points at the elevator, then downwards, then holds herself tightly and shakes her head.]
0DI1000118	[She looks at you, blinks again, then opens her mouth - but nothing comes out.]
0DI1000119	[She touches her throat, then traces the scar beneath the chin, and her eyes widen in alarm.]
0DI1000120	[She looks shaken. As she glances at the Auto-Doc, she recoils, and her mouth opens - but again, nothing comes out.]
0DI1000121	[She looks back at you, and her hands clench into fists - her eyes narrow, and she takes a step back, studying you.]
0DI1000122	[The woman opens her mouth again, winces, then frowns and drags a finger across her throat in a slow motion. She looks more angry than pained now.]
0DI1000123	[Frowning, she touches her throat again, gently, then her hand brushes her collar, then her frown deepens.]
0DI1000124	[Her eyes narrow as she traces the edge of the collar until she finds the lock. She begins to press it with her fingers.]
0DI1000125	[She looks surprised. Then notices your collar, and raises an eyebrow.]
0DI1000126	[She frowns, narrows her eyes, then slowly shakes her head.]
0DI1000127	[She shakes her head again and draws a line in the air between the two of you.]
0DI1000128	[She shakes her head - once, then crosses her arms.]
0DI1000129	[Christine glances straight up, frowns, then turns back to you and taps her wrist.]
0DI1000130	[She looks exasperated, then waves her hand in a circle in front of her.]
0DI1000131	[She raises an eyebrow, then tilts her head slightly.]
0DI1000132	[She frowns, then cups her hand to her ear.]
0DI1000133	[She shakes her head... then pauses, and shakes her head again, then looks exasperated.]
0DI1000134	[Christine looks blankly at you. Then touches her head, smiles, then shakes her head.]
0DI1000135	[She waves her hand, then shakes her head - she then nods in the direction of the casino.]
0DI1000136	[She nods with an exasperated look, then makes a circle with her hands, repeats it twice more, then raises her hands and waves them like wings.]
0DI1000137	[She puts both hands in front of her, then makes a motion with her hands as if writing something.]
0DI1000138	[She nods. She looks impressed.]
0DI1000139	[She shrugs. Then she points to you and shrugs.]
0DI1000140	[She shakes her head.]
0DI1000141	[She touches one of the scars on her cheeks, shakes head. Then touches the scar on her neck, and nods.]
0DI1000143	[She shivers slightly, and shakes her head.]
0DI1000144	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, looks impressed.]
0DI1000145	[FAILED] [She shakes her head, then nods in the direction of the casino again.]
0DI1000146	[She moves her finger in a wider circle, then raises her hand over her eyes.]
0DI1000147	[Her eyes widen, and her eyes gauge yours. She then touches her wounds, and her expression crumbles into anger, as if defeated. She slowly nods.]
0DI1000148	[Christine narrows her eyes slightly. She slowly nods, then steps slightly behind you.]
0DI1000149	[Christine glances at your follower, shakes her head, then points at you, her, and nods in the direction of the fountain.]
0DI1000150	[Christine's defeated expression vanishes into a stone-faced glare.]
0DI1000151	[Christine gives a brief nod, then turns and begins to walk.]
0DI1000152	[She frowns, glances at the collar, looks back at you. She makes a circle with her hands, puts her hand over her eyes and squints.]
0DI1000153	[She nods at you, then lowers her hand from her eyes, shakes her head. She draws a slow line between you.]
0DI1000154	[She studies you again, then her expression softens slightly. She shakes her head slowly, and gives a silent sigh.]
0DI1000155	[She nods at you, then raises an eyebrow and nods at the door.]
0DI1000156	Should be able to rewire them, failing that, shoot them, although that'll alert the others, they're on a linked patrol pattern.
0DI1000157	He saw me, before the scars, at a place far from here. It's where he found some of the technology he uses now.
0DI1000158	It's a place called the Big Empty. The name's deceptive - if you know where to look.
0DI1000159	Almost got trapped there. There was someone else, though, who came along. Knew about Elijah.
0DI1000160	No idea. A courier. Wore an Old World flag on his back. He was the one who pulled me out there, told me where Elijah had gone.
0DI1000161	Helped me heal up, listened to my story. He... sympathized.
0DI1000162	He said he understood what it meant to track someone who had such a... impact on his past life.
0DI1000163	He said people were like couriers, sometimes never understanding the messages they brought. That's who he was hunting for... some courier.
0DI1000164	Try and reason with him, see what happens. He's so lost in his technology, I don't think he even understands why anymore.
0DI1000165	So come on and get me, jackass. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
0DI1000166	So come on and get me, bitch. I'll have this floor's security dissect you like an Auto-Doc.
0DI1000167	Leaving me in that goddamn elevator in the dark? You'll beg me to do the same to you while the Holograms are tracing lasers across your face.
0DI1000168	[Christine motions to you, points at the door uneasily, then makes a pulling motion with her hand. She seems hesitant to go near it.]
0DI1000169	All doors are locked down, security's activated - and emitter signals are lighting up all over this floor. I'll do what I can from here.
0DI1000170	You'd think it was Spring the way tourists keep rolling in.
0DI1000171	That one's got a head on their shoulders. For now.
0DI1000172	Hope that tourist is hurrying, haven't got all day.
0DI1000173	At least this one seems like a straight shooter. Or sucker.
0DI1000174	That tourist crosses me, they'll regret it. Even if they don't, they still might.
0DI1000175	Should never have set that radio signal on repeat.
0DI1000176	There's a picture, a bunch of headless saps all waiting for the pearly gates. Whoever did this... messed up.
0DI1000177	Oh, looks like you already forced the gate. Now, everybody and their mother can walk right in, thanks.
0DI1000178	What are we doing in here? Planning to toss me in a cell?
0DI1000179	Going to be sad to leave the Residential District. Well... not really.
0DI1000180	Sure left a lot of traps around. Sometimes I forget where they are.
0DI1000181	As worse as the other places are? This section of town is the most dangerous.
0DI1000182	We need to get out of here - come alone if you want, don't drag me here.
0DI1000183	Hear there's a belltower and church to the North... filled with Ghost People.
0DI1000184	The cafe survived? How about that. Had great coffee - and one of the waitresses? Rhonda? Piece. Of. Work.
0DI1000185	Do not leave me here.
0DI1000186	Never liked the Chief here, real stickler for "policy."
0DI1000187	Made off with a lot of mines, shotguns, and explosives from here... wasn't easy with the Ghost People around.
0DI1000188	Got a worse grease smell down here than Danny Parker's hair on Opening Night.
0DI1000189	What are we doing here for? This place is... well, it's haunted.
0DI1000190	Seriously, we should get out of here. The Security Holograms... shoot on sight, and you can't even hurt them.
0DI1000191	Salida del Sol - "Sunrise." Not much to look at now.
0DI1000192	You sure came a long way to rob this place. Guess greed is in the blood.
0DI1000193	Breath of fresh air in here... literally. If you need to take a breather from the Cloud, this is a good spot.
0DI1000194	Might be a nice place to hole up for a while.
0DI1000195	Check the fountains, might have some wishes... er, chips we can snag.
0DI1000196	Watch the ground for bear traps and any openings for tripwires.
0DI1000197	Ghost People.
0DI1000198	If I ever had to come here, I stuck to the overhangs and roofs - like sidewalks up there.
0DI1000199	Like a toxic ashtray down here.
0DI1000200	Find a way to get this place hopping again... would clean all the toxic gas out of Puesta del Sol.
0DI1000201	Stinks down here. And I can barely smell anything.
0DI1000202	Sure glad one of us knows what you're doing.
0DI1000203	You know, this used to be a nice town. Well, nice enough.
0DI1000204	When in doubt, step quiet - and watch where you step.
0DI1000205	Where there's a bear trap, Ghost People aren't far behind.
0DI1000206	Watch out if you see a prize lying around - the Ghost People leave "supplies" as traps.
0DI1000207	Getting real tired of tourist season - no offense, but you guys are lowering the bar.
0DI1000208	Cloud wasn't always here. Grew over the years, even without cars or factories.
0DI1000209	Sierra Madre may wait. Not me.
0DI1000210	Sierra Madre's not getting any younger.
0DI1000211	What's next?
0DI1000212	Might be a bit rude, but that chair you're sitting in - it's got a shaped charge in the seat cushion.
0DI1000213	[SUCCEEDED] Sounds like you've done some blue collar construction work in your life, your Ma must be proud. Still...
0DI1000214	[FAILED] "Butt" is right. That heart-shaped charge in the stuffing will cause just the right amount of bleeding.
0DI1000215	Great, a moron - just what I need. Look? That seat you're sitting in? It's a bomb. Go boom.
0DI1000216	Get up without my permission, I'll blast your ass so far through your head, it'll turn the moon cherry pie red.
0DI1000217	So - let's keep this sweet and polite, and finish our conversation with no misunderstandings.
0DI1000218	Just because I work in entertainment, doesn't mean I'm a moron.
0DI1000219	I heard my necktie beeping, I know what that means - I'm part of this somehow. I want out of this contract.
0DI1000220	And if you put me in it, I'm not going to be too happy. So whatever's going on here, if you're part of all this? You're taking orders from me.
0DI1000221	I'm not an idiot. I know the reason I'm in here now is because of the old guy - and you.
0DI1000222	And you're wearing a collar, so I trust you a little more than the old guy. He's more controlling than I'd like.
0DI1000223	Thing is, here's where being my partner pays off. See, I know how to get into the casino vault.
0DI1000224	So here's the short of it - piece together Little Miss Vera Keyes' song in the right order? Sierra Madre opens its legs, we're in business.
0DI1000225	[SUCCEEDED] And that's what I've missed - a rapt audience.
0DI1000226	[FAILED] You don't listen too good, do you? Makes me think whatever you have to say isn't worth my time.
0DI1000227	Oh, of course you do. Now, it's like we're married with these big wedding rings around our necks.
0DI1000228	So why don't you hear my proposal first, before you start talking about what you need.
0DI1000229	Christ, if that collar blows, I don't know if you'd know the difference, you'd probably still keep walking around with that dumb, blank look.
0DI1000231	Good, good - then we're in business. I may be a betting man, but I like it when the odds are in our favor.
0DI1000232	If you're here with who I think, then I'd rather have you on my side than his. An... ace in the hole.
0DI1000233	You want to live, I want what's in the Madre. Real simple.
0DI1000235	Tried talking to them, bribing them, leaving food - nothing. In the years since, they haven't changed their approach, but I sure have.
0DI1000236	They catch you, they drag you into the Cloud, and you're not coming back out. After that, having your necktie go off would be mercy.
0DI1000237	My advice? Stay out of their way, they don't die easy.
0DI1000238	That's an interesting clause. That's a real bad contract you have. We have.
0DI1000239	[SUCCEEDED] What are you talking about?
0DI1000240	[FAILED] The hand's been dealt, that's the deal. You going along with my terms, or do you want your brains to be wallpaper?
0DI1000241	Just like all the rest. Strolling in here, thinking you own the place. I've been here longer than any of you tourists.
0DI1000242	Trust me, I'm letting you off easier than the Sierra Madre ever would. Nobody's going to miss you... whoever you are, you're old news.
0DI1000243	All right, all right... looks like marriage finally caught me.
0DI1000244	I'm listening... partner. What's next, if we're death-til-we-part?
0DI1000245	Not leaving me much choice. The Fountain, huh? Hope the Hologram's still working and the battery's running strong.
0DI1000246	I'll follow you, I'm not going alone, trust me. Not like I'm a coward or anything, I'm not running around town without an escort.
0DI1000247	I'm serious. One of the locals catches us, we aren't coming back - and I'd like to keep an eye on you.
0DI1000248	You shoot them, they get back up. You stab them, they get back up.
0DI1000249	That's why I have explosives all over this place - unless you blow them up, chop them up, disintegrate 'em, the Ghost People don't go down.
0DI1000250	Not enough bullets in the town to spend on them. So unless you're a real good shot, save one for yourself right before they catch you.
0DI1000251	[SUCCEEDED] Well... you seem like you know how to handle yourself. All right.
0DI1000252	Once, I fired a lucky shot, hit a gas tank one was holding. Blew his arm off at the shoulder... and he didn't get back up after that.
0DI1000253	So if you're that good, don't aim for the head - aim for their bombs. And if you can wait until his buddies are close by, even better.
0DI1000254	[FAILED] Yeah, well, "probably" is something a gambler says, not a survivor. I'd keep your pistol where it belongs - in the holster.
0DI1000255	Friend... "there's more mysteries in heaven and earth..." wait, no, "there is more between heaven and earth..." oh, forget it.
0DI1000256	I'd sooner ask what makes me an undying son of a bitch than spend any thought as to why they crawled to life here.
0DI1000257	I'm counting myself lucky I still have my faculties - they sure don't. Then again, they may not have had the... focus I do.
0DI1000258	Wait, wait... wait just a minute. I'm not walking out there on my own.
0DI1000259	Always had the Sierra Madre to keep my mind occupied.
0DI1000260	Most folks, they don't have the same drive, the same need. Not worth my time. Pretty much Ghost People before the Bomb, now Ghost People after.
0DI1000261	I know what's out there. It's why I've planted a mine field, shotguns, and explosives all the way on the road to my little boudoir here.
0DI1000262	So we go together, or we're not going at all. I'll split my hand in Blackjack when the time's right, I'm not splitting up in this town, trust me.
0DI1000263	All right... partner.
0DI1000264	All right, all right... but you already got company, so tell you what - I'll meet you at the Fountain.
0DI1000265	That's... a good point. All right, let me grab some smokes, and I'll meet you at the Fountain.
0DI1000266	All right, keep it short, we don't have a lot of time.
0DI1000267	Of course you do. Let's hear 'em.
0DI1000268	It's your time, and if you want to spend it chatting, not much I can do about it.
0DI1000269	Whatever we do - don't rile them up. Normally, there's only a few, maybe a pack. There's more out there, a lot more.
0DI1000270	If they find out someone's trespassing, it'd be shaking a hornet's nest. Don't want to think how many of them could fill these streets.
0DI1000271	Yeah, well, machines like those weren't unusual before the Bomb. Maybe to you, they're amazing, to me, they're grifters without the personality.
0DI1000272	Sinclair made sure if you spent money here, it went one direction - although that's not how he described it.
0DI1000273	Called it "self-sufficient." Like he was doing the residents a favor. Right.
0DI1000274	If it's an emergency, you can get chems for any... uh... condition. Sinclair left that for doctors and trained professionals, not the common folk.
0DI1000275	Even security and maintenance could get special supplies out of them. Staff had codes on little cards they could use to unlock them.
0DI1000276	Around. Don't have much use for them myself, not worth the risk to get them.
0DI1000277	I got all the basics covered, as long as I have the chips to pay for them. I don't need much.
0DI1000278	There's a private elevator, Sinclair's elevator. It's up in the Executive Suites, in Vera's room. Not a coincidence.
0DI1000279	Vera. She was... my other partner, before the Bomb. Took some legwork. Some convincing, made it happen.
0DI1000280	Elevator's up in the Executive Suites. Voice-activated. Speak the right phrase, in the right tone of voice, and it's open sesame.
0DI1000281	I was able to snag the voice, or thought I had. The right tone and phrasing... well, that may take some time.
0DI1000282	Yeah, the woman, the Starlet, Vera - her voice. Didn't realize there was so many holotapes of her still around, otherwise... eh, never mind.
0DI1000283	No, that I still had to figure out - still do. Sinclair wrote stuff down, was obsessive about it. Just got to find where.
0DI1000284	Go knock yourself out. I'm just going to catch my breath a bit. That performance... well, more pressure than I was expecting.
0DI1000285	Sinclair was already puppy-eyed, so all I had to do was the introductions. She smiled, fluttered her eyes, showed a little leg...
0DI1000286	...and he built this whole place for her. Made her the key to his vault, like a joke, cause of her name. Her fake Hollywood name.
0DI1000287	Except Sinclair didn't know I'd been there first. I could twist her whatever direction I wanted.
0DI1000288	All she had to do was get inside the Sierra Madre for the Gala, then use her voice to open the door. After that... smooth sailing.
0DI1000289	Would have been the biggest heist in history. Sinclair left holding the bag. Ruined.
0DI1000290	The Bomb. Vera got sealed in here. A few hundred years go by, give-or-take. Almost the end of the story - then you came along.
0DI1000291	Now we finish the job. Rob the Sierra Madre, rip out its heart. Last chapter of Frederick Sinclair, close the book.
0DI1000292	Problem? All high-and-mighty. Lording it over everyone. Acting so self-righteous, like nothing could touch him. He was the one with the problem.
0DI1000293	Never got mad at anything. Nothing seemed to shake him. Even after... his life kept getting dragged through the dirt.
0DI1000294	Always kept looking for the bright, shining future in everything. So... I decided to take everything from him.
0DI1000295	Do to me? What, weren't you listening? He thought he was better than me. Don't believe me? Look around.
0DI1000296	This big casino, this big colossal monument - think it was for some woman? No, all ego, all self-righteous-in-lights, fit him perfect.
0DI1000297	Had to take him down a few pegs, bring him down to my level. "Begin again?" Some things you don't get up from... I was going to prove it.
0DI1000298	I only saw her yesterday. Well, a few yesterdays.
0DI1000299	I didn't know at first. Then the old man showed up. You showed up. Then... that woman showed up, covered in scars.
0DI1000300	The one who makes all the hand signs, a little tight around the corners of her mouth.
0DI1000301	I put her in the Clinic, tuned her like an instrument. If she heals up, it's not going to be her voice speaking any more.
0DI1000302	That is, if the Sierra Madre didn't get her. If it did... well, there's enough of Vera around for me to spend a few years piecing a book together.
0DI1000303	Then she can make some beautiful music. I'm not banking on it.
0DI1000304	No... you're not the type, but accidents happen, good intentions or no.
0DI1000305	Really? That wasn't the "we're both bomb-married" talk you gave me when we first met.
0DI1000306	Look, you could offer me a steel clad contract for a world tour of all major cities with Imperial Records, I still wouldn't stay here.
0DI1000307	Sure, nice words, nice promises... not worth a dime out here in the shadow of the Sierra Madre.
0DI1000308	You say you wouldn't leave me here, I know better. And you leave me here, this Gala Event isn't going to happen, I can feel it.
0DI1000309	Holy Mary, Mother, and Joe - now there's a show.
0DI1000310	Not much time to get to the gates before they shut the door and turn folks away.
0DI1000311	All right, now - I'm out of here.
0DI1000312	If the Ghost People didn't know we were here before, they know now.
0DI1000313	Someone struck up the band. A band of tortured cats.
0DI1000314	What kind of casino has two Grand Openings?
0DI1000315	This is your last hurrah, Sinclair, I promise you.
0DI1000316	Just my luck.
0DI1000317	Luck's finally shining down on me.
0DI1000318	You wait, beautiful. Keep that gate open for me, Dean'll be there soon.
0DI1000319	Sierra Madre, sweetheart, Dean's coming home.
0DI1000320	We'll see who's holding the cards in the end...
0DI1000321	Didn't come all this way to get conned by some tourist.
0DI1000322	The joke's on you, "partners." You aren't getting to the prize without me.
0DI1000323	This is a fine how do you do.
0DI1000324	Should have blown up that seat cushion right when they sat down, would've been a better end than this.
0DI1000325	Just finish the last job, Dean. It's all you've wanted, just hang in there.
0DI1000326	Keep your head down, Dean, don't let the locals see you.
0DI1000327	Town's going to be filled with Ghosts when the sky lights up.
0DI1000328	Sinclair, you better appreciate all I do to screw you over.
0DI1000329	That tourist is better than most. Eh... probably won't matter.
0DI1000330	The linked collars is a new trick. Can't say I like it much.
0DI1000331	Waiting for the fireworks. Just like last time.
0DI1000332	Can't wait to see their faces when they find out what the lock is. Just gotta wait 'em out.
0DI1000333	Place is going to be swarming with the masks when the sky lights up.
0DI1000334	Don't have to take the long way back - there's a shortcut across the way, you see.
0DI1000335	It's through the Cloud - but if I'm with you, I can help you through it. If you didn't already force the lock to the gate, that is.
0DI1000336	Have a seat - came all this way, least I can do is let you rest your feet for a second.
0DI1000337	Just sit there on my little casting couch - more a chair, really, but I prefer up-and-comers to relax when I interview them.
0DI1000338	You're my guest. If you're going to be rude, you can show yourself out. Probably won't tap-dance no more when you leave, but that's on you.
0DI1000339	You standing there is making me nervous. Sit down, will you?
0DI1000340	Have a seat.
0DI1000341	Hey... guess who finally showed. You weren't on the guest list. Guess I'll need to call security, have them show you the door.
0DI1000342	You... partner, are you a sight for sore eyes. Unfriendly crowd tonight, in a lethal way - if you could calm the house down, I'd be grateful.
0DI1000343	Now, now... that's my room. You want your own dressing room, you have to work for it.
0DI1000344	What the blazes... piece of junk! You rigged that terminal, didn't you. Didn't want security showing you out, eh? We'll see.
0DI1000345	So... can't leave well enough alone, have to enter Vera's room. Some things are better left in the past, "partner."
0DI1000346	Don't do it. Leave that projector alone - I'm warning you.
0DI1000347	So... you think you have what it takes to beat me, on my stage, in my town? Come on down, we'll see.
0DI1000348	Hey, you found my old room. I mean, it's a little small... and hey, watch the hands in there, I remember where I left everything, got it?
0DI1000349	Hnh. Maybe I can shut down these ghosts using the Stage Manager's old termin... dammit! Well, so much for that idea.
0DI1000350	Hey, you're making real progress, good. Uh, look that's... Vera's room, so careful what you touch in there, be respectful.
0DI1000351	All right, now calm the audience down and let's go home. And when my part plays, no cracking jokes - that was the hairstyle back then, all right?
0DI1000352	Oh, man... nice job. Good thing I was distracting them while you flicked them off. We're a good team - I run the show while you run the box office.
0DI1000353	Hurry, would you? Get me out of this mess. Got to sue my agent for this.
0DI1000354	Get me out of here, they've got me trapped!
0DI1000355	Hold it together, Dean, you've been in worse jams. Like Madrid. Christ - Madrid.
0DI1000356	How long you think you can keep dancing around out there? Song's going to end soon, you along with it.
0DI1000357	You won't get out of here alive. Even if you reach me, you don't have the guts to fight.
0DI1000358	I'm calling the tune here - this is my theater, my show, I've waited my life to get back here. You? Not even worth the time it'd take to kill you.
0DI1000359	I am out of here... well, not to the Villa, just out of the damn theater first chance I get.
0DI1000360	Got to say this for Sinclair, he sure knew how to keep things locked down, the tight-assed prick.
0DI1000361	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure.
0DI1000362	Hnh. Theater's almost the same as it was.
0DI1000363	This place... hasn't changed at all.
0DI1000364	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did?
0DI1000365	That audience... better lay low, get a feel for the crowd.
0DI1000366	Good thing, someone walks in here, they're toast.
0DI1000367	First time on stage in a hundred years, and it has to be this?
0DI1000369	Where the hell did everyone else go?
0DI1000370	Need some help here... and that audience is not looking friendly.
0DI1000371	Hope my partner fared better than I did... better not have left me high and dry, get-even's not going to be pretty.
0DI1000372	So... what's your story, beautiful?
0DI1000373	[Christine studies Dean, frowns.]
0DI1000374	Don't... uh... don't talk much, do you?
0DI1000375	[Christine shakes her head slowly.]
0DI1000376	All right, then. I'll just wallflower it over here.
0DI1000377	Eh... those scars? What happened, somebody... something carve you up, or...?
0DI1000378	[Christine frowns, tilts her head slightly.]
0DI1000379	Damn shame, hate to think if someone put you in there. Who bailed you out again, the new guy? Interesting.
0DI1000380	Look, you obviously hear good - even if you aren't much of a talker.
0DI1000381	[Christine's eyes narrow.]
0DI1000382	Don't get me wrong, that's a plus in my book.
0DI1000383	[Christine eyes narrow to slits.]
0DI1000384	Still, are you getting any shred of your voice healed up, or...? Like anything?
0DI1000386	Where the hell did you get this one. "Dog?" What, so you don't forget your name?
0DI1000387	I don't remember you. Who are you.
0DI1000388	A little slow, huh? Uh... Dean. Dean Domino. I... live here.
0DI1000389	You look like food, smell like food. Dog - hungry.
0DI1000390	All right, pal, you stay in your corner, I'll stay in mine. Do not leave me alone with this thing.
0DI1000391	Why are you so carved up - that a bear trap on your arm?
0DI1000392	Reminds me, keeps the voice out of my head. He can't talk when the pain's howling at me.
0DI1000393	Eh... wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
0DI1000394	Dog is hungry. Tired of your voice... when do we eat?
0DI1000395	Don't like the way this guy is looking at me. You better be his leash.
0DI1000396	Stop looking at me, you idiot. I can hear your stomach growling from here, I don't like it.
0DI1000397	Run from Dog? Dog knows how to hunt. Dog will find you, tear you apart.
0DI1000398	That a bet you want to take? Cause I'll see that and raise you a few bullets to the skull.
0DI1000399	Dog's been shot before, many times. Won't stop me from catching you.
0DI1000400	I hope you've got this one under control, because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
0DI1000401	Dog, back in the cage.
0DI1000402	People missing heads... make mistake coming here. Make Dog hungry.
0DI1000403	It looks like someone was experimenting... although they were doing so after the collars went off.
0DI1000404	Really dark down here. Smell like oil and 'tronics.
0DI1000405	Dog not like this place. Air smells like burnt sparks and blood.
0DI1000406	Cafe. Food place. Maybe something in kitchen?
0DI1000407	Like it here.
0DI1000408	When Dog catch a Ghost in plastic, Dog tear him apart so they don't get back up.
0DI1000409	Smells like... flesh in plastic... lots of food around here. We should catch some.
0DI1000410	Lots of marks on walls from other dead people. They not get far.
0DI1000411	Hope the voice doesn't come back. Mean. Bad.
0DI1000412	Where is Master? Did he go away? Dog will be good this time.
0DI1000413	Swallowed something bad. Taste like burnt wires.
0DI1000414	Always yell at Dog. Yell at Dog because gets hungry, can't stop it... always need more.
0DI1000415	Insides growling.
0DI1000416	So hungry.
0DI1000417	Don't like this place. Want to go back, back to the Base. Or the Church, miss the Church.
0DI1000418	Air in here not burn chest.
0DI1000419	:: Mournful whining to self ::
0DI1000420	:: Stomach rumbling.::
0DI1000421	Knew you would come, below the cage... down to where I am. Maybe you saw the letters I scratched on the Villa walls.
0DI1000422	A little farther. Follow my voice... that's it. The one in the cage? Dog. I had to lock him up. He keeps... disobeying me.
0DI1000423	That's me, there, on the table. The disk. My voice.
0DI1000424	Can't take any chances, though... you may be some victim who simply stumbled down here. If so, can't let you let Dog out... no, not yet.
0DI1000425	If you're who I think you are, you came to fetch Dog, use him to drag others here. Now I'll use you - and that Pip-Boy you're wearing.
0DI1000426	You're smart. Clever. The key to Dog's cage is simple. Take my voice to the cage above. Let me speak to the beast inside.
0DI1000427	Then you and I... we can talk.
0DI1000428	What have we here? You weren't who I was expecting. I'm disappointed.
0DI1000429	Still... even if you aren't my intended guest, you take direction. Good. You can't have been an idiot to figure out how to release me from my cage...
0DI1000430	...or perhaps you are, with that leash on your arm and the one around your neck... with our collars and manacles, why, we may as well be kin.
0DI1000431	I'm the voice of reason. I sleep sometimes... down in the basement, in the cage. Now that I'm awake, Dog goes back in the cage.
0DI1000432	Dog knows I'm here, but can't do anything about it. I'm his... conscience. Keep him tame, keep him from hurting us... doing foolish things.
0DI1000433	The carving's a reminder, for mirrors and for Dog. Dog, who you heard coming in, howling and hungry, as always.
0DI1000434	You're good at fetching... this should keep him where he belongs. For now. I'll wait... send the signal, we'll be ready.
0DI1000435	Then nothing's going to keep me here... we need bait, or the beast is going to wake up, and you'll never see the Sierra Madre.
0DI1000436	Locked myself in. Could feel myself... letting go. Dog's howling getting louder. It happens when he's hungry and no one's around to tell him... no.
0DI1000437	I've been trapped in here for some time, then you come along and let me out. So... you opened my cage for a reason. Now... I want to know why.
0DI1000438	Of course you do. And so do I.
0DI1000439	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in. Now - what do you want?
0DI1000440	Do you see these wounds of his, covering his skin...the bear trap on his arm? He placed his own hand in it.
0DI1000441	The name he carved in his chest? To remind him of who he is, he inflicts pain on himself to silence me, when all I try to do... Hrr!
0DI1000442	...he cuts, hurts, and tries to murder me out of him. He won't succeed. Just makes me angrier.
0DI1000443	Dog is the beast, we simply change cages. Like the ones here.
0DI1000444	...hrnnn... will kill us both unless you do something. Never felt him so strong before, he won't listen to my voice. He's... he's...
0DI1000445	...hungry. Come here, or Dog will chase you, break you until you no run anymore.
0DI1000446	...hrnnn... listen to you... can't hold him back much longer... tell him... to pull on his chain, as hard as...
0DI1000447	...Dog can. What Master wants, Dog can do. Please don't be mad with Dog...
0DI1000448	...live anymore. Sick of being inside, sick of hearing his stomach screaming at me, and...
0DI1000449	...Dog is tired... Dog tired of fighting, being here... Tired of you keeping Dog caged here.
0DI1000450	...both of us are. Tell him to listen to me. Then we can get out of this... finally... and...
0DI1000451	...now Dog is listening to voice, your voice only.
0DI1000453	Nnn-nnn.
0DI1000454	Yes, Master.
0DI1000455	Very well... lead on.
0DI1000456	You already have someone in your shadow... I'll meet you at the Villa Fountain.
0DI1000457	Very well... to the Fountain and its ghost, then.
0DI1000458	Maybe Dog will obey you. I'm not as easily broken.
0DI1000459	I'm sure you do.
0DI1000460	Nooooooooooo!
0DI1000461	:: Howling, frightened. ::
0DI1000462	Let me out, let me out!
0DI1000463	Noise hurts, noise hurts!
0DI1000464	Streets are hurting my ears!
0DI1000465	Too bright, too bright.
0DI1000466	Lights and fire.
0DI1000467	Pretty.
0DI1000468	Lots of noise.
0DI1000469	Where is Master? Did Master make fires in the sky?
0DI1000470	:: Delighted clapping ::
0DI1000471	:: Weeping. ::
0DI1000472	:: Whimpering ::
0DI1000473	:: Howling in frustration ::
0DI1000474	Please let me out.
0DI1000475	Dog is sorry, sorry, sorry.
0DI1000476	What did I do?
0DI1000477	Where are lights. Dog want to see the lights.
0DI1000478	Can't wait to see the lights.
0DI1000479	:: Impatient Growl ::
0DI1000480	Hurry up, Dog doesn't like being here.
0DI1000481	Got to go... Casin-oooo.
0DI1000482	Didn't... we do this before? Can't remember.
0DI1000483	Want show and lights and yelling to start.
0DI1000484	Get away while you can, before he comes back.
0DI1000485	Makes Dog hurt self.
0DI1000486	Master, help me, Master, help me. Please.
0DI1000487	Don't let him make me hurt myself. Hurt keeps him away.
0DI1000489	I'll be good this time, I promise, Master, just keep him away.
0DI1000490	Noise makes my stomach hurt.
0DI1000491	Turn the noise off.
0DI1000492	Puts Dog in the cage, hiding downstairs.
0DI1000493	He's watching, waiting for you to try and let me go.
0DI1000495	...going to make casino burn, no more being...
0DI1000496	...back in the cage. Stop what you're doing, we can...
0DI1000497	...can hear you now. Not much longer, not...
0DI1000498	...listening to me. Tired of being your minder, tired...
0DI1000499	...of putting Dog to sleep, he wakes up in cage, hungry, Dog wants...
0DI1000500	...to protect you, always wanted to protect you, the reason I have to take control is...
0DI1000501	...Master. Master set me free, Dog needs to...
0DI1000502	...listen to me. If you do this, we both...
0DI1000503	...die. Dog wants to die. Don't care anymore, tired of you, tired of place. Master will...
0DI1000504	...help us. Please let me help us. If you don't, then you're...
0DI1000505	Something... wrong in the air.
0DI1000506	All fire now. Burn away voice, leave Dog in peace.
0DI1000507	No! Dog, get back in the c-
0DI1000508	Why pipe not break. Pipe. Break. Hnh. Leave it, not important.
0DI1000509	Pipe stay broken.
0DI1000510	Pipe needs to behave, or Dog will hurt pipe.
0DI1000511	All better. Pipe be good now, keep hissing.
0DI1000512	Are you listening? From now on, when I talk to you, pay attention.
0DI1000513	I've left markers on your Pip-Boy - find the three other collars in town - 8, 12, and 14, get them to the Fountain. Obey me, and you can all go free.
0DI1000514	Do I? For what? Your greed? Curiosity? You came here on your own, no one held a gun to your head.
0DI1000515	I've seen your Pip-Boy archives, your map markers and notes - you picked up the Sierra Madre signal just as I did, you couldn't resist.
0DI1000516	So if you feel I have a lot to answer for... no, the blame isn't on my shoulders. Might as well have put the collar on yourself.
0DI1000517	Hiding? Hardly. Trapped.
0DI1000518	You think you were the first one to unlock the casino door? No, I did it... with other hands, other bodies. After that, the casino wouldn't let go.
0DI1000519	Once I was locked in, no way out... until your Pip-Boy signal came to life in the Villa. Then... then, uh, things changed. And here you are.
0DI1000520	You speak as if your fingers have never touched the keys of a RobCo terminal. No machine is foolproof, they are designed to obey us.
0DI1000521	The Pip-Boy's operating system has vulnerabilities... advantages to those who've studied its construction, even superficially.
0DI1000522	It's just a machine, though. Its real vulnerability is who wears it. And that's how you were caught.
0DI1000523	That thing on your wrist - it's a convenience. It tells you where to go, what to do, dulls your brain.
0DI1000524	It may have helped you find the Sierra Madre broadcast, but it's just as much a crutch today as it was in the Old World.
0DI1000525	Proud that you have one? I can hear the superiority.
0DI1000526	Can't believe the idiot swallowed his collar.
0DI1000527	What's taking that human so long.
0DI1000528	If that human wasn't wearing a collar...
0DI1000529	Wonder what that human's insides would look like laid out over the fountain.
0DI1000530	Might be able to rip the Pip-Boy off his arm without killing him. Hmm.
0DI1000531	No toxins in the air in here.
0DI1000532	Well, this place has seen better days.
0DI1000533	If we need to fight, you should call Dog out... as much as I hate to admit it.
0DI1000534	Might be able to use the gas valves around here to set traps of our own.
0DI1000535	We'll need to move faster than this if we're going to outwit the Old Man.
0DI1000536	Happy you followed the Sierra Madre broadcast? Curiosity and greed, same thing.
0DI1000537	It's your own fault you're here. Couldn't leave well enough alone.
0DI1000538	That Pip-Boy... maybe I'll tear it off your arm, wear it on my neck.
0DI1000539	Air tastes like copper. Or Old World gold.
0DI1000540	Almost got away... then the idiot's hunger screws it up.
0DI1000541	Why do you keep looking at your Pip-Boy? It won't help. Didn't help the Old Man.
0DI1000543	The human did it. Good.
0DI1000544	Not going down like last time - Dog, you're staying in the cage.
0DI1000545	Time to get to the gate, "friends" or no friends.
0DI1000546	Fires and speakers are going to bring the Ghost People out in full.
0DI1000547	Coming for you, human... you just wait.
0DI1000548	Madre's mine.
0DI1000549	Hnh. The human pulled it off.
0DI1000550	Just like last time. Come on, Dog, you know the drill.
0DI1000551	Gate won't be open for long.
0DI1000552	Need to stay out of sight... can't afford to be distracted now.
0DI1000553	What the Old World saw in these light shows is beyond me.
0DI1000554	When this festival fires, I'm the first one in the door.
0DI1000555	Last time I ever deal with human trash...
0DI1000556	After the Bomb, still slaves to technology, events, Pip-Boys, collars... hnnnr.
0DI1000557	I'll whip you for this, Dog. I'll crush your cage with you inside it for making me go through this.
0DI1000558	All this - if I get inside the Sierra Madre, it's all worth it. All of it.
0DI1000559	As soon as those collars go off... we'll settle things, yes.
0DI1000560	Hurry, we're targets out here.
0DI1000561	Almost inside. Finally. Then I can get rid of the baggage.
0DI1000562	Quiet, Dog, stay in the cage.
0DI1000563	Sick of these Old World deathtraps.
0DI1000564	The Sierra Madre's almost mine.
0DI1000565	They better not try and leave me here...
0DI1000566	What's this? Why... it's a little doll. Were you carved by a craftsman, or mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
0DI1000567	[Christine narrows her eyes, gets into a combat stance.]
0DI1000568	I'm not going to hurt you... yet. Much. Scars tell a story, some old, some new... and the one on the throat is fresh and red.
0DI1000569	Someone wanted to cut your voice, little doll. Or they didn't finish their work, or didn't know how to.
0DI1000570	[Christine frowns.]
0DI1000571	Oh, it wasn't me... I have no use for your neck beyond what encircles it. The lack of screams when I finally kill you... that is what I'll regret.
0DI1000572	Touched by radiation, and you choose to spend your time here. You could have just left... but you're too obsessed to let go.
0DI1000573	I used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you. At least he had the sense to know his own name, without carving it into his chest.
0DI1000574	Mirrors tell me my name when needed... and I have a name for you, several. Thief, coward... showman. Radiation couldn't kill the truth, could it.
0DI1000575	The truth, buddy, is this: you and me, we're now family as long as we got these bowties on. So watch your mouth, you don't scare me.
0DI1000576	You could have left the Sierra Madre. Left this Villa, joined your own kind.
0DI1000577	Sierra Madre's mine, my heart's right where it belongs.
0DI1000578	You can't abide it. There's no heart. You hate it, I can hear it in your words.
0DI1000579	Sounds like you need your hearing checked. Sierra Madre, it's meant for me.
0DI1000580	It's letting go.
0DI1000581	You've heard of the Sierra Madre Casino.
0DI1000582	We all have, the legend, the curses.
0DI1000583	Foolishness about it lying in the middle of the City of the Dead, buried beneath a blood-red cloud.
0DI1000584	A bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
0DI1000585	It was built before the War, a tower of gold and lights, where fortunes could be gained and lost...
0DI1000586	... a monument to wealth.
0DI1000590	Don't... eh... don't talk much, do you?
0DI1000595	What's this little doll? Were you carved by a craftsman, little doll, or were you mauled by a drunk who didn't know his tools?
0DI1000598	[STATIC]
0DI1000613	Wait, so you're not just slow, you're screwy, too? Some crew we are... we are never getting into the Sierra Madre.
0DI1000627	Hope you've got this one under control because he's giving me a nasty itch on my trigger finger.
0DI1000636	That tourist is better than most. Probably won't matter.
0DI1000656	Wonder what happened to the suckers. Might have gotten taken away, like I did? Hnh.
0DI1000666	Used to know a ventriloquist with more skill than you, at least he had the sense to know his own name without carving it into his chest.
0DI1000745	I... he's asleep. Finally. Shhhhhh.
0DI1000746	Dog... all I wanted was for you to listen to me, let me care for you. Keep you from hurting yourself...
0DI1000747	Now I can. And one day, when you're ready, I'll let you out. When you're calm, and we... understand each other.
0DI1000748	And we're at peace, you and I, mind and instinct. Then the world will be ready for us.
0DI1000749	Hello? Voice? You there? It's Dog......Dog can hear himself. Voice is... is in cage? Locked.
0DI1000750	Now Dog speak. Now Dog not afraid. And... hungry. More hungry.
0DI1000751	Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
0DI1000752	What is this place?
0DI1000753	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest.
0DI1000754	"God." No... not God. Something in reverse... hnh. Was that one of them...?
0DI1000755	Should rest, get my strength back... then explore this place, see what it holds.
0DI1000781	Still can't figure out why I lost the signals...
0DI1000782	There's no reason why it could have gone wrong, had it all planned out... maybe it was the curse of the Sierra Madre.
0DI1000783	Damn Cloud still in my lungs, rattling around.
0DI1000784	Dammit, get back here.
0DI1000785	Good thing I installed radios in the collars, Pip-Boy's letting me pick them up.
0DI1000786	What the hell is 21 doing now... hnh.
0DI1000787	Fool better not decide to sleep. Vitals go down, I'll get someone else to do this job.
0DI1000788	Unnn... sitting too long. Damn arthritis.
0DI1000789	Come too far to go back now. Too far.
0DI1000790	Hnh. Going to wipe the slate clean. Kimball, the Republic... Hardin, McNamara, my "brothers." Then I'll head back West.
0DI1000791	Better loop some instructions in case something happens.
0DI1000792	Going to get inside this place if it's the last thing I do.
0DI1000793	Running out of volunteers. Last ones couldn't see beyond their own greed.
0DI1000794	If only people would do what I say, wouldn't need these damn collars to keep them in line. Keep going for each other's throats like dogs.
0DI1000795	Wish I... still had that damn Holorifle. Spent forever making it... need to find it when this is all done.
0DI1000797	The Gala Event... finally. Probably wake up half the things in town.
0DI1000798	Power's fluctuating in here... getting some systems waking up, good, good.
0DI1000799	Now all they have to do is just get here. Tired of waiting.
0DI1000800	Hurry... hurry... you just need to get inside, I'll handle the rest. Come on, you fools.
0DI1000801	Not far now... soon, the Sierra Madre's mine. Doors won't hold open forever... just like the last time. Come on.
0DI1000802	All right, now everything's coming together...
0DI1000803	Just need to keep their gears turning a little while longer...
0DI1000804	Can't believe this old Pip-Boy saved me. Even if it led me to that damn signal in the first place.
0DI1000805	Good thing the new recruit had a Pip-Boy, too, probably stole it from a Vault 21 dweller. Still, a thief's just what I need for this.
0DI1000806	If only the others would've obeyed orders half as well as this one... should have thought of linking the collars together the first few times.
0DI1000807	Good thing I can still hook into the Villa speakers by remote...
0DI1000808	Damn Hologram tech. Worthless as security... better as weapons.
0DI1000809	What the hell are they doing out there. Hurry up, you idiots, I don't have a few more years to waste.
0DI1000810	Outwitted by doors. Hermetically sealed doors don't protect anyone, all they do is seal us in.
0DI1000811	Why the owner tied all of this to the Gala Event, insanity... backwards thinking, having a festival be your key. No wonder the bombs fell.
0DI1000812	Can you hear me? Signal should be stronger in here. I'll set this on loop... just in case I need to step away for a moment.
0DI1000813	When the bombs hit, this casino sealed up like an Emperor's tomb. If you don't know what that means, never mind, it means we're trapped.
0DI1000814	So - get the power running to the main floor. That'll open the elevators and unlock the doors.
0DI1000815	The ones that didn't strip their gears when they locked into place, Old World junk. Shoddy workmanship.
0DI1000816	Once the power's on, then I'll tell you your next steps. Just get this part done, and then listen.
0DI1000817	If you're wondering where your crew is, well... the casino saw them as guests. Which means they all got assigned to their floor. Just like mine.
0DI1000818	Don't worry about them, they're of no use if you can't get the power running.
0DI1000819	All I need is you for the rest of this. Which means we just need to deal with them, one by one, and then the Vault's... ours.
0DI1000820	Ha! You got the power on, excellent. You were quite a find, glad my trap in the desert caught you before time ran out.
0DI1000821	And also glad you didn't come across this place first, might have plundered it first... can't have that. Like at HELIOS. And Hoover Dam.
0DI1000822	All right, setting this on repeat in case you're some idiot-savant braincase and need the reminder...
0DI1000823	So, my greedy friend, we've got some unfinished business. I'm not one to share, and there's loose ends we need to wrap up first.
0DI1000824	The rest of your team is on different floors. They got assigned there, ushered there based on the casino's records as to the best "fit."
0DI1000825	Don't ask me how, Pre-War casino security and escort systems aren't my specialty.
0DI1000826	Go to each floor, and kill them. I don't need them anymore... well, now that you're here.
0DI1000827	We don't need anyone... except each other. Together, we'll crack the Sierra Madre, and we can both leave this place behind.
0DI1000828	Now... if anything about our little heist went smoothly, you'd go to the Vault... except it's locked by some code I'm not familiar with.
0DI1000829	The door to the casino vault is hidden in the Executive Suites, without the means to unlock it, it's useless.
0DI1000830	Find a way to open it, bypass the code, then we'll talk.
0DI1000831	You did it... a voice lock. Why would he have done that? Uh! Never mind.
0DI1000832	Now I just need you to go below, look around. See if there's any other surprises down there.
0DI1000833	I'll be along once you've found the Vault. No need risking myself just yet.
0DI1000834	End of line.
0DI1000835	I... we... hope you've enjoyed your stay.
0DI1000836	Farewells can be a time of sadness. Letting go... difficult. As a guest of the Sierra Madre, you know that truth more than anyone.
0DI1000837	Frederick Sinclair believed one's life could be made anew every day, that fortunes were more than the wealth in your hands.
0DI1000838	Love. Life... family, those to care for, and those who will care for you.
0DI1000839	To those who know these joys, the Sierra Madre holds little they don't already have.
0DI1000840	Out in the world, beyond these walls, that is your chance to begin again.
0DI1000841	I hope you'll return, in happier times. Until then, the Sierra Madre... and I... will hold you in our hearts.
0DI1000842	Guests, and residents of the Villa alike, I ask you to step outside and look to the night sky.
0DI1000843	It's the moment you've been waiting for, the reason we're all here - the Gala Event, the Grand Opening of the Sierra Madre Casino.
0DI1000844	You are the ones who have made this momentous occasion possible, and for that, we thank you.
0DI1000845	So raise your glass in celebration - let music fill the streets, fireworks light the sky, and promise of new beginnings fill your hearts.
0DI1000846	No matter what your fortunes, no matter what your cares, let go this night, and begin again.
0DI1000847	I suggest you hurry, though - the gates of the Sierra Madre are open, but only for a brief time.
0DI1000848	After that, the doors will close for the evening's festivities, and won't open again until morning.
0DI1000849	Let's head through the hole in the wall there - if we go backstage, we avoid the locals.
0DI1000850	[The Hologram makes a gesture, seems to be indicating amounts and figures.]
0DI1000851	[The Hologram points at the table before you. As you set the chips down, the tabletop rotates, and with a whir, Pre-War bills slide out.]
0DI1000852	[The Hologram nods, gives a stiff farewell wave.]
0DI1000853	[You place the bill on the counter. A panel rotates, and the bill is replaced with a single Sierra Madre Chip.]
0DI1000854	[You set the bills on the counter. A panel flips, there is a single whir, a click, then a panel rises up with a handful of Sierra Madre Chips.]
0DI1000855	[You count out the bills on the counter. A panel flips, followed by slow, steady series of clicks, and a stack of chips rise up from the panel.]
0DI1000856	[The Hologram waits.]
0DI1000857	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and nods. She opens her mouth slightly, then closes it, frustrated.]
0DI1000858	[She points at you, then makes a fist and puts it against her chest and nods.]
0DI1000859	[Christine smiles slightly in relief, and moves to the elevator.]
0DI1000860	What did you just do... can't access the protocols. Didn't even think Elijah could break Madre security... hnh. Must be a Scribe, too.
0DI1000861	Security's down...? Hnh. Doesn't matter, won't help you.
0DI1000862	If it's who I think it is, this is Christine... recovered. In what looks like an Old World hotel room, high class, two rooms - exit's sealed.
0DI1000863	Floor's got holographic security. Not latest tech, field of view targeting systems, primitive. Familiar.
0DI1000864	Floor looks like it protected the guests too well. Checked the Suite, found the holographic woman from the Villa Fountain.
0DI1000865	Picking up that interference frequency, same as the Villa, floor's live with speakers and radios. Keep an ear out, watch the walls.
0DI1000866	Doors on this floor are all operated manually in an emergency, place is locked up tight. Must be keycards around somewhere.
0DI1000867	Looks like security systems did more to kill the people here than the Bomb did. Hope there's a way out of this casino.
0DI1000868	What's with my collar... Elijah? Or... no, it's you. Even better. This is Christine, voice back. You got off on the wrong floor, you're trapped.
0DI1000869	Hope you can make it past security. I've been looking forward to taking care of you since the Gala Event.
0DI1000870	You and Elijah were working together this whole time. Should've known, just from your actions, you have his... outlook on things.
0DI1000871	Hope you aren't dead yet... although I'm sure my collar would let me know. I could just detonate it now, but saving it for someone special.
0DI1000872	Time is against you. It always was.
0DI1000873	Struggle all you want... the Sierra Madre will be your grave.
0DI1000874	I'm not without weapons of my own... let me show you.
0DI1000875	You came all this way... but you lost as soon as you arrived here.
0DI1000876	Think you've won? You've won nothing.
0DI1000877	You think you've outsmarted me? You can't get away. You're the one on a leash, you always were.
0DI1000878	Pre-War tech... so easy to control, just like your Pip-Boy. Turrets, Holograms, they're all just toys.
0DI1000879	Don't have time for this.
0DI1000880	Aaah... Pre-War junk. I'll put you down myself.
0DI1000881	Eh? What's this.
0DI1000882	Alarms... what... you. Think you can run, think you can trick me?
0DI1000883	This entire structure is mine to command. Security... weapons... all this technology - mine. Now - you die.
0DI1000884	You think you've escaped... no. No, you were never out of reach... my hand was always around your neck.
0DI1000885	Staying in the Vault? Think it'll protect you? No... I don't think so.
0DI1000886	I'll have the Sierra Madre kill you for me. You can't beat all the casino's defenses... it's only a matter of time now.
0DI1000887	Did you really think you could steal from me? The Sierra Madre is mine.
0DI1000888	Christine, scarred by her hunt for Elijah and unable to let him go, perished in the Sierra Madre Casino.
0DI1000889	She never completed her mission, nor did she stop to consider what had driven her to accept the mission in the first place.
0DI1000890	Obsession is another form of greed, a lesson that Christine never learned.
0DI1000891	Christine, her mission complete, found new purpose as the Sierra Madre's warden. She watched over it silently - by choice.
0DI1000892	Over time, the Ghost People came to see her as one of the Holograms. They would watch, silently, as she walked among them.
0DI1000893	At times, Christine thought of the Courier, who had kept Elijah's hand from her throat.
0DI1000894	The Courier reminded her of the other courier she had met in the Big Empty, and wondered if the two had found each other at last.
0DI1000895	She did not think of them again until she heard the legends of the Divide.
0DI1000896	The Divide, where the two messengers, the two couriers, fought beneath an ancient flag, at the edge of the world.
0DI1000897	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... had his last show on the Sierra Madre stage.
0DI1000898	The heist he spent over two hundred years planning fell apart, just as the first, by underestimating his partner's strength.
0DI1000899	Not long after the Courier left the Villa, the lights in the theater shut off, one by one.
0DI1000900	Only Dean's Hologram remained on stage, singing silently to an empty room.
0DI1000901	Still... as consumed as he had been with its riches and ruin, the Sierra Madre had held him captive long ago.
0DI1000902	Dean Domino, entertainer, singer... thief... explored the Sierra Madre not long after he was rescued by the Courier.
0DI1000903	Once he left the theater, the Sierra Madre recognized him as a guest, and many doors opened to him. He had to admit, it had been built to last.
0DI1000904	During his search, he came across the final records of Vera and Sinclair, and realized what happened the night the bombs fell.
0DI1000905	He felt strangely sad for a moment, and he had no idea why.
0DI1000906	Shrugging it off, his mind turned instead to where the Courier had come from. Vegas still survived, out there in the Mojave.
0DI1000907	Its sights, sounds... and casinos, ripe for the taking.
0DI1000908	So giving the Sierra Madre one last nod and a wink, he set off beyond the Cloud to begin again.
0DI1000909	When Dog fell in the Sierra Madre casino, two died as one.
0DI1000910	Dog died hungry, alone, frightened.
0DI1000911	The voice in his head died with him. Screaming. Furious. Enraged.
0DI1000912	But the voice was gone, and Dog was grateful.
0DI1000913	At least Dog was dead and the voice needed to watch over him no more.
0DI1000914	In the moment before their lives ended, the wall between the two personalities fell. The two became silent as they saw the chain between them.
0DI1000915	Hunger and control are twin greeds, something Dog and his shadow had never realized.
0DI1000916	Dog forgot himself, as did the voice that raged within him. After their passing, a new voice spoke within the mutant's shell.
0DI1000917	It was difficult for the voice to remember the two it once was... there was the beast, Dog consumed by hunger...
0DI1000918	...and the other in reverse... the one consumed by control.
0DI1000919	Both were driven by need for the other. The Courier brought them together, somehow, joined the two into one.
0DI1000920	All that happened at the Sierra Madre, was a faint memory to the new personality... like a flickering light in the clouds of the mind.
0DI1000921	The new voice did not think of the Courier again until the battle at the Divide reached his ears.
0DI1000922	The battle between the two couriers, beneath the torn skies and the Old World flag... each bearing a message for the other.
0DI1000923	And the mutant prayed the Courier that had saved him... had been saved in return.
0DI1000924	Dog, free of the voice inside his head and no longer waiting on the voice of the Master, wandered back West.
0DI1000925	His hunger never ended. Often, small communities would suddenly vanish.
0DI1000926	They were assumed to have been hit by Wasteland creatures and dragged away... dogs, Brahmin, and humans alike.
0DI1000927	Freed of both Dog and the one who held Dog's leash, the other voice resumed control. First the mind, then finally, the mutant's shell.
0DI1000928	His first act was to tend to the scars on the body with careful hands, slowly healing all the scars except the ragged name torn on his chest.
0DI1000929	He briefly thought of remaining at the Sierra Madre. But it was a monument built by humans, representing something he no longer needed.
0DI1000930	He began walking west, in search of others like him. As he did, he spoke of the courier who had set him free and allowed his life to begin again.
0DI1000931	Wasn't sure until now I could trust you. Now I know.
0DI1000932	Look, when I woke up here... however that happened... I had this key on me - I think it belongs to her.
0DI1000933	Haven't had a chance to use it yet - might open the dresser, or the safe - didn't have time to experiment with it before you arrived. Here you go.
0DI1000935	Silence suits me fine. When your master shows, I'll deal with him, too.
0DI1000936	I've been hunting the one who hijacked your Pip-Boy, Elijah, for... some time.
0DI1000937	He cannot leave the Sierra Madre alive. What he's done... what he's done here is nothing compared to what he's done in the past.
0DI1000938	The only way to bring him out is if you get to the vault... he won't allow you to go down there alone. That's when we kill him.
0DI1000939	Good luck. He's... not an easy opponent. If I can, I'll help. Might be able to figure something out using the Sierra Madre's computer systems.
0DI1000940	[Christine nods, and steps slightly behind you, waiting.]
0DI1000944	Good. I was growing... impatient.
0DI1000945	Rhhhr. Dog will follow.
0DI1000946	[Christine sniffs the air, then touches her neck and frowns. She gestures at the air and taps her wrist.]
0DI1000947	[Christine looks around, then nods toward a terminal on the far side of the room.]
0DI1000948	[Christine points to an electrical box on the wall, and twists her hand.]
0DI1000949	[Christine shakes her head as you approach the edge of the catwalk. She turns away from the catwalk and begins looking around.]
0DI1000950	[Christine nods at the toxic cloud below, then makes a walking motion with her fingers and slowly shakes her head.]
0DI1000951	[Christine's eyes narrow. She raises an index finger, as if listening, then points ahead grimly and pulls back an imaginary trigger.]
0DI1000952	[Christine nods at you, then the Ghost Person on the ground, makes a neck-chopping motion.]
0DI1000953	[She circles her finger around the Fountain and moves her fingers and thumb together rapidly, as if talking.]
0DI1000954	[She frowns, stops moving her hand, then points at the Pip-Boy at your wrist.]
0DI1000955	Surprised that Super Mutant didn't eat you... and don't get me started on Dean.
0DI1000956	So... I just rasp out some words, and the vault opens? That woman, the starlet... she didn't build this place, why would the builder do that?
0DI1000957	I know. The sealed doors, the security... it's almost a fortress. Think that's why we're being ordered to come here and crack it open?
0DI1000958	Yeah, still functional. Lot of garbage data on it, its basic procedures should still work fine.
0DI1000959	Looks like you got almost everything, not much more I can extract... "doctor."
0DI1000960	I can see... check the root, recent diagnostics...
0DI1000961	Lot of Med-X was dispensed for... Vera Keyes. Guess that's her corpse there for certain... and why all those meds are scattered around in here.
0DI1000962	...here's the medical report. Looks like she had some sort of terminal condition... diagnosis isn't conclusive, must have been painful.
0DI1000963	I'm not even sure she knew, if these medical reports are enough. She must have been numb most of the time.
0DI1000964	All right. Just glad I can answer you now.
0DI1000965	No... they run a lot deeper than that.
0DI1000966	While I was hunting Elijah in the Big Empty, he trapped me in one of those medical research centers buried there.
0DI1000967	It... did something to my head... and I got off lucky. It's difficult enough to read now, and somehow the leap between what's in my head and words...
0DI1000968	...it just ends up being a mish-mash of symbols, not letters. Can still do math, formulas, equations... writing poetry's out.
0DI1000969	Yeah... I saw records of other "patients," and what had been done to them. Some couldn't hear anything but static. Others, just... gibbering wrecks.
0DI1000970	Never going back... and Elijah was on his way here, so I couldn't stop to see if it was something I could fix...
0DI1000971	...if you can even fix what happened to me when they jabbed the electrodes into my skull and turned my head into a flashlight.
0DI1000972	Then I got here, and my voice got severed... now I have a new one. Another thing Elijah has to answer for.
0DI1000973	Dean? Dean Domino?
0DI1000974	Why would he want to torture me? If he wanted to do that, he could keep his singing career going... or keep staring at me.
0DI1000975	What? Open something... my voice. That's why it's hers... someone wanted to use me as a key.
0DI1000976	All right, I can do that... hope you're ready.
0DI1000977	To the vault... of course. That makes sense.
0DI1000978	An audio-lock to where? To the Sierra Madre vault. It's voice-activated. And he wanted in.
0DI1000979	That makes sense. So... those bodies in the Clinic... all right. Dean always felt like the odd one out, and he kept... studying me.
0DI1000980	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, and raises her hands, palms facing each other, then rotates in a 180 degree arc and back again.]
0DI1000981	[FAILED] [She rolls her eyes, opens her mouth to speak, then stops, her face tensing up in frustration.]
0DI1000982	The Gala went off, the Switching Station opened up - thought the screeching in the Auto-Doc was bad, Station worse.
0DI1000983	Got outside, saw the light show, and it was enough to make me run to the casino.
0DI1000984	Also... it seemed like the lights and speakers were helping to guide me... guess your master wanted a back-up in case you died.
0DI1000985	As for being assigned to this floor... maybe it's because of my new voice. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe it recognized me as a guest.
0DI1000986	It's possible. This place is immense... and it still has power, food dispensers, security... was it all for Pre-War guests? Or for her?
0DI1000987	All right. If you go down there, are you prepared... what if you don't come back?
0DI1000988	I... just wanted to make sure you're ready. When you go down there, that may be it for us... we won't be needed anymore.
0DI1000989	The one who made these collars, he'll follow you down there. And he won't let you leave. He's not one for sharing, never was.
0DI1000990	[She taps the collar and then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
0DI1000991	[She taps her collar, then opens and closes her hand really fast.]
0DI1000992	[She points at your Pip-Boy, her collar, and then your collar. After a second, then she opens and closes her hand slower.]
0DI1000993	[She points at your collar, then hers, then nods at your Pip-Boy. She makes a triangle motion, then the same slow pulse as before with her fingers.]
0DI1000994	Love makes people do strange things. Won't argue that. It can drive you crazy sometimes if you can't... connect.
0DI1000995	If they loved each other, and they were together... I suppose that's all that mattered.
0DI1000996	But she's in that side room, dead, because the casino wouldn't let her leave. And who knows where he is.
0DI1000997	You did? Looks like even the Old World can't keep you out when you've got a mind to get in.
0DI1000998	Fine. I hear my collar beeping though, I've got the route to the exit all mapped out.
0DI1000999	[She nods... then gestures at your hand, offers hers.]
0DI1001000	[She holds it, meeting your eyes intently for a few moments. She gives your hand a gentle squeeze, then releases it and smiles slightly.]
0DI1001001	[She frowns, then waves you away and focuses on the terminal.]
0DI1001002	[She narrows her eyes, determined, and gives a last nod.]
0DI1001003	[She tries to open her mouth and nothing comes out. Her eyes narrow and her hands ball into fists.]
0DI1001004	[She touches her collar, then shakes her head in frustration and nods at you to go ahead.]
0DI1001005	[Christine tilts her head slightly, glances at your collar, then your Pip-Boy. She opens her mouth, frowns, then closes it.]
0DI1001006	[Her face looks sad, and she taps her chest once, slowly. She nods at you, then the exit.]
0DI1001007	[Christine takes a step back from your gaze... her eyes widen in alarm, she takes one step, then two toward the elevator.]
0DI1001008	[Christine studies the elevator frame, raises her hands... then sets them down... then raises them up again.]
0DI1001009	[She gives a silent sigh of exasperation, and frowns at the elevator, and her hand brushes the side of her face, tracing the scar.]
0DI1001010	[She turns to you, relieved, and nods... then she turns away, and her face crumbles. She makes motions with her fingers, then clenches her fists.]
0DI1001011	[Her face becomes angry. She points at the elevator, points downward, then wraps her arms around her and shakes her head.]
0DI1001012	"Begin again, but know when to let go." Let's see what happens.
0DI1001013	I... can't let him leave here. Look, you've done so much, and he's not going to show himself until you go down there.
0DI1001014	[SUCCEEDED] I...
0DI1001015	[FAILED] No... no, you have it wrong. Look, it's now or never, all right? Let me open the elevator.
0DI1001016	I can't let go. Every time I've thought about it...
0DI1001017	I've lost him so many times. He needs to die... what happened here, with us? He's... he's done so much worse.
0DI1001018	I know. And he will kill me, I can't get the collar off. Even if I could, I need to be sure - see his eyes, his face, when he dies.
0DI1001019	You have to promise me. Promise me you'll deal with him... if I see him, I...
0DI1001020	I can't. It's my mission, has been. This has to be done.
0DI1001021	I... I didn't want this to happen. Ending him is more important than saving you. For what it's worth... I'm sorry.
0DI1001022	All right. All right, I'll... but I'll need to leave this floor. He'll pick up my collar, and...
0DI1001023	I... never mind. Let me get the vault open... "Begin again... but know when to let go." Sounds like you.
0DI1001024	[She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
0DI1001025	[FAILED] [She frowns, shakes her head.]
0DI1001026	[SUCCEEDED] [She is about to nod - then stops, points at herself, and shakes head.]
0DI1001028	[She frowns, slowly shakes her head - she opens her mouth, then makes the motion of tuning a dial, then points at herself.]
0DI1001029	[She nods, and motions for you to go ahead.]
0DI1001030	[She nods, once, then again, points at the two of you, then the Pip-Boy.]
0DI1001033	[She looks puzzled for a second, then glares at you and motions you to move on.]
0DI1001034	[Christine holds out her hand, and motions at your Pip-Boy.]
0DI1001035	[Christine studies the Pip-Boy intently, turning your arm around as if your wrist's a sensor module she just found.]
0DI1001036	[She doesn't seem interested in the screen - she studies the exterior, then the casing. She seems to be making sure it's intact.]
0DI1001037	[She frowns, and snaps her fingers at your Pip-Boy.]
0DI1001038	[Christine snarls, makes a dismissive wave, and goes back to studying the Fountain intently - then looks at the casino, then the Fountain again.]
0DI1001039	[Her finger stabs through the red buttons, narrowing in on the local map. She scrolls to the Sierra Madre's main gate, frowns, backs out.]
0DI1001040	[She calls up the local map of the Puesta del Sol Switching Station, zooms in. Her intent expression loses some of its edge as she notes the marker.]
0DI1001041	[She looks up at you, points at marker on your Pip-Boy, points West and tilts her head.]
0DI1001042	[She points at the Fountain, then at your Pip-Boy... pauses, then points at her collar, then yours.]
0DI1001043	[She encircles her throat with her hand, then slowly releases it. Then she motions again to the West.]
0DI1001044	[SUCCEEDED] [She slowly nods, looks impressed.]
0DI1001045	[FAILED] [She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
0DI1001046	[She sighs silently, then shakes her head and motions to the West.]
0DI1001047	[She nods, then waits.]
0DI1001048	[She surveys the area, focusing upwards. She glances at the casino, frowns. She then looks West, then East.]
0DI1001049	[She glares at you. After a second, she pauses, and smiles slightly, shaking her head. She then makes a circle of the skyline with her finger.]
0DI1001050	[She examines the chip for a second, raises it to her eye, then turns it to the side, gauging its diameter and width.]
0DI1001051	[She runs her finger over the surface slowly, checking the engraving. She then tosses the chip back to you.]
0DI1001052	[She then pretends to look around, sees something on the floor, then pretends to bend down and pick it up. She then looks at you and nods.]
0DI1001053	[She frowns, shakes her head.]
0DI1001055	[SUCCEEDED] [She smiles, nods.]
0DI1001056	[FAILED] [She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
0DI1001057	[She frowns, looks frustrated for a moment, thinking.]
0DI1001058	[She stands still for a second, then stops, and slowly makes the motion of bending down and scooping something up.]
0DI1001059	[Then she holds the imaginary object in her hand, as if heavy, and puts it in front of her, as if on a table.]
0DI1001060	[She then hefts what looks like a small box, and pours it on top of the object, looks at it, then reaches down and holds up a small "O."]
0DI1001061	[Christine points at your pack, then points at the Fission Battery and the Scrap Metal.]
0DI1001063	[She points at your Pip-Boy, makes a motion of opening it up and removing something from it.]
0DI1001064	[She then raises her hand and makes the motion of smashing it and holding up the remains.]
0DI1001065	[FAILED] [She frowns, then thinks for a moment. She then points at your pack, and taps the back of her wrist.]
0DI1001066	Thought you'd leave me in that elevator? I haven't forgotten what you did in the Switching Station, not for a second.
0DI1001067	Trapped down in that room in the dark, listening to that sound, like saw blades. I could barely breathe... couldn't even scream!
0DI1001068	Was like being operated on in that Auto-Doc in the Clinic... all over again.
0DI1001069	Come to throw me in the Auto-Doc? Toss me back in the Clinic where you found me?
0DI1001070	Did you know the Stimpak reservoirs ran out within an hour of being in there? I was in there for two weeks, and it kept... repeating the procedure.
0DI1001071	No Med-X, no stims, just... that sound, feeling the scalpels... cut. Now... we're going to see how you like it when someone else is in control.
0DI1001072	I can switch the proximity of the detonation frequency. Try and run? I'll have the signal seek you out, blow up your collar from a distance.
0DI1001073	Come in close, maybe get the upper hand? I'll set off the proximity detonator, and your collar'll blow.
0DI1001074	[She points at the casino, makes a movement with her hands as if talking, and then repeats the squinting gesture.]
0DI1001075	[Christine waits, studying you.]
0DI1001076	[She nods, impressed. Then she points at you, then her and makes a circle.]
0DI1001077	[She nods. She then makes a series of hand motions to represent weight and amounts - enough so you think you could do it on your own.]
0DI1001078	When we first met, I thought I recognized the collar technology. Just needed some time to experiment with it.
0DI1001079	I noticed the signal lag as soon as you arrived on the floor. Collar detonator signal's down to a dull thud, more like a heartbeat than a screech.
0DI1001080	You think you can kill me, then make a run for the exit before my dead man's signal catches you and blows that collar. Not gonna be that easy.
0DI1001081	The Suites here gave me enough tools and enough time that our frequencies... I can push and pull that collar of yours however I want.
0DI1001083	[SUCCEEDED] I did. And it means I can control your movements.
0DI1001084	[FAILED] You'll find out.
0DI1001085	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, it helps... as long as I need to control your movements.
0DI1001086	[FAILED] Free? I have more freedom of movement than you do, and that's all I need.
0DI1001087	You'll find out.
0DI1001088	Try and run, it won't matter, the signal will find you. Get too close to me, then the signal'll lock on. You can't get away.
0DI1001089	We'll see. I don't think you're gonna have the time.
0DI1001090	You, Elijah... it doesn't matter. Both of you have run out of places to hide.
0DI1001091	[SUCCEEDED] No, I believe you. All along, you were watching out for yourself. I understand.
0DI1001092	But I wonder what you would have done if there hadn't been these collars. Would you have gotten me out of the Clinic at all?
0DI1001093	So as long as we're "in this together," and it's a choice between you and me? I know what you're going to choose.
0DI1001094	I'm not gonna wait for that to happen - again. I'm tired of being controlled.
0DI1001095	[FAILED] I believe you. And that's not the point. That collar... I believe you got caught by Elijah, too. I don't think it changes who you are.
0DI1001096	How you behaved in the Villa... all that was you. And as bad as these collars are, maybe it kept you from being worse.
0DI1001097	And that's the worst part about all this. That it takes something like that to keep you from hurting someone else.
0DI1001098	Dean? He put me in there? No, I don't believe it. He didn't have any reason to torture me. You, on the other hand...
0DI1001101	He was trying to figure out if I recognized him... and see if my throat healed. I'll deal with you first, then I'll deal with him.
0DI1001102	[She pauses, then draws a jagged symbol like electricity in the air, then puts on an odd, staring face.]
0DI1001103	[She keeps the blank face for a second, then slowly blinks, looks around. She looks at her hands, shakes them, then lets them go limp.]
0DI1001104	[She shakes her head... then stops, as if thinking.]
0DI1001105	[SUCCEEDED] [She nods, slowly, and then makes the motion of typing and drawing X's and lines in the air, and then gives a thumbs up.]
0DI1001106	[FAILED] [She looks distant... then slowly shakes her head.]
0DI1001107	[She nods, smiles.]
0DI1001108	[She nods.]
0DI1001109	[She nods. She raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
0DI1001110	[Christine looks at you, frowns. Then glances at the casino, her eyes narrowed. She stops breathing for a second, as if holding it in.]
0DI1001111	[She ignores you for a second, still staring at the casino. Then she glances at you, and her face and stance relax slightly.]
0DI1001112	[She points at her collar, then the casino with an irritated look. She then folds her arms and raises an eyebrow.]
0DI1001113	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks like she's about to shake her head, stops, and then puts her hand over her eyes and squints, as if staring in the distance.]
0DI1001114	[FAILED] [She glares at you a moment, then slowly shakes her head.]
0DI1001117	I've... done worse. Much worse... and for more hopeless causes, and I will again.
0DI1001119	[She wrinkles her face, frowns, and looks angry. She touches her throat, traces the scar with her finger, then points the finger at the casino.]
0DI1001120	[She then points at your collars, points at the casino. Then she matches your gaze with a dark expression, then draws a slow line across her throat.]
0DI1001121	[She gives a nod. Then another nod, even slower.]
0DI1001122	[She nods grimly. She seems satisfied.]
0DI1001123	[Christine's expression relaxes slightly, and she nods.]
0DI1001124	[Christine's expression becomes furious, and she raises her hands, draws jagged lines in the air.]
0DI1001125	[She then points at you, then the direction of the casino, and makes the motion of two hands talking to each other.]
0DI1001126	[As one hand continues to talk, she moves the other hand to the wrist, and constricts until the other hand slows, stops talking.]
0DI1001127	[Christine looks at you, then shakes her head, points at your collar, then the front gate and shakes her head.]
0DI1001128	[She then slowly shakes her head and draws an "X" in the air.]
0DI1001130	[She looks at you for a moment, studying you. She doesn't move. After a second or two, she frowns.]
0DI1001131	[She frowns, glances at your feet, then nods. She then raises an eyebrow, points at you, makes a circle, then points at your feet.]
0DI1001132	[She continues to look at you for a moment, studying you, then her eyes fall to your collar, then your Pip-Boy.]
0DI1001133	[She glances back up at you, then she circles herself and points at the ground between you.]
0DI1001134	[She repeats the circling motion again. This time, she lowers her hand and circles her finger inward, until she's pointing at the spot between you.]
0DI1001135	[Still pointing at the ground between you two, she raises an eyebrow.]
0DI1001137	[FAILED] [She makes a mock sigh.]
0DI1001138	[She waits. After a second, she raises her eyebrow again.]
0DI1001139	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm in the direction of the Fountain.]
0DI1001140	[She shrugs, then taps the back of her palm, pointing West and down.]
0DI1001141	[Almost against her will, she smiles. After a moment, the smile fades, and she points at the ground again.]
0DI1001142	[She looks at you for a second, studying you. Then nods.]
0DI1001143	[She points at you, then points at the casino, and she slowly shakes her head - then points in the direction of the main gate.]
0DI1001144	[She frowns, puts her hands on her hips and glares at you. After a second, she rolls her eyes.]
0DI1001145	[She then makes a mocking, slow intake of breath, and then winces. Then she glances at you, points in the direction of main gate.]
0DI1001146	[She looks at you for a moment, glances at your collar, shrugs. She then lightly grabs her neck with both hands, holds it for a moment.]
0DI1001147	[Then her hands fall away. She looks at you, looks at the exit and nods.]
0DI1001148	[She slowly shakes her head, then points at the ground.]
0DI1001149	[She frowns. Glances in the direction of the casino, then the exit, then back in the direction of the casino.]
0DI1001150	[She shrugs... without strength or conviction. She isn't looking at you when she does.]
0DI1001151	[She nods slowly, as if thinking. Then she raises an eyebrow, looks skeptical, then shrugs.]
0DI1001152	[She points downwards, makes a circle around her, then back to the same spot... and then her finger drifts, circling, and she makes a mock-frown.]
0DI1001153	[SUCCEEDED] [She shakes her head, points at herself, then points at you, nods.]
0DI1001154	[FAILED] [She looks frustrated, then makes a dismissive wave.]
0DI1001155	[She shakes her head and rolls her eyes.]
0DI1001157	[She nods once.]
0DI1001158	[She slowly shakes her head. She points at the ground, then moves each leg outward, straddling the place where she's pointing.]
0DI1001160	[She frowns, shakes her head... pauses... then tilts her head slightly, nods slowly.]
0DI1001161	[She frowns, makes a mock motion of loading a gun, then hefting it to her shoulder and taking aim at something in the distance.]
0DI1001162	[Then she pauses, makes a sweeping circle, then puts her arms in a circle around it, as if covering it.]
0DI1001163	[Shakes her head and makes a motion of two fingers walking.]
0DI1001164	[SUCCEEDED] [She looks impressed, nods.]
0DI1001166	[She looks at you, as if surprised. Then glances at your collar, wrinkles her face, and points at it.]
0DI1001167	[She makes a wide sweeping circle of the area, looking around... then brings both hands back to her, then to her neck, and holds it.]
0DI1001168	[Her hands still on her neck, she looks at you gravely, then shakes her head.]
0DI1001169	[She nods slowly, hands still locked on her throat. She looks pained for a moment, and she breaks from your gaze.]
0DI1001170	[Her fingers flutter, almost frantically, for a second, and she runs her hands along her scalp, then her throat - then the collar.]
0DI1001171	[She points at your Pip-Boy, almost with frustration... then gestures all around her, and her shoulders seem to sag.]
0DI1001172	[After a moment, she glances back at you, glances around her, then shakes her head slowly.]
0DI1001173	[She points at your collar, then hers, and shakes her head slowly... then cuts the air with her hand and her face becomes blank.]
0DI1001174	[She gives you a snarl, glances at your collar, makes a dismissive wave.]
0DI1001175	[SUCCEEDED] [Her face wrinkles more, and then she gives a reluctant smile.]
0DI1001177	[She nods and raises a finger.]
0DI1001178	[Still smiling, she rolls her eyes, and then slowly taps the back of her wrist.]
0DI1001179	[She looks at you, surprised. Then she opens her mouth as if to laugh... silently.]
0DI1001180	[Almost as soon as she utters her silent laugh, she stops, looks pained, and her expression becomes dark.]
0DI1001181	[She doesn't look at you, continues to stare darkly in front of her.]
0DI1001182	[After a moment, she glances at you, then taps the back of her wrist. She nods in front of her.]
0DI1001184	[She frowns and raises her middle finger.]
0DI1001185	[She shakes her head and pumps her fist near her chest.]
0DI1001186	[She nods. She makes a motion with her hands around her chin, drawing it down, and then she raises her hands and clenches them at the sky.]
0DI1001187	[She shakes her head... then stops mid-way, frowns... then tilts her head, as if thinking. She seems lost in thought for a moment.]
0DI1001188	[She glances at you, as if caught, then she smiles slightly, but there's an edge to it. Then she shakes her head, slowly, once.]
0DI1001189	[She points at your Pip-Boy.]
0DI1001190	[She nods, looks concerned, taps the side of her head, and expands her hands.]
0DI1001191	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again.]
0DI1001192	[She shakes her head, points at your Pip-Boy again and makes a talking motion with her hand.]
0DI1001193	[She nods, then circles her ear.]
0DI1001194	[She nods, frowns.]
0DI1001195	[SUCCEEDED] [She frowns, raises two fingers, and has them walk together. Then she looks down on the two fingers, and her face becomes angry.]
0DI1001196	[Then she chops her hand down, and draws the two fingers apart. One of the finger she points at herself.]
0DI1001197	[FAILED] [She pauses, looks at you for a second, then shrugs and shakes her head.]
0DI1001198	[She repeats the chopping motion, slower, then draws the two fingers apart. She looks sadly at one of the fingers.]
0DI1001200	[She frowns, shakes her head, and even more so at husband.]
0DI1001201	[She hesitates, then waves her hand.]
0DI1001203	[She shakes her head, but rolls it side to side.]
0DI1001206	[She nods, and looks at you a little surprised.]
0DI1001207	[She shakes her head, draws the two fingers together, then shakes her head more emphatically.]
0DI1001208	[She raises an eyebrow, looks at you.]
0DI1001209	[She nods slowly, studying you. She seems to be gauging you again.]
0DI1001210	[She makes a slow circle motion after a moment, taps her wrist.]
0DI1001215	[She nods. Once.]
0DI1001216	[She shrugs slightly, then waits.]
0DI1001217	[She makes a disapproving frown, shakes her head.]
0DI1001218	You know what... you're right. I don't need to use the same methods to kill you, and I shouldn't... it would make me as bad as Elijah is.
0DI1001219	All right - forget the proximity frequency, we'll decide this ourselves.
0DI1001220	[Christine studies the area, then the Police Station. She pretends to unload a weapon and holds up the imaginary cartridge, waving it.]
0DI1001221	[Christine looks at the machine and frowns. She points at the narrow slot on the side and raises an eyebrow.]
0DI1001222	[Christine stops, glances at the speaker, then glances at your collar, frowning.]
0DI1001223	Need to reset this damn thing... switching the frequencies... come on, come on...
0DI1001224	Resetting signal... resetting signal.
0DI1001225	That's it... signal frequency's hot, let's see how you deal with this.
0DI1001226	Switching frequency, asshole.
0DI1001227	Switching frequency, bitch.
0DI1001228	Seeing what I can do to shut those turrets down from up here... come on... come on...
0DI1001229	...got it, two of 'em down... can't shut down the others - he's cut off access. Dammit! Put him down, bury him - whatever it takes!
0DI1001231	"Begin again - but know when to let go."
0DI1001232	Sinclair's little surgery carts. Kept them around for his lady friend.
0DI1001233	What, you need surgery done? Let's get out of here... those speakers on the wall are making my nerves do a dance.
0DI1001234	Guess we're going the long way around.
0DI1001235	See? That... wasn't so bad, was it?
0DI1001236	Looks like we'll have to go through this pea soup. I can get you across.
0DI1001237	We're not heading to the police station, are we? Ghost People hunt there.
0DI1001238	He's not dead... it's a trick. Get an axe.
0DI1001239	Better make sure he's dead. Poke him with a stick or something.
0DI1001240	Watch for Hologram security, not as nice as the lady at the fountain, trust me.
0DI1001241	What are we doing here? We're not going to find a doctor on call at this hour, trust me.
0DI1001242	Place is haunted, got ghosts walking in it.
0DI1001243	Look... I give you this key, and there's nothing to keep you from just killing me and running. And as I see it...
0DI1001244	...I just gave up my ace in the hole. So... the only chance I've got left is making sure you don't leave.
0DI1001245	And there's no way in hell I'm letting you get to the Sierra Madre vault instead of me. Not after all this time.
0DI1001246	It's a shame... I regret it. Still, you dames are all the same - things get a little hot, you get cold feet. That's why I'm still alive. You? Well...
0DI1001247	You don't just stop robbing casinos, do you? What's that tape... oh, the one with Sinclair's woman, Vera.
0DI1001248	What about it? You want me to give you a standing ovation?
0DI1001249	Always asking questions when you should be shooting. You're a piece of work, I'll give you that.
0DI1001250	Yeah - don't you? Or... guess Vera Keyes got lost along with the rest of the holo-archives when the bomb hit, huh?
0DI1001251	Ghost in name and image. Still a looker, though. Got to hand it to Sinclair, sure can pick 'em. Well, or get picked. Whichever.
0DI1001252	[SUCCEEDED] Lucky guess... you sure about that? Because if you make a mistake... well, Sierra Madre's got us both.
0DI1001253	[FAILED] Yeah, you're a gambler. Me, I don't take chances. Trust me, only one of us has a sure out.
0DI1001254	All right, all right... look, I'll hand it over, I promise. No need to get all upset. We can both come out ahead in this.
0DI1001255	What? Hey, hey... now... w-wait... I... ah, forget it. Time for the hard way.
0DI1001256	What are you talking about? Medical report? Vera wasn't...
0DI1001257	...the Med-X and Superstims. And here I thought she was trying to numb herself to the lights.
0DI1001258	Sinclair must have known, though. He was dense, not in that way. But... that doesn't make any sense. If she was sick, dying...
0DI1001259	...then why build this place? Why start a damn casino and have her be the lock?
0DI1001260	Because she could get closer to Sinclair than I ever could. He built this place for her... well, after the two "chanced" to meet.
0DI1001261	That's... hmm. Never mind, doesn't change anything. The Sierra Madre's still waiting for us to crack it open.
0DI1001262	I waited an entire lifetime! Sitting in that Villa, watching it all fall apart - Sinclair's Sierra Madre towering over everything? Untouched?!
0DI1001263	Then you show up, thinking you can just take it all from me, you and the old man running the show? I planned all this, I made it all happen, not you!
0DI1001264	Sure, yeah, I have the key on me. I made other keys, too, to unlock the casino and ruin Sinclair, finally. After all these years...
0DI1001265	No... now... now I think ruining you and all your plans would be enough for me. Kill me, I still win, you're never getting in the vault.
0DI1001266	Well... "safely?" Around here, that word doesn't come cheap.
0DI1001267	Safely? What, after your sweet-and-ruthless talk when we first met, now you care about my safety? Right.
0DI1001268	Really? You don't strike me as the type, especially after our little "how can I cooperate" chat at my home.
0DI1001269	Real funny. Although you know, after your "collar talk" in the Residential area, I believe you.
0DI1001270	Look... I strike up the speaker system, there's going to be ghosts all over this place. Any change in the sounds around here...
0DI1001271	...the Ghost People are not big on talking, they are big on listening. Hunting. Killing. More vicious than music critics, trust me.
0DI1001272	In the middle of town here? Alone? On a rooftop, with a big lightshow in the air?
0DI1001273	Tell you what - why don't you just give me one of those Space Age Cosmic Knives so I can slit my wrists, be less painful checking out that way.
0DI1001274	Not one for fighting if we can avoid it. Still, wasn't bad at the pistol range and over the years, I've learned how to handle a knife...
0DI1001275	...and explosives a bit. A bit. Made a lot of mistakes along the way. Still have my fingers, though.
0DI1001276	Partner, I'm not sure this guy's operating with a full deck. My bet? Process of elimination, lowest common denominator.
0DI1001277	He figures the "Strong Man"'s needed somewhere, even if it sounds like the Strong Man's two minds about it.
0DI1001278	Plus, I'm guessing wherever ol' Doggy Boy's needed doesn't need smarts. I hope not, or we're royally jones'd.
0DI1001279	Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
0DI1001280	And go on, run for the exit door, this'll be fun to watch.
0DI1001281	I still need to eat. At least I think I do. The Villa provides... even if it's not as glamorous as the Cantina Madrid.
0DI1001282	Once I... well, realized what you could scrounge up around here, I had a lot of time to experiment. Not the best chef, but...
0DI1001283	...well, here's the mix, if you can stomach it. I call it a "Sierra Madre Martini."
0DI1001284	Scrape some Cloud Residue off the walls, mash it in a Tin Can with some Junk Food from the machines, then hold your nose and down it.
0DI1001285	There's Electric Hot Plates around if you can't find a campfire to mix it at. Also, there's other recipes you can do with the Cloud Residue...
0DI1001286	...although it might take a hardier survivalist than me to brew them. I stick to martinis.
0DI1001287	Christine, that her name? Nice name. I mean, you can't see it on posters, but... never mind.
0DI1001288	I don't know. She might need to hold some place where speaking isn't important. Like stage tech? Lighting? Got me.
0DI1001289	And me? I've had prime billing in Europe, New York... and this gig doesn't feel like that.
0DI1001290	Don't get me wrong, I can hold an audience, conduct a score from the rooftops, but I'm guessing I'm the odd man out in this whole heist.
0DI1001291	Little Miss Silence...? Maybe she needs to be in some place where she can be seen, but being heard isn't important?
0DI1001292	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... maybe the drain in power, that'll cause the security systems to shut down enough to let us in. But... getting back out?
0DI1001293	No, the place'll close up tighter than an opening at the Fronds. Or Danny Parker's sphincter when he has to tip a doorman.
0DI1001294	[FAILED] Interesting... in the sense that having some light show open the Sierra Madre? Interesting to me, who would have thought?
0DI1001295	Oh, it'll light up the casino, light up the sky... set the speakers in the Villa to play beautiful, soothing music.
0DI1001296	...and when I say soothing music, I mean with the speakers being the state they are, things'll be screaming, all right. Think air raid sirens.
0DI1001297	That means it'll wake up everything in town like a hornet's nest. Not sure what a hornet is? Forget it - basically, trouble.
0DI1001298	Vera was a big star, back before the Bomb. Not the best actress, but... well, she had other talents. Nice voice, nice legs.
0DI1001299	For some reason, Sinclair... he built this place... she caught his eye. Once he was hooked, that was it, had to have her.
0DI1001300	So made the introductions, and guess what? He builds this place for her, like some kind of Cleopatra obsession. Wasn't always a deathtrap.
0DI1001301	Of course. What, some kind of surprise to you that I knew people once? Used to have my name in lights, all right?
0DI1001302	Knew a dozen Veras, or whatever her name was. Uh... "Vera Keyes." Figured I could pay Sinclair back, introduce the two...
0DI1001303	...guy was a slouch in the dame department, had to pick up the slack somehow.
0DI1001304	The Clinic? Yeah, I did bring her in. Before the Gala... well, before the first Gala Event. A few lifetimes ago.
0DI1001305	She was a stress case, throat was shot, all nerves. When she wasn't doped up on Med-X or Superstimming her pain away...
0DI1001306	...look, never mind. I don't want to speak bad about her. She was a classy woman, good singer, and if she couldn't act her way out of a box...
0DI1001307	...she was Sinclair's world, and that's all that mattered. He didn't need to know any of that, any of her history.
0DI1001308	Sure. First, they figure they can get out, escape. Then they start thinking it over, start thinking about how they can have it all.
0DI1001309	They start weighing the odds, taking risks... and then taking each other out. Bomb collars or not.
0DI1001310	Although... it's odd, the bomb collars weren't linked before like they are now. Guess someone learned what the problem was.
0DI1001311	Dead. Either got killed by one of the Villa's attractions, locals, or the beautiful weather.
0DI1001312	Can tell you right now - they didn't stick close to each other, and when they did, they let down their guard at the wrong moment.
0DI1001313	Some left signposts to others, trying to help them out - just led to them getting killed by someone a little more greedy than they were.
0DI1001314	Well... considering my life's on the line, too, yeah, a few things.
0DI1001315	First off, keep everyone together. Keep checking behind you, make sure your partners are following... don't let them wander.
0DI1001316	Also, don't go running crazy everywhere. Almost every inch of this town is lethal. So if you're not sure, take it real slow.
0DI1001317	And speaking of slow, don't go shouting, or attracting attention. Go quiet. The Ghost People find you, it's over.
0DI1001318	Right, look - so, not everything about the Villa was the pinnacle of bright ideas.
0DI1001319	In order to pull off the Gala, old Sinclair had to get creative... the Sierra Madre announcement, for example. Not just for the casino, not at all.
0DI1001320	The Gala's tied to the casino, draws on its power. Might cause it to reset itself, open the doors for a bit like it was supposed to.
0DI1001321	Well, Vera's beautiful voice doesn't run on casino power, exactly. Her broadcast is tied into the emergency broadcast signal for the Sierra Madre.
0DI1001322	You know, in case of attack? Well, guess what - the night of the Gala Event, the emergency signal went out all right.
0DI1001323	But because the broadcast had been hooked up to the Gala Event, instead of an emergency signal, you get Vera's voice on the radio. Great, huh?
0DI1001324	Yeah. The Sierra Madre's last song, one only a few people are ever going to hear. A little sad, but what can you do?
0DI1001325	Odd Man out... dead weight. Someone you need holding the toolbox, the nurse passing the scalpel, the chauffer driving you to the concert.
0DI1001326	Any guy with hands is who he needs up on that rooftop. Guess he thinks I don't rate, looking like I do. Poor him.
0DI1001327	Look... those ghosts are going to come out of the wings behind you in a second, the security types, not the "friendly" bald types.
0DI1001328	And if you got in here, the door's probably locked tight behind you - so don't back up or run for the exit, you're not going to make it.
0DI1001329	Trust me - as soon as you can, run to the door to the left - use the key you got out of the music rag there, and camp out.
0DI1001330	As bad as things are, it's going to get a lot worse if either of us pops - so get backstage... until we get a better plan.
0DI1001331	Good, go, and don't get yourself killed - do that, and we're both done.
0DI1001333	Look... just get rid of them, all right? Tried to slip off stage, then they all started changing color and raising their hands... not a good sign.
0DI1001334	[SUCCEEDED] Uh... right. Uh... let's see... when you get the door open, there'll be an exit door dead ahead. Don't take it.
0DI1001335	It's most likely filled with toxins from the vents. So hug the wall, make as much space between you and the door... or it's Cloud Nine in a casket.
0DI1001336	Past that... is my dressing room. Under the table there's a footlocker. It's tucked back a bit, so you might miss it. Inside, a gun, some ammo.
0DI1001337	Not much help against the ghosts, still, if you're about to give up, call it quits? Throw it to me so I can eat a bullet first.
0DI1001338	[FAILED] Anything else? I've told you all I can think of! Now, come on, get going.
0DI1001339	You are preaching to the choir. Sinclair and his security... don't even get me started. Those Holograms...
0DI1001340	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, so what? We got bigger problems with the Holograms... no, no, wait, you're right.
0DI1001341	The Theater piped music and sound backstage, which means those little squealers are in the corridors back there, too.
0DI1001342	[FAILED] What about them? The speakers won't kill you if you leave them alone, don't worry about them, just get backstage.
0DI1001343	Uh... let's see. Um, once you break right, watch each turn in the corridor, one'll be on your right past my dressing room - and up.
0DI1001344	Oh, my dressing room - may have left the radio on, right by the table... uh, if you could just shut it off instead of blowing it u... uh, never mind.
0DI1001345	And there was a speaker in the prop room, too - on the wall between the entrances. And... well, walk slow - there's bound to be more.
0DI1001346	[SUCCEEDED] Yeah... yeah, right. So... let's see... security's here because the show hasn't started. Guests aren't allowed in, so...
0DI1001347	...guess we need to start the show. Okay... so when they were setting this place up... we had rehearsals...
0DI1001348	...and heh... Sinclair even set up hologram recordings of the shows so we could watch and critique our performances before a fake audience. Whatever.
0DI1001349	Thing is, when the recording queued up, a nice, calm, appreciative audience appeared in the Theater - no security with their head-blasting zap rays.
0DI1001350	So, find the music, get it to the projector room upstairs, then play it...? Might reset security, worth a shot.
0DI1001351	[FAILED] One thing at a time - and buying time is what we need, all right? Think in the now, it'll sort itself out. I hope.
0DI1001352	Look, I'm in danger here, all right, not exactly thinking with a level head, so cut me some slack. Please.
0DI1001353	The speakers are all controlled by a central console. It's the farthest from the only door out of here...
0DI1001354	...so you'd need to do a full circuit of the corridor to get to it. Once there, you'll need to shut it down, and I don't have the code.
0DI1001355	If you have the code, you can turn off all the speakers, make them settle down. Getting backstage should buy us time, just take it slow.
0DI1001356	The Holotape should be where I left it... no, wait. It's... it's in Vera's dressing room, probably. May... may be a key to her room on my desk.
0DI1001357	Anyway... snag the key out of my room, and look around Vera's room, the Holotape has to be there. As for getting it to the projection booth...
0DI1001358	Well... sometimes Vera used to watch from the projection booth, so she must have had a master key... look around her room, might be there.
0DI1001359	[SUCCEEDED] What? Oh, my left - your right. So, yeah, run to the door on your right. Heh, almost got you killed there. Us killed there.
0DI1001360	[FAILED] Right, the locked door to the left. Watch out, the guards are going to materialize in any second, crouch and take it slow.
0DI1001361	Do I have to spell it out? Come on. Time's wasting, and those Holograms are going to be on us any second.
0DI1001362	What? Are you sure? That song... that stupid song of hers... no, that makes perfect sense.
0DI1001363	And it was always playing here in the casino... dammit, if I'd only brought a recording inside... so, what, you're trying to recover it?
0DI1001364	Oh, I'm not going to fight you - I'm going to let security show you out. Didn't see anyone come in? Well... they'll be here soon.
0DI1001365	Guess Vera echoes down through the ages, then. Sierra Madre hasn't completely forgotten her.
0DI1001366	So that's why you showed... you wanted what was in the music archives on this floor, hook up the signal. Nice.
0DI1001367	[SUCCEEDED] No... no... the collars... I know what happened now. Sure, mine activated... but it feels different, the electronic tapdance inside.
0DI1001368	I can kill you and still make it out while security is busy frying you to a crisp. Hands are clean, then smooth sailing to the Sierra Madre.
0DI1001369	[FAILED] No... I know how the collars behave now, in here anyway. At least the Sierra Madre gave me that.
0DI1001370	I should be thankful, in a second, it'll give me another gift - with any luck, security'll leave enough of your ashes for an urn on my mantle.
0DI1001371	Well, yeah in the Villa. But I have one inside, too.
0DI1001372	We can talk about that later, though, it's not important right now... you came for me, any sign of the others?
0DI1001373	Figures... wish he'd show himself, although I'm betting he's not doing that until we've cracked the vault.
0DI1001374	That means we'll still need a copy of the song to get into the vault... and after all I went through to smuggle a copy inside.
0DI1001375	Wait... you said this guy wanted you to deal with all of us first? What, is everyone else here?
0DI1001376	It's safe. I hope. Right now, let's focus on getting everyone else to safety, all right? Everybody else all right?
0DI1001377	Forget that walking stomach, not interested in being his lunch... just glad the girl's all right. Where is she? Is she here?
0DI1001378	Wait... no, if the Sierra Madre assigned people to floors, she's got to have been sent to Vera's room, right? That's irony for you.
0DI1001379	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better.
0DI1001380	Dead? For the love of... this whole heist was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
0DI1001381	Dead? For the love of... Chopping up her voice box was a gamble anyway. So much for back-up plans.
0DI1001382	Figured that out, huh? Clever.
0DI1001386	You know... people can still surprise me. All right, I believe you. You got spine. Guess the bombs left a little human goodwill behind.
0DI1001387	At least you're honest, can't blame you. I'd have done the same if there was a trigger to my head... or a collar on my neck.
0DI1001388	I'll be fine, don't worry about me. Go on ahead, I'm going to try and unwind.
0DI1001389	All right - well, thanks for bailing me out.
0DI1001390	So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
0DI1001391	Hnh. You got a point. You better not let me down. Try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
0DI1001392	All right... look, if the Holograms are here to keep me company, then... I don't mind staying here for a while.
0DI1001393	But listen... when this thing goes off, try and get into the Sierra Madre without me? You'll wish you hadn't.
0DI1001395	And here I thought I was being clever. Teach me to hold my cards a little closer to the chest... whole heist was a gamble anyway.
0DI1001396	Still... there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives, right? Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal?
0DI1001397	[SUCCEEDED] Dead? After all I went through... after all that hauling her body through the streets?
0DI1001398	[FAILED] Really... "partner." Now, now... you can't pull one over on Dean... but you tried, didn't you?
0DI1001399	So you don't want to share... keep her from me, huh? All we have to do is make her sing, and it's all ours.
0DI1001400	Although... why lie to me? I'm hurt. I mean, we don't even need her if you get the terminals live, and the music kicking.
0DI1001403	Perfect, couldn't have worked out better. So - what, you're heading to the main terminal now that you've got this floor unlocked?
0DI1001406	All right... even if they all end up dead, though, you say there's a way to recover the song from the Sierra Madre archives.
0DI1001407	Just set up links to each floor, then use the lobby terminal to tie it all together? Easy. Just a little legwork.
0DI1001408	Yeah? Little bit of two-reel memories... we're here to steal from the Sierra Madre, not from each other.
0DI1001409	"Blackmail" is such a strong word. I asked her, she said yes, then... she started to get cold feet.
0DI1001410	I blame Sinclair... he was such a victim, that maybe she felt it would be too easy... it doesn't matter.
0DI1001411	Sinclair built this whole town to accommodate her. Same with the casino's voice lock. He wanted to make sure she had access to everything.
0DI1001412	And since I already had access to Vera... well, that meant I had access to the vault, too.
0DI1001413	What wasn't I blackmailing her with. Chem use, indiscretions, more chem use... the usual Hollywood tune.
0DI1001414	Like Sinclair, people are the architects of their own misfortunes. Leave themselves wide open for someone to waltz right in and take what they want.
0DI1001415	As long as they take a single step into the trap. Get a few pictures, get a little dirt, and that person's your piano.
0DI1001416	Vera? Med-X was her thing, even Superstimmed herself for the after-rush. Sick.
0DI1001417	Way I figure it, you'll try and run for the exit, and only I know where the key is - and where the safest place in the whole theater is: backstage.
0DI1001418	You, you're trapped down there, and you couldn't shut off the speakers, unlock the doors, or cancel security if you tried.
0DI1001419	I'm not a betting man, I've come too far to leave it to chance.
0DI1001420	What... what now? Try and come back here?
0DI1001421	No, you belong out in the audience... I mean, not like... uh... you could get backstage. That key you snagged, it won't work.
0DI1001422	Of all the... where the hell are those stupid Holograms already? Even if you get back here, you won't live long, trust me.
0DI1001423	No, you want to know why? Because there's more beneath the streets, in the buildings, and oh - everywhere else.
0DI1001424	They hear anything out of the ordinary, especially "music" screaming through the speakers when I close the connection? They'll be here, fast.
0DI1001425	Take? It's not going to take anything because you couldn't offer me anything to stay here.
0DI1001426	The Ghost People'll come out of the woodwork when the Gala Event starts blaring, and when they see me trapped up here? It's curtains for Dean.
0DI1001427	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. If the Hologram systems still work, that'd do the trick.
0DI1001428	Okay... all right, you call up some of those Old World stiffs, that'd be an audience I wouldn't mind having below.
0DI1001429	[FAILED] Yeah, and how can you guarantee that? I'm not waiting here alone, trust me.
0DI1001430	I mean, if I had a few of those Holograms... or a few hundred... surrounding me, maybe. I'd settle for two, enough to cover a quick exit.
0DI1001431	You're full of it - you kill me, we both die. You wouldn't dare.
0DI1001432	So you leaving me here? No dice, not going to happen, and nothing you can say will change my mind.
0DI1001433	You can look all you want... I still feel safer with a pair of Hologram escorts to make it through the area.
0DI1001434	You powered the Holograms up? Well... yeah, that's pretty good protection. Sure worked at the fountain, Vera kept the Ghost People away.
0DI1001435	But, uh... how do I know the power won't suddenly go out? And... I don't know, this still sounds risky to me. For me.
0DI1001436	If I remember correctly, there should be two Holograms you can switch on in the area... just don't remember how.
0DI1001437	Do that, and I'll consider waiting on the rooftop. Maybe.
0DI1001438	What? What are you talking about?
0DI1001439	You wouldn't. You need me to strike up the sparking chords there. Breaking my legs isn't any way to get me to dance.
0DI1001440	You wouldn't... no, yeah, you would. I would. If I thought you screaming wouldn't attract more of the locals.
0DI1001441	All right, I'll stay here. For now. But you leave me high and dry, make a run for the Sierra Madre? You'll pay for it, I promise you.
0DI1001442	What? You wouldn't. I mean... no, wait, you would. You don't bluff, ever since you first showed up in the Villa and we chatted.
0DI1001443	No... you wouldn't. You're not the type. Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me.
0DI1001444	You just let me talk, not even letting on that our collars were linked, when all you had to do was tell me that to get me to come along.
0DI1001445	So... no, I don't think you'll shut them off. You don't threaten people, not your way.
0DI1001446	Wait, hold on. I didn't say I was scared. Heh, heh. Cold feet? Don't be ridiculous. I've played to worse crowds than this, I can hold the fort here.
0DI1001447	[SUCCEEDED] Well... yeah. You got a point.
0DI1001448	[FAILED] What do I want? I want a little more insurance than some Old World Villa construction to guard me, all right?
0DI1001450	[FAILED] Trust you? Right. You're not the one who has to sit up here and wait for the Ghost People to show.
0DI1001452	[FAILED] Really? You're not the one standing up here waiting for the Ghost People to show, all right?
0DI1001453	Oh, right, after all the "we'll both blow up if you don't do as I say" talk we first had. Not put me in danger? Right.
0DI1001454	Yeah... yeah, you're right. You didn't have to switch on those Holograms, and you did.
0DI1001455	Even when you first showed up in the Villa, you didn't threaten me, were just willing to cooperate to get through this. Hnh.
0DI1001456	Unless he's got a friend, no dice. Nobody relies on a single escape route unless they want to get caught.
0DI1001458	The police station... Ghost People love this place, no idea why. Might be the Holograms nearby.
0DI1001459	Hey, those are my emergency supplies! Uh... I-I mean... I know we're in a bad spot here... just, uh, leave me something, all right?
0DI1001460	Yeah, go on... help yourself. Why not?
0DI1001461	Leave me something, will you?
0DI1001462	Never should have left those stupid handprints. Dead giveaway.
0DI1001463	Those machines... Sinclair's little gifts, lasted longer than he did. If you need food, stims... put in a chip, hold out your hand.
0DI1001464	Pretty as a picture.
0DI1001465	Uh... Dean, I... didn't hear you come in.
0DI1001466	I'm not wearing my dancing shoes, so I walk a little softly now. What, you think I was a Chinaman, come to cut your American throat?
0DI1001467	Dean, really.
0DI1001468	What... no hug? Come here.
0DI1001469	Dean, I'm getting ready.
0DI1001470	You sing like a bird, pop the safe, and we're as through as through can be.
0DI1001471	Dean... I just... about tonight, I... I don't know.
0DI1001472	You don't know? I ask one simple favor of you, and you tell me "no?"
0DI1001473	I didn't say no. I just said that... I don't think...
0DI1001474	You're right, you don't think.
0DI1001475	I don't need you - I'll send you back to the farm, worse off than you were, because you'll have seen the Sierra Madre, and had to let it all go.
0DI1001476	I could have gotten any leggy dame out of Hollywood to get out here and play Sinclair's heart strings.
0DI1001477	You just happened to be the one I caught, and it was really your own fault, a little too much into the chems and meds, and...
0DI1001478	Aw, shhh, don't cry. Look, I'm not trying to hurt you. Just one last little job, a little less dirty, a little less messy. He trusts you, Vera.
0DI1001479	And so do I. After this, I promise you, all those other Holotapes, they'll go away.
0DI1001480	Of course, Dean.
0DI1001481	Is... is this thing on? You hear me down there? Trying to help you out here... disable the speakers, play a little music...
0DI1001482	...and that's more like it, got a beat you can swing to. And they won't set off your collar any more - just hit that guy where it hurts.
0DI1001484	Hnnhhhh... Dog getting full.
0DI1001485	OM NOM NOM
0DI1001486	Rhrrrrrr...
0DI1001487	RhhhhaaarrrRRRRRRRR!
0DI1001492	Hnnh. City smells bad in some places, so bad it makes people fall down.
0DI1001493	Careful, the Villa's filled with pockets from the Cloud. Lethal.
0DI1001494	I'm in control. The Master won't help Dog now... and it won't help you.
0DI1001495	Not listen, Dog out of cage now.
0DI1001496	[SUCCEEDED] The key? Why it's the Old Man, the one who brought us here.
0DI1001497	I hid the key on me so Dog wouldn't know... I just need the Old Man to show up, so he and I can talk.
0DI1001498	If Dog was in control when the Old Man appeared... well, he would just do whatever he commanded, as always. And I can't have that.
0DI1001499	[FAILED] It's close, safe, as you know.
0DI1001500	[FAILED] It's close, safe. I did lock myself in, after all.
0DI1001501	[SUCCEEDED] Trauma... yes, in a manner of speaking.
0DI1001502	[FAILED] No... sometimes it simply wakes voices up.
0DI1001503	[SUCCEEDED] That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
0DI1001504	I needed to come out of the cage to protect Dog. From clever humans... like you.
0DI1001505	[FAILED] Perhaps. Or maybe I was here all the time, watching. Waiting for you.
0DI1001506	Dog... Dog has heard that before. Was there pretty lights? There... were things to pull? Hard to pull, but Dog did. And... a cage.
0DI1001507	...and Dog was hungry there. Dog... was someone else there, with Dog. Then... then there was noise, then... lights... and streets... screamed.
0DI1001508	...Dog doesn't want to go to cage. It's inside Dog now, Dog can see the cage, hear the noises. The way to casino... it'll hurt you. Inside.
0DI1001513	Dog and I take turns in the cage... one steps out, the other goes back in.
0DI1001515	Dog is listening.
0DI1001516	Dog will crush you, snap your bones, make red everywhere.
0DI1001517	[SUCCEEDED] Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
0DI1001518	[FAILED] Dog tired of listening to you - put you in cage, piece by piece.
0DI1001519	No. No, Dog, no...
0DI1001520	...knows now. Voice was always small... Dog could have torn it apart, eaten it all this time, tear it...
0DI1001521	...apart, Dog... we cannot be apart, you need if... hnnnh... hrrhhaharrrrr...
0DI1001522	...Dog... Dog is... empty. The voice... Dog is hungrier than ever...
0DI1001523	Dog... Dog doesn't have a... hnh. Here it is. Dog... Dog didn't know it was there. How did it get there?
0DI1001524	Does Master want Dog to fetch someone? Dog will hunt down whoever you want, bring them here.
0DI1001525	Master, Dog is here. What does Master want?
0DI1001526	Yes, Master... Master sounds different, quieter. Master... Dog doesn't want to be in the cage any more. Dog will be good this time, Dog promises.
0DI1001527	Yes, Master. Here, Dog sorry, Dog... just... just let Dog out of the cage. Don't want to be here any longer.
0DI1001529	Dog will obey. Dog will stay here... for now.
0DI1001530	After... after that, Dog find food... tear apart food, eat. Chase it down, can't run, feed. Finally, until Dog is full.
0DI1001531	Yes, Master. Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. Dog will follow.
0DI1001532	Already have a Dog with you... Dog will meet you at the Fountain. Maybe find food on the way.
0DI1001533	Master, Dog waited a long time... brought you many people. If Dog finds more, will bring them to the Fountain, Dog promises.
0DI1001534	Yes, Master. Dog hopes to see you soon.
0DI1001535	Dog good at punching... hitting people with metal bear jaw until they go quiet.
0DI1001536	Dog sometimes pick up club when thing need to hit is big, need to punch in many places.
0DI1001537	Hard to pull things...? Dog has to pull very, very hard to... are we going there?
0DI1001538	Dog not want to stay and pull things... hard to do... and cage there.
0DI1001539	Taste like plastic and copper. Gas inside, in pockets, hssss when teeth sinks into them.
0DI1001540	Master went away until you show up with him on your arm.
0DI1001541	Don't know. Dog keep bringing people here.
0DI1001542	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many. Keep stabbing Dog, cutting him.
0DI1001543	Voice doesn't get mad when Dog feeds on the people here. Voice not like Ghost People, worried there are too many to eat, too many knives.
0DI1001544	Started eating them because wouldn't go quiet when Dog smashed them with bear jaw. Only want one.
0DI1001545	Got Dog angry, others kept cutting him and slicing him with knives when he tried to make one go quiet with teeth.
0DI1001546	So Dog started crushing them, then when they stop twitching, then eats them. Then they not get back up with hssss-chkk noise, Dog not like that.
0DI1001547	Dog can tell when they not yet dead... twitch a bit, make low noise, then noise when they get back up, listen.
0DI1001548	Dog doesn't like to eat them always, sometimes so many.
0DI1001549	Dog fetches. Dragged you here... Dog thinks. You not struggle like others. Trap makes you sleep, make your voice go to cage.
0DI1001550	Dog doing what he was told. Tried to catch as many as he can, can eat the others.
0DI1001551	No eat you, though. Master talk through you, like voice inside Dog. Dog missed hearing Master, not hear Master for long time.
0DI1001552	Might find way back if Master lets you go. If he not want you to go, he makes head red spray. Then Dog has to find another one.
0DI1001553	To leave...? Go through gate, walk. Hard to find way, Dog can do it, too hard for most to come here. Why so quiet in streets.
0DI1001554	Nrrrrrrh... rhhhhharrhhh!
0DI1001555	[SUCCEEDED]Hnnh? Master? Don't want Master to be mad... what does Master want Dog to...
0DI1001556	[FAILED] No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
0DI1001557	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master... Dog... Dog is listening.
0DI1001558	[FAILED] No... no, you put Dog here, you keep him here! Like other cages you put Dog in!
0DI1001559	If... if other voice comes out... Dog... Dog won't wake up. Dog doesn't want to sleep, please don't make him...
0DI1001560	...go to sleep. Good. Yes... make him sleep. Please...
0DI1001561	...don't make me go to sleep. I... Dog is tired. Dog is tired, can't... keep eyes open. Sleep... Dog needs to sleep.
0DI1001562	Dog... Dog never thought of the voice as... small. As something he could hold...
0DI1001563	...on for much longer. What are you doing? What...
0DI1001564	...do you want Dog to do? Voice is small now, Dog... Dog could... Dog choke the voice, crush it into red mash.
0DI1001565	Dog is sorry, so sorry, didn't want to, but...
0DI1001566	...it's time for you to realize who's in control here. First, we tear you apart - then this casino, and the Old Man with it.
0DI1001567	Yes, Dog can do that. Dog hopes to see you soon.
0DI1001568	...do this? Yes, he can. You caused this - coddled him, protected him, now I'm going to have to take control from...
0DI1001569	...you, you need to go, run. Dog is going to burn voice... burn voice out, burn it away.
0DI1001570	...and Dog looks just like me. You've hurt yourself. Inside. Do you see now, see...
0DI1001571	...in the water. Dog understands now. Dog knows what happened.
0DI1001572	He's right. If you merge us, then... I... we... or whatever we become... we can't help you when you reach whatever's at the Sierra Madre's end.
0DI1001573	And Dog... Dog doesn't want to unremember you, may forget you.
0DI1001574	We will forget almost all that has happened here. You'll be alone - at the Old Man's mercy. Like Dog. Like me.
0DI1001575	...to stop you. You think your pull is stronger than mine? No... no, I've minded Dog, protected him far longer than you ever have. He won't...
0DI1001576	...listen to you. If Master sent you, Dog is listening.
0DI1001577	...him, just as I do. Do you understand now? Do you understand why I have to take control? He...
0DI1001578	...why keep hurting self, voice keeps... telling Dog to do things. Dog just wants voice to go away... away.
0DI1001579	...too late. Too late for us... too late for you to do anything but...
0DI1001580	...listen to you. Your voice... Dog will listen to you.
0DI1001581	Dog is tired of voice inside, tired of being in another cage, again. Try to...
0DI1001582	...kill this human, Dog. Kill them. If this casino is destroyed, good, it'll kill the Old Man, too, the one who...
0DI1001583	...shouts at Dog, the voice shouts, and to stop the voice, Dog needs to burn it out.
0DI1001584	You did it. You... I don't feel him struggling anymore... I'm in pain, and... I hate to say it, I'm starving, but... I'm not fighting him.
0DI1001585	All I wanted was him to listen to me, take care of him, keep him from hurting himself...
0DI1001586	Now I can. One day, when he's ready, I'll let him out. When we... understand each other.
0DI1001587	Dog can't remember. Don't want to go, can't make him stay there.
0DI1001588	[SUCCEEDED] The lights were pretty. In the sky. Pointed at casino. And the casino opened up.
0DI1001589	[FAILED] Uh-uh. Dog... Dog wants to stop talking now.
0DI1001590	Maybe. Not sure you could find way back once leave. Dog has to smell and hunt for path back here sometimes... Cloud keep moving.
0DI1001591	It okay... no one ever leave except Dog... and Dog not want to leave. You here until Master lets you go.
0DI1001592	[SUCCEEDED] Dog can see the voice. Looks just like Dog...
0DI1001593	[FAILED] Dog... Dog does not understand. Voice? The other voice? What do you want Dog to do.
0DI1001594	If Dog... if Dog goes into the water... Dog can't help if Master gets mad. You were nice to Dog, Dog wants to help.
0DI1001595	Dog doesn't want to die. But the voice keeps shouting, and...
0DI1001596	Dog tried to shut it out, tried to hurt self enough to make it...
0DI1001597	...quiet. Shhhhh, Dog. Let me handle this. I'll let you feed on this human when we're done.
0DI1001598	No... if you rip their arms off... or legs, mask people stay down. Easier to rip off legs and arms when they fall on ground, just keep hitting them.
0DI1001599	If can't make them fall down and rip off legs, make them ash. Saw one caught in electric sparks so much, he turn into burnt pile. Not get back up.
0DI1001600	Dog knows... please... help Dog end the voice, Dog just wants it to go away. Dog...
0DI1001601	...and I have more in common than we know. Soon, you'll be inside Dog, just as I am.
0DI1001602	Dog tried. Just hard... hard to hear over voice sometimes... so loud... pain... pain...
0DI1001603	...won't shut me out, Dog. It won't silence me. This human... both of them, they mean to...
0DI1001604	...help Dog, please. Please.
0DI1001605	Lou... ten... ant? Long ago. Smart. Gave us all things to do. Like watch. And kill. Gone now.
0DI1001606	Miss Lou. Miss the Base. Miss the Church. Don't like here. Don't want to talk about it any more, makes head hurt.
0DI1001607	[SUCCEEDED] Dism... disin... chop legs off while stand up, eat when fall down. If not that, make them electric ash.
0DI1001608	[FAILED] All make them stay down. Most of time.
0DI1001609	[SUCCEEDED]You... were kind to Dog. Dog will listen... Dog is glad you came...
0DI1001610	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you come, voice... voice is going...
0DI1001611	[FAILED] No... Dog is my creature, and he's more than enough to end you here and now.
0DI1001612	Dog knows where to hit them, make them stay down... base of neck, lower back, hit it hard enough, life snaps out of them.
0DI1001613	Dog can... see where back of collar is? Follow down, to lower back - hit neck, middle back, right on spine, crack. Then they not get back up.
0DI1001614	Dog hits them, then Dog eats them... easier to make quiet twice that way.
0DI1001615	No... Dog no listen to you, no listen to your voice anymore - will tear you apart, feed on you.
0DI1001616	Dog put his hand in it, hurts. Made the voice go away, now can't get it off. Don't want it off, hurt keeps voice sleeping... bleeding.
0DI1001617	It also keeps others quiet, too. Dog hits them with metal bear teeth until their voices stop, makes Master's voice come back.
0DI1001618	Here? Followed voice in air, then here... here as long as can remember. Don't like this place... hard to find things to eat sometimes.
0DI1001619	Better than the cage. Dog doesn't like being locked up. Voice in air didn't say anything about a cage and nothing to eat.
0DI1001620	Hurt self. Hurt makes the voice go away... it doesn't like pain.
0DI1001621	Dog doesn't like pain, either, but keeps voice quiet, so Dog will hurt self until voice dies. Dog hurt self enough, voice go away, never come back.
0DI1001622	Dog doesn't understand... too hungry, hard to hear words... Master, when can Dog feed.
0DI1001623	If Dog was fed like last time, Dog would listen. If the feeding was quiet.
0DI1001624	Maybe voice could make Dog stay, Dog not want to be in cage, Dog want to be free, find Master.
0DI1001625	Nnnh... getting tired of hearing your orders. Dog's clawing at the cage, hungrier than usual.
0DI1001626	You must need something, I can see it in your eyes. The Gala... of course. How could I forget?
0DI1001627	If you want me to... heel... if you want Dog to obey, then he'll need to be fed, like last time.
0DI1001628	Hnnh-hnn.
0DI1001630	Nnnh-Hnnn.
0DI1001631	Yes... no... don't know what the word means, everyone says the same, except the voice. The voice says it backward.
0DI1001632	Dog is getting tired, Master. When can Dog eat?
0DI1001633	Too much talking makes Dog's head hurt. Getting hungry.
0DI1001634	Dog trapped here, too. This place not like West. Air like copper wire. Gut heavy, hurts, beeps sometimes.
0DI1001635	Back West... in bone cities... Dog wore a collar on wrist, turned him into color of ground, turned him into color of sky.
0DI1001636	Dog hears many voices... one in air. The... other one. And Master. Master is the nicest. Gets mean, mad sometimes. But lets Dog feed.
0DI1001637	Master was quiet for a long time until Dog heard him on your arm... did you eat him? Dog gets hungry, too. Being hungry makes the voice... mad.
0DI1001638	Dog eats whatever he can catch. Sometimes they run, but Dog is strong, moves fast.
0DI1001639	Sometimes... makes voice mad when I eat... Master doesn't mind.
0DI1001640	Is true. Dog wore it right on his hand, where bear trap is now... he thinks.
0DI1001641	When put it on, hard to see. Hard to see... Dog was told not to be seen then. Same as now, except different.
0DI1001642	Dog and others... had to hide in Base. And Church. The Master was there. Master was... spoke like many people. Smart. Like Lou-Lieutenant.
0DI1001643	Dog misses the Church. When got dark, no people, Dog could sit on floor and look up at ceiling. Could... take off wrist-collar then.
0DI1001644	All gone. All gone. It better now that found new Master.
0DI1001645	New Master tells Dog what to do, rewards Dog, like old Master. Dog goes get people, drag them here... like vat. Dog knows how to do that.
0DI1001646	If people fight, Dog hit them until they stop. And if more than one, Dog can eat them, so Dog hunts hard for as many as he can find.
0DI1001647	Don't know where other voice come from. Wish would go away. Always trying to stop Dog, caging Dog.
0DI1001648	Voice started talking not long ago, Dog think... was always there. Start talking when Master showed up? Making Dog sleep, go to cage.
0DI1001649	Voice hates Master. It okay... voice always hide when Master around, go quiet, watch Master as he does things. Voice scared of Master, Dog thinks.
0DI1001650	Master always feed Dog if not in cage. Master lets Dog do what Dog wants. Not like other voice in cage. Always mad with Dog, shouting at him.
0DI1001651	He takes care of Dog. He tells Dog what to do. Told Dog to come here, put collars on people.
0DI1001652	Sometimes people fight. Dog holds them until they go quiet, don't make any noise. If collars don't fit or go too quiet... find others for Master.
0DI1001653	Master makes the other voice go away - the other voice hates Master, Dog can feel it. Master's voice is like pain, protects Dog.
0DI1001654	Lost it. Got hungry. Made the other voice mad, madder than it ever was, mad enough to lock Dog up.
0DI1001655	Other voice... don't wake him up. When voice wakes up, Dog goes to sleep and voice climbs up in Dog's head.
0DI1001656	The voice puts Dog in places... puts him in cages and locks him in.
0DI1001657	Sometimes when Dog gets tired. Or eats too much, gets full. Sometimes... when Dog goes to the cage... then voice wakes up.
0DI1001658	The voice locks Dog in when it comes up, always trying to keep Dog from food. Voice did it at the cage where you found me. Then Master came.
0DI1001659	Dog is better at the baser instincts than I... I merely have the brain for it.
0DI1001660	His sinew and muscle are difficult to move consciously... he's always hungry, clumsy, heavy.
0DI1001661	Of course I know. Even if I don't see it happen - down in the cage, I hear echoes of the footfalls, the click of the collars.
0DI1001662	Every time I see one of you I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, anymore than Dog can help himself.
0DI1001663	You heard the voice, the promise, and then you walked right into one of the Old Man's traps. Then... then Dog comes for you, drags you here.
0DI1001664	You can lead me to water... no, being trapped in this courtyard while lights are flashing and sirens are screaming...
0DI1001665	I can survive one or two of the inhabitants... more than that, even Dog would have to work to keep full without being carved to pieces.
0DI1001666	And the gate here... if it somehow got locked, it'd be the holding cell at the Police Station again, except with no way out.
0DI1001667	Really... an amusing thought.
0DI1001668	If you needed his teeth to devour those metal switches, chew up the diagram, then let him out.
0DI1001669	There's a sequence, precise and clear as a knife, that must be followed. And it requires more than instinct to operate.
0DI1001670	No, you need me, here - out of the cage.
0DI1001671	The Gala Event is the way to bring the Old Man out. He won't show himself until the casino doors are open.
0DI1001672	So triggering the Event is key... and the key. The question becomes... can we trust each other to do this? We'll see.
0DI1001673	If we go there, you'll have to give me control. If you bring Dog out, then... I'll make sure you pay in blood.
0DI1001674	Things here... are... under control. Find the one that dragged us here, end him.
0DI1001675	Dog understands... Dog has done... bad things, knows why voice was...
0DI1001676	...furious with him. Tired of the anger. Thank you... Courier. Even if it's only for minutes before the Sierra Madre kills us all, then...
0DI1001677	...Dog hopes you find a way to save self, like you help Dog, and...
0DI1001678	...when you meet him, find a way to save yourself, as you tried to save us. Otherwise, I'll be upset with you.
0DI1001679	Dog understands. Need help, need Dog in case.
0DI1001680	Of course. You... we might not get through this, otherwise. Need to survive, no matter what the cost. Now... now...
0DI1001681	You were there all the time...
0DI1001682	...all the time, you were there, and so close...
0DI1001683	...together.
0DI1001684	Who... who are you? What is this place?
0DI1001685	I feel as if I've woken up.
0DI1001686	I don't know you, yet I feel like I do, and a feeling of... gratitude. I... forgive me, I... I'm wounded. This chain... this bear trap on my arm...
0DI1001687	...how did I even get this far with these wounds? The pain is excruciating, I... I need to rest for a moment.
0DI1001688	That... that was not the answer I was expecting.
0DI1001689	Thank you... for whatever you have done. I will remain here, need to get my strength back.
0DI1001690	[SUCCEEDED] Master? Master, Dog hoped you would come, voice... voice is going...
0DI1001691	[FAILED] Dog... Dog wants to, Dog does, but...
0DI1001692	[SUCCEEDED] You think you can figure out what to... hnh. Of course you can.
0DI1001693	I'll stand at my post. Once you trigger the event... well, we'll see who makes it to the Sierra Madre.
0DI1001694	[FAILED] No... you can barely give me instructions, let alone order Dog. Bark your orders somewhere else.
0DI1001695	It always does... makes him sleepier. Weaker. Easier to keep out of trouble. As for the type of food...
0DI1001696	Make sure it isn't struggling, if you can. It's hard enough to choke down half of what I suspect he eats. And make sure it's not a bomb collar.
0DI1001697	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found a carcass. Or three.
0DI1001698	More? Don't push your luck.
0DI1001699	You're a brave one. Sure you're ready for the answers?
0DI1001700	Dog might know more, you should ask him. Beware the answer, because I think Dog got hungry, he couldn't help himself.
0DI1001701	I tried, I always try, and he... he keeps giving in.
0DI1001702	All it takes is the right... command. Whenever Dog hears the... his Master giving orders, I go back in the cage.
0DI1001703	So that leash on your wrist... and the one on your neck. I won't truly be free to... express myself until every trace of that voice is destroyed.
0DI1001704	Still... if you ever want to speak to me, bark my audio log at him, the one in the police station. That'll call me out.
0DI1001705	Orders - for me. This should be good.
0DI1001706	It's close. Closer than I'd like... Dog's been into things, needs to think before he eats, chew before he swallows. He's... eager that way.
0DI1001707	Now the collar's a part of me. Inside. I can feel its electronic heartbeat, clicking and burning down below... like before.
0DI1001708	It was cold and heavy before going in the cage... now you're here, and it's pulling and kicking again, tugging like a leash. Interesting.
0DI1001709	No... why did I lock him in the cage. I locked him in because I could feel him... getting hungry again. There wasn't much time.
0DI1001710	If Dog roams, he gets into trouble... eats things he shouldn't, listens to others he shouldn't... so he's safer in here. We're safer in here.
0DI1001711	I hoped if I locked him in here... the one he obeys would come for him. Instead, I get you.
0DI1001712	No... no, I don't think so. Even in here, I have more control than you do.
0DI1001713	I'm not leaving until the one who controls the collars shows... not his voice, not his hand, not his lackey... him.
0DI1001714	And when he comes to see me, we'll settle things. So go on, go back to your master, tell him I'm waiting for him. Dog may follow him - I won't.
0DI1001715	Don't play stupid, I already have to mind one child. You must have figured it out by now.
0DI1001716	The Old Man obsessed with the Sierra Madre... riddled with greed. Hoped you might be him when I woke up. All you are is his hand...
0DI1001717	...you're the same kind of greed. Followed the radio, the broadcast, and now you're here, all confused. Not for long. You'll figure it out.
0DI1001718	Really. Yet it led you here, to me. And now you're here, and it's burning a hole in my guts. Maybe it's crying for its owner.
0DI1001719	They... detach. When segmented, they look like nothing more than metallic Radscorpions... and if they're attached to neck flesh, warm, red...
0DI1001720	Dog doesn't care what's on the body he's crushing in his hands, he'll mangle it, twist it, make it fit until he's full.
0DI1001721	Dog can't help himself... hungry... greedy. And now the collar's inside, alive again. And we're trapped here until it goes cold.
0DI1001722	As if I had a choice. Sometimes instinct takes over, and that's when I go into the cage. It's like curiosity that way.
0DI1001723	After all, you wouldn't have put that collar on by choice... perhaps it was your curiosity that caused that hand to close on your neck.
0DI1001725	Every time I see one of you, I know exactly how you got here - you couldn't help yourselves, anymore than Dog can help himself.
0DI1001727	You're not him anymore than I'm Dog. But that collar around your neck...
0DI1001728	...you're an extension of the Old Man's grasp, clumsy, perhaps, but a tool, yes. And once you get acclimated to the Sierra Madre...
0DI1001729	...then you'll feel the same overpowering hunger the Old Man does. And then you'll be him, not just his hand.
0DI1001730	Elijah. Human, weak like all of you are. Feeling age circling him like starved dogs, howling for blood.
0DI1001731	To me, he reeks of age and failure. And madness. To me, he is simply the "Old Man." To Dog, he is "Master." His name, meaningless.
0DI1001732	Running out of years, hopes and dreams running through his withered hands like sand from the Big Empty... and scorched by the sun.
0DI1001733	Me? You think I want to haul bodies around the wastes like a Brahmin at the whip? No, Dog does it, when the Old Man says fetch, Dog fetches.
0DI1001734	You were in a man-trap, and Dog made his rounds, and dragged you here. When, I don't know. But... it must have been... recent. Before the cage.
0DI1001735	Of course you can't. This cage is locked tight... from you and the Old Man.
0DI1001736	The way back doesn't matter... try to leave, try to disobey, and your collar ends the journey faster than you can say, "begin again."
0DI1001737	You're clever, you'd be able to find a way back if you left the Villa. Dog can... I can find the way back, if "back" is where I even wanted to go.
0DI1001738	Until the Old Man lets you go, you're going nowhere. This beautiful paradise, with all its toxins and death... it's home.
0DI1001739	I don't remember you... that isn't surprising. What is... is that it was when Dog was out of his cage... free, hungry.
0DI1001740	He knows not to eat anything he catches in the traps... after that, however... so he dragged you here, you got spared.
0DI1001741	Dog must have fed after you arrived... once he was fed, that allowed me out of the cage, and put him inside. Do you remember how long you were out?
0DI1001742	Must have already been in the cage... already had the collar in me. You're lucky Dog didn't devour you... otherwise, we'd be closer than we are now.
0DI1001743	The Old Man... this "Elijah," tried to hold the sun in his hands, arrogance, was cast down for it. Icarus' crime was to fly too high, Elijah...
0DI1001744	Elijah wanted to bring the sun down to him. Hnh! Arrogance.
0DI1001745	Heard the call of the Sierra Madre, just like you did... exactly the same way.
0DI1001746	Finds out it's more than a story, comes to this shining poisonous grail, this jewel of the desert.
0DI1001747	Dog knows him more than I do. Dog's always nodding, always obeying him, because he's weak and hungry and greedy for master's affection.
0DI1001748	Oh, I have the key, always did. Hid it on the chain behind my neck before Dog came bursting out, eating everything he could.
0DI1001749	Wanted to make sure whoever came to fetch Dog spoke to me first, got within reach. Instead... I get you.
0DI1001750	Dog and I don't share... everything. What I know, he doesn't.
0DI1001751	What he knows... what little he knows... I don't. For example, your arrival is a surprise. I wished that I could have remembered, I'm sure Dog knew.
0DI1001752	And when he's feeding, well... I sometimes have to find out about it later. Now all there is to do is wait for my intended guest.
0DI1001753	[SUCCEEDED] They were here when I arrived... so I made use of them, in a manner of speaking. More their... voices, really.
0DI1001754	These collars... they don't just track us. You can eavesdrop on them as well. Tune to a frequency, and you can hear everything someone is saying.
0DI1001755	So perhaps it's a good thing that Dog swallowed his collar. Anyone listening would find it difficult to hear past the... digestion.
0DI1001756	[FAILED] I was afraid Dog would get lonely. The voices, as static and whispering as they are... are still company.
0DI1001757	Then I still win. I'd rather die in this cell than have Dog follow him any longer, follow his orders, his commands, desperate for recognition.
0DI1001758	The Old Man... he has the need to hold on, to the past, to the Madre... I'd rather be free, let go of this shell, than have it cage me any longer.
0DI1001759	Dog? You're not talking to him now, are you? No, even if you could drag Dog out of his cage, you still couldn't get him out of this cage.
0DI1001760	I put him here for a reason... if he could have escaped, he would have. So here he stays.
0DI1001761	Yes, but Dog doesn't know that. We don't share everything. Sometimes it's a blessing... sometimes... it causes difficulties.
0DI1001762	Now I think it's a blessing, it keeps you on that side of the cage. Now... you go fetch. Find your master, bring him here so we can talk.
0DI1001763	Yes... you could. And once he was out, all starving and hungry... what do you think he would do then?
0DI1001764	Be careful what cage you open, because he won't go back in it without a fight. He'll tear you apart, he won't care if it kills you both.
0DI1001765	Dog... obeys. Yes. Why... do you have some means of contacting the Old Man?
0DI1001766	You... don't play it. If you do, I'll find a way to get out of the cage, end you. I'll murder you, crush your arms and legs until...
0DI1001767	They all wanted their freedom at first. Then... they realized they could get inside the Sierra Madre.
0DI1001768	After that, their freedom wasn't important any more. They couldn't let go, just like the Old Man. So you say you want your freedom...
0DI1001769	No... even if you feel that way, it won't last. You'll forget, get greed-blind, and you'll turn.
0DI1001770	No... I don't trust you. Even if you're not working with him, you'll fall into the same trap he did.
0DI1001771	You may think you can take your revenge... that'll change. You'll start thinking there's a way to have it all.
0DI1001772	No! No, no, don't! I'll make you suffer for this, I promise you.
0DI1001773	Although it may not matter... I suspect the Sierra Madre will be reward enough for ones like you.
0DI1001774	No, you wouldn't. If you did, you won't escape this place alive. I'd shatter every one of your limbs to splinters and leave you here.
0DI1001775	You think I'm afraid of your collar exploding, killing us? No, I'll leave you breathing, then keep walking until my collar goes cold.
0DI1001776	I'll prop your broken body in view of the Sierra Madre so you can see what you came to steal... forever out of reach as you die.
0DI1001777	Hnh. No... no, you're not. Even though Dog's more docile... easier to control.
0DI1001778	You may regret this. This place... this place is where creatures like Dog can survive. The people that fill its streets...
0DI1001779	He is as vicious, more vicious than them. His hunger can help you more than I can. When I am in control... this shell is difficult to... fight in.
0DI1001780	[SUCCEEDED] Very good. Yes... it's another layer of white noise to ensure privacy. Unfortunately, it's also acted as a dinner bell for the residents.
0DI1001781	As long as the holographic greeter outside is active, however, I can get by them... the Holograms fascinate them. Ghost-worship, perhaps.
0DI1001782	[FAILED] Yes... interesting that. More like a dinner bell to some.
0DI1001783	Prove it... how? Words are worthless.
0DI1001784	Uh-huh. Master ordered it. "Take places." Then... Master went away. Left Dog... Dog in cage.
0DI1001785	Casino open long time ago, not sure when... voice keeps putting Dog in cage. Haven't seen Master since, only hear voice on your arm and from walls.
0DI1001786	I am not sure you belong here. No, you don't belong here.
0DI1001787	Yet... you came this far. And I'm not interested in remaining here any longer. I'll unlock the cage.
0DI1001788	And so... greed, practical or otherwise, has its day.
0DI1001789	The... inhabitants of the Villa. They are difficult to kill. They need to be chopped apart, hacked on the ground... disintegrated, if you can.
0DI1001790	They are difficult to kill... but not to devour. And Dog is always hungry.
0DI1001791	If he is with you, when they fall, he will fall on them, end them. If I am with you... fighting will be far more difficult.
0DI1001795	Dog is afraid of me as long as the Master isn't around.
0DI1001796	[SUCCEEDED] The "Master" - Elijah... reminds Dog of someone from long ago. His leader, commander. Commanders.
0DI1001797	The Master was a strong personality... personalities as well. Dog is slavish, was conditioned to serve the Master until death.
0DI1001798	The Old Man... Elijah merely came along and opened that door in Dog's mind. Now Dog does whatever the Old Man wants.
0DI1001799	[FAILED] Habit. Conditioning. It doesn't matter.
0DI1001800	Mad? Mad doesn't even begin to describe... there's not a word for the hate I feel inside. It's consuming... twists every thought to red.
0DI1001801	After all that's laid ruin to the world... again and again, I thought at last, we could be free... thought Dog could be free.
0DI1001802	No... no, the world's always got another cage, waiting, keeping everything you want... just out of reach.
0DI1001803	Gather others, drag them here... fetch, like an animal... and hurt them if they resist.
0DI1001804	Dog doesn't even blink, even hear their cries when he's twisted their arms full circle... fragile things, screaming on the ground...
0DI1001805	To listen to him... commanding Dog... to hurt others... and Dog just nods, eager and willing to serve.
0DI1001806	Do anything? Me... me, Dog puts in the cage, hurts himself to try and drown out my voice, when all I want to do...
0DI1001807	...aah... hrrr, never mind, useless. Finally had to start fighting back, screaming on my own. Had to take matters into my own hands, lock Dog up.
0DI1001808	[SUCCEEDED] I've watched over Dog for so long. Tried to stop him from... hurting others, killing others, quiet that mindless howling instinct of his.
0DI1001809	He doesn't understand, he has the brain of a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
0DI1001810	[FAILED] No... because all I need to do is bide my time. I'll settle this... myself, as I always planned.
0DI1001811	He's my brother - kin. Without him, I wouldn't exist. Maybe I was nothing more than his conscience, trying to rein him in. Useless.
0DI1001812	I... I just need him to show restraint, let go of the needs, the hungers. Ease the burden... just once, so I can have my thoughts to myself.
0DI1001813	The instinct is stronger than me. Dog is stronger than me. He's just a child... he knows when he does wrong, he just can't help himself.
0DI1001814	I don't know when I first spoke, or when I first started thinking for myself, it was so long ago. I... slept for a long time... before...
0DI1001815	...I want to believe I was the one in control. Once. I don't know anymore. Then Dog got a new Master. A new voice. And I woke up, to protect him.
0DI1001821	Ask him. Or better, don't. It wouldn't be an interesting conversation, much like this one.
0DI1001822	He did, yes. A team did, with collars linked just like yours. Did he tell you everything, or just about the pretty lights?
0DI1001823	There was more. Only he truly recalls, though... and should. I won't spoil it for you, especially when we have more... pressing matters.
0DI1001824	Very good. As for the casino... yes, it did.
0DI1001825	Because something got left inside. The Old Man... Elijah.
0DI1001826	He's trapped in there. As I hoped he would be.
0DI1001827	Because he couldn't. As soon as he made his way into the casino, it sealed up...
0DI1001828	...and the casino's construction allowed me an opportunity to escape. The collars... unhooked. I... was free.
0DI1001829	No... I saw to that...
0DI1001830	It should have... the casino's construction is unusual. Signals in there get... scrambled, some alloy in the architecture... I don't know.
0DI1001831	I wasn't sure until the collars de-activated that I had won. Trapped him in his cage. Dog... I... could be free.
0DI1001832	Dog happened. When the collars came off... he got... hungry. And all my work, all my effort... wasted because of his hunger, his greed.
0DI1001833	Ask Dog. It doesn't matter... it's in the past, as much as I try to forget it, it's always... with us.
0DI1001834	[SUCCEEDED] Interesting... so it seems you have another link we don't. And... you're to blame for this.
0DI1001835	Yes... he wears a Pip-Boy on his wrist, just as you do. If he's feeding commands and signals, then I would be careful.
0DI1001836	He's most likely installed a contingency switch in the Pip-Boy. If the signal gets cut off, or you try and remove it... well, then we'll all die.
0DI1001837	[FAILED] That I don't know. The collars came back to life... I'm not sure how.
0DI1001838	I felt it when you woke me up... that kicking in my gut, the collar was coiled with a charge again, like a snake.
0DI1001839	Really. As much hatred as I hold for him, he is much, much smarter than many I've met... no offense meant, of course.
0DI1001840	He seems to not only understand the workings of Pre-War tech, he seems to breathe it. And... these collars, commandeering your Pip-Boy...
0DI1001841	Are the marks of someone who makes mistakes - but he's not leaving much to chance when it comes to ensuring our compliance.
0DI1001842	No... this time is different. The key is different.
0DI1001843	Maybe it's familiar, comfortable. Practice makes perfect.
0DI1001844	And as much as it bruises my ego, some things require... brute strength. In the right combination.
0DI1001845	Besides, none of your assembled band of thieves look able to rip a 200 year rusted power switch down like a machete to fire up an entire town.
0DI1001846	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... Hrrr... That's the easy explanation, the one humans use. Pre-War technology, as if it's the cause of all ills, mind and body.
0DI1001849	I do. And after you threw me in the cage at the Police Station, I have no intention of telling you.
0DI1001850	I do... the diagram there tells me what I need to know.
0DI1001851	This Villa was built to decay, but parts... parts were well-defended, indeed. There was a method in the layout, you can... see it.
0DI1001852	The terminal outside... one of those means this place was designed... properly. No, if locked, it could hold others out... and even Dog inside.
0DI1001853	You're right... but trust? Trust is such a... harsh word. I prefer... mutual need. It's more honest.
0DI1001854	No, I can help you. These wiring diagrams... I know how to operate the switches in sequence to make fire appear in the sky.
0DI1001855	I... we just need to make sure that Dog doesn't surface before that happens. To do that... he'll need to be fed. That makes him stay in the Cage.
0DI1001856	Dog has torn apart a number of the inhabitants of this town... while he doesn't prefer them to... other flesh... it'll do for the time being.
0DI1001857	Find some of the inhabitants... it'll require some hunting on your part. Kill them, take some of the remains inside them, bring it back here.
0DI1001858	They're not easy to kill. But... I have faith in you, and the beast must be fed if you want him to stay in this cage.
0DI1001859	No, you'll throw me in the cage when you need to, just like at the Police Station. Trust you? No... you've made trust... difficult.
0DI1001860	I'm not staying here and doing what you "order" me to do. Not again... and the sequence here? Just see if Dog can figure it out on his own.
0DI1001861	All right... for a moment there, I thought... hnh. I'll wait here then, come back when you've found meat from two of the bodies.
0DI1001862	Two chunks of meat from their bodies should be enough. Hunt... quietly, so as not to draw more here.
0DI1001863	If you don't... then I can't guarantee I'll remain in control long enough to help you. It is... your choice.
0DI1001867	Really. And why is that? Dog is much more... docile. Obedient.
0DI1001868	So you want me to listen. To obey. No... I can't. Because Dog wouldn't let me. I can already feel him clawing at me.
0DI1001869	If you want me to remain, then I'll need to stay aware... enough to operate the switches properly.
0DI1001871	And what would that gain you? Are you so eager to slice off your hand to spite your arm?
0DI1001872	Pretty circle on machine, all glowing.
0DI1001873	Those machines feed on Sierra Madre Chips. There's codes that unlock other things, too.
0DI1001882	Feel strange, like... sleeping. On my neck, is this... a chain? I... what's carved on my chest?
0DI1001895	Good, well done... now, for the festivities, and your parts in all this.
0DI1001896	The owner of the Sierra Madre... for whatever reason... keyed the Grand Opening to the Gala Event itself.
0DI1001897	It needs to be fired off in order for the casino doors to open. As I've discovered, one person can't do it.
0DI1001898	So, get your team in position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
0DI1001899	You're so close now, don't let me down. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on the next team.
0DI1001900	This gate to the Sierra Madre's sealed, locked. For now. Do as I say, and it won't be locked for much longer.
0DI1001901	Damn speakers at end of hall - red light means they're shielded. Must be a way to shut them off somewhere else.
0DI1001902	Outside, you may notice your vision'll pulse, get dizzy. It's the Cloud. Eats your insides, slowly. Too much exposure, death.
0DI1001903	Get the mute down the elevator and into the Manual Override Chamber.
0DI1001904	I can hear the event firing off. Now get to the main gate of the Sierra Madre, quickly.
0DI1001905	Get there soon or the doors will seal, and you'll be trapped outside.
0DI1001907	You're at the Ghoul's Gala area... now, make him stay.
0DI1001908	You're at one of the Gala locations, you'll need to bring the mutant here. Only he has the strength to operate the levers, I've found.
0DI1001909	The bell tower. That's where you'll trigger the Gala Event. It's a ways up. I'm sure you'll find a way to climb up there.
0DI1001910	And once you get near the top... look for a ladder. It's easy to miss.
0DI1001912	Watch out for the Villa inhabitants, they're... difficult to kill unless you chop them apart... if you can, blow them up or disintegrate them.
0DI1001913	Picking up an emitter signature - watch for security Holograms, dangerous. Don't shoot them - attacking them is useless.
0DI1001914	Villa's comm speakers have aged poorly, like the Madre. Pre-War junk. The speakers emit a signal that'll set off your collar if you stay too long.
0DI1001915	There are damaged speakers, and shielded ones... the damaged ones you can destroy at range - don't get close, you can't switch them off like a radio.
0DI1001916	That's the way out - after you break into the Sierra Madre's vault. Try to leave, I'll set off your collar.
0DI1001917	Don't go through the gate to Puesta del Sol yet - gather the others first.
0DI1001918	Picking up signals near your location. Detonators. Watch for traps.
0DI1001919	Leave the Salida del Sol gate alone. You're not done with the Villa yet, so don't stray.
0DI1001920	There - the Switching Station. That's where you'll need to bring the mute.
0DI1001921	You've gotten one of the floors re-established, good... accessing the music archives now. Two more to go.
0DI1001922	Oh... it seems the casino has uninvited guests... the Villa inhabitants were pounding at the doors - now they've found a way inside.
0DI1001923	Deal with them - and don't try and leave yourself, or I'll let the collar do its work.
0DI1001926	Another fragment... good. Almost have the entirety of what I need from the music archives.
0DI1001927	Once you have the last fragment, you can thread the archives together at the main floor terminal.
0DI1001929	You have the last fragment, that is all I need. Now...
0DI1001930	Go to the main lobby terminal, thread the music sequence together.
0DI1001931	Now... back to the Suites. And we'll sing the lock open.
0DI1001932	Ghosts... they fill the Villa. More in the Casino... much more.
0DI1001933	They carry out the functions the dead once did. They cannot be harmed... they only perform the same rote tasks until their power dies.
0DI1001934	They are of no consequence - except for the Security Holograms, the ones with the silhouettes of the armored Sierra Madre guards.
0DI1001935	Most Holograms perform specific functions. The Security Holograms, ever since the bombs fell, now perform their function.
0DI1001936	They will kill anyone they detect. They are immune to guns, weapons, EMPs... even energy weapons. Still, they have limitations.
0DI1001937	Their design limits their field of view, enough to avoid detection.
0DI1001938	Each has an emitter - destroy or disable it, and they cease to be a threat.
0DI1001939	Still... at least they still work as intended. Other technology here is more of a threat to you... notably, the Villa's radios and speakers.
0DI1001940	Someone who followed the call of the Sierra Madre, just as you did. Now that I've found it's more than a story... I intend to take what's inside.
0DI1001941	Maybe that's why you came. Why you followed the Pip-Boy here... and straight into one of my traps. Now, this is your reward.
0DI1001942	Confused? Don't be. I'm commandeering the hologram technology of the Villa.
0DI1001943	Numbers, equations, circuits... all can be controlled, provided there's a connection, and the knowledge to use it.
0DI1001944	This Villa, the casino... a treasure trove of such devices. The Holograms included.
0DI1001945	One is a trusted ally... obedient, collar or no, although the collar helps. The other two... well, we'll have to see what the traps caught.
0DI1001946	The Cloud is what blankets the sky here... you may smell it in the air, copper and sulfur... burns the lungs and seeps into the skin.
0DI1001947	As for its origins... I am not certain. Pre-War industrial pollutants... something in the Sierra Madre structure...
0DI1001948	It is unique across the wasteland... and deadly. It has kept this place preserved since the Great War.
0DI1001949	Assembly stations. Schematics are stored within... dispensers with unlock codes.
0DI1001950	They use the Chips scattered around as batteries... alloys and raw material embedded in the shell.
0DI1001951	They resemble the vending machines of the Mojave, but they are crafting devices of tremendous versatility. Once an Old World convenience, now...
0DI1001952	...now, they are a means of survival. Use the Chips to power them. Select from the holographic display, the device will assemble it.
0DI1001953	I've unlocked the West and East gates to Puesta del Sol and Salida del Sol...
0DI1001954	...now that you've survived the Villa, I need to get to my position, you don't need me to hold your hand anymore.
0DI1001955	I'll keep monitoring you via the transceivers through the Villa... if I need to offer guidance, I will.
0DI1001956	A display of lights, fireworks... music in the streets, a Pre-War festival to mark the casino's opening. The bombs struck first.
0DI1001957	It is of no consequence, only firing the event is - get the three in position, then travel to your position in Salida del Sol and trigger the Gala.
0DI1001958	After that, the real work begins.
0DI1001959	That is for me to know. You get that far... you'll see for yourself.
0DI1001960	I do not know. A Pre-War icon, perhaps. It is of no consequence aside from being a circuit I can utilize.
0DI1001961	Hmm! Get here? You walked into one of my traps in the Mojave... following the Sierra Madre signal. Now, you're here, with that collar on your neck.
0DI1001962	When you came into the bunker, you saw a victim, their head blown off for disobedience.
0DI1001963	The city is filled with other stories, many such stories. Is "no" your choice?
0DI1001964	I'd suggest taking the FEV reject to his position first... although you may need his brutality and strength elsewhere first.
0DI1001965	As easy as the Villa was to navigate... the outlying areas of the Villa are far more dangerous, thicker with the Ghost People, traps, and toxins.
0DI1001966	Use your team as I use you... listen to your collar, watch where you step. You're no use to me dead.
0DI1001967	Perhaps you think this is a simple robbery. A cheap casino heist.
0DI1001968	No... this is a heist of the centuries. We're not plundering the Sierra Madre - we're plundering history, taking from the Old World itself.
0DI1001969	It won't let its secrets go easily... not without a fight. I wouldn't expect anything less.
0DI1001970	It's like that Pip-Boy on your wrist, except filled with explosives. A little radio of the Old World, just needed some tuning.
0DI1001971	Do what I say, and the collar won't go off... refuse, try and run, disobey me? I'll kill you and find someone else.
0DI1001972	There's no escape from here until I let you go. The sooner you accept your situation, the better.
0DI1001973	That structure you see above the Fountain - the Sierra Madre Casino... you need to break inside. A... heist. Too many years in the making.
0DI1001974	But to get inside, avoid its traps... you'll need to gather the team. As I've found, one cannot do it alone.
0DI1001975	Around the Villa are three other collars like yours - Collar 8, 12, and 14. Find all three and get them here, to the Fountain. Then, we'll talk more.
0DI1001976	And should you get any ideas about killing each other and taking the treasure of the Sierra Madre for yourself - a warning.
0DI1001977	All your collars are linked... one of you dies, you all die. If that's what it takes to make you cooperate, so be it.
0DI1001980	Then you are of no use to me.
0DI1001981	Anywhere sheltered from the Cloud... inside buildings, tunnels... any place not exposed to the outside air.
0DI1001982	Anything the Cloud has touched has preserved it one way or another... but only the Holograms in the Villa truly remain.
0DI1001983	Unfamiliar with the legend of the Sierra Madre? The casino exists. You are one of the few who look upon it.
0DI1001984	Where you're standing is the Villa beneath the casino above. The wreckage... the Villa... lies in the shadow.
0DI1001985	The Villa is a dumping ground of failed construction... Pre-War junk that has aged poorly.
0DI1001986	I brought you here. There are mechanisms in place once the traps across the Mojave are sprung.
0DI1001987	For now, your sole focus should be the Sierra Madre, and how to get inside. Until then, you won't leave alive.
0DI1001988	Yes... the inhabitants... avoid them if you can, they are difficult to kill.
0DI1001989	Whatever has created them, bullets, explosions, energy... it can make them inert for a time, then they seem to crawl back up, restored.
0DI1001990	Perhaps it's the Cloud... perhaps something in their physiology.
0DI1001991	It is the Cloud covering the Villa. The longer you are outside, the more its toxins seep into your system... through the lungs and the skin.
0DI1001992	It will eat at you the longer you are outside... so wherever you go, move fast, or you'll soon find yourself too weak to move.
0DI1001993	It is the Cloud that surrounds the Villa. It shouldn't prove lethal in the time you are here... prolonged exposure would be hazardous, however.
0DI1001994	Fall asleep... and you will not wake up.
0DI1001995	The Sierra Madre has many... defenses, means of screening guests for illicit or dangerous items. Your arrival here, weaponless, was not my intention.
0DI1001996	The Casino, this Villa... it takes anything with even a trace of radioactivity, traces of unknown substances... and returns it home. The bunker.
0DI1001997	The process is automated, and the casino itself has other, similar "services." I was unable to find a workaround, except to send others in as tools.
0DI1001998	No... while it will erode your health, it will only bring you to the point of death, no farther. At that point...
0DI1001999	The air here is lethal only if you enter concentrated pockets of the Cloud. Too long inside one, you'll die, so be careful where you step.
0DI1002000	I've seen some survive concentration of the Cloud for short periods of time if healthy enough - others were too weak.
0DI1002001	Rebreathers, chemical suits... there is no protection against it, it decays all it touches. I've found fighting it useless.
0DI1002002	Yes, music was intended to be broadcast all over the Villa... over time, however, the radio signal has decayed and emits a different frequency.
0DI1002003	Speakers and radios interfere with the bomb collar frequency, and can trigger the detonators... prematurely.
0DI1002004	It is an unfortunate side effect, one I did not anticipate. I was unable to calibrate the collars to block the signals - so you'll have to make do.
0DI1002005	Everyone asks that. Should be asking how they plan on leaving.
0DI1002006	It only takes putting a collar on one to begin the chain. One with a collar may chain another. And that one, another. Had traps all over the wastes.
0DI1002007	The chain ends with the super mutant. Although with him... the collar wasn't even necessary. He only needed... guidance.
0DI1002008	Gather the three others needed for this job, return them here. After that, I'll have more instructions for you.
0DI1002009	Take the others to their positions to trigger the Gala Event. After that, the doors of the Sierra Madre should open.
0DI1002010	Yes. But not immediately. You'll hear a beep from your collar's detonator - when you do, step back, scan the area, and find the signal source.
0DI1002012	The damaged speakers are sparking, ha... hard to miss. The casings are resistant to vandalism - punching or hitting them will not destroy them.
0DI1002013	Travel West, toward the Villa Police Station - follow the radio frequency and the alarms.
0DI1002014	Although there's a great deal of interference at the source. Perhaps that's why I lost contact with him.
0DI1002015	No matter, aside from Collar 8, there should be weapons, armor at the police station. Go West, avoid the Villa inhabitants, bring the mutant back.
0DI1002016	Gunshots, energy blasts - even spears thrown with great force - can puncture their exterior.
0DI1002017	Shielded speakers can't be destroyed at all. You'll need to avoid them or switch them off via a terminal. I... I'll leave the method up to you.
0DI1002018	Your piece of RobCo trash will help you, I've ensured it. It can latch on to the signal of the collars...
0DI1002019	...and tune into their frequencies. The bomb collars come with radios embedded in them. You can eavesdrop easily.
0DI1002020	It was part of their design... to listen in. They can even screen out white noise from the environment to allow greater monitoring.
0DI1002021	Yes... Collar 8, the FEV reject, the Super Mutant. He's docile, predictable, and provided he's not starving, should be easy to command.
0DI1002022	I lost contact with him some time ago... probably after he dragged you here from the trap. Find him, he'll follow you, collar or no.
0DI1002023	A long story. FEV... a virus with an even longer story... it gave birth to the docile one, turned him into a Super Mutant long ago.
0DI1002024	Because in some respects, breaking in to the Sierra Madre is easier than breaking human instinct. Greed.
0DI1002025	The Villa is filled with corpses. Some killed by the dangers here, some by me. Others... turned on each other.
0DI1002026	Once they realized the Sierra Madre could be theirs, they cared nothing for their freedom... their survival... or each other.
0DI1002027	The ones brought here live on only in what they've left behind, their marks - graffiti on the walls. And victims they've killed.
0DI1002028	Some tried to help... left supplies and healing for others who came. Their reward? They were tracked down, killed by others with baser instincts.
0DI1002029	Some of these murderers went as far as to leave traps behind them... turning markers for help into deathtraps for anyone following them.
0DI1002030	It killed some of them when they forgot where the traps lay... or when they desperately needed the assistance they had cut others off from.
0DI1002031	Too many. This place is dangerous... and its quarantine measures, its hazards... have claimed many. Failures upon failures.
0DI1002032	Do you think I wanted to place collars on you to ensure compliance? No... if robots could have done this, I would've sent them.
0DI1002033	The Sierra Madre is a complicated lock. Cracking it open requires human hands.
0DI1002037	Still... I have not left you defenseless, and the Sierra Madre's security in some respects, can help you if you are resourceful enough.
0DI1002038	This place is well-preserved. Few who came here ever returned. All of the treasures of the Old World lie scattered about, virtually untouched.
0DI1002039	Search, hunt... craft what you can from what you find. The trash of the Pre-War era can keep you alive - food, knives, more. Use them.
0DI1002040	Even the Villa's toxins... and the residue it leaves behind... can be shaped into tools and weapons. Gather it as well.
0DI1002041	Also... there is one more thing in your possession, a rifle that will keep you alive, as surely as the collar will.
0DI1002042	It is a Holorifle, a weapon I constructed when I arrived... I have since made superior models - and modifications.
0DI1002043	For now, that tool will have to do until you find other weapons... and I suggest you do, the Holorifle's ammo is limited.
0DI1002044	Still, it should serve well enough. I fashioned it from the Holograms of the Villa and used it against the Villa's... living inhabitants.
0DI1002045	The collars. They're Pre-War tech, I suspect this great land had... compliance issues before the war.
0DI1002046	It's one of a series of models. The one on your neck? Special, easier to make adjustments. Unreliable in other ways, notably radio interference.
0DI1002047	A place far from here, called the Big Empty. Almost didn't make it out.
0DI1002048	Were two others there... a woman. And a man, a courier. The woman was familiar... the other... I don't know what happened to him.
0DI1002049	Big Empty's a treasure box, a scientific graveyard of Old World misery. Like the Sierra Madre... there's treasures there, sleeping. Some, awake.
0DI1002050	The Holorifle, the Saturnite alloy... the hologram technology, hibernation chambers, Securitrons, the collars...
0DI1002051	...even the suits attached to those things stalking the Villa... that's only the surface of what's there. Right now, the Sierra Madre is what I want.
0DI1002052	What do I want. Weapons. Security. A citadel of my own.
0DI1002053	The Madre's all these things. It's a fortress and a weapon. A chance... to... "begin again."
0DI1002054	Once I unlock its archives, I can carve the Mojave into any shape I choose.
0DI1002055	The Cloud is unique in my travels. Its proximity to the Sierra Madre isn't a coincidence.
0DI1002056	Right now it protects this casino, preserves it. It can be used to preserve other Old World relics - and cleanse them, at the same time.
0DI1002057	And as much as I've researched hologram technology, the Big Empty facility was clear - only the Sierra Madre got Holograms working... properly.
0DI1002058	The Holograms here kill trespassers. That's what I want. Dump one of those emitters in the middle of any battle, there's no defense.
0DI1002059	It's like holding light in your hands. Can't fight it... only watch it burn. Just one is a portable army. Arm it - anyone stands against you, dies.
0DI1002060	No, there is one last thing I want from the Sierra Madre. Its bounty. The machines that fill its streets, its corridors.
0DI1002061	They provide, provide almost anything. Perhaps in the Pre-War era, they were commonplace, things to dismiss.
0DI1002062	Now, they are far more valuable. You know it. They helped keep you alive.
0DI1002063	Veronica... she... survived HELIOS. She would. Resourceful.
0DI1002064	As for "losing" HELIOS One... that was the only outcome, aside from retreat. NCR, swarming like ants over Old World relics... Hoover Dam... HELIOS...
0DI1002065	I won't let those... children seize anything else. Hardin... McNamara... can't stop them... won't. So I will, with the Old World as my weapons.
0DI1002066	Sources of food, supplies... medical assistance, ammo... make more collars, even print currency. Make a nation.
0DI1002067	The Cloud allows me to wipe the slate clean. Collars ensure cooperation. Holograms - defense. The Vending Machines provide... everything else.
0DI1002068	The Sierra Madre can kill nations and build them, using its technology with the right applications.
0DI1002069	Attack? No, not attack them. Wipe the slate clean. Make the Mojave like it was meant to be... undisturbed by man.
0DI1002070	I'll send the Cloud, the Holograms. Bring ruin in my hands until only I stand atop the HELIOS One tower again.
0DI1002071	I'll scour Hoover Dam with the Cloud, rain its walls with spears from the sun... with an army of Old World ghosts behind me, Holograms all.
0DI1002072	I'll kill them until it's only me, me alone... in a quiet world. In a world that's nothing like what happened at HELIOS One.
0DI1002073	I've read your Pip-Boy. Seen what you've done...
0DI1002074	If you wish to end them... I could use someone like you. Resourceful. Uncompromising. NCR has many soldiers... many citizens.
0DI1002075	I know that. Their days were numbered since they occupied Hoover Dam.
0DI1002076	Hnh. Perhaps... perhaps I was too quick to put a collar on a potential ally.
0DI1002077	Very well. I'll come down... and show you what the Sierra Madre has in store.
0DI1002078	It started with... a setback. Fires, blood, beneath the sun... a sun so close you could touch it.
0DI1002079	Moments like that, however, failures... can provide the brightest clarity.
0DI1002080	You think I'm a murderer. If I was, I'd have set off your collar long ago... the collar ensures compliance, encourages... cooperation.
0DI1002081	Think about it. Would you truly have gotten into the casino without those collars? No, human nature is against us, always.
0DI1002082	Did you know... did you know that I had to keep adjusting the collars, keep changing the rules to make this moment possible?
0DI1002083	Every time, even with collars clutched at their necks... they would betray each other, kill each other, to get inside the Sierra Madre.
0DI1002084	It... it was insanity. They could've had it all, it was so close. And... and they kept turning on each other, again and again.
0DI1002085	Cracking the Sierra Madre was difficult... but cracking greed, that was more difficult. So the dead man's switches went in.
0DI1002086	When your life is tied to another's, sacrifice and cooperation - they can be conditioned, learned, and you can focus on the matter at hand.
0DI1002087	Greed can be beaten. Contained. Controlled. You know it better than anyone... or I hope you do. It doesn't matter.
0DI1002088	No. I am not going to take the chance while I'm so close... not this close, no. Not again... I can wait... afford to be careful.
0DI1002089	You... you're locked down there. This is the only entrance, and I have free rein of the Sierra Madre. I have time... more than you.
0DI1002090	Besides, there might be more traps. I'll send more scouts in... yes, others. You're... resourceful, don't want to leave anything more to chance.
0DI1002094	The mutant. Heh! He swallowed one of the collars... after that, he was mine. The collar wasn't even necessary.
0DI1002095	All his kind, they exist to be given orders. They're soldiers - simple, stupid. I ask him to fetch, he did... even without the threat of death.
0DI1002096	Even when I stopped speaking to him, he continued to leave the Villa, gather victims from the mantraps, out of habit.
0DI1002097	He must have found you in one of them. If so, he's probably forgotten - he only remembers my voice.
0DI1002098	He put the collar on you, dragged you here, because he doesn't know any better. It's in his nature, greedy and child-like.
0DI1002099	"Dog?" Hnh. Appropriate. It's what I called him. You've met him. You know why he forgot - his brain was ruined by FEV, his memory, wreckage.
0DI1002100	He may know the way back, somewhere, deep down. I doubt it. He tracks by smell and instinct. Still, he could be trained.
0DI1002101	It lies in the bunker - or whatever mantrap caught you. It's the Sierra Madre, its security systems strip guests to their garments.
0DI1002102	It has... prejudices against outside material, "contraband." Almost anything with a radiation signature.
0DI1002103	The New Vegas casinos do the same thing, manually. Although preventing bloodshed, not radiation poisoning, is their main concern.
0DI1002104	Of course. I walked all this way. If you're worried... I'll give you a map back - or show you the way out when this is all over.
0DI1002105	The Villa did, as an extension of the casino, yes - and then sent it back to the owner's residence. Here, "begin again" is more than a slogan.
0DI1002106	You think I wanted to send you here without weapons, healing? No, the Sierra Madre lays you bare, strips and stores all your worldly possessions...
0DI1002107	...it's automated to move things as the builder saw fit, Sinclair - even the guests. It's what divided your team, me, assigned us to "our floors."
0DI1002108	No contraband, nothing foreign in his paradise - even common Pre-War vending machines were banned from the Villa.
0DI1002109	No... I don't think so. It'd most likely trigger other security measures... if you hurt the Vault at all.
0DI1002110	The builder of the casino built it to last - the Sierra Madre withstood the war. I'm sure the Vault is protected as well.
0DI1002111	Besides, you wouldn't have followed the signal if you didn't want this place's secrets for your own. You're curious... past the threats.
0DI1002112	Then all you need to do is wait, be patient. Hnh... you may be down there for a while. Just as I was, trapped inside the casino.
0DI1002113	Consider this punishment for following the Sierra Madre signal in the first place. So eager to rush ahead... now, enjoy your reward.
0DI1002114	You've gotten far. Any farther, try to breach the vault, you'll become a corpse.
0DI1002115	What's inside is mine. Anyone else touches it... tries to take it from me... they'll answer for it.
0DI1002116	[SUCCEEDED] The collar? Even if you could trigger it... no, you'd die.
0DI1002117	[FAILED] Really? No, I don't think so. I can afford to wait, and your threats... meaningless.
0DI1002118	Kill yourself, and you decide this now. I can shut down your signal, prevent the collar from going off.
0DI1002119	[SUCCEEDED] Huh... clever.
0DI1002121	[SUCCEEDED] The elevator. Then you'd be trapped for certain, no probability of escape.
0DI1002122	[FAILED] The vault would be as shielded against vandalism just as the casino itself was. No... any damage you could cause would be minimal.
0DI1002123	[SUCCEEDED] You might destroy access to the data... not the data itself. Besides, there would be safeguards in place.
0DI1002124	[FAILED] There's nothing you can do that I cannot undo... or recover. And I have the time now, thanks to you.
0DI1002125	But, you recognize the value of what's down there. You would no sooner destroy what's inside the Sierra Madre than destroy yourself.
0DI1002126	Persist in threatening me... or the Sierra Madre's secrets, you're of no use to me, I'll set off your collar now.
0DI1002128	[FAILED] Quite certain. How you managed to come all this way amazes me - perhaps it was luck.
0DI1002130	[FAILED] Indeed... and how would I reach you, let alone speak to you. Perhaps you're not as resourceful as I suspected.
0DI1002131	Even... even if you damaged the mechanism... there's a chance of repairing it. It might take years... but it's possible.
0DI1002132	[SUCCEEDED] I've lost much in the past by... falling to my instincts. This time... this time will be different.
0DI1002133	[FAILED] Silence and patience will convince me. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
0DI1002134	[SUCCEEDED] That signal... that siren's call... lured me in, yes. And being trapped in the Sierra Madre, perhaps forever...
0DI1002135	That has made me more - cautious. I have my freedom, access to the bottom of the casino, and you, under my control. Heh... I can wait.
0DI1002136	[FAILED] If you want to appease me, then do so in silence. I'll come for you, in time. Irritate me, and I'll silence you forever.
0DI1002137	True... the collars... have worked better than I'd hoped. With adjustments.
0DI1002138	Still... I'm not eager to leap into another trap - the Sierra Madre's or yours. This experience has taught me human nature is... unreliable.
0DI1002139	You say your freedom is important to you - so did the others that fill the Villa, before they turned on each other.
0DI1002140	[SUCCEEDED] Hnh. The collars... yes. Technology solves so many ills.
0DI1002141	[FAILED] Enough talking, save your energy. You'll be down there for a while.
0DI1002142	[SUCCEEDED] I... I have earned it, fought for it. Paid for it in blood, mine, others - countless times.
0DI1002143	[FAILED] Let you go? To crawl back to whatever caravan whore spawned you? No, she was perhaps more talented in deals than you.
0DI1002144	If you seek to goad me... impatience and greed led you here, not me, it doesn't control me as it does you.
0DI1002145	I won't fall prey to another trap - either the Sierra Madre, or yours. There is no trust between us, and there will be no trades, either.
0DI1002146	[SUCCEEDED] This casino isn't some caravan safe. And the lock that secures the Sierra Madre vault doesn't hold all its secrets.
0DI1002147	[FAILED] Take all the time you need. I suspect the Sierra Madre is more than proof against bobby pins and crowbars.
0DI1002148	[SUCCEEDED] Hiding in the Sierra Madre... an interesting thought. I'd come to see it more as a prison.
0DI1002149	Hide, flee... it doesn't matter. The Sierra Madre is patient. I can be as well. You won't get any farther inside, and you won't escape my sight.
0DI1002150	[FAILED] As long as you're wearing that collar, you're not far from me. A press of a button, and I'll find you - I'll just listen for the explosion.
0DI1002151	Find a way inside - you can try. The Sierra Madre is a patient thing, and it has outlasted many who've come to its doors.
0DI1002152	The punishment often equals the reward for those without the foresight to see what's in store. I'll let you test the security, see how you stand up.
0DI1002153	[SUCCEEDED] I've had enough... enough of others stealing from me.
0DI1002157	Hmm... compliance. Good. The others... fought, argued. If they had only obeyed...
0DI1002158	I see the collar has done its work, I can hear it in your voice. Stand and wait outside the Vault, where I can see you from the elevator.
0DI1002159	After that... I wandered, alone. Saw the storms of the Divide, walked among the Ciphers of the West. Traveled to the Big Empty.
0DI1002160	I heard the signal. The woman's voice, the Sierra Madre, promising a chance to begin again, reverse my fortunes. All... nonsense.
0DI1002161	I tracked the signal. Came here, scouted the city... using other hands. Kept dying on me, killing each other. You - you got the farthest of all.
0DI1002162	Are you listening? Good. From now on, when I talk, listen - and follow my instructions.
0DI1002163	Play stupid, play clever, make the mistake of saying "no?" That collar on your neck'll go off and take your head with it.
0DI1002164	Hurry up and deal with the FEV reject, he's of no use to us.
0DI1002165	Must be a back entrance to the kitchen - check the main casino side corridors. Find it.
0DI1002166	Now get out, before your collar blows!
0DI1002167	That idiot's opened the gas valves! A single spark - or he sets off his collar, the casino's going to burn. Us along with him.
0DI1002168	Shut off the gas valves, or that idiot'll kill us all.
0DI1002169	Don't let him spot you! If he does, talk him down before he has a chance to ignite the gas.
0DI1002170	This is the past you're walking through. Few have ever seen it. No one else ever will.
0DI1002171	I worked hard to get here, it'll give me what I need before I leave. And it'll always welcome me back.
0DI1002172	Now... look for a way to wake this ghost up, remind it it's got guests.
0DI1002174	You woke it up... good. Emitter frequencies... lighting up everywhere...
0DI1002175	Damn recordings... dead echoes in the frequencies...
0DI1002176	Casino's security is shutting down... opening up its vendor and gambling programs in the back casino... Heh! Still might be something for sale.
0DI1002177	Maybe something can help you now - security's shut down. After you're done looking around, head to the lobby, and we'll deal with your... friends.
0DI1002178	You inside. Can you hear me? Power's fluctuating... emergency power. Oh! You are in.
0DI1002179	Good... thought that might be the end of you. Unfortunately, your... "friends" also found their way here. Knocked unconscious... just like you.
0DI1002180	Wondering what happened? You were hit by casino security. Detects anything foreign - radioactive, it subdues the "visitor," moves them if needed.
0DI1002181	Hnh... getting interference from old recordings... the guests who were trapped here... eh, shut that noise off...
0DI1002182	Looks like the casino moved your "friends" around once inside... might be useful. Or not. Wonder if they came to help or kill you. Still...
0DI1002183	My signal should work through the speakers, now that you're inside. Heh, heh! Welcome to the Sierra Madre, in all its glory.
0DI1002184	This is what the Old World stood for, even with bombs about to rain down on them. Now look at it.
0DI1002185	Beautiful... now its guests are all dead. Better this way. Quiet. How the Mojave should be.
0DI1002186	Now - with the casino sleeping, it's got places closed off - won't let you go yet. We'll get there, trust me, just need to wake it up.
0DI1002189	Casino's woken up, paying attention to us. Good.
0DI1002190	Wondering what happened to your team...? Looks like they got moved to other floors. Interesting, maybe that's why... hmmm, yes... yes.
0DI1002191	Perhaps the casino recognized specific guests... or guests with a voice or look close enough for them to be... assigned to that floor. We'll see.
0DI1002192	Had hoped with the power restored, the systems would fully awaken... especially the sound archives.
0DI1002193	But no... your teammates' collars on each floor are interfering with the systems.
0DI1002194	It's the white noise filters embedded in their construction... they're blocking the casino speakers, the music.
0DI1002195	You'll need to recalibrate... or destroy... each collar. To do that, you need to get close, re-set the signal - or blow their heads off.
0DI1002196	I'll leave the choice up to you - my preference? End them now. They're of no use.
0DI1002197	After all, it's safe to kill them now, provided you make it quick.
0DI1002198	You see, the collars don't work inside the Sierra Madre... well, between floors. Else, I'd set off the collars, be done with it.
0DI1002199	So find them, deal with them, as long as you're fast and can get off the floor after killing them.
0DI1002200	The floors... whatever they lined this place with, interferes with the collar frequency... so if you kill them, you should have some time to run.
0DI1002201	Uh... just not sure how long, may not be consistent. More... less... whatever, it doesn't matter.
0DI1002202	What we need is in the basement, we need to go to the top first and ride our fortunes down. After we deal with your team on the other floors.
0DI1002203	Find the mute and deal with her. She's somewhere on this floor.
0DI1002204	Floor's buzzing with emitter signatures. Watch out for Holograms.
0DI1002205	Your collar's ticking. Get out of that floor!
0DI1002206	The elevator to the casino vault is locked, find a way to open it.
0DI1002207	The door to the vault is voice-activated. Which means we need the starlet's voice. Or recordings of it.
0DI1002208	If that Ghoul's still alive... correct that. Or break him.
0DI1002209	Door's sealed. Must be a key to the backstage. Hunt for it.
0DI1002210	Get to the door before the collar explodes, move!
0DI1002211	Now, deal with the Ghoul. This has gone on long enough.
0DI1002212	Think you can escape? No, that hand on your throat is mine, always was.
0DI1002213	You won't get out. I'll bring the whole Sierra Madre down on you, bury you here with all the others.
0DI1002214	You think you've escaped?! You can't outrun me, you were always under my control! Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?!
0DI1002216	We all have, the legend, the curses. Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
0DI1002217	A city of ghosts. Buried beneath a blood-red cloud... a bright, shining monument luring treasure hunters to their doom.
0DI1002218	An illusion that you can begin again, change your fortunes.
0DI1002219	Finding it, though, that's not the hard part.
0DI1002223	Some foolishness about it lying in the middle of a City of Dead.
0DI1002224	A city of ghosts.
0DI1002225	Beneath a blood-red cloud...
0DI1002226	...a bright, shining monument, reaching out, luring treasure hunters to their doom. An illusion.
0DI1002227	A promise that you can change your fortunes. Begin again.
0DI1002234	You've heard stories of the Sierra Madre Casino. We all have.
0DI1002235	This story's different than the others. It's all in promise of beginnings. And the ending.
0DI1002236	The survivors of the Sierra Madre thought about gathering at the Fountain and waiting for the Courier.
0DI1002237	In the end, the collars' silence made them uneasy, and the fear of turning on each other made them hesitate, and leave the goodbyes - unspoken.
0DI1002238	The radio message at the fountain was enough for them, and there was no need to add another farewell on top of all they had suffered.
0DI1002239	In the years that followed, the legend of the Sierra Madre faded, and there were no... new visitors to the city.
0DI1002240	Years later, when a mysterious blood red cloud began to roll across the Mojave, then West toward the Republic, no one knew where it had come from.
0DI1002241	Only that it brought death in its wake. Attempts to find the source of the toxic cloud failed.
0DI1002242	The Mojave was cut off. Through the Cloud, lights were seen from HELIOS One.
0DI1002243	There were stories of ghosts immune to gunfire, who struck down anyone they saw with rays of light.
0DI1002244	The last chapter of the Mojave came when a modified REPCONN rocket struck Hoover Dam, releasing a blood-red cloud, killing all stationed there.
0DI1002245	All attempts to penetrate the Cloud and re-take the Dam failed, and both the NCR and Legion finally turned away from it, citing the place as cursed.
0DI1002246	In the years that followed, communities across the West began to die as traces of the Cloud began to drift over lands held by the NCR.
0DI1002247	Only two remained alive in the depths of the Cloud, at the Sierra Madre, waiting for their new world to begin again.
0DI1002248	The Courier, lured by the promise of the Sierra Madre, could not escape. Once inside the vault, the casino did not let go.
0DI1002249	When the Courier finally passed away, the casino created a new Hologram to walk with the other ghosts that filled its casino.
0DI1002250	It was a pre-programmed homage intended for another. It assumed a new meaning in the likeness of the Courier.
0DI1002251	A means of allowing even the dead to begin again.
0DI1002252	[Christine taps her collar, makes a sweeping gesture at the area, then begins to pulse her fingers outward, faster and faster.]
0DI1002253	[Christine nods at the Vending Machine, then makes a sweeping gesture with both arms and draws them to her chest.]
0DI1002254	I'm not one for church, but there's a bell tower to the north that has a nice view of the Sierra Madre. Well, did, anyway.
0DI1002255	You smell gas? I smell gas. Might be a valve nearby, we can use it to torch any locals that come near us.
0DI1002256	Surprised these homes weren't robbed blind, folks leaving the key out like that. If only the Sierra Madre'd done the same.
0DI1002257	Now, there's a view. Hello, beautiful.
0DI1002258	Bones. Dog not like bones, don't taste good... unless meat on them.
0DI1002259	Cage over there with things to pull, hard to pull, Dog can do it. Done it before? Not remember.
0DI1002260	Place with hard to pull things is over there... "W" on your wrist thing? Weh-st. West.
0DI1002261	This is the place you need to go when everyone is in place. Until then... nothing more than a diseased view of the Sierra Madre.
0DI1002262	Can you hear me...? Damn transceivers... let me link the collars to the speaker in the tower... then... there.
0DI1002263	[You hear banging from the speaker, as if someone is hammering on a wall with their fists.]
0DI1002264	[You hear a tapping from the speaker... a series of sharp taps, then a slow, two taps.]
0DI1002265	I'll pull the switches. And when I find you, I'll pull your head from your body.
0DI1002266	Ready. The both of us. I'll keep Dog locked in his cage... you just open the Sierra Madre.
0DI1002267	Dog is scared... wants out of cage. Cage you put me in. Will pull levers, be good, just let Dog out.
0DI1002268	Dog is ready to be good, pull switches, see the lights.
0DI1002269	What are you waiting for? Rubbing it in? Strike up the band already.
0DI1002270	Careful when you do... you think the Villa's bad now, you haven't seen anything yet.
0DI1002271	Come on, partner. So close now, stage is set, strike up the band.
0DI1002272	Just get ready to run when you do... I sure will. Think the Villa's bad now... you haven't seen half the hell this town can raise.
0DI1002273	[The hammering stops for a second... and there's one final bang from the speaker, as if someone is smashing their fist into a wall.]
0DI1002274	[A single tap comes from the speaker, then silence.]
0DI1002275	Finally. Now, the gates will open. And so will the skies.
0DI1002276	[The Hologram nods.]
0DI1002277	[The Hologram flickers in acknowledgement.]
0DI1002278	The world's most famous stars and entertainers were invited to its Grand Opening.
0DI1002279	An invitation was a sign of... exclusiveness.
0DI1002280	The opening was supposed to symbolize a road to a brighter future, not just for the world...
0DI1002281	... but for all who came to its doors.
0DI1002282	A chance for anyone to begin again.
0DI1002283	Except - the Sierra Madre never opened.
0DI1002284	The war froze it in time, like a big flashbulb going off. The Grand Opening - one big ending of humanity.
0DI1002285	It's still out there, in the Wastes, preserved, just waiting for someone to crack it open. But getting to it. That's not the hard part.
0DI1002286	Gala
0DI1002287	TheaterPerformance - 'Saw Her Yesterday'
0DI1002288	END MUSIC
0DI1002289	I warned you to cooperate. Now I'll have to begin again.
0DI1002291	When you die, I'll be waiting...
0DI1002292	Heh... now, come on, you open up. Open up, damn you.
0DI1002293	Open the vault... I can make it worth your while, think about what you're throwing away. I have other weapons, other technology I can share with you.
0DI1002294	And the Big Empty... I know the way there. I know some of its secrets... if...
0DI1002295	The collars... the collars were a mistake, I see that now. Why would I kill you? After all you've done... after all we've done together.
0DI1002296	Are you listening to me?!
0DI1002297	Everything down here... I swear... so much you could use, you could rule the wastes with what's down here...
0DI1002298	...make your own army, re-shape the world, and if others disagree... put collars on them, I can show you how.
0DI1002299	Don't you leave me here. You can't do this to me.
0DI1002300	Eh? Getting dark in here. Machine... machine's losing power, no. I still have Pip-Boy light... maybe... maybe... no, no, that doesn't work.
0DI1002301	Where... where is the door. Can't find the door.
0DI1002302	Calm, been in worse situations... find a way out... somehow, then find that Courier...
0DI1002303	Maybe Veronica... no... no, she thinks I'm dead.
0DI1002304	Must be someone... maybe that other courier, one with the flag on his back... maybe... no... no, said he'd never come to the Sierra Madre...
0DI1002305	No way out. Can't... can't end like this.
0DI1002306	You. I know you can hear me. When you die, Courier... I'll be waiting. Your grave's going look just like this vault.
0DI1002307	When you die... I'll be waiting here... at the Sierra Madre. Waiting.
0DI1002308	...would you stop? Such a kidder.
0DI1002309	This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for Love Sets Sail... god, this script. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to have the w...
0DI1002310	...is that a plane over head? Those bombers are nothing but big hornets buzzing around the sky these days...
0DI1002311	...is it gone. All right. This is Vera Keyes, auditioning for "Love Sets Sail."
0DI1002312	"Malcolm... ever since our freighter went down, I feel like my heart's fallen to the bottom of the ocean along with my... ugh"
0DI1002313	...along with my career. God... heh... all right, all right...
0DI1002314	Sinclair?! Sinclair, I'm trapped. Please, oh god, the security systems won't let me out, they're keeping me here.
0DI1002315	Sinclair! Sinclair!
0DI1002316	We all pay for what we've done. I'm so sorry, Sinclair. Sorry, I... I should have trusted you.
0DI1002317	I'm going to die here, amongst the ghosts. I... I'm still being recorded by the holographic system.
0DI1002318	The doors, they... they sealed. I... I can hear the other guests, screaming to be let out, to let go.
0DI1002319	Let go? Let go of what?
0DI1002320	I came so far to be here... now, now I just want to leave. Please... let me leave.
0DI1002321	Sinclair? Sinclair, where did you go? Why did you leave me here? Why...
0DI1002322	Sinclair, is that you?
0DI1002323	Think you can run? The longer you try and keep your distance, this scanning frequency will flush you out.
0DI1002324	[Christine flicks her finger back and forth quickly like a switch, then nods to the north.]
0DI1002325	[Christine frowns, looks upward, then back at you. She nods her head upwards, then makes the motion of holding a gun at the ready.]
0DI1002326	[Christine's eyes dart around at the walls and the ceiling. She glances at the exit, then takes a slow breath. Sweat appears on her brow.]
0DI1002327	[Christine's eyes dart in the direction of the screeching sound. She looks frightened and trembles slightly, as if fighting an urge to run.]
0DI1002328	If your marker's right, think the roost we're looking for is to the southeast.
0DI1002329	I am all about keeping low in this section of town... so let's see about creeping by the locals, all right?
0DI1002330	Ah, aren't the trees lovely this time of year, all blooming and green...
0DI1002331	Nice spot for sunning. Well, if the sun ever touched here.
0DI1002332	Tired of being inside. Want outside, get food inside Dog.
0DI1002333	Why leave a bear trap here, so high up. Someone's arm must have lost it.
0DI1002355	This crouching's hell on my knees.
0DI1002356	[Christine crouches down.]
0DI1002357	Wish I had a Stealth Boy instead of this bear trap.
0DI1002359	Hnnnn. Dog is following.
0DI1002360	No have wrist-collar now - Dog still good at not be seen.
0DI1002361	How Dog hunted back West. For Lou.
0DI1002362	Get a porter, carrying someone's bags - not my style.
0DI1002363	[Christine puts her palm flat and lowers it to the ground, shakes her head.]
0DI1002364	Allying with you is already more of a burden than I can bear.
0DI1002365	Hnnh-Nnn. Dog can't carry any more.
0DI1002366	I can help you in the Cloud, not for long, though.
0DI1002367	Don't dive in for too long, only so much I can do to help.
0DI1002368	[Christine looks at you, touches her throat, frowns.]
0DI1002369	Hnnhrr... air smells bad.
0DI1002370	Eyes stinging.
0DI1002371	Won't get rid of me that easily.
0DI1002372	Trying to lose me in the Cloud? Not a chance.
0DI1002373	Let's bring down the house!
0DI1002374	[Christine's face peels back in a snarl.]
0DI1002375	Rhhhharrrhhh!
0DI1002376	That's done it.
0DI1002377	Ah! Get a rug, put me out, something!
0DI1002378	[Christine begins to beat at the flames on her body.]
0DI1002379	Hrnnnnooooo!
0DI1002380	Fire.
0DI1002381	Feeling the music.
0DI1002382	Spring's back in my step.
0DI1002383	[Christine blinks, takes a breath, then nods.]
0DI1002384	Pain's going away.
0DI1002385	Finally - pain's gone, can focus.
0DI1002386	Nnnf!
0DI1002387	Hnnhr!
0DI1002389	Unff!
0DI1002390	[Christine's eyes blank, and she falls.]
0DI1002391	Hnnh.
0DI1002392	Rrr!
0DI1002393	Can finally park in handicapped spaces now.
0DI1002394	[Christine taps herself, then waves her hand - she looks in pain.]
0DI1002395	Hhrrnnnnnhhh!
0DI1002396	Dog's damaged.
0DI1002397	Yeah... that's the sweet stuff.
0DI1002398	[Christine checks herself, gives the thumbs up.]
0DI1002399	Hnh. Better.
0DI1002400	Physician, heal thyself.
0DI1002401	Bullets all cashed out here!
0DI1002402	[Christine taps her gun in frustration.]
0DI1002403	Hnnnrh?
0DI1002404	Too many targets, not enough bullets.
0DI1002405	Song and dance might work better than what I've got.
0DI1002406	[Christine taps her weapon angrily, assumes defensive stance.]
0DI1002407	Hrhhhnnnhh!
0DI1002408	Can't hurt this one, give me something that will.
0DI1002409	They're cutting through this like paper!
0DI1002410	[Christine quickly taps what she's wearing, makes a hatchet motion.]
0DI1002411	Don't want to repeat that number.
0DI1002412	Feels like someone played my head like a trombone.
0DI1002413	[Christine shakes her head, gets quickly back on her feet.]
0DI1002414	[Christine quickly leaps to her feet, narrows her eyes, and scans the area.]
0DI1002415	Nnnnnn... eyes went black.
0DI1002416	Good thing Dog wake up and not other voice.
0DI1002417	At least I woke up instead of remaining in the dark.
0DI1002418	Whatever it is, I want to kill it.
0DI1002419	Uh... could use a little boost here.
0DI1002420	Great, spilling my guts out to everybody.
0DI1002421	[Christine winces, then tries to hide it.]
0DI1002422	Hrrrrrrn.
0DI1002423	Losing blood.
0DI1002424	I'm bleeding green here, any ideas?
0DI1002425	[Christine winces, clutches her side.]
0DI1002426	Hnnnhrrrrrhn.
0DI1002427	Head swimming. Can't hold myself... together much longer.
0DI1002437	Hhh-hhnn. Dog hears you.
0DI1002438	Yeah, right. Oh, you're serious. You bet.
0DI1002439	[Christine narrows her eyes, nods.]
0DI1002440	Of course... murder's in our blood.
0DI1002441	Hrrrrrrrrrrr... Dog will do that.
0DI1002442	All you, trust me.
0DI1002443	[Christine raises an eyebrow, then shrugs.]
0DI1002444	As long as you don't get yourself killed.
0DI1002445	Only if save pieces for Dog...
0DI1002446	That's a relief. I-I mean, not like I care. I'm fine on my own.
0DI1002447	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shrugs.]
0DI1002448	Make up your mind.
0DI1002449	Dog stays.
0DI1002450	I can't say it hasn't been fun... well, I can, but I'll save it for my memoirs.
0DI1002452	I'll make more progress on my own - just don't get us killed.
0DI1002453	Dog will leave.
0DI1002454	Arrrooooooooooohnhrhnhr.
0DI1002456	Time to feed.
0DI1002457	So be it.
0DI1002459	Just wanted a little peace and quiet.
0DI1002460	Time to make some music.
0DI1002461	Strike up the band.
0DI1002462	Great.
0DI1002463	[Christine's eyes narrow, stance changes.]
0DI1002464	Lose the second-stringer, and I'll make the time.
0DI1002465	Strike up the band, Domino's back in town.
0DI1002466	[Christine glances at your companion, shakes her head, then raises her index finger.]
0DI1002468	I'll only travel with you... get rid of the other piece of meat, then we'll talk.
0DI1002469	I'll follow you. For now.
0DI1002470	Nnnn-Nnn... too many, Dog waits until you lose one... maybe let Dog feed?
0DI1002471	Dog is ready. Where we go?
0DI1002472	Tactics? What, we going to get into a shootout soon, or...?
0DI1002473	[Christine raises an eyebrow suspiciously.]
0DI1002474	Tactics? Why don't you let me worry about that - you just follow along, I'll take care of you.
0DI1002475	Hnnrrh? What do you want Dog to do?
0DI1002476	Style's not something you just change, friend.
0DI1002477	[Christine looks at you and waits.]
0DI1002478	As long as I am in control, fighting... is difficult. I'm not the... beast he is.
0DI1002479	Hrnnnh? What do you want?
0DI1002480	Sure, let's jaw all day and all night, why not?
0DI1002481	[Christine frowns, taps the back of her wrist, then circles her finger.]
0DI1002482	And what do you want to discuss now?
0DI1002483	Hnnnh... Dog is listening.
0DI1002484	If that's all, let's shake a leg.
0DI1002486	Good... you were starting to bore me.
0DI1002487	Dog hears you, will follow.
0DI1002488	Boxing's not really my thing. I prefer the gentle touch... but all right, it's your show.
0DI1002489	[Christine nods, and her stance changes slightly.]
0DI1002490	To warn you, as long as I'm in control, my coordination... suffers.
0DI1002491	Dog good at smashing things that move with bear trap.
0DI1002492	I'll be sure to cover you, don't you worry.
0DI1002493	[Christine nods, closes one eye and slowly pulls an invisible trigger.]
0DI1002494	While I'm in control, my ability to use his hands is... difficult.
0DI1002495	Dog will try... trigger and sight... Dog prefer to hit with bear trap.
0DI1002496	You're the one who dragged me out of my apartment, so yeah, I'm keeping close. So what?
0DI1002497	[Christine tilts her head slightly.]
0DI1002498	What is it? It won't matter in the end.
0DI1002499	Hnnh?
0DI1002500	Like dancing with your shadow.
0DI1002502	If you're sure.
0DI1002503	Hrnnnh, Dog will be kin. Like others in night.
0DI1002506	Go on - but keep it quick.
0DI1002507	Hnnh-hnnn.
0DI1002508	Enough gum-flapping, Madre's not getting any younger.
0DI1002510	If you mean into the casino, then - yes.
0DI1002511	Hnhhr!
0DI1002512	Oh, you bet. I'll flank them... might take me a while, though, so you just hold tight.
0DI1002513	[Christine nods, makes a half circle with her hand.]
0DI1002514	I'll watch over you.
0DI1002515	Hnn.
0DI1002516	Fine. "Tactics" means "stay out of sight" around here anyway.
0DI1002517	[Christine nods, waits.]
0DI1002518	Fine. What else?
0DI1002519	Hnnh-nnn. Dog not sure he remember anyway.
0DI1002520	Wait a moment, before you go.
0DI1002521	Everyone, please, may I have your attention.
0DI1002522	Has your life taken a turn? Do troubles beset you? Has fortune left you behind?
0DI1002524	Post-Gala Villa
0DI1002525	Spooky Audio!
0DI1002526	Dean
0DI1002527	Food's back.
0DI1002528	Hunt's on.
0DI1002529	Should've stayed lost.
0DI1002530	Won't get away again.
0DI1002531	Back like a bad habit.
0DI1002532	Thought they'd bailed.
0DI1002533	[Christine's eyes narrow, points.]
0DI1002534	Hnnf.
0DI1002535	Madre's playing tricks on me. Whoever it is, they're gone.
0DI1002536	Guess they skedaddled. Sounds good to me.
0DI1002537	[Christine scans the area, then shakes her head.]
0DI1002538	Nothing.
0DI1002539	Where are they? Not done yet.
0DI1002540	Lost them.
0DI1002541	Where did you go?
0DI1002542	No matter where you run, I'll find you.
0DI1002543	Lost, but not forgotten.
0DI1002544	Now where did you go?
0DI1002545	[Christine narrows her eyes, shakes her head.]
0DI1002546	Do good? Eat now?
0DI1002547	Hnnnrrh, all done, all gone.
0DI1002548	Finished here.
0DI1002549	That felt... good.
0DI1002550	Nice finish.
0DI1002551	Leave 'em wanting more.
0DI1002552	[Christine scans the area, then relaxes slightly.]
0DI1002553	Enough - the Sierra Madre is our target, not its ghosts.
0DI1002554	Perhaps they ran. If not... we'll see them soon.
0DI1002555	Hnh.
0DI1002556	Sierra Madre's playing tricks with me now.
0DI1002557	Forget this, let's focus on getting into the casino.
0DI1002558	[Christine does one final scan, then shakes her head, and motions forward.]
0DI1002559	Food!
0DI1002560	Dog was getting hungry.
0DI1002561	Kill this one before they call others.
0DI1002562	I'll end you.
0DI1002563	Of course, it was getting too quiet.
0DI1002564	Going to need a hand here, "partner."
0DI1002566	Arrrrrroooooooooo!
0DI1002567	Rhhhhhhrrrrrrr!
0DI1002568	Let's kill them, Dog.
0DI1002569	Ah, guests. Their mistake.
0DI1002570	Jackpot!
0DI1002571	Just couldn't mind your own business...
0DI1002572	[Christine motions to you, points.]
0DI1002573	Hnh? Smell something.
0DI1002574	Something's moving, moving.
0DI1002575	Trespassers.
0DI1002576	Something's out there.
0DI1002577	Sounds like we got a tourist.
0DI1002579	[Christine holds up her hand, pauses, then starts scanning the area.]
0DI1002580	Where is the food?
0DI1002581	Dog hungry, please come out.
0DI1002583	I'll find you, you can't hide.
0DI1002584	Still looking... although I'm all for following suit and leaving.
0DI1002585	Vanished like a Maxis act.
0DI1002586	[Christine scans the area intently.]
0DI1002587	Hnnnrrrrrrrrrrrr.
0DI1002588	Hnnnnrrrrrr...
0DI1002589	Whatever it is, it's still out there. Waiting.
0DI1002590	It'll come to us, Dog. Just wait. We'll kill it together.
0DI1002591	Still out there.
0DI1002592	I can hear you moving, whoever you are.
0DI1002593	[Christine raises her hand, and starts scanning the area.]
0DI1002594	What're you doing that for? Fine, let's settle this.
0DI1002595	[Christine points at your collar, then hers.]
0DI1002596	Hnnhh? Hrnnnnn.
0DI1002597	If this is how you want to die, then so be it.
0DI1002598	Fine, fine - don't want us both blowing up anyway.
0DI1002599	[Christine checks herself, stops attacking, looks angry, points at collar.]
0DI1002600	Hnnnr? Hnnn.
0DI1002601	Next time, I'll break your legs and hang you from the Madre gates.
0DI1002602	If you find a place to pawn that, go right ahead.
0DI1002603	Greed took the others - go on, keep it. I'll get it back eventually.
0DI1002604	[Christine narrows her eyes, then shakes her head and waves you off.]
0DI1002605	Hnnnh? Rhnhhhrrrr...
0DI1002606	Take from me again, and I'll leave you for the Sierra Madre.
0DI1002607	Vera, sweetheart... see you soon.
0DI1002608	Guess a fat lady's singing somewhere.
0DI1002609	You win, Sinclair.
0DI1002610	So much for the Sierra Madre.
0DI1002611	[Christine clutches her collar as she falls, clawing at it.]
0DI1002612	:: Death cry ::
0DI1002613	Finally, the howling will end.
0DI1002614	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
0DI1002615	[Christine makes frantic motions with her hands.]
0DI1002616	Hhh-hhh-hhhhnnn!
0DI1002617	Look out.
0DI1002618	Let me whip up a special cocktail...
0DI1002619	[Christine waves for you to get back, makes throwing motion.]
0DI1002620	Hnnnh-Hnnnh-Hnnnh.
0DI1002621	Let sound and thunder answer this.
0DI1002622	Valor, you're up - discretion and me, we're outta here.
0DI1002623	[Christine shakes her head, waves at you to follow.]
0DI1002624	Hnnnh-hnnnh-hnnh.
0DI1002625	Find a defensible position, we'll kill them there.
0DI1002627	[Christine takes the blow, doesn't flinch.]
0DI1002628	Hnh!
0DI1002629	Ennh!
0DI1002630	Hnnnhhhr!
0DI1002631	Die.
0DI1002632	Time to cash this one out.
0DI1002633	Godammit.
0DI1002634	Batting a thousand, that's us.
0DI1002635	Used to open in Paris. Paris. Now this.
0DI1002636	Can't believe I left the apartment for this.
0DI1002637	[Christine narrows her eyes, and her stance changes.]
0DI1002638	Hrrhrhhhhnnnh!
0DI1002639	Something needs to die.
0DI1002641	[Christine nods, adjusts her gear.]
0DI1002642	All of your weapons will do. And your stims.
0DI1002643	Dog fetches... will share... have food?
0DI1002644	You sure? I mean... look, you can't just tell me to walk now, you know. That's... well, not very friendly.
0DI1002645	[Christine raises an eyebrow.]
0DI1002646	You... want us to split up. All... three of us?
0DI1002647	Why you send Dog away? Dog hear you right?
0DI1002649	I'd shed a tear, but I'm sure we'll be chatting again.
0DI1002653	Don't be ridiculous - point that somewhere else, will you?
0DI1002654	[Christine frowns, points at your collar, then hers.]
0DI1002655	I didn't take you for suicidal.
0DI1002656	Don't shoot. Bullets hurt.
0DI1002657	A little party favor before the grand finale.
0DI1002658	[Christine points at mine, then taps her temple.]
0DI1002659	Thinking ahead... good.
0DI1002660	Want Dog to fetch bomb-thing? Or not touch?
0DI1002661	Watch where you're chucking those things!
0DI1002662	[Christine covers her ears.]
0DI1002663	Don't waste those - save one for when they get close.
0DI1002664	Arooooooooo!
0DI1002669	...Hnnnhrhhh... my voice... won't work, won't hold him, down, doesn't matter, won't help...
0DI1002670	...Hnnnhrhhh... he's gotten too strong, too scared... even my own voice won't help...
0DI1002671	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Left Dog in cage, mean to Dog... now, Dog...
0DI1002672	You... you hurt Dog, keep hurting him. Dog hungry, not want to hurt any more... not want to...
0DI1002673	You...? Master... no, not Master. Dog remembers you. Kind to Dog... Dog can't...
0DI1002674	Kind to Dog... then hurt Dog... you hate Dog, hate...
0DI1002675	Master? Dog not hear you come in... too hungry, now... at cage door? Master, Dog is listening now you are close and he can hear you over hunger.
0DI1002676	I'll wait here until there's fires in the sky.
0DI1002677	Dog is waiting.
0DI1002678	You better have brought enough meat. I can feel Dog's teeth tearing at my ribs, hungry to get out.
0DI1002679	Why Dog eyes go black for bit. You talk to other voice?
0DI1002680	Dog wants out... Dog is hungry.
0DI1002681	Let Dog out. Hungry, hate being in here.
0DI1002682	So here we are. A row of switches all lined up. How familiar...
0DI1002683	...these switches won't move themselves, after all... there must be some trick to it. Now that I'm here... what do you expect me to do?
0DI1002684	Why are we here? Dog not want to be here... place too much like a cage for Dog.
0DI1002686	So... are we on our way to somewhere else...? A Gala Event, perhaps?
0DI1002687	Where are you taking Dog? Dog doesn't want to leave, heard Master... saw Master in sky.
0DI1002688	And when Master not there... woman at fountain... she is made of lines and light, want to watch.
0DI1002689	If it isn't the clever one. What do you want?
0DI1002690	You are the nice voice... kind to Dog. You keep the other Voice quiet.
0DI1002691	Remember you... you were mean to Dog, make Dog sleep... and other Voice come out.
0DI1002692	Hnh. Dog remember you.
0DI1002693	Be patient, I'm going. Maybe you should know when to let go.
0DI1002694	You made it, good. I'm getting tired of waiting for you - and Elijah. Surprised? Yeah... I made it here, just like you did.
0DI1002695	You made it, good... <Coughs>ugh.. Hurts to talk. I'll keep this quick in case my... voice goes out.
0DI1002696	You're back. You sure you still want me here, collars and all? Not much for waiting around with a bomb around my neck.
0DI1002697	I... I wish you luck in the Vault. Elijah... he's tough to pin down.
0DI1002698	[Christine is looking at the Fountain, her eyes narrowed. She then scans the courtyard perimeter, gauging the distance.]
0DI1002699	[She glances at your wrist, then back at the Fountain.]
0DI1002700	[The woman before you looks disoriented, pained - she blinks a few times, then winces, as if the act of blinking causes her pain.]
0DI1002701	[Christine points at the sky, makes a fist, then makes an explosion gesture with her fingers.]
0DI1002702	[Christine shakes her head, narrows her eyes, then points at your compass.]
0DI1002704	[Christine looks at you warily.]
0DI1002705	[Christine glares at you.]
0DI1002707	So you showed. Felt the collar start kicking again as soon as the elevator doors rattled open.
0DI1002708	Think you're going to up-stage me, here at the Sierra Madre? I don't think so. Now that I'm inside... well, I don't need you anymore.
0DI1002709	Finally, a friendly face... hey! Partner! Up here.
0DI1002710	In a bit of a predicament here... had to duck backstage, take a powder, the audience is a little... murderous tonight.
0DI1002711	All right, you're resourceful, I'll give you that - it's going to take a lot more than juggling keys and shooting speakers to stop me.
0DI1002712	As I see it? All I need to do is kill you, then make a run for the exit. You do the same, you'll be clawing at the lock until your head blows off.
0DI1002713	So maybe you and I should have a little chat - just like we did when you first waltzed into town.
0DI1002714	Those electric ghosts aren't the kind of audience I like at the best of times - at least the ones in the Villa had manners.
0DI1002715	Don't even know how I ended up here... guess the casino still recognizes guests even after all this time, huh? How's that for history.
0DI1002716	Not going to be performing here again, that's for sure. This place is a dump! Lousy acoustics.
0DI1002717	Not now, we got bigger problems.
0DI1002718	Was that him floating above the Fountain, the boss man? The one who put these bowties on our necks?
0DI1002719	Sure does like to make a presentation... wish he'd keep it down, or else the Ghost People are going to swarm the gates, Vera Hologram or no.
0DI1002720	Have a seat, and then we'll talk.
0DI1002721	The Sierra Madre. Mmm... beauty, isn't she. She the one who invited you here?
0DI1002722	Or maybe you didn't catch her voice on the radio. Woke up, confused, like some of the others. Least you're still breathing.
0DI1002723	By the way, don't get up or make any sudden motions, no matter how uncomfortable that chair gets... the cushion's just for show.
0DI1002724	I'll hold up my end, don't you worry. We get to the Sierra Madre, it'll be a different tune, trust me.
0DI1002725	"Hold the wires, Dean." Talk about being a second stringer.
0DI1002726	So this is where I'm supposed to put on the show? Played better venues, let me tell you.
0DI1002727	What's that there... wiring? Looks... looks like it's tied to the sound system in the Villa, except for that snipped section there.
0DI1002728	So... what, I stand here, hold the two ends in my hands, and tap them together like cymbals?
0DI1002729	Didn't think much of our chances, now I'm thinking I was wrong. What's the next step?
0DI1002730	Well, now, if it isn't my ball, chain, and dog collar rolled all into one.
0DI1002731	You have that sad, questioning look in your eye. Not sure talking to me's going to make it any better.
0DI1002732	[You get no response.]
0DI1002735	You've returned. Why? Gather the three as I've instructed, then I will have more for you - not before.
0DI1002739	So, get your team into position indicated on your Pip-Boy, then trigger it properly.
0DI1002741	You. You're in the vault... finally. After all this time. The Sierra Madre... mine.
0DI1002742	Don't move, don't go into the vault. And don't touch anything else... there may be more traps down there... another security system.
0DI1002743	Enough talking.
0DI1002744	Whoever designed the Sierra Madre... their obsession with messing with frequencies and signals...
0DI1002745	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. If you resist, I'll use the collar, even if it puts the vault at risk.
0DI1002746	I'm coming down - I'll meet you face to face at the vault entrance. No tricks. If you prove troublesome, well... there's always the collar.
0DI1002747	I'm coming down, forget the Sierra Madre security, I'll find you myself. Try to break into the vault, I'll set off the collar.
0DI1002748	Curious? You must be. We have time, now that you've done your work. And our interactions have been too one-sided, even for my tastes.
0DI1002749	Ask! You still have time.
0DI1002752	[The flickering Hologram stares at you expectantly.]
0DI1002753	[The holographic cashier faces you, flickering. It seems to be waiting for you to speak.]
0DI2000001	Just like that, huh? You got guts, I'll give you that. You sure you want to jump in blind? Ain't got no questions about where we're going or why?
0DI2000002	I bet you are, but we only got room for one more on this expedition. You'll have to leave your friends behind.
0DI2000003	I bet you are, but we only got room for one more on this expedition. You'll have to leave your friend behind.
0DI2000004	I bet you are, but you ain't going nowhere loaded down like a pack brahmin.
0DI2000006	Are you now? You know we ain't coming back this way for a good long while now, right? And you know about the weight limit?
0DI2000007	I don't want no whining about "Oh, Mr. Masterson, I left my one-of-a-kind plasma cannon back at base, can we go back for it?"
0DI2000008	You sure you're ready now?
0DI2000009	You sure about that this time? We ain't coming back for a while.
0DI2000010	Well I'll be. I was starting to lose hope we'd be able to get any of this, much less all of it. Tribals are smart but... well, they're ignorant.
0DI2000011	Letting go of a taboo is difficult for them, so I knew it would have to be one of us. Turns out all it took was a Gentile. Or, uh... no offense.
0DI2000012	These supplies are a godsend, but if we're going to evacuate Zion without drawing more White Leg attention, I need you to go back into the valley.
0DI2000013	Specifically, I need you to scout out some locations for White Legs and try to recover a map of Grand Staircase, a wilderness area to the east.
0DI2000014	There's also the matter of the roads. We're going to be heading out of the east side of the park, but I'm not sure the way is clear.
0DI2000015	I appreciate it. Well, that's it. This is all we need. Now all that's left is to quietly pack up and try to get out of here without being noticed.
0DI2000016	That's assuming that Joshua won't try to stop me. And that he hasn't talked you into fighting the White Legs despite what I've said.
0DI2000017	Don't worry. I don't hold it against you. You're a -  an outsider. Fighting seems like the practical solution. But there's more than that at stake.
0DI2000018	You've done more than I could have ever hoped for. Thank you. And may God protect you for all of your days. Goodbye.
0DI2000019	You let them die! They needed you! Why didn't you help them?!
0DI2000020	Nevermind. I don't have time for this. Take the map. Just take it and go!
0DI2000021	What uh... what do you want to know, exactly? I'm sure she could tell you much better than I.
0DI2000022	Hoo! Glad to hear it! That'll be some happy mama, huh? Thank you - really. It means a lot to me.
0DI2000023	Sure, hey, I understand. I wish it could have been done different, but at least the calf is back with its herd.
0DI2000024	That's... not really what I was hoping for. I guess... I guess at least we don't have to worry about the Bighorners attacking the camp now. Hoy....
0DI2000025	That's... not really what I was hoping for, but... I guess I can give the little guy a home. What the hell.
0DI2000026	I can't tell you that! I have a sworn vow of secrecy, or something like that, to all the people I left behind.
0DI2000027	I know everything! I know all about it! But I ain't about to tell the likes of you!
0DI2000028	I have a sworn vow of secrecy, or something like that, to the people I left behind!
0DI2000029	You been to Vault two-two, huh?
0DI2000030	Huh? ...Of course I noticed! First thing I noticed about you!
0DI2000031	Me, I'm so used to wearing mine, it's just normal. Don't think you're someone special just because you got one.
0DI2000032	Earning my keep. Jed hired me on as a caravan guard for this expedition of his.
0DI2000033	The work suits me. I've tried staying put in one place, but it never works out.
0DI2000034	Grew up in New Reno, and I couldn't put that snakepit behind me fast enough.
0DI2000035	Then I wound up wasting the prime of my life playing Sheriff in Caliente, little town north on the 93. Talk about a pain in the ass.
0DI2000036	You ask me, best to keep moving. At least the scenery changes.
0DI2000037	What? No... you must be mistaken. Daniel would have told me!
0DI2000038	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... all right, I reckon you know your limits.
0DI2000039	You keel over on me out there, though, and I'll leave your ass. After we take everything useful you crammed in your pack.
0DI2000040	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a virgin on her wedding night up there.
0DI2000041	Last thing I need is some greenhorn getting stuck on a rock, slowing the whole caravan down.
0DI2000042	[FAILED] That's exactly what I'm worried about. We got us some passes tighter than a-  well, tighter than a Chairman's fist up there.
0DI2000043	You get stuck in there, you'll slow the whole caravan down while we pry you loose. Begging your pardon, ma'am.
0DI2000044	Heh. I do believe you could.
0DI2000045	Heh. All right, I'll believe you - Lord knows I ain't going to pat you down to find out for myself.
0DI2000046	Let me tell you a story. When I was a boy, a man came through the valley with one of the caravans. Tall man, big mustache, carried a guitar.
0DI2000047	I asked what he did for his living, and the interpreter told me he was a singer.
0DI2000048	"What is that?" I asked. The man explained that he went from place to place and sang for people, who gave him food and shelter and care in return.
0DI2000049	I couldn't believe that there was a place in this world where a man could do that. I promised myself then that one day I'd explore that world myself.
0DI2000050	Ya? What did he say?
0DI2000051	This is true? You spoke to him? Oh, that is a relief. Grasas, na'ne.
0DI2000052	Just don't. It makes the New Canaanites powerful uncomfortable, and it scares the britches off the tribals.
0DI2000053	Don't talk about the Burned Man either, while you're at it. Trust me on this one, it's for your own good.
0DI2000054	I do. A fine husband and three children. I miss them each day, but I take comfort in knowing they are safe.
0DI2000055	A Sorrow's Yao Guai Fist is a sacred symbol. It shows that we belong to the tribe and have willingly undertaken a dangerous quest to aid the tribe.
0DI2000056	Each Sorrow makes his own - and only after hunting and slaying a Yao Guai that threatened our people.
0DI2000057	Our shaman, White Bird, oversees the rites. Perhaps if you spoke to him, he would allow you to undertake such a quest.
0DI2000058	The job is simple - help us get this caravan into Zion and find New Canaan. The pay is 25 caps per day, half up front, half on return.
0DI2000059	You'll get a bonus if we make it into Zion, plus another bonus if we reach New Canaan.
0DI2000060	Oh, one more thing - don't mention the name Joshua Graham to anyone. Anyone.
0DI2000061	Mostly it's the mountain Bighorners - whole herd of them up on the cliffs there. Usually they're not too aggressive, but lately... hoo!
0DI2000062	My guess is one of the calves got lost somewhere along the way. Bighorners are communal - one missing calf, and the whole herd gets ornery.
0DI2000063	If that calf doesn't turn up soon, they might very well come down into the valley and attack the camp.
0DI2000064	You change your mind about helping out?
0DI2000068	You might try luring the baby out with some banana yucca. These Bighorners go crazy for the stuff.
0DI2000069	Best place to look for Back When stuff is the taboo places. Sorrows and Dead Horses don't go in there, and even White Legs don't like them much.
0DI2000070	I thought he might. It's been some time since I've visited... civilized places. I don't have fond memories of them.
0DI2000071	But I have always seen these places from the outside. I'd rather not influence him more than I already do. Why don't you talk to him?
0DI2000072	Imagine New Vegas if there was no Mr. House-type fella keeping the peace, then give everybody a gun and a Jet addiction.
0DI2000073	Town's run by a bunch of crime families, no law to speak of. Make trouble, and you wind up buried in Golgotha, outside town.
0DI2000074	The scuzz factor's off the charts. Non-stop whoring and drugs. Couldn't walk down the street without getting asked to star in a porn movie.
0DI2000075	So I got my ass out of there while I still owned it. Guess I figured the answer to every problem was rule of law. Naive, huh?
0DI2000076	That is a sad story. I do not like to tell it, but if you are asking, it must be at White Bird's request. That, I will honor.
0DI2000077	Long ago, a girl lived among this tribe. She was a curious child, and a clever one, and her mother had a devil's time watching over her.
0DI2000078	One day, the child slipped away from camp and went to play in the caves nearby. The girl did not know that a Yao Guai slept in that cave.
0DI2000079	The girl died. The tribe wept, for the girl had died before her naming day, and her ghost would remain restless and wandering upon the earth.
0DI2000080	Many hunters tried to kill the beast, but it eluded them, or drove them off. The shaman said that since it had consumed the girl, the two were one.
0DI2000081	So we call the beast Ghost of She, for the child had no name to be called. That is the story of the Ghost of She. It is a sad story. It is our story.
0DI2000082	You ain't never been to Zion, have you? We'll be passing through a whole mess of narrow slot canyons and high, rough passes.
0DI2000083	A big pack'll get you wedged in like a Super Mutant crawling through a storm drain, and too much weight will kill you in the thin air.
0DI2000084	We're a smaller company out of Sac-Town, up in the northern part of the NCR. We run some business through New Reno, there on the "Little Loop."
0DI2000085	Had a nice run to Salt Lake City, too - but then we lost contact with New Canaan, and that went all to hell.
0DI2000086	He's been the chief of our tribe since he came back to the Valley. He went off to the civilized world years ago, to fight a war. That didn't go well.
0DI2000087	White Legs - nasty bunch. They been raiding deeper into Zion ever since New Canaan was wiped out.
0DI2000088	Uh, how you think? I shoot things in the eye, that's how good I am! Yeah, I'm that good!
0DI2000089	Why, uh, once I got jumped by three... Deathjaws! Except actually it was four of them! Imagine that!
0DI2000090	But I didn't panic, because... because I never panic! What I did was become a storm of death! Shot every one of them monsters "pop" in the eye!
0DI2000091	Well, I grew up near Dayglow out west, so yeah, I grew a third nut that glows in the dark!
0DI2000092	I'll drop trou for you out on the trail after dark, sis. Let you see what you're working with, know what I mean?
0DI2000093	Where the fuck you think? Vault two-two! That's where I grew up!
0DI2000094	Place lived up to its name, that's for sure.
0DI2000095	When you got fresh water and a trickle of geothermic power, always be some gang of assholes wants to kill you for it.
0DI2000096	Spent more years and took more bullets than I care to admit protecting that hellhole from dangers, within and without.
0DI2000097	If it wasn't the 80s or the White Legs raiding, it was someone from town drunk off his ass trying to win an argument with a shotgun.
0DI2000098	Got tired of shooting the folks I was supposed to protect. So... now I do this.
0DI2000099	Waking Cloud is my name. I am midwife to the Sorrows. It sounds ill-omened, no? "Midwife to sorrows."
0DI2000100	Daniel is a wise man, and a great friend to the Sorrows. He taught me to speak the language of New Canaan - the English from the holy books.
0DI2000101	Grand Staircase is farther east, deeper into the Colorado Plateau.
0DI2000102	The White Legs were able to reach us here, but it's only because Zion is close to the Long 15. They can't pursue us east of here. It's too wild.
0DI2000103	Throughout our history, we have called many places Zion. This valley is full of God's beauty, but it's just a place. Zion is more than this.
0DI2000104	We cannot use any and all means available just to protect stone and water and a piece of sky. We have to hold on to our faith. Far more enduring.
0DI2000105	If we sacrifice grace for a piece of land, we may live in this valley, but we will no longer dwell in Zion. It's better for us to leave now.
0DI2000106	What can I tell you?
0DI2000107	Sorry, the shit I do with it is so far over your head, be wasting my time to put it in words you could understand!
0DI2000108	Basically, it makes me badass. More badass, I mean. It's totally mind-blowing shit. It ain't just some bracelet, know what I mean?
0DI2000109	Jed says it's got maps and shit like that, so that's how I'm gonna guide this caravan where it needs to go! Not that I didn't know all that already!
0DI2000110	What's the difference? Raiders is raiders.
0DI2000111	Bunch of them swept in to town and dragged off two working girls. Deputies and me gave pursuit, straight into 80s territory.
0DI2000112	By the time we caught up with the girls, there wasn't much left of them. So we turned for home.
0DI2000113	Made it back to Caliente without further losses, but we was watched the whole way. Never seen so few people cover so much land. Goddamn creepy.
0DI2000114	If the 80s had wanted to kill us, we would've been dead. Guess they figured we weren't worth the trouble.
0DI2000115	We have dwelt in the Narrows since the End That Came In Fire, when the Father in the Caves punished the world and made us forget the holy tongue.
0DI2000116	We have had good relations with the other tribes in the valley. At least, before Salt-Upon-Wounds brought his White Legs here.
0DI2000117	We have Daniel to thank for our continued existence. His advice and help has kept the White Legs from overrunning us so far.
0DI2000118	I do not know how long even he can protect us, though.
0DI2000119	He is war chief of the White Legs, and the worst butcher of them all. The tribes he has crushed are many. The warriors he has slain, countless.
0DI2000120	Well, I ain't never been inside, myself. Did some trading with the New Canaanites from their mission there, but that was all on the outskirts.
0DI2000121	All the old ways in and out were destroyed after the War, but we got ourselves the location of a pass the New Canaanites use - that's our way in.
0DI2000122	That's why I wanted someone with a Pip-Boy on the caravan - the map'll be helpful for checking the topography, keeping us on the trail.
0DI2000123	That's great news. We can use anything you can offer.
0DI2000124	They're hateful savages who live only to plunder and destroy. Their leader is a devil called Salt-Upon-Wounds.
0DI2000125	War is what all he knows. Everything he has, everything that tribe has, was taken by force, raiding and scavenging.
0DI2000126	It's said there's no man deadlier at close range, that that powerfist of his has smashed a hundred skulls.
0DI2000127	Maybe that's true, but so what? It's a low form of leadership. A tribe that knows only war has no future. And so he'll lead them to Caesar.
0DI2000128	Used to be they raided northeast of Caliente, time to time. But then the Desert Rangers fell apart ten years ago, absorbed into the NCR.
0DI2000129	Soon enough the White Legs were swarming all over that stretch of I-15. Folks learned not to head north if they wanted to keep their scalps.
0DI2000130	Eventually the White Legs destroyed the bridges across the Virgin River, over in Arizona. End of discussion.
0DI2000131	Have you not heard of the god of the New Canaanites? He is our protector and our judge. He helped our ancestors find their place here in Zion.
0DI2000132	He gave us many gifts, but we are not to seek him out. His caves are forbidden to us. Those who seek them out are taken from us.
0DI2000133	If you could part with it, healing powder would be welcome. We have enough Stimpaks for now, but we can't rely on that small supply.
0DI2000134	Broc and Xander plants can be found throughout the valley and you might even find some on White Legs you come across.
0DI2000135	Sure, okay. I'll wait behind. Not like I'm not used to that.
0DI2000136	As you wish. I will wait, but please do not be gone long.
0DI2000137	Sorry. That's not going to happen.
0DI2000138	Well, it ain't good, I'll tell you that. It's not like the Mojave or the NCR - hell, even Arizona under Caesar is safer.
0DI2000139	You got raiders all over the damn place, tribes of degenerates that'll eat you as soon as look at you, regional warlords... the works.
0DI2000140	Not too many decent places to stop and trade. New Canaan's one of the only ones left I know about.
0DI2000141	You want to know what I do, Bud? Anything I fucking want!
0DI2000142	You want to know what I do, Toots? Anything I fucking want!
0DI2000143	I'm one of a kind! I been places, see? And done things - lots of them!
0DI2000144	And when it's time to kill shit up? Hell yeah, I'm a fucking storm of death!
0DI2000145	Something or someone make the mistake of crossing Ricky? I'll fucking deadeye him, her, or it!
0DI2000146	In fact... yeah, in fact, that's my nickname! "Deadeye" Ricky - that's my name!
0DI2000147	I used to help the Sorrows with various medical problems and general issues they were having, but my bishop sent me here as a missionary.
0DI2000148	We New Canaanites believe that there is a path to salvation for everyone and it's important that we set people on that path if they are willing.
0DI2000149	Oh man, yeah! Trigger finger is feeling itch-ay! Come on, assholes! Show yourselves and Deadeye Ricky'll blow your fucking heads off!
0DI2000150	I ain't feeling good, man. I feel like shit! I got the shakes, got the sweats. This fucking sucks!
0DI2000151	There's an old saying that goes, "If you want peace, get ready for war."
0DI2000152	You've got me figured half-right. I'll shoot dead any White Leg that tries to creep into this camp, but it's only to protect the Sorrows.
0DI2000153	The Lord helps those who help themselves, but the Sorrows don't know how. Joshua and I do. Since I got them into this mess, I need to get them out.
0DI2000154	Caesar would never admit this openly, but he knows that I'm alive. I've killed enough of his frumentarii and assassins that have come looking.
0DI2000155	I've heard one of them travels the Mojave as a courier. Most of Caesar's agents meet a fitting end in NCR territory, but maybe this one survived.
0DI2000156	Nice job, Eagle Eye! Of course I got a Pit-Boy and a Vault suit! So what?
0DI2000157	Father in the? Oh, right. He's some spirit the Sorrows used to believe in, watched over them from the caves in the valley.
0DI2000158	They marked some of the caves around here because they think they'll be punished for going inside.
0DI2000159	I think as more of them learn the teachings of the New Canaanites, they'll lose their old superstitions.
0DI2000160	It's not a subject I'm fond of discussing. It's over and done with, anyway. Why are you so interested?
0DI2000161	I think that would put him - and you - in a difficult position. Caesar has agents looking for me, but he won't admit I'm alive.
0DI2000162	And even if you killed me, he can't acknowledge that. To do so would be to admit I had never died. That Caesar made a mistake.
0DI2000163	No. He lives by his lies and shall die by his lies. There is no escaping it.
0DI2000164	[SUCCEEDED] Hey hey hey! Fuck you! I didn't say nothing about using Psycho!
0DI2000165	[FAILED] Yeah, Doc, I'm feeling great, fuck you very much. Asshole.
0DI2000167	I walk in your footsteps.
0DI2000168	I'll take a look, boss! Keep me covered!
0DI2000169	Ambush! Tribals, and they mean blood!
0DI2000170	Shhhhh! Hold on, now... Could swear I heard something up ahead.
0DI2000171	Goddammit, ambush! Cover, people! Watch yourselves!
0DI2000172	Holy hell! Stay low, people, stay low...
0DI2000173	Stella!... Oh no! Don't you die on me, woman, you hear?
0DI2000174	On your feet! Keep fighting! Come on now, I got ya...
0DI2000175	You want some, assholes? You just pissed off the wrong guy! And that means Ricky!
0DI2000176	I don't deserve this! My Pip-Boy don't even work! Why the fuck you hire me?
0DI2000177	Shut the hell up, Ricky! Might as well be waving at them!
0DI2000178	Enough of this! We're sitting ducks here! Here I come! I was a sheriff once, goddamn it!
0DI2000179	Well, all right then. Let's get moving. We've got a long road ahead of us...
0DI2000180	Fair enough. Come on back when you're ready.
0DI2000181	Hang on - ain't you the one that wiped out the Crimson Caravan's Vegas branch not too long ago?
0DI2000182	Ought to thank you for that - knocking McLafferty out of the running gives Happy Trails a market to expand into.
0DI2000183	Wait a minute, I recognize you. Yeah... you're Alice McLafferty's rising star, ain't you?
0DI2000184	You sure you want to be here? McLafferty's non-competes are pretty rigid.
0DI2000185	Damn good thing you came along, too. We had another prospect with a Pip-Boy, but he done skedaddled. Something must've spooked the boy.
0DI2000186	Don't know much about the place, but I can tell you about the people. The New Canaanites were some kind of religious group from before the War.
0DI2000187	They control the old city of Ogden, a ways north of Zion, and they got themselves a nice defensible mission in the canyon itself - or they did.
0DI2000188	They trade a fair bit with the tribes in Zion - well, the ones that don't try and kill them, anyways.
0DI2000189	Should have figured you for a player. All right, let's play.
0DI2000190	Another one, huh? Sure, why not?
0DI2000191	There's a chest over yonder, you can store your extra in that. It'll be safe as can be until you get back.
0DI2000193	Without New Canaan's mission in Zion, the only ways to Salt Lake City are down the old I-80 or up through Ogden.
0DI2000194	The highway's too risky - NCR's rangers are so busy here in the Mojave they don't have the manpower to keep the raiders off.
0DI2000195	Ogden's just too far - we'd lose more in travel expenses than we'd ever earn.
0DI2000196	[SUCCEEDED] You ain't wrong. Losing the Salt Lake City run really stung us. If we can't re-establish contact with this run, we'll be in real trouble.
0DI2000197	[FAILED] We do all right, don't you worry about us. Got enough in the kitty to pay you, anyways.
0DI2000198	I ain't a prayin' man myself. They paid for their goods and dealt square with us, that's all I ever cared about.
0DI2000199	But don't think that just because they're religious that they're pacifists. They take care of their own, and they're damn fine marksmen too.
0DI2000200	Nope - hence this caravan. If we don't make contact with the New Canaanites, Happy Trails might as well just shrivel up and die.
0DI2000201	They're about what you'd expect - crazy, jacked up on chems, violent as hell, and not too bright.
0DI2000202	The worst are the 80s, but we won't be passing through their turf on this run.
0DI2000203	That's right. The folks that lived in Zion before the war, they didn't just get a little savage, they're downright feral.
0DI2000204	Most of them don't even speak English any more - you got to get yourself a New Canaanite translator to talk to them.
0DI2000205	The ones you really got to watch out for are the White Legs, from the Great Salt Lake. They'll attack just about anyone that ain't one of theirs.
0DI2000206	Dangerous enough we won't be going near them if we can help it. I got no desire for my head to decorate some little gas station fort's walls, thanks.
0DI2000208	No. Why? Why? Haven't you seen enough of what's going on here to see that the Sorrows don't need to butcher the White Legs for a piece of land?
0DI2000209	What Joshua wants is more than an attack. He wants a slaughter. And he needs more than you and the Dead Horses to do it.
0DI2000210	The Sorrows can't be pushed into this. You and Joshua don't have the right to force them into it. Please, consider what I'm saying.
0DI2000211	It may be. I hope it is. To tell the truth, if something goes wrong, more Sorrows could die in the escape than in Joshua's proposed attack.
0DI2000212	Even knowing that, it's a risk I have to take. With your help, and Joshua's, even if we're attacked, we can defend the Sorrows and escape.
0DI2000213	We'll be traveling at night, in small groups, across the valley. With luck, the White Legs won't know what's happened until the next morning.
0DI2000214	But if the White Legs realize what's happening... Joshua and I will need you to help us escape. Don't hold back. I promise you, the White Legs won't.
0DI2000215	Once our path is clear, I'll give you everything you need to get back to the Mojave, but the Pine Creek tunnel must be collapsed behind us.
0DI2000216	It's the only way to delay the White Legs' pursuit long enough for us to get a head start. Good luck, and may God be with us.
0DI2000217	Even our Lord had doubts. Think it over, but listen to your heart. And do it quickly. We don't have much time.
0DI2000218	Hurry! There isn't any time to waste! We have to get out of here and collapse the tunnel behind us!
0DI2000219	Thanks. Even one dose can make a difference.
0DI2000220	Your generosity is...  well, I just can't thank you enough.
0DI2000221	That's... I'm so sorry. That's terrible. We've been having a lot of problems with the White Legs here in Zion lately.
0DI2000222	In fact, that's why I'm here. I'm Daniel, a New Canaanite missionary to this tribe, the Sorrows.
0DI2000223	It's important that you speak to my colleague, Joshua Graham, at the Dead Horses camp at Eastern Virgin. We can speak again later.
0DI2000224	Again, I'm very sorry for the deaths of your friends.
0DI2000225	Okay. Can you do me a favor and "just walk" down to Eastern Virgin?
0DI2000226	There's a group of Dead Horse warriors there with my colleague, Joshua Graham. I'd like you to talk to him about the route you took to enter Zion.
0DI2000227	We've had a lot of problems with White Legs in the area and I'd feel more comfortable if you spoke with him about the situation here. Thanks.
0DI2000228	I'm someone who's responsible for protecting a lot of innocent people from raiders and mercenaries who might try to take advantage of them.
0DI2000229	I think you need a little perspective on what the heck is going on in Zion. There's a Dead Horse warrior camp at Eastern Virgin. Get there.
0DI2000230	My friend Joshua Graham can fill you in on some of the trouble we've been having with White Legs in these parts. Listen to what he says.
0DI2000231	Now if you'll excuse me, I've had enough of your sass for one day.
0DI2000232	I appreciate the enthusiasm. There aren't a lot of people in the wasteland with kindness to spare for anyone who isn't kin.
0DI2000233	Since you've been poking around the valley, you might see more activity from the White Legs.
0DI2000234	One of the Sorrows hunters, Waking Cloud, has volunteered to help guide you through the valley. She has a special talent for staying out of sight.
0DI2000235	After this, it's just a matter of getting everyone out of here safe and sound. And hopefully you can head back to the Mojave without any more trouble.
0DI2000236	Listen, I understand that you want to go home. But we didn't ask you to come to Zion. As far as I'm concerned, you're an uninvited guest.
0DI2000237	In better times, I'd drop everything to help you out, but I have to ensure the safety of the Sorrows first.
0DI2000238	And don't think you're alone in this. One of the Sorrows, Waking Cloud, has volunteered to help you in the valley.
0DI2000239	She's an experienced hunter and has a special gift for staying out of sight when she needs to. Should make things easier for you.
0DI2000240	After that, all that's left is to evacuate the Sorrows safe and sound. I'll give you a map and supplies, everything you need to get back home.
0DI2000241	Okay. You better listen close because I'm not going to repeat myself. You were not invited here. This is not your home.
0DI2000242	We have what you might call a compulsion to help you on account of our beliefs, but if you continue to spit in our eye with insults and profanity...
0DI2000243	You'll find out what happens when our patience wears out. People died at New Canaan because we bickered and debated about what to do.
0DI2000244	That was a mistake. Complaining to me now, also a mistake. I'm not going to add sin upon sin by listening to your grumbling.
0DI2000245	You want the map? Get out in that valley. Help us. One of the Sorrows, Waking Cloud, will go with you. She knows how to get around the valley unseen.
0DI2000246	She's also a midwife and has three kids of her own, so she'll be more tolerant of your whining.
0DI2000247	[SUCCEEDED] I understand. But I hope you can understand why it's so important for us to leave here as soon as we can.
0DI2000248	I... we couldn't save New Canaan. This is a chance to make up for that, to start again. We can't fail.
0DI2000249	[FAILED] Corrected action is the most sincere form of apology.
0DI2000250	Fantastic.
0DI2000251	You just don't learn, do you?
0DI2000252	The New Canaanites interfered in their lives. We did that. And we've done it before, with others. Always with good intentions, but things go wrong.
0DI2000253	When that happens, we can't just abandon them, let them die at the hands of New Canaan's enemies.
0DI2000254	You're free to hold that opinion, but you're not responsible for these people. If I have to kill to prevent their blood from being spilled, so be it.
0DI2000255	There is an important difference between killing in defense and waging war. Even a Gentile like you should know that.
0DI2000256	Joshua is a living bible of all mankind's miseries of war! The debt he has levied through his actions, he repays every day!
0DI2000257	He is a monument both to God's unending forgiveness and to humanity's unfathomable capacity for cruelty. It's written on every inch of his body!
0DI2000258	When you look at him, do you only see a man of God? Beneath those bandages, he is burned flesh. As he burns, so does he consume everyone around him.
0DI2000259	Joshua wants to fight because the White Legs have stoked the naked flame inside of him. You, you see the light, but do not yet feel the heat.
0DI2000260	I can pray that you never will, but it isn't up to me and it isn't up to God. It's up to Joshua.
0DI2000261	Joshua doesn't just want to fight the White Legs. He wants to annihilate them. The stakes are too high for their tribe.
0DI2000262	Hurting them won't dissuade them. If they can't join Caesar's Legion, they'll die out in a generation. They've never learned how to survive.
0DI2000263	Food preservation, tanning, even basic hunting and cooking seem beyond them. They only survive by scavenging and raiding, but that can't last.
0DI2000264	They'll only stop if Joshua and the Dead Horses can kill their war chief and their entire war band. That's exactly what he intends to do.
0DI2000266	Try walking alongside a tribal child, a refugee, and holding her hand for three days because her parents were killed by NCR prospectors.
0DI2000267	After the prospectors have stalked the remainder of the tribe, they fire off a few shots to scare them, and the tribe bunches together for safety.
0DI2000268	A grenade comes rolling in and kills another six people. The only reason you survive is because someone else's body absorbed the shrapnel.
0DI2000269	You're left sprawled out on the ground with ringing in your ears and a little girl's hand in your hand because that's all that's left of her.
0DI2000270	After you've done that, if you can look me in the eye and tell me it's better to stand aside, maybe then I'll listen to you.
0DI2000271	Oh, well that's true. Waking Cloud is a talented midwife. She's certainly brought more children into the world than I have.
0DI2000272	But there are some problems she's never dealt with. One of them came up when she was having her third child and...
0DI2000273	I really didn't do much. I'm surprised she mentioned it.
0DI2000274	I did.
0DI2000275	Her three children are safe. They made it north weeks ago and met up with New Canaanites heading east.
0DI2000276	Her husband didn't make it. He died protecting their children from a White Leg attack.
0DI2000277	Do not tell Waking Cloud. She is one of the only Sorrows who can communicate easily with us and her tribe needs her to be strong right now.
0DI2000278	Good. Fine, whatever you'd like to know.
0DI2000279	To every thing, there is a season. Who are you or I to put this heavy burden on her now?
0DI2000280	And I don't like hiding it from her, but I'm between a rock and a hard place here.
0DI2000281	Her people... honestly, we all need her help. As much as it pains me to say it, there will be time to mourn later.
0DI2000282	Good. I'll tell her after we've helped the rest of the Sorrows reach safety.
0DI2000283	I know. You're right. I shouldn't have hidden it from her in the first place. I just... we can't fail here again.
0DI2000284	Zion can't become the next New Canaan. The Sorrows don't deserve that. They don't deserve any of this.
0DI2000285	Sometimes I look at them and wonder if they would have been better off if those old trails had stayed forgotten.
0DI2000286	If we had never found any of them. Tell Waking Cloud if you think that's best. I won't stop you.
0DI2000287	That's not an easy thing to be. I don't like doing this, but I can't see any good coming from telling Waking Cloud her husband died.
0DI2000288	You'll do what you'll do - I won't try to stop you. I'd ask only that you consider the repercussions of your actions.
0DI2000289	Good.
0DI2000290	As much as I wish people wouldn't touch alcohol or chems at all, I understand. Would you like me to help?
0DI2000291	Huh. You look fine to me. Physically, anyway.
0DI2000292	Yeah, you don't look too bad. Shouldn't take much to get you fixed up.
0DI2000293	It looks like you have a few nasty injuries, but nothing I haven't seen before. Want me to fix you up?
0DI2000294	Funny sense of humor. I've seen corpses with injuries less severe than yours. This might take a while.
0DI2000295	Even after all these years, it's still a problem for prospectors, caravan guards, couriers, and tribals. I can fix it.
0DI2000296	I can provide medical assistance. I can even use supplies that we have here, but I can't just sell what we have.
0DI2000297	I need to address problems as they arise, and most of those have to do with the Sorrows or Dead Horses.
0DI2000299	Have a seat. This may be a bit uncomfortable.
0DI2000300	I'd like to help you, but I have to be able to cover the cost of supplies. If you can find the money, come back and see me.
0DI2000301	Thanks. Hold still. You'll be better in no time.
0DI2000304	Well, I do need to cover the cost of supplies. Let me know if you find enough funds.
0DI2000308	That should cover it. Hold on. This shouldn't take long.
0DI2000309	I'm trying to make amends for allowing our problem to become their problem. The New Canaanites, I mean.
0DI2000310	The White Legs have always fought with us, and with Joshua returning, Caesar has motivated the White Legs to stamp out the New Canaanites entirely.
0DI2000311	That means the tribes we work with, too. It's already hap- I just want to prevent something terrible from happening to the Sorrows.
0DI2000312	[SUCCEEDED] I do. All right. I can provide you with supplies, but be frugal with them.
0DI2000313	[FAILED] I'm sure your caps are fine, but I have to hold on to the supplies I have here. Sorry.
0DI2000314	[SUCCEEDED] Fair enough. Just be careful and hopefully you won't need these.
0DI2000315	[FAILED] If you need healing, just ask me. I can help you with addiction, radiation poisoning, even broken bones. But I can't give you supplies.
0DI2000316	Thank you. If I can help you in some other way, don't hesitate to ask.
0DI2000317	A spiritual wasteland, yes. We believe that before this life, our souls existed elsewhere. And after we die, our souls will leave this world.
0DI2000318	During our time here, we have the burden of choice. The choices we make determine where we go in the spirit world, and how we will face judgment.
0DI2000319	New Canaanites believe, as many once did, that God was made flesh here on Earth as a man named Jesus Christ. He sacrificed his life to save us.
0DI2000320	Every sin, every terrible thing that you, me, or any one of us have done for all time, was washed away by his blood. We just have to accept his love.
0DI2000321	That's why we visit the tribes, to spread the good news. For all we know, we New Canaanites may be all that remains of Christ's followers.
0DI2000322	Yeah, Bishop Mordecai is...
0DI2000323	Sorry. Mordecai was my bishop. He was killed by White Legs during the attack on New Canaan. He was responsible for our congregation there.
0DI2000324	I don't know who my next bishop will be. But that's a problem for tomorrow. There are plenty of troubles here for us today.
0DI2000325	Yes. But not just White Legs. Raiders too. Prospectors. Slavers. Anyone who thinks they can exploit the ignorant and the innocent.
0DI2000326	We lost the Tar Walkers. And the Crazy Horns. We did our best, but we made mistakes. We paid for them, but they paid more.
0DI2000327	I'd like to get out from under that debt someday. Until then, it's enough to stop ourselves from getting deeper in the hole.
0DI2000328	To remove the Sorrows from harm's way. I have to give credit to the White Legs for finding their way here, though I imagine many died in the process.
0DI2000329	But they can't follow us east, not into the Grand Staircase. They don't know how to live off of the land. We head there, we can find some safety.
0DI2000330	We lost it. Our community, everything. But the past is gone. We have to look forward.
0DI2000331	Look, I've got a lot to do here. My personal relationship... it's not important right now. Can't see how it concerns you, anyway.
0DI2000332	[SUCCEEDED] True enough. We can't escape it no matter how hard we try. Best we can do is own up, trust in the Lord to forgive.
0DI2000333	Joshua was gone, so were a lot of the other New Canaanites. White Legs must have been watching for a long while, counting who remained.
0DI2000334	We didn't think the White Legs were a real threat. Maybe it was overconfidence. Maybe sloth. Either way, we didn't see them coming.
0DI2000335	They attacked at night. They killed without regard to age or infirmity. Armed or unarmed. They beat children to-
0DI2000336	Beat them to death in their beds while they were sleeping. And now we're all that's left. Maybe thirty of us. Pride goeth before destruction.
0DI2000337	[FAILED] As far as you're concerned, it is. This really isn't the time to talk about it, all things considered.
0DI2000338	Heh. That's actually a better response than I usually get from wastelanders. No offense.
0DI2000339	Tell you what. There's a lot going on right now but why don't you take this. Read it. Maybe you'll hate it. Maybe you'll be bored.
0DI2000340	But if you have questions, assuming we get through all this, let me know. It used to be my job to answer those questions. Maybe it will be again.
0DI2000341	Good news is an amazing thing in this world we've unmade. We're so used to going to sleep with nightmares that we can't imagine waking up to a dream.
0DI2000342	But that's what we believe, every word of it. It's the cornerstone of our faith and how we choose to live.
0DI2000343	With every step you take, you put one foot in front of the other and know that you'll be pulled back down to this Earth.
0DI2000344	We know that God is watching over us, waiting for us to come back home. To us, there's no difference. Walking and living. It's all belief, all faith.
0DI2000345	We teach them practical skills for this life and we prepare them for what's to come.
0DI2000346	The Sorrows could master all the wonders of the Old World. conquer the Great Basin north to south. But without God's love, they would have nothing.
0DI2000347	It is shelter in the storm, food in times of hunger, warmth and light in the cold and darkness. What can compare to that in value and versatility?
0DI2000348	You don't agree. That's your choice. It can be their choice, too. No one is forced to follow the narrow path.
0DI2000349	[SUCCEEDED] I never thought I'd be in charge of anything. Don't know why. Bishop Mordecai was old. He had been sick for years.
0DI2000350	He couldn't walk anymore. It wasn't a problem for the rest of us. He made it out to be more trouble than it really was. Just his way, I guess.
0DI2000351	When the White Legs came... he was upstairs. We couldn't get him out in time. The house caught fire at the base and worked its way up. Fast.
0DI2000352	He didn't die of smoke. I wish he had. Sometimes I wake up and for a minute or two, I think all of it was a dream. But it's not. It wasn't.
0DI2000353	I wish all of this were some fevered vision of what could have been. Instead of what is, what we let happen.
0DI2000354	[FAILED] It's understandable, but this is something for me to work out with the Lord. And I hope you can understand that.
0DI2000355	Thanks. What would you like to know?
0DI2000356	I'd like you to drop it. It's a private matter.
0DI2000358	I've already explained to them that we're leaving! They've accepted it! What is Joshua going to tell them about being a warrior?
0DI2000359	What are you going to tell them about how to live with themselves after they got lost in the moment, killed someone who didn't deserve to die?
0DI2000360	Or does that not matter? Is that just an acceptable consquence if it means holding on to this valley?
0DI2000361	Maybe there is no place left in this world for mercy. But even if it tramples me into the dust, I will never accept it. And I will never condone it.
0DI2000362	Joshua must be waiting for you. I'll stay here with the others as I told them I would.
0DI2000363	No. This is how we made the world. And we brought it to them.
0DI2000364	Joshua must be waiting for you. I'll stay here with the others.
0DI2000365	Oh. Ah. Of course. How stupid of me. They probably also think Mary is the mother and Jesus is the child.
0DI2000366	No wonder they picked up on things so easily. I guess it just goes to show how difficult it is to communicate sometimes.
0DI2000368	Thanks. That will help a good deal.
0DI2000369	That's very generous of you. Five doses will help a great deal.
0DI2000371	Our advance scouts leave chalk signs to mark places rich with game. I'm not a full scout yet, so I follow the marks and guide the hunters.
0DI2000372	Of course you do - I understand. You know, I heard stories about rangers from Back When - they carried lightning sticks that stunned the animals.
0DI2000373	I've never been to any of the Back When places, but they might have left one when they died.
0DI2000374	You might also try luring the baby out with some banana yucca - the mountain Bighorners love the stuff.
0DI2000375	Joshua Graham - he leads our tribe. Thanks to him, the Dead Horses are strong, and safe from our enemies.
0DI2000376	He'll want to talk to anyone coming up from south-ways. Guess that means just you, now. Come, I can take you to him.
0DI2000377	I mean the Lands Beyond the Valley - the place where the cities never fell. Where people don't live in tribes and forage just to survive.
0DI2000378	Joshua keeps saying it isn't paradise out there, but how can it not be, compared to this?
0DI2000379	Sorry, I'm getting distracted - Joshua will want to know about you - please, go to our camp on the Eastern Virgin. Tell him how you came to be here.
0DI2000380	Lah, I meant no offense - if you won't talk to me, talk to Joshua Graham - he's at our camp on the Eastern Virgin.
0DI2000381	Dead Horses mark ourselves to commemorate our hunts. When a hunter takes a great beast, or when a youth goes on his first hunt, he gets a tattoo.
0DI2000382	We came up in the Land of the Dead Horse, though why the Back When folks called it that I got no hint.
0DI2000383	We raided, we fought... we lost. Our enemies drove us back into Zion, and we would have died if it hadn't been for Joshua. Joshua, and his Caesar.
0DI2000384	If it wasn't for Joshua, the Dead Horses would still be the whipping boys of the Zion Valley.
0DI2000385	He taught us how to hold our territory, to protect ourselves. He guided us away from Caesar, and showed us how Caesar would have destroyed us.
0DI2000386	Only a little - I was very young. He was... different. Prouder, yes, but harder, crueler, more driven. Really, I was terrified of him. We all were.
0DI2000387	When he came back, I almost didn't believe he was the same man. He was humbler. He wanted to protect, not destroy.
0DI2000388	Little bit. I met some of their missionaries a few times, but I've never been to their city. Joshua could tell you more - or Daniel, I imagine.
0DI2000389	We decorate our clubs with them to honor Joshua Graham. They were the weapons of his old tribe, so now they are ours.
0DI2000390	Can't say they seem that dangerous to me, but Joshua says they "won the West."
0DI2000391	Yeah? Hey, thanks - most of the hunters don't listen when I tell them the problem.
0DI2000392	Just one thing - try not to kill any Bighorners if you can, yeah? You'll drive the herd off, and we'll have to range farther on our hunts.
0DI2000393	That's great! I'll help any way I can.
0DI2000394	Oh sure, that's just what the hunters said. Well... I guess let me know if you change your mind.
0DI2000395	Well... because they're our enemies. What else would we do? They take our land, they kill our scouts, they poach our hunting grounds.
0DI2000396	When Joshua first came to us, he was servant to a man he called Caesar. He led his master's armies, and we were ready to follow him into war.
0DI2000397	Then he lost his master's army to a tribe called Enseeyar, the Sunset People. When he returned, he was as you saw him - burned, broken, but changed.
0DI2000398	He led us away from Caesar, led us to our own destiny in Zion.
0DI2000399	Goot sists. We head east, then. Joshua is at our tribe's camp in the Eastern Virgin.
0DI2000400	Well, before he left, he didn't have those bandages all over his face. That tell you something?
0DI2000401	You see his face, you'll understand.
0DI2000402	I don't know, he doesn't talk about it much. Maybe - but how can two civilized tribes fight over something as small as a dam?
0DI2000403	Hah! ...Really? That's... my gods. Must be some mighty civilized folks who built that.
0DI2000404	Now you sound like Joshua. He always tells me the tribal life is better, that I should stay here and forget the outside world.
0DI2000405	Sorry - Joshua was pretty clear. Get you to Daniel, then come on home. You can take it up with him if you'd like.
0DI2000406	I will. Goot gonen, ahk iss.
0DI2000407	Hey, it's not my fault! And what's this "minion" stuff? Dahs eet - see you around, "civilized" man.
0DI2000408	Hey, it's not my fault! And what's this "minion" stuff? Dahs eet - see you around, "civilized" woman.
0DI2000409	This is the eastern fork of the Virgin River, and it's the place we Dead Horses call home. Joshua says it is a temple to God's glory on earth.
0DI2000410	We can talk more about it later, though - it's not smart to keep Joshua waiting.
0DI2000411	I'm called Follows-Chalk. Joshua sent me to scout for any outsiders coming up from the Southern Passage.
0DI2000412	We can talk more about that later, though - it's not smart to keep Joshua waiting.
0DI2000413	Joshua will answer all your questions. He doesn't like being kept waiting, though - go talk to him as soon as you can.
0DI2000414	I won't keep you. Maybe we talk again after.
0DI2000415	But... they were White Legs! The enemy! You are a very strange outsider, but I think Joshua will want to speak to you anyways.
0DI2000416	Nasty bunch of raiders from up by Great Salt Lake. White Legs killed your friends at the Southern Passage.
0DI2000417	Not many survive White Leg raids - not even by running. Joshua will want to hear about what happened to you.
0DI2000418	Is it? I always heard it was rather large outside the valley. Well, wherever he is, I hope he's well.
0DI2000420	I'm sure he will want to talk to you. You can find him just south of here, in the Angel Cave.
0DI2000421	Goot! I really wasn't looking forward to talking to Joshua if you turned me down.
0DI2000422	Hey... as long as we're traveling together, think you could help me out with a little wildlife problem?
0DI2000423	Let's move then.
0DI2000424	I don't think he'll like that answer much. You change your mind, I'll be around the Dead Horses camp. Goot gonen.
0DI2000425	Hmm... you might try luring the baby out with some banana yucca. These Bighorners go crazy for the stuff.
0DI2000426	Goot sists. Maybe while you're there you can tell me about where you came from, yeah?
0DI2000427	That's what Joshua said. White Legs came down from Great Salt Lake in force - fell on New Canaan before they could mount a defense.
0DI2000428	Joshua found some of the survivors led by a man named Daniel. Most of them have fled the valley, but Daniel stayed on with the Sorrows tribe.
0DI2000429	He and Joshua have been arguing over whether to stand and fight the White Legs or take the Sorrows and the Dead Horses out of the valley.
0DI2000430	That's the weird part - normally the White Legs keep to the Great Salt Lake. I don't know what brought them down this far south.
0DI2000431	I, umm, I haven't told him yet. Never had the growans.
0DI2000432	You'd do that? Sure, sounds smart to me. He might not get so mad at you.
0DI2000433	He said that? Well, I guess you have been out there more recently than he has. So... what's your advice?
0DI2000434	Oh. Well, I guess that's about what I could expect from him. I'd like a minute alone to think about this. Dank ni.
0DI2000435	Really? He said that? Hoo! I'm going to do it. After all this is over, I'm going to go explore civilization!
0DI2000436	Dank ni, ahk iss - I never would have had the growans to ask him myself.
0DI2000437	A job as a singer? Then it really is true....
0DI2000438	Lots of them around the valley - places built by the folk from Back When. You'll know them when you see them - scouts mark them with hand prints.
0DI2000439	The hand prints are a warning to keep out - angry ghosts live inside. Not that I believe in angry ghosts. They're just spooky old places. Right?
0DI2000440	Lots of Back When places to choose from, but for the things we need, best to start with the really closed up places.
0DI2000441	Three I know of: a building down by the river called a "Fishing Lodge," the old ranger station in the northwest, and the general store right by it.
0DI2000442	Closer to home, might be something you can salvage from the place where the little ones fell, just west of the Eastern Virgin.
0DI2000443	I see. Well, thanks for your telling. I'd like a minute alone to think about this. Dank ni.
0DI2000444	Really? You think so? Hoo! I'm going to do it. After all this is over, I'm going to go explore civilization!
0DI2000446	In the river, there's a twisted pile of metal and glass, all full of bones. Joshua says they were scouts, but they looked awful small to me.
0DI2000447	Lots of that old stuff, how do you say it... electronics? Maybe you could use some of it.
0DI2000448	Yah, and they're still back there! Let's go get them!
0DI2000449	Goot sists. Let's show them what we're made of!
0DI2000450	You're not going to fight? But... okay. You better come with me, then. Joshua will want to see you.
0DI2000451	[FAILED] No! He and his tribe have worked hard for their wages. Who am I to deny them?
0DI2000452	God be with you.
0DI2000453	Happy Trails. I remember. They were good friends.
0DI2000454	I have bad news for your employers. New Canaan was destroyed, its citizens scattered. All because of the White Legs. And Caesar, of course.
0DI2000455	The White Legs want to join the Legion. Caesar's rite of passage is the destruction of the New Canaanites, almost assuredly because of me.
0DI2000456	The good news is that we can help you find your way back. Daniel, one of the other New Canaanites, has made many maps of the region.
0DI2000457	The bad news is that we can't help you right now. Not with everything that's going on.
0DI2000458	[SUCCEEDED] He has a debt to pay for what he's done and I've come to collect. And so he's chosen to cower in the water like a dumb animal.
0DI2000459	He never had any dignity to begin with. None of them did.
0DI2000460	But for your sake... for the Sorrows' sake, I'll let him die on his feet.
0DI2000461	Stand up and look at what's come for you!
0DI2000462	God's will.
0DI2000463	Even though you made your way in, there's no easy way back. Without a map, you'll die in the wilderness.
0DI2000464	Daniel, one of our missionaries, can help you, but you've caught us at an... inconvenient time. We're under continual threat from the White Legs.
0DI2000465	You're a good neighbor to us. We all go through periods of darkness. In such times, we can turn to the Lord, but it's good to have friends.
0DI2000466	Daniel and I need Pre-War tools to help us navigate beyond Zion. Should we need to evacuate, these instruments will be vital to us.
0DI2000467	Normally, we would have some of the Dead Horses or Sorrows look for them, but many Pre-War buildings in the valley are taboo. They won't go inside.
0DI2000468	There are only so many ways you could have entered Zion from the south. You descended by routes that you cannot safely ascend to return to the Mojave.
0DI2000469	I'm not telling you this as a trick. Whether you want to help us or not, you can't get back without Daniel's assistance.
0DI2000470	I'm sure he'll be willing to assist you, but we have other responsibilities at the moment.
0DI2000471	There are many reasons why that would be a bad idea. I will illuminate three.
0DI2000472	First, do not believe that because Daniel is a missionary he is incapable of or unwilling to defend himself.
0DI2000473	Second, if you harm Daniel or any of the Sorrows or Dead Horses, I will find you. Make no mistake. God willing, you will not leave this valley.
0DI2000474	Lastly, waging war against good people is bad for the soul. This may not seem important to you now, but it's the most important thing I've said.
0DI2000475	We are responsible for leading and protecting the Sorrows and Dead Horses. They are smart people, but not as worldly as you or I.
0DI2000476	I am preparing the Dead Horses for war and Daniel is preparing the Sorrows for... other things.
0DI2000477	The Sorrows believe in a spirit that lives in the caves, say the spirit punished them once for trespassing.
0DI2000478	They put special marks around the cave entrances to keep people out. It doesn't work on the White Legs, of course, but the Dead Horses are spooked.
0DI2000479	Thank you. Follows-Chalk can help you find your way around the valley.
0DI2000480	He's inexperienced, but he knows enough of our language to ignore the taboos about Pre-War buildings.
0DI2000481	Thank you. Now obviously, taboos against Pre-War buildings won't be a matter for you - but take caution when you go rooting around in them.
0DI2000482	The choice is yours, of course, but you're not going to find a way back to the Mojave without our help.
0DI2000483	Go with God, brother.
0DI2000484	Go with God, sister.
0DI2000485	The White Legs didn't just force my people out of New Canaan. They butchered everyone who wasn't fast enough to get away.
0DI2000486	The elderly, the ill, children. Those who stopped to help the wounded. It made no difference to them. They can't be reasoned with, the White Legs.
0DI2000487	Daniel believes that if we leave, if the Sorrows leave, the White Legs will stop. He doesn't understand what this kind of tribe is like.
0DI2000489	Living in willful ignorance is an ugly thing, but God often speaks loudest in the wild places of his creation, like Zion.
0DI2000490	Zion is a place, and a state of being, that has been lost to us several times in the past. Each loss is a new fall of man.
0DI2000491	And after each fall, we weep in strange new lands and dream of Zion, dream of visiting vengeance upon those who took it from us.
0DI2000492	But this is the waking world in which we live. There is no need to cry, no need to dream. We can act now and stop the White Legs here.
0DI2000493	Given those two choices, yes. In the best of all possible worlds, they would just leave us in peace. But they won't.
0DI2000494	I don't enjoy killing, but when done righteously, it's just a chore, like any other.
0DI2000495	Practiced hands make for short work. And the good Lord knows there's much to be done here.
0DI2000496	Happy are those who do the work of the Lord. Zion belongs to God and the people of God. It is a natural temple and monument to his glory.
0DI2000497	When our Lord entered the temple and found it polluted by money-changers and beasts, did he ask them to leave? Did he cry? Did he simply walk away?
0DI2000498	No. He drove them out. It is one thing to forgive a slap across my cheek, but an insult to the Lord requires... no, it demands correction.
0DI2000499	Daniel and I don't agree on everything, but in our hearts, we both want what's best for the Sorrows and Dead Horses.
0DI2000500	You've seen what the White Legs do, and I think you know what has to be done. If Daniel hears it from someone other than me, well...
0DI2000501	Zion may not be lost to us after all.
0DI2000502	They're still God's children, but if they turn against their brothers and sisters, won't listen to reason...
0DI2000503	If they pollute the Lord's temples on Earth, like Zion, who are we to stand by and let them continue?
0DI2000504	Daniel does not yet see things the way we do. He is the John to our Matthew and Mark. When you have a moment, speak with him.
0DI2000505	There may still be time to save Zion from the White Legs, to keep God's children here, in this living temple.
0DI2000506	Thank you. It will be for the best.
0DI2000507	Of course. Think on it, and look in your heart. The light of the mind alone cannot dispel the whole world's darkness.
0DI2000508	The Sorrows need help. We brought the White Legs here, the New Canaanites. This is their home, Zion, God's gift to them.
0DI2000509	In abandoning it, we will gain nothing and will lose more than you realize. Please think about this, and look in your heart.
0DI2000510	The light of the mind alone cannot burn away all darkness.
0DI2000511	God told Moses that the tribes of Cain would not be welcome in Zion. The White Legs are as close as I have seen, beyond hope, beyond redemption.
0DI2000512	But if the Sorrows die in a state of ignorance, their salvation may be delayed as well, passing from life in this world to a spiritual prison.
0DI2000513	We have a responsibilty to protect this place and those who have come to dwell in it. If you feel the same way, speak with Daniel.
0DI2000514	There may yet be time to save Zion from those who are too ignorant to understand what they have come to destroy.
0DI2000515	Then you must bear witness of this revelation to Daniel. The obviousness of it escapes him.
0DI2000516	We both desire a non-violent solution to this problem. Where we differ is that only one of us believes it is possible.
0DI2000517	Speak your heart to Daniel when the opportunity presents itself. There may yet be time to save Zion.
0DI2000518	I and the Dead Horses are prepared to do what must be done to protect Zion from the White Legs.
0DI2000519	And though Daniel won't accept it yet, there are many Sorrows who are also prepared. They may not be warriors, but this is their home.
0DI2000520	If you have a chance to speak with Daniel about this, ask him to consider defending Zion instead of abandoning it.
0DI2000521	He has good intentions, but I fear that if we evacuate the Sorrows from this place, it will be lost to them, and us, forever.
0DI2000522	You're not so certain. Fair enough. We all have doubts.
0DI2000523	Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. But you can be a Thomas for now. Fight the White Legs enough and you'll see the truth.
0DI2000524	I just hope that by the time you understand, there will still be time to convince Daniel that we have to fight for Zion to save it, and the Sorrows.
0DI2000525	Then as a Gentile, you should find this to be even more beneficial. If the Sorrows stay in Zion, you will always have a link to New Canaan.
0DI2000526	If the Sorrows leave Zion, so too do the New Canaanites. What's more, you'll have more White Legs coming farther south.
0DI2000527	You may not be concerned over matters of faith, but this is a case where faith and practicality coincide.
0DI2000528	No one wants the White Legs here. We just need to convince Daniel that it's our responsibility to ensure that doesn't happen.
0DI2000529	Talk to Daniel about fighting the White Legs. He wants to evacuate the valley, believes it is best for the Sorrows, physically and spiritually.
0DI2000530	He knows I disagree, but believes my desire to fight is the result of my... history of violence.
0DI2000531	Perhaps if he heard an argument from you, he could be convinced. In any case, it's important enough to try.
0DI2000532	I understand. The safest way for you to resolve this is to help me and the Dead Horses defeat the White Legs.
0DI2000533	Daniel wants to evacuate the Sorrows from the valley. I think this will be much more difficult for everyone, you included.
0DI2000534	You can rationalize, if you'd like. A lucky coincidence of my faith and your pragmatism leading to different goals by the same means.
0DI2000535	But you'll have to help convince Daniel, because I can't do it alone. The good Lord knows I've tried.
0DI2000536	In a world filled with misery and uncertainty, it is a great comfort to know that, in the end, there is light in the darkness.
0DI2000537	Every day, we move closer to our judgment. We must do our best to walk in the footsteps of our Lord and teach others how to do the same.
0DI2000538	For many of us, the road is a difficult one, but the path is always there for us to follow, no matter how many times we may fall.
0DI2000539	Whether there is a God or not, his existence doesn't depend on what you believe or what I say.
0DI2000540	There is much to be skeptical of in this world, so it no longer surprises me to learn how many people don't really believe in anything.
0DI2000541	But I believe that our Lord was made flesh as Jesus Christ and died to redeem me. And you. And the Sorrows. Even the White Legs. Everyone.
0DI2000542	I know it may be hard for you to accept or even to understand. In my heart, I believe that though I am a sinner, I have been saved.
0DI2000543	And I believe there is something beyond this rock and this air and this water around us, something more that is waiting for us.
0DI2000544	I have been baptized twice, once in water, once in flame. I will carry the fire of the holy spirit inside until I stand before my Lord for judgment.
0DI2000545	Every day. Some days are... harder than others.
0DI2000546	They attack everyone who isn't a White Leg, especially caravans. They don't know how to survive on their own, so they have to raid.
0DI2000547	But as for why they are here, they are trying to wipe us out. All of us.
0DI2000548	They want to join Caesar's Legion, and they can only prove their worth by destroying the New Canaanites and everyone we shelter.
0DI2000549	The valley belongs to God, but no. The Dead Horses live at Dead Horse Point, up the Colorado River. They came here because I asked them to.
0DI2000550	Before I... returned to the fold, I visited them years earlier. I looked much different then, but I left an impression on them.
0DI2000551	I taught them how to hunt more efficiently, how to maintain their weapons and Pre-War equipment. When I returned, they showed their appreciation.
0DI2000552	The Sorrows have many skilled hunters among them, but no warriors. They have not had to deal with war or raiders for decades.
0DI2000553	Even though they can hunt a full-grown Yao Guai, they don't know how to deal with the White Legs. That's why we're here.
0DI2000554	We wear more clothing than them and understand more about technology, but we're still a tribe, a linked family of families.
0DI2000555	The Boneyard, Phoenix, New Vegas, they're just places, metal and stone. New Canaan dies, but the tribe lives on.
0DI2000556	When the walls come tumbling down, when you lose everything you have, you always have family. And your family always has tribe.
0DI2000558	He's a butcher. Believe me, I know the godless fire that burns in his heart. I've been burned by it myself.
0DI2000559	He's not the kind to let his subordinates do all the killing. No, he likes to have a hand in it, with that spear of his.
0DI2000560	He's fashioned himself an abomination before the eyes of the Lord. I'm happy to serve as an instrument of divine justice.
0DI2000561	Most don't. It's been hundreds of years since the war. They've developed their own languages.
0DI2000562	Take the Dead Horses. We think they were originally refugees from a place called "Res," east of the Grand Canyon.
0DI2000563	They speak a combination of Res and a language spoken by travelers who were visiting Res when the bombs fell. Over time, the two languages blended.
0DI2000564	I was a translator years ago, but it's hard to keep up with all of the tribal variations.
0DI2000566	I was born in Ogden, what people came to call New Canaan. Things were more peaceful when I was growing up.
0DI2000567	When I was a young man, I went out into the world to do missionary work as all New Canaanites do.
0DI2000568	I traveled along the Long 15 and followed 89 south into Arizona. Along the way, I met two men from a group called the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0DI2000569	Edward Sallow and Bill Calhoun. They came to teach the tribes. Calhoun was a good man. Edward was the one who got us into trouble down the road.
0DI2000570	I want to take from them what they took from me, from my family. In this life. I want them to suffer. I want all of them to die in fear and pain.
0DI2000571	I want to have my revenge. Against him. Against Caesar. I want to call it my own, to make my anger God's anger. To justify the things I've done.
0DI2000572	Sometimes I tell myself that these wild fires never stop burning. But I'm the one who starts them. Not God. Not them.
0DI2000573	I can always see it in my mind. The warmth and the heat. It will always be a part of me. But not today.
0DI2000574	[SUCCEEDED] Go. Get out of here. Go back. Back to the Great Salt Lake.
0DI2000575	[FAILED] For injuries I suffered long ago.
0DI2000576	[FAILED] I am the right hand of the Lord and the instrument of his vengeance!
0DI2000577	No, not then. Back then he was just Edward. Smart man. Young, but we all were. We thought we could hike into the Grand Canyon and talk to Blackfoots.
0DI2000578	We did, and the Blackfoots were friendly enough at first, but eventually... I've thought back to that day so many times. I must have mistranslated.
0DI2000579	Something must have been mixed up, because the Blackfoots decided we weren't going to leave. The rest is history, assuming Edward hasn't changed it.
0DI2000580	This way lies the path to hell. Edw- Caesar needed me to translate. Translation became giving orders. Giving orders became leading in battle.
0DI2000581	Leading in battle became training, punishing, terrorizing. A series of small mistakes before a great fall.
0DI2000582	And I stayed in that darkness until after Hoover Dam. After I failed Caesar and he had me burned alive, thrown into the Grand Canyon.
0DI2000583	I survived because the fire inside burned brighter than the fire around me. I fell down into that dark chasm, but the flame burned on and on.
0DI2000584	The next morning, I woke up and crawled out of the northern edge of the Grand Canyon, that cursed place. It took me three months to reach New Canaan.
0DI2000585	It was as though the prodigal son had returned. They welcomed me like I had never left, never done anything to shame them.
0DI2000586	The fire that had kept me alive was love. Their love. God's love. I will never be able to repay the debt I owe to them, but I must try.
0DI2000587	[SUCCEEDED] You are kind to offer, but no, there's nothing you can do. We don't use chems, but I learned long ago that I'm immune to their effects.
0DI2000588	It never stops burning. My skin. Every day, I have to unwind the bandages and replace them with fresh ones.
0DI2000589	Exposing my body to the air is like living through it again. But it's better to be clean than comfortable.
0DI2000590	I try not to involve myself with matters of the Mojave anymore. All I know is from before the Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI2000591	Better than Caesar, but that's not a high standard. Too much love of money and ownership, not enough love of God and giving.
0DI2000592	Any society that derives its power and authority from the will of man alone lives apart from God and will crumble in the end.
0DI2000593	Follows-Chalk needs more guidance in his life. Just not from me.
0DI2000594	I had heard of him, but when we were preparing to enter the Mojave, he didn't seem relevant to what was happening.
0DI2000595	From what I've learned since Hoover Dam, he handled the Mojave tribes in a fashion not entirely dissimilar from Caesar. It's too bad.
0DI2000596	Love the sinner, hate the sin. With Caesar, it's often very difficult to see through all of that sin to the person inside.
0DI2000597	I can say that we were both lucky that NCR's supply lines and land routes north of Mojave Outpost were destroyed before the Battle of Hoover Dam.
0DI2000598	Something bad happened near Death Valley, at a place called the Divide. NCR couldn't cut across anymore and it slowed down their reinforcements.
0DI2000599	Terrible storms ripped entire companies apart before they even got to Nevada soil. The aftermath of Hoover Dam could have been even worse for Caesar.
0DI2000600	I don't know for certain, and I don't think NCR knows, either. Whatever happened at the Divide was too much for them to handle.
0DI2000601	Our frumentarii told us what they saw. Only fools and madmen would march into a place like that. All roads wind down to the same spot, the grave.
0DI2000602	They said all that's left there is a gaping wound cut into the Earth, cursed and damned. No place for God-fearing folk.
0DI2000603	Not all of them. But they couldn't take 127 north to get around the mountains.
0DI2000604	As if Death Valley weren't enough, they had the Divide and Big Empty to deal with.
0DI2000605	From what the Legion's explorers reported, the Big Empty may as well have been a wall to any living thing approaching it.
0DI2000606	Whatever you tell him, I'm sure it will be fine.
0DI2000607	It's still his choice to make. I just want him to make it without looking to me for approval. He's a man. He can make his own decisions.
0DI2000608	Then let him know. Follows-Chalk needs more guidance in his life. I'd prefer it not come from me.
0DI2000609	If people want to look to me for how to fight, I will show them how. I believe God put me on this Earth for that very reason.
0DI2000610	But to live like me, think like me... no. There are better people for them to look to for such things.
0DI2000611	I have to admit, it's hard to believe. That even after all he did to me, all he tried to do to find and erase me from this world, he went first.
0DI2000612	No doubt this will be good for the Mojave. I can only hope Arizona and the tribes don't suffer as the Legion falls apart around them.
0DI2000613	Hmm. Good. You're doing God's work, whether you believe it or not.
0DI2000614	The Lord shall reveal all things in good time.
0DI2000615	I think only Caesar can lead the Legion. I've never met anyone who could take his place. I couldn't. I never had a mind for logistics.
0DI2000616	I don't know Lanius, but from what I've heard, he has no interest in leading anyone unless it's in battle.
0DI2000617	No. The Legion dies with Caesar. What follows now are just the last steps of a man who does not yet realize that he's walking dead.
0DI2000618	The Dead Horses are capable scouts. Nothing passes into or out of Zion without my hearing of it.
0DI2000619	What's it sound like I'm saying? If I was saying what you said I was saying, then yeah, I said it!
0DI2000620	I was walking along, minding my own, and up pops one of them Brotherhoods. He yells "Hand over that laser rifle, asshole!"
0DI2000621	So I hand it over, just to make him think I'm scared! But really I'm not! I never am!
0DI2000622	Before he knows what hit him, I draw my 11mm machinegun and BAM! BAM! Right through the eyeslit in his helmet! D.O.A.!
0DI2000623	[SUCCEEDED] There so is! Or it was a 9mm or a 10, I don't know! Don't care!
0DI2000624	Said I was good at killing shit up! Never said I was good with numbers!
0DI2000625	[FAILED] Whatever. When you're me - a Deadeye - shots like that ain't nothing special. It's just what I do.
0DI2000626	Hell yeah it's quite a story! But I'm quite a man, so stories like that follow me everywhere!
0DI2000627	Or there was the time one of them Steel Brotherhood assholes made the mistake of messing with me! Last mistake he ever made!
0DI2000628	[SUCCEEDED] No, no, you heard me right. "Deathjaws!" They're like Deathclaws - but bigger teeth!
0DI2000629	[FAILED] Just how green are you? Everybody heard of Deathjaws. You better hope I'm around if you run into one.
0DI2000630	Then I guess this dumb fucker's armor musta been... D-series or something!
0DI2000631	All I know is, he died up real dead when I killed him, okay?
0DI2000632	Hey! That's - man, what a bitch! I was just being friendly!
0DI2000633	[SUCCEEDED] Hey! That's - man, what a bitch! I was just being friendly!
0DI2000634	I don't think so, honey! You won't be able to resist!
0DI2000635	[FAILED] Ricky travels light on purpose, asshole! If you're looking for a slave, ask someone else!
0DI2000636	[SUCCEEDED] I travel light on purpose, okay? But if the price is right, I'll tell Jed I'm carrying less - so you can carry more. What's your offer?
0DI2000637	Goddammit, I didn't say nothing about using Psycho!
0DI2000638	But, uh... Just talking hypno-theoretically here... Got any suggestions?
0DI2000639	All right, all right - I am a little light. How many hits you holding?
0DI2000640	Fixer? Never said I wanted to kick the habit!
0DI2000641	Guess I can use it when I run out of the good stuff. How much?
0DI2000642	Fine! You win, asshole! Enjoy leading the expedition into a fucking ambush! Hope you all die!
0DI2000643	One lousy hit? That'll cover me for an hour! Hand it over.
0DI2000644	Two hits? Ain't gonna last long. Fine, hand it over.
0DI2000645	Three hits? Like that's gonna hold me? Fine, I'll take them.
0DI2000646	That'll last me a while! Nice. Now take your caps and fuck off.
0DI2000647	Ten hits'll last me a good while. Worth every cap. Now fuck off.
0DI2000648	That much for a dose? Fucking robbery!
0DI2000649	All right, here's your money! Don't spend it all one place!
0DI2000650	Why'd you bring it up, then? When the withdrawal hits and I feel like killing something, I'll know where to start!
0DI2000651	That's right. Stick your nose where it don't belong and it's gonna get stung.
0DI2000652	You got a deal. You're lucky he trusts me.
0DI2000655	No sweat off my tits, asshole. Guess you better start deciding what gear you're going to leave behind.
0DI2000656	[SUCCEEDED] Go ahead! Your word against mine, fucko! See what happens!
0DI2000657	[FAILED] Yeah, too bad one of them is worn by a total fucking idiot!
0DI2000658	[SUCCEEDED] Bullshit! Ain't nothing wrong with my Pit-Boy! I mean Pip-Boy!
0DI2000659	[FAILED] Fat chance! Like I got time to bring you up to speed. Fuck that.
0DI2000660	Look, this is a sweet gig for me! Don't go fucking it up! What are you after, anyways?
0DI2000661	Hey hey hey, why you got to go and be like that! Fuck!
0DI2000662	I travel light on purpose, okay? But fine, I'll tell Jed I'm carrying less so you can carry more. What an asshole.
0DI2000663	Forget it? Uh uh. Ricky remembers everything! But he keeps his secrets, too!
0DI2000664	Well, yeah, okay. You caught me.
0DI2000665	Yeah, so don't bring it up again!
0DI2000668	Fine, just keep it to yourself, all right? Don't be such a fucking jerk about it.
0DI2000669	[SUCCEEDED] You speak. I listen. Kill you, maybe I not. Maybe.
0DI2000670	[FAILED] Weak words you talk! Now you see strong spears better than weak words!
0DI2000671	You mock White Legs! You die now!
0DI2000672	We leave, but always fight, White Legs! We strong warriors for Caesar!
0DI2000673	Yoocan no nikumpa me! Deyai-yoo!
0DI2000674	...I go. But rebuild my tribe, and come we back stronger than before!
0DI2000675	Sorrows are weak. We go, find true warriors to test us!
0DI2000676	This good fight will be!
0DI2000677	Ha! Yes, end!
0DI2000678	Baika-ker! You devil!
0DI2000679	Him hear you. You talk!
0DI2000680	<White Bird stares at you wordlessly.>
0DI2000681	These roots make sacred vision tea. You drink, you see path before you. Ready?
0DI2000682	Drink. Tea is strong. Tea is bitter. Wisdom is strong. Wisdom is bitter. You see?
0DI2000683	Tea will wait. Me? Maybe not.
0DI2000684	Then visions of truth are at an end. Will you learn from truth? Maybe yes. Maybe no. Only for you to decide.
0DI2000685	Here, take. Gift, to remind you of visions. Use well. Or sell to curio trader. Either way, says much about you.
0DI2000686	Go! Return maybe yes, return maybe no. But go.
0DI2000687	Take drugs! Kill a bear!
0DI2000688	Seek medicine plant! Return with Sacred Datura Root! Receive visions of truth, they guide you!
0DI2000689	Spirits guide you whether you listen or not. Smarter to listen, hmm?
0DI2000691	You go to cave. Find Ghost of She. Lay ghost to rest. This your quest. Bring peace where was strife. Go!
0DI2000692	Sad story. Not for your ears from my lips. Ask midwife. She speak to your ears.
0DI2000693	I do not know this "survivalist," but the Father in the Caves is the god of the New Canaanites.
0DI2000694	I have seen the holy books, and once I even saw an image of the holy child and his mother.
0DI2000695	Do not the New Canaanites' books say the Father gave the world his child?
0DI2000696	Perhaps you do not fully understand the New Canaanites. I have seen the Father's images.
0DI2000697	His holy bride and holy son were given unto the world to save it. They dwelt in the caverns of the mountains, caverns which can still be seen today.
0DI2000698	The people sinned against Him, and were punished with the End That Came in Fire and the loss of the holy tongue. Only the New Canaanites were spared.
0DI2000699	I'm sure Daniel could tell you more. His knowledge of the Father is greater than my own.
0DI2000700	Yes - the language of the New Canaanites is the holy tongue, for it is the language their sacred books are written in.
0DI2000701	The Father in the Caves brought it to them after the Judgment, but the ancestors of the Sorrows sinned against Him. They were denied the true tongue.
0DI2000702	Six years. He attended the birth of my third child. It was a hard birth. The River nearly carried my water to the Father, and my child's with it.
0DI2000703	Daniel knew the ways of New Canaan's medicine. He stepped in and saved both of our lives.
0DI2000704	After the birth, I asked Daniel if he would teach me what he knew of childbirth. He agreed, and so here I am.
0DI2000705	The children and the old have already been evacuated from the camp. They are safe enough, unless the White Legs come for us in force.
0DI2000706	I tend to other hurts and sicknesses that afflict our tribe. I also scout the valley for the herbs I use in my medicines.
0DI2000707	When we learned that Salt-Upon-Wounds had defiled Zion with his presence, Daniel ordered the children, the old, and the sick evacuated from the camp.
0DI2000708	My husband volunteered to lead the hunters that went with them for protection.
0DI2000709	I try not to worry about them, but we have had no news for so long, and Daniel seems sad when I ask him about it. Sad... and a little frightened.
0DI2000710	Certainly. I am happy to share my knowledge.
0DI2000711	How... how dare he? What gives him the right? I thought Daniel was my friend, but he cares nothing for the Sorrows!
0DI2000712	Perhaps... I will have to have a very long talk with Daniel when all of this is over. Thank you for telling me this truth.
0DI2000713	Arrogant... yes. I thought Daniel respected me, saw the Sorrows as his equals... but he manipulates us for his own ends.
0DI2000714	About Daniel... I don't yet know. But I am a woman of the Sorrows, and I will have restitution for my husband.
0DI2000715	You might rush them and take them by surprise. We would be badly outnumbered then, though, and these will be strong fighters.
0DI2000716	We might also use their superstition against them. White Leg warriors believe that to lose their totems on the eve of battle is a terrible omen.
0DI2000717	Yes. If their war totems were to... "disappear," they would likely lose the will to fight.
0DI2000718	I will follow your command - but I advise caution if it is possible.
0DI2000719	Disarm the traps if you can - or find the White Legs who placed them and drive them off.
0DI2000720	Our advance scouts should be able to deal with them if they don't have to fight off raiders at the same time.
0DI2000721	I would suspect you are right. Perhaps we should try to find them before they lay more traps?
0DI2000722	As you say.
0DI2000723	Fighting so many at once is a dangerous prospect, unless you are a truly mighty warrior.
0DI2000724	This many so close together suggests a nest nearby - if we find it and destroy it, we might have better luck.
0DI2000725	I hope that is truth, and not a boast. But I will respect your leadership.
0DI2000726	I stand with you.
0DI2000727	Did Daniel not give you some of the New Canaanites' fire clay? That could easily collapse a cave and trap the beasts inside.
0DI2000728	Look around and see if you can find a cave nearby. It may prove easier than slaying the beasts.
0DI2000729	We should not be here! This place... it belongs to the Father in the Caves! We must not profane it with our touch!
0DI2000730	The Father in the Caves! The Holy Father who gave the Sorrows His succor and gave the New Canaanites His son!
0DI2000731	Many of the caves around the valley are sacred to him, and those who would trespass are punished by holy wrath!
0DI2000732	It is a holy place! If we go any deeper, we will suffer for it!
0DI2000733	Do not mock that which you do not know! Such talk can only anger the Father.
0DI2000734	You speak as one who has not heard the tales, who has not seen the sacred images. If you knew, you would not mock.
0DI2000735	I understand. I would prefer to leave as soon as possible, though.
0DI2000736	Before we depart, our shaman, White Bird, asked me to convey his desire to speak with you.
0DI2000737	Certainly. We should make haste, then.
0DI2000738	The lone Bighorner is the most vulnerable to its enemies. In the herd lies strength - if you reconsider your choice, I will be here. Paz patasooba.
0DI2000739	What would you speak of?
0DI2000740	He did not say. White Bird is notoriously close-lipped. But he is wise, and you would do well to speak to him.
0DI2000742	Excellent. His cave overlooks the camp - I will show you where.
0DI2000744	I do hope you will reconsider. I will point out his cave on your map, should you wish to speak to him later.
0DI2000745	As you wish. I will point out his cave on your map, should you wish to speak to him later.
0DI2000746	Perhaps he will. I sometimes feel he thinks he must protect me. If he has news, I would know of it.
0DI2000747	In the shadow of Daniel's death, those Sorrows who survived the assault on Zion Valley mourned his loss, as was their custom.
0DI2000748	Word of Daniel's passing reached the New Canaanites several weeks later. They prayed that their brother would be well-received by their Lord.
0DI2000749	After leading the Sorrows from their home in Zion to safety in Grand Staircase, Daniel continued to wonder if he'd made the right choice.
0DI2000750	He spent his life evangelizing the beliefs of his people to a new generation of young men and women, as his ancestors had for centuries before him.
0DI2000751	He was happy with his family, but for the rest of his life there were nights when he awoke with sadness to find he had been dreaming of Zion.
0DI2000752	For years after the defeat of the White Legs, Daniel did his best to minister to the Sorrows' spiritual needs.
0DI2000753	Try as he might, he could not hold back the tribe's increasing militancy and reverence of Joshua Graham.
0DI2000754	Demoralized, he returned to his family and Dead Horse Point. His failures haunted him for the rest of his days.
0DI2000755	Having revered Joshua Graham as a living legend for so many years, the Dead Horses found it difficult to accept his death.
0DI2000756	New Canaanite missionaries sought to remain in contact with the tribe, but lacking Joshua's authority, their influence dwindled.
0DI2000757	Still, as an expression of enduring respect for their lost spiritual leader, the Dead Horses helped protect the lands where New Canaanites settled.
0DI2000758	As generations passed, the Dead Horses came to worship a spirit of the land, a harsh spirit of divine justice. They called it Joshua.
0DI2000759	Having helped Daniel and the Sorrows escape from Zion, the Dead Horses returned to their home at Dead Horse Point.
0DI2000760	The tribe continued to learn from the New Canaanites, and over many years built a flourishing community along the banks of the Colorado.
0DI2000761	Though the tribes' bond would endure, it was Joshua Graham's legend the Dead Horses would revere, not the tenets of New Canaan's faith.
0DI2000762	Having helped eradicate the White Legs from Zion, the Dead Horses returned to Dead Horse Point in triumph.
0DI2000763	They remained neutral toward the Sorrows, but as years went on, there were periods of competitive friction, even violence, between the tribes.
0DI2000764	The New Canaanites - Daniel especially - intervened regularly as mediators, but found it difficult to reconcile the tribes' conflicts.
0DI2000765	And with that, the Courier walked out of the history of the tribes of Zion and back to the gathering storm of the Mojave Wasteland.
0DI2000766	Follows-Chalk took the Courier's words to heart and decided that the big cities of the Mojave Wasteland and NCR were best left unexplored.
0DI2000767	Though he sometimes dreamed of distant lands, he continued to support his family at Dead Horse Point, and eventually his wanderlust faded.
0DI2000768	Follows-Chalk took the Courier's words to heart and decided that he would behold the sights and sounds of distant lands with his own eyes and ears.
0DI2000769	After returning to Dead Horse Point, he quarreled with his family and other tribe members about his ambitions.
0DI2000770	One morning, they awoke to discover that Follows-Chalk had set off alone, westward, into the wilderness.
0DI2000771	He was never seen again.
0DI2000772	Already weakened by several seasons of bad trading, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was devastated by the failure of its expedition.
0DI2000773	The New Canaanites never reestablished ties with the caravan.
0DI2000774	Their experiences with outsiders near the Great Salt Lake and in Zion had been far too negative.
0DI2000775	Within six months, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was bankrupted and dissolved.
0DI2000776	Already weakened by several seasons of bad trading, the Happy Trails Caravan Company was initially discouraged by the results of its expedition.
0DI2000777	The fate of New Canaan, and the evacuation of the Sorrows from Zion, made the prospect of trading seem fruitless.
0DI2000778	When Daniel told his family about the exploits of Happy Trails' employee, the Courier, however, New Canaan decided to repay the company's kindness.
0DI2000779	Twice per year, New Canaanites made the dangerous journey west to trade with the company in the city of New Reno.
0DI2000780	The Happy Trails Caravan Company could not survive on such trading alone, but the New Canaanite's generosity made tough times go easier.
0DI2000781	The defeat of the White Legs in Zion marked a turning point in the fortunes of the Happy Trails Caravan Company.
0DI2000782	Every two months, the caravan met with the New Canaanites in Zion Valley to trade. Happy Trails soon returned to prosperity.
0DI2000783	The vigilance of the Sorrows and Dead Horses in defending southwestern Utah, initially startling to Happy Trails caravans, soon proved a blessing.
0DI2000784	The tribes united against the 80s, driving them back from Highway 50, and thus opening yet another trading route for Happy Trails caravans.
0DI2000785	After a long and troubled life, Joshua Graham finally found rest in Zion.
0DI2000786	In the end, his unswerving militancy had accomplished what the NCR's finest sharpshooters and Caesar's wrath could not.
0DI2000787	The New Canaanites took comfort in the belief that their brother's soul would again dwell in Zion at the end of days.
0DI2000788	The threat of the White Legs ended, Joshua Graham helped the Sorrows and Dead Horses tend to their fallen comrades and secure Zion.
0DI2000789	The Courier's words had stayed Joshua's wrath in his darkest hour, and in sparing Salt-Upon-Wounds, he was changed.
0DI2000790	While he continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan, he sometimes showed quarter to those who crossed his family.
0DI2000791	Eventually this new spirit would diminish the myth of the Burned Man in distant lands - a small price for the peace it brought to Joshua Graham.
0DI2000792	With the White Legs crushed, Joshua Graham led the Sorrows and Dead Horses in tearing apart and burning the corpses of their enemies.
0DI2000793	He set about training his army in the "Way of the Canaanite," and soon the New Canaanites and tribes of Zion were feared well into the Mojave.
0DI2000794	Legends of the Burned Man grew even more depraved, and terrifying.
0DI2000795	Though the Courier had stopped Joshua Graham from executing Salt-Upon-Wounds, the war chief still fell in battle.
0DI2000796	The White Legs defeated at Three Marys, Joshua led the Sorrows and Dead Horses in tending to their comrades and burning the corpses of their foes.
0DI2000797	He continued to advocate militant opposition to the enemies of New Canaan and showed little quarter to those he fought. And yet he was changed.
0DI2000798	He no longer reveled in the brutality and cruelty for which he had been known in his former life.
0DI2000799	His inner demons, if not extinguished, were at the least... appeased.
0DI2000800	Daniel succeeded in leading the Sorrows out of Zion, as he had wanted to do from the start.
0DI2000801	The Courier protected the Sorrows during the evacuation, ensuring that most reached their destination unharmed.
0DI2000802	Over the weeks and months to come, Daniel would see to the Sorrows' resettlement in Grand Staircase.
0DI2000803	Their adjustment to their new home was not without difficulty, but eventually the Sorrows came to accept the loss of Zion.
0DI2000804	Daniel evacuated the Sorrows from Zion, but due to the Courier's neglect, the White Legs butchered many along the way.
0DI2000805	Those who survived barely reached Grand Staircase, but once there, the Dead Horses and New Canaanites helped them settle.
0DI2000806	The unfamiliarity of their new surroundings, and the loss of loved ones, evoked a terrible and lasting grief among the Sorrows.
0DI2000807	For two generations, many would die still lamenting the loss of Zion.
0DI2000808	The Sorrows fought beside Joshua Graham and the Dead Horses, eradicating the threat the White Legs posed to Zion.
0DI2000809	Seeing the Courier convince Joshua Graham to spare Salt-Upon-Wounds, the Sorrows learned that retribution could be tempered by mercy.
0DI2000810	Though he despaired at the Sorrows' loss of innocence, Daniel took some small consolation in the Courier's lesson, and prayed it would take root.
0DI2000812	Watching as the Courier encouraged Joshua Graham to execute Salt-Upon-Wounds, the Sorrows learned that New Canaan offered no mercy to the wicked.
0DI2000813	The Sorrows' transformation from a peaceful, timid tribe into a merciless, warlike people broke Daniel's heart.
0DI2000814	Over time, the Sorrows became ever more ruthless in their dealings - even with each other.
0DI2000815	Daniel traveled to and fro between the New Canaanites and Zion, continuing to plead for a return to the old ways whenever he visited.
0DI2000816	Eventually, the Sorrows grew tired of his blather, and turned their backs on him.
0DI2000818	When the Courier and Joshua Graham felled Salt-Upon-Wounds, their victory was celebrated with a great feast.
0DI2000819	The Sorrows' transformation from a peaceful, timid tribe into a proud and warlike people broke Daniel's heart.
0DI2000820	He tried to take solace in the knowledge that they would remain in Zion, but it was a small comfort. The Sorrows' innocence was lost.
0DI2000821	And so it was that the conflict between the New Canaanites and the White Legs was finally resolved.
0DI2000822	The Courier's involvement had tipped the scale, shifting the fragile balance of power.
0DI2000823	Waking Cloud turned bitter and resentful toward Daniel and the New Canaanites when she learned her husband's death had been concealed from her.
0DI2000824	She poisoned some of her tribe against New Canaanite teachings, making relations between the groups difficult from time to time.
0DI2000825	Waking Cloud was distraught when she learned of her husband's death, but took comfort from her tribe, and the compassion of the New Canaanites.
0DI2000826	She forgave Daniel for having concealed her husband's fate from her, and learned to accept his fate.
0DI2000827	When her grief faded, she took a husband from the Dead Horse tribe. At her bidding, he stayed close to home.
0DI2000828	With Daniel dead, the White Legs soon overran Zion and drove the Sorrows and Dead Horses from the Valley.
0DI2000829	The White Legs plundered all of the Pre-War buildings the Sorrows had marked off-limits, their squalor an affront to Zion's natural beauty.
0DI2000830	By year's end, little trace remained that the Sorrows had ever made the valley their home.
0DI2000831	After the White Legs drove the Sorrows from Zion, they celebrated by destroying all traces of the valley's former inhabitants.
0DI2000832	They appealed to the Legion for assimilation, but were denied.
0DI2000833	Their failure to eradicate the New Canaanites in Grand Staircase and farther up the Colorado had not gone unnoticed.
0DI2000834	The White Legs made a half-hearted effort to find the New Canaanites, but were driven off by Dead Horses trained in the ways of Joshua Graham.
0DI2000835	The White Legs lost all hope of joining the Legion and disintegrated into a number of petty raiding bands, leaving Zion Valley a polluted cistern.
0DI2000836	Demoralized by the Dead Horse and Sorrows attack the Courier and Joshua Graham led against them, the White Legs retreated to Great Salt Lake.
0DI2000837	Their days were numbered. Word soon reached the 80s tribe that the White Legs' spirit was broken, their war chief a dim shadow of his former self.
0DI2000838	By year's end, the 80s would overrun the White Legs' camps, scattering the tribe to the winds and claiming the Great Salt Lake for its own.
0DI2000839	Joshua Graham's chilling execution of Salt-Upon-Wounds seared into their minds, the surviving White Legs retreated to the Great Salt Lake.
0DI2000840	Unable to shake the memory of their brutal defeat and the Dead Horses' savagery in battle, the White Legs feared further reprisals.
0DI2000841	They fled north, out of Utah, into Wyoming. The wilderness was harsh, and the first winter claimed over half the tribe.
0DI2000842	When spring came, the survivors parted ways in small bands. And so the White Legs died a quiet, ignominious death.
0DI2000843	Despite their defeat at Three Marys, and the death of their war chief, the White Legs were determined to pursue the other New Canaanites.
0DI2000844	But when they finally tracked down their prey in Colorado, they discovered the tables had been turned.
0DI2000845	The White Legs who survived the New Canaanites' ambushes were hunted down by Dead Horses before they could reach the safety of the Great Salt Lake.
0DI2000846	When word of the White Legs' diminished numbers reached the 80s tribe, war was declared, and by year's end, the White Legs had been wiped out.
0DI2000847	Lead on, I'll follow.
0DI2000848	I will try to follow your example.
0DI2000849	See that tower? Back When, folks used them to talk to each other on the air. Not like with signal drums, they could actually talk! Amazing, huh?
0DI2000850	Look sharp, lots of giant ants around here. We call 'em picnic-killers. Don't really know what that means. Something from Back When, I guess.
0DI2000851	See this? This is why your own two feet are better than any cart, whether it's pulled by critters or goes on its own.
0DI2000852	Must have been nice, when Zion was friendly enough folks could make camp wherever they pleased and not worry about White Legs and deadly critters.
0DI2000853	Feels good to be doing some actual scouting, not just following.
0DI2000854	I hear some odd things about the civilized lands outside Zion. Is there really a giant thunder-lizard people live inside?
0DI2000855	The spitter plants and the green monster men aren't native to Zion. Wonder where they came from?
0DI2000856	So I finally get to explore all those taboo places without the other scouts yelling at me? Can't wait!
0DI2000857	Bet they don't have anything as nasty as Yao Guai out where you come from, huh?
0DI2000858	Those, um, what did you call them? Walkie talkies? Those are going to be loads better than signal drums and smoke signs.
0DI2000859	That compass thing always knows where north is, huh? Even if it can't see the stars?
0DI2000860	That Back When medicine smells funny. Guess it works though.
0DI2000861	There can't really be a place where people go into big buildings and give away all their money just to watch someone flip paper squares on a table...
0DI2000862	Way I heard it, Salt-Upon-Wounds butchered everyone in New Canaan and nailed their corpses to the cliffs.
0DI2000863	Why do you carry all those bottlecaps, anyway? They jangle like crazy.
0DI2000864	We follow this path for a while. Nice view of the river, neh?
0DI2000865	You can take the path north here if you want, or head east over the ridge. There's a nice view from the top of that cliff, if you want a look.
0DI2000866	Keep headed north, around this rock pile.
0DI2000867	Follow the old road south, nearly there.
0DI2000868	You see the dead sentries? Shamans say our enemies' souls are trapped in them, but Joshua says it shows we're serious about fighting White Legs.
0DI2000869	Down this path to the north. Hope you don't mind getting wet.
0DI2000870	Nearly there now. Watch out for traps in the water. Got to keep the White Legs out somehow, neh?
0DI2000871	Here we are. Joshua's just ahead there, in the Angel Cave.
0DI2000872	Hang on, you're going the wrong way!
0DI2000873	I thought we were going to the Dead Horses camp?
0DI2000874	Hold up, you're getting all turned around. Check your map and backtrack a little.
0DI2000875	Where are you going? That's not the way to the camp!
0DI2000876	I'm happy to travel with you, but you're not headed toward the Dead Horses anymore.
0DI2000877	Heads up, this is the Three Marys. White Legs territory. You sure you want to head in there?
0DI2000878	These paintings show the Dead Horses' victories against other tribes. Lots more of them since Joshua came to us.
0DI2000879	The Narrows up ahead, that's the Sorrows' territory. They're peaceful enough, but you don't want to make them mad.
0DI2000880	"Scenic Overlook." What do you suppose that means?
0DI2000881	Some kind of view up here, neh? If you know how to look, you can spot all kinds of landmarks from up here. Look, I'll show you.
0DI2000882	That's Pine Creek up there. Supposedly it's one of only two ways out of Zion Valley. Of course, without a map, good luck surviving.
0DI2000883	That thing actually flew once, like a big metal bird? Bet you don't have to follow chalk marks up there....
0DI2000884	Hoo! That's for the White Legs! Sorry we weren't fast enough to save your friends, though. The Dead Horses will remember them in our prayers.
0DI2000885	You should come with me now - Joshua Graham will want to meet a visitor from the civilized lands.
0DI2000886	For as long as I remember, the Dead Horses have thought that places of the old world were taboo. Doesn't look so spooky to me.
0DI2000887	See those handprints? Dead Horses and Sorrows mark them on taboo places, places from Back When. Good thing for you I don't buy into that stuff.
0DI2000888	Hold up, see that log over there? Take a closer look. There might be some good stuff tucked in there.
0DI2000889	You ever seen anything like these green men? Sure as anything they aren't from around here.
0DI2000890	Ah, the Eastern Virgin. What's the phrase? "House sweet house?"
0DI2000891	Glad you made it. Joshua's just to the south, inside the Angel Cave. You'll want to talk to him straight away.
0DI2000892	Freeze! Don't move a muscle. Yao Guai.
0DI2000893	Hoo! That was some kind of lucky. Guess that one was all full of gecko, neh? Don't get used to it, though. Yao Guai are plenty mean as a rule.
0DI2000894	A few decades back, folks in the NCR started to hear about a community in northern Utah called New Canaan.
0DI2000895	Didn't know much about them, except that they were religious folks. Sent out missionaries to talk to the tribes.
0DI2000896	We've seen our share of cults, but the New Canaanites, they were honest traders. Good fighters, too. Raiders wouldn't tangle with 'em.
0DI2000897	But then the Legion appeared in Arizona. I reckon you know all about them.
0DI2000898	Turns out Caesar's first war chief, the Malpais Legate, was a New Canaanite. Joshua Graham.
0DI2000899	Legend goes that Graham was the meanest, toughest son of a bitch in the whole damned Legion.
0DI2000900	The New Canaanites wouldn't talk about him. They were ashamed. Guess I can't blame 'em.
0DI2000901	Well at Hoover Dam, the Malpais Legate finally met his match. Hanlon and Oliver kicked his New Canaanite butt right back over the river.
0DI2000902	Caesar had to make an example for the others, to show them that even at the highest level, failure wouldn't be tolerated.
0DI2000903	He had Graham covered in pitch, lit on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon. People say he didn't even scream on the way down.
0DI2000904	Not long after, some of the slaves and tribals started to talk. Said Graham wasn't dead. Shouldn't have been any surprise.
0DI2000905	All this talk bothered Caesar, so he forbade anyone from speaking his name. Wanted to erase Joshua Graham from history.
0DI2000906	He got his wish. Joshua Graham disappeared. And in his place came legends of the Burned Man walking the wastes.
0DI2000907	Probably just a tribal ghost story. But New Canaan's been silent for a long time. Maybe it's a coincidence. Maybe the Malpais Legate is dead.
0DI2000908	Or maybe Joshua Graham did crawl out of that canyon and finally found his way back home.
0DI2000909	The paths we're following are slow going, so you might as well keep your ears open and listen to what old Jed has to say.
0DI2000910	Come on, down this path. We're almost there.
0DI2000911	Holy hell, it's the White Legs! What are they doing this far south?
0DI2000912	Goddammit, Stella, heard you the first time, and the fifteenth, too.
0DI2000913	The New Canaanites will know a way. And if they don't, we got the maps on our friend's Pip-Boy over there.
0DI2000914	Enough lollygagging! Get moving and keep an eye out for tribals!
0DI2000915	All right, people. Been a long couple weeks, but here we are. Zion.
0DI2000916	I know your feet hurt, I know you're tired. But I need everyone's mind on the trail ahead.
0DI2000917	Ain't the trail ahead worries me, Jed. Those descents we made, through that slot canyon back up there.
0DI2000918	Ain't no way we're getting back out the way we come. And then what?
0DI2000919	Goddammit, Stella, heard you the first time, and the fifteenth, too
0DI2000922	Don't listen to this... thing! His cries are those of a mad beast caught in a thicket! He gave no mercy to my family, and I will give none to his.
0DI2000923	Thank you for this. I know Daniel doesn't approve, but destroying the White Legs is the only way to ensure the Sorrows can remain in Zion.
0DI2000924	You and I will lead a group of Dead Horse warriors and Sorrows hunters into Three Marys from this position.
0DI2000925	Our objective is to find the White Legs' leader, Salt-Upon-Wounds, and prevent him from fleeing.
0DI2000926	Show no quarter to the White Legs we come across. Make no mistake about why we are here. This is an extermination.
0DI2000927	This is taking too long. We can't let Salt-Upon-Wounds escape. I'm going to find a way around. God willing, we will finish this together.
0DI2000929	There. That's it. It's finished. When they hear what happened here, the White Legs will crawl back to their Great Salt Lake.
0DI2000930	If Caesar doesn't kill them, they'll wither and die like the cursed mongrels they are.
0DI2000931	Come. Let's find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon. And there is still much work to be done.
0DI2000932	That's it. It's finished. Thank you for... staying with me. I couldn't have done this on my own.
0DI2000933	Let's go find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon. And there is much to do.
0DI2000934	It's the same end he would have met if he had died on his knees. But I suppose this was for the sake of the Dead Horses and Sorrows.
0DI2000935	Still, thanks to your help and the grace of God, the White Legs won't be troubling Zion anymore.
0DI2000936	Let's go find Daniel. Tomorrow will be here soon enough. And there is much to do.
0DI2000937	We warned you at Syracuse, and you persisted.
0DI2000938	You took advantage of us at New Canaan to drive us out, and like the dogs of Caesar you are, you followed us to Zion.
0DI2000939	And now you stand on holy ground, a temple to God's glory on Earth. But the only use for an animal in our temple is sacrifice!
0DI2000940	Kale watcha nei conserva oh! You understand me, don't you? Don't you?!
0DI2000941	Show respect, owslandr! Joshua Graham greatest warchief!
0DI2000942	You know our tongue - smart owslandr.
0DI2000943	Joshua in high place of cave. You show respect, utman! Joshua is greatest warrior. You show him no respect, he show you thunder and fire!
0DI2000944	He in high place of cave. You show respect, owslandr! Joshua is greatest warrior. You show him no respect, he show you thunder and fire!
0DI2000945	You wise for owslandr.
0DI2000946	Ha ha. Funny owslandr. Maybe soon dead owslandr.
0DI2000947	Shaiss! Would kill you myself, but Joshua says no harm to visitors until harm done to us.
0DI2000948	Go, owslandr. Meet Joshua. We see how long you talk like that.
0DI2000949	Owslandr utman zookuh Joshua Graham? You look for Joshua Graham?
0DI2000950	Hmph. Since you are friend to Sorrows... we go. But you kill White Legs!
0DI2000951	[SUCCEEDED] Because you are friend to Sorrows... very well. We go. Angry ghosts will do for White Legs.
0DI2000952	[FAILED] No! We not let White Legs defile our ancestors! We go! We fight!
0DI2000953	We go!
0DI2000954	We wait, but not forever!
0DI2000955	Shut your mouth, you goddamn junkie! Or I'll plant one between your shoulder blades, I swear!
0DI2000956	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Johnny-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
0DI2000957	Don't worry, Stella! This was my last hit, but thanks to ol' Janey-come-lately over there, Ricky got some Fixer to take the edge off.
0DI2000958	Don't worry, Stella! Ol' Ricky won't be running out of Psycho any time soon! Ol' Ricky's downright flush! Yes indeed!
0DI2000959	Best fix for you'd be a bullet in the brainpan. Now shut it.
0DI2000960	Sounds like you got enough for a fatal overdose, then. Do us all a favor, will ya?
0DI2000961	Dream on, Stella. Ricky ain't about to die for nobody. Ricky's fucking in-vin-cible, yessir!
0DI2000962	Goddammit, never should joined this assbackwards caravan...
0DI2000963	Enough! Another word of your bitching and I'll put you out of your misery myself!
0DI2000964	You don't know how this feels, Stella! I'm sick! Never been so sick my whole life!
0DI2000965	You ain't sick! You're a goddamn junkie, that's what you are! So shut it!
0DI2000966	You ain't got no heart, Stella! I swear, you're a monster, and you're gonna regret treating me like this!
0DI2000967	Didn't nobody do this to you but yourself, junkie. Now try suffering in silence for once.
0DI2000968	"Heard you the fifteenth time, Stella. What's it matter if we're trapped here? Everything will be just fine."
0DI2000969	Oh I'm sure you're right, Jed. What's the worst can happen to us out here? Nothing. Perfectly safe, fucking perfectly...
0DI2000970	"That's right, little lady. Everything will be just fine with Jed to protect you. Quite the leader is what I am, hell yes."
0DI2000971	Sorry to bother you with reality, ol' Jed. Who cares if we can't get back out the way we come?  That's not a problem.
0DI2000972	Ain't the trail ahead worries me, Jed. Those descents we made, through that slot canyon back up there?
0DI2000974	Hoi! Owslandr zookuh Joshua Graham?
0DI2000975	Please be respectful here - these are the bones of our ancestors.
0DI2000976	Those tents down there - that is a White Leg war camp. Do you see the war totems they've erected around the tents?
0DI2000977	White Leg warriors pray to them for strength and savagery before battle. This is no raiding band.
0DI2000978	The river is lovely at this time of day, don't you think?
0DI2000979	The river is lovely at this time of night, don't you think?
0DI2000980	It is good to travel with another. I spend so long scouting on my own that I forget what human company is like.
0DI2000981	I have seen many strange plants in the valley - plants that seem to hunger for human flesh. Where they come from, I do not know.
0DI2000982	White Leg attacks grow more frequent each day - I fear for our people and for our valley if something is not done.
0DI2000983	Oh Father, guide and protect us your humble children as we labor in the vineyards, and make us strong to resist those who would steal Zion from us.
0DI2000984	I wish you could have met my family. You would like them, I think.
0DI2000985	Zion used to be a place of peace, you know. Daniel says that it is holy in the eyes of the Father. I hope someday you will see it as it was.
0DI2000986	Father, I ask that you guide this man who is the vessel of your will. Show him the light of your wisdom and the peace of your love. Amen.
0DI2000987	Father, I ask that you guide this woman who is the vessel of your will. Show her the light of your wisdom and the peace of your love. Amen.
0DI2000988	Daniel says that most people outside the valley do not keep to the Father's ways. Perhaps when you leave you will carry His word with you?
0DI2000989	When Salt-Upon-Wounds took New Canaan, he ordered the White Legs to salt the earth so nothing could grow again. What kind of monster could do that?
0DI2000990	I know you are eager to leave Zion, but... perhaps you might find peace if you stayed. Think about it, yes?
0DI2000991	So this is the Ghost of She's lair. I was never brave enough to try to find it....
0DI2000992	We should not be here! The Three Marys is where the White Legs make their camp! We should leave, quickly.
0DI2000993	I am always a little sad to leave the Narrows, and happy to return.
0DI2000994	This is Pine Creek, one of the only ways out of Zion Valley. Watch out - many dangerous beasts lair nearby.
0DI2000995	These are places of the time before. We should not be here - it is forbidden!
0DI2000996	This is the only sure path from the Narrows to Pine Creek! They will be cut to ribbons by these traps!
0DI2000997	It has been some time since I visited the Dead Horses. Our tribes don't have much contact with each other.
0DI2000998	Yao Guai - even our strongest hunters could not hope to kill so many. There must be a nest nearby.
0DI2000999	Like the shadow of a ghost.
0DI2001000	We pass like moonlight on still water.
0DI2001002	I look like a pack Brahmin to you? Come on, we travel light!
0DI2001003	I will be more useful to you traveling light.
0DI2001004	Feeling the poison here!
0DI2001005	I'm not feeling so good....
0DI2001006	I've been poisoned!
0DI2001007	This wound needs to be sucked out, quickly!
0DI2001008	I need some Radscorpion glands and Nightstalker blood to treat this poison.
0DI2001009	Good as new!
0DI2001010	Just what the medicine man ordered!
0DI2001011	That should keep me going a while longer.
0DI2001012	Much improved.
0DI2001013	I feel better already.
0DI2001014	Ahh! I'm going to need a healer!
0DI2001015	Hope you've got medicine better than some sticky herbs!
0DI2001016	I fear I will need more than my herbs to fix this....
0DI2001017	This wound is grievous! I need help!
0DI2001018	There... hopefully it won't fall off now.
0DI2001019	Now that's good medicine!
0DI2001020	This is much more effective than I expected!
0DI2001021	If only I had more of this medicine to share with the tribe.
0DI2001022	No more bullets!
0DI2001023	I'm shooting dry here!
0DI2001024	I have no more bullets!
0DI2001025	I need a reload!
0DI2001026	My guns are empty!
0DI2001027	Might as well tickle them with a feather!
0DI2001028	Got anything bigger I can fight with?
0DI2001029	I don't think I'm hurting them at all!
0DI2001030	Are you sure this weapon actually works?
0DI2001031	My attacks are doing nothing!
0DI2001032	They're cutting through me like paper!
0DI2001033	This armor is useless!
0DI2001034	I cannot defend myself against this!
0DI2001035	I need better armor!
0DI2001036	Oh, look, I'm not dead.
0DI2001037	Okay, okay, I'm up. What's next?
0DI2001038	This is not the most pleasant place I've woken up.
0DI2001039	My head feels about to burst. At least that means I'm still alive.
0DI2001040	Is it normal to hurt all over after a battle?
0DI2001041	I could use some help here!
0DI2001042	I won't last long at this rate!
0DI2001043	Can I get some backup? Healing? Something?
0DI2001044	My wounds are getting worse!
0DI2001045	I can't keep up this pace much longer!
0DI2001046	I need healing powder!
0DI2001047	If I don't make it... tell Joshua... I tried.
0DI2001048	Looks like I'm headed for the big dark....
0DI2001049	Sorry... I let you down....
0DI2001050	Even my best herbs won't work if I'm dead... I need help!
0DI2001051	I will not leave my children orphans!
0DI2001052	If I fall... save the Sorrows... please.
0DI2001053	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
0DI2001054	Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem who said, "Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation."
0DI2001055	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed. Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
0DI2001056	Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
0DI2001057	Do you know what it means?
0DI2001061	You're starting to sound like the old Joshua. Okay, got it.
0DI2001062	Isn't a more diplomatic approach preferable? Very well, but I'm not comfortable with this.
0DI2001063	It's the only way I know.
0DI2001064	Now you're thinking like a hunter! I like this plan.
0DI2001065	That seems sensible. I'd prefer to let you choose the targets.
0DI2001066	What's the point?
0DI2001067	Glad to hear it. I wouldn't want to go back to Joshua alone.
0DI2001068	Good. Daniel's decisions are wise. You are wise for respecting them.
0DI2001069	Good, because I wasn't going to leave.
0DI2001070	All right. Joshua won't be too happy, but all right.
0DI2001071	If that is your wish, I cannot change your mind. I will wait for you at the Sorrows' camp until you return.
0DI2001072	I'm not going anywhere. Get the idea out of your head and get moving.
0DI2001073	Let's take them!
0DI2001074	This one's mine!
0DI2001075	I'm with you.
0DI2001077	For the Sorrows!
0DI2001078	Hyah!
0DI2001079	God protect me!
0DI2001080	Lord, make me thy instrument!
0DI2001081	God and liberty!
0DI2001082	Momewi de luchoo!
0DI2001083	Mes luchoo ahorla!
0DI2001084	Me derote katu!
0DI2001085	Shtairb, chin dee!

0DI2001087	Dah ah hi meer!
0DI2001088	Deyai-yoo, devil!
0DI2001089	Wes run!
0DI2001090	Nikumpa me!
0DI2001091	Joshua said I might be going with you. Let's go then!
0DI2001092	I am happy to offer you what guidance I can. Let's go.
0DI2001093	The path lies before us. Let's not waste any time.
0DI2001094	Tactics? You know I'm not much of a fighter, right?
0DI2001095	Battle is not my strongest skill, but I am eager to learn from you.
0DI2001096	What have you to teach me of tactics?
0DI2001097	Change it to...?
0DI2001098	How shall I fight?
0DI2001099	Oh?
0DI2001100	What can I do?
0DI2001106	Up close and personal? Well, as long as they don't have guns.
0DI2001107	I will fight with my fists as best I can.
0DI2001108	Fine. If that's your style, I can adapt.
0DI2001109	Keeping my distance sounds more my speed anyways.
0DI2001110	My skills lie elsewhere, but I will do as you bid.
0DI2001111	Naturally.
0DI2001112	Just tell me where to be, and I'll be there.
0DI2001113	How close do you prefer me to follow?
0DI2001114	Whatever you'd like. It makes no difference to me.
0DI2001115	Fine by me - get too far back and it's easy to lose your partner in this maze.
0DI2001116	I will do my best to stay close.
0DI2001117	I'm at your side.
0DI2001119	What else is there to talk about?
0DI2001122	Off we go, then.
0DI2001124	Sure... you are going to leave me some chalk marks to follow though, right?
0DI2001125	I'll give you room to work, then.
0DI2001126	As you like.
0DI2001128	I will do my best to follow your requests.
0DI2001130	Joshua isn't going to like this....
0DI2001131	Hey! Don't die on me now!
0DI2001132	This is how violence always ends....
0DI2001133	I wish I could have saved you.
0DI2001134	There will be time to grieve later.
0DI2001135	Let this death mean something.
0DI2001141	Nona! Ud muerna!
0DI2001142	Ud matanna mes!
0DI2001143	Roo too nait, ahk iss.
0DI2001144	No! Neekt ni!
0DI2001145	Yoo murdah my hainji!
0DI2001146	No! Net yoo!
0DI2001147	Howdy. My name is Jed Masterson, and I'm a caravan boss for the Happy Trails Caravan Company.
0DI2001148	If you're hearing this, I have a job offer for you. Happy Trails is organizing an expedition north into Utah, off the Long 15, and we need people.
0DI2001149	We're looking for caravan guards, prospectors, couriers - if you're used to humping it across the Wastes straight toward trouble, we want you.
0DI2001150	If you've got a Pip-Boy, we definitely want you.
0DI2001151	On the other hand, if you're a greenhorn or a city-slicker spinning tales about your skills, you can kindly go hang.
0DI2001152	If we like your gumption, we'll pay you square and treat you fair. Find me, Jed Masterson, at the Northern Passage if you're interested. Luck to you.
0DI2001153	Estee no luchoo mela!
0DI2001154	Me no kaade partu estee.
0DI2001156	Thought you could get away from Follows-Chalk?
0DI2001158	I found them!
0DI2001159	Let's end this.
0DI2001160	Judgment's coming.
0DI2001161	Time's up.
0DI2001163	Discube katu!

0DI2001170	Thah no!
0DI2001171	Deyai-yoo, maikku!
0DI2001172	They must've run off. Scared of us, huh?
0DI2001173	I don't think they're coming back.
0DI2001174	They're gone. Perhaps that means we don't have to kill them.
0DI2001175	I think our enemy has fled.
0DI2001176	Only a matter of time.
0DI2001177	Time will run out on you yet.
0DI2001178	Hide while you can.
0DI2001182	Baste veoo. Uds pasane.

0DI2001191	Hey! Where'd they go?
0DI2001192	Lost 'em!
0DI2001193	I cannot find them!
0DI2001194	Where are they?
0DI2001195	Yes, hide. Run and hide in fear.
0DI2001196	Slink away. Squeeze between the rocks if you can.
0DI2001197	Hiding, are you? Well, I'm coming to find you.

0DI2001208	Well, that's that then.
0DI2001209	Never stood a chance, did they?
0DI2001210	Messy business - I am glad it's over.
0DI2001211	Let's move on - I don't like to linger in this place.
0DI2001212	Work well done.
0DI2001213	All in a day's labor serving the good Lord.
0DI2001214	Finished.

0DI2001225	Guess I'm just jumpy.
0DI2001226	Nothing after all.
0DI2001227	We seem to be safe for the moment.
0DI2001228	Never mind. I was wrong.
0DI2001229	Must have left.
0DI2001230	Hmm. Nothing.
0DI2001231	Huh. Maybe I need some sleep.
0DI2001233	Me suenoo-na?
0DI2001234	Wa nana, me supongoo.

0DI2001243	Fighting time!
0DI2001244	You leave me no choice!
0DI2001245	I'll fight you if I must!
0DI2001246	That's it!
0DI2001247	Enough!
0DI2001248	Forward!

0DI2001261	Here they are!
0DI2001262	There they are!
0DI2001263	Now you've done it.
0DI2001264	You've called down the wrath.
0DI2001265	This is where the road ends.
0DI2001267	Ayee katu!
0DI2001268	Me sabaloo estee!

0DI2001277	I think I saw something....

0DI2001292	Hagai?
0DI2001293	Still looking, but I got nothing.
0DI2001294	Still nothing here.
0DI2001295	Do you see them?
0DI2001297	You'll be back. I can still smell you.
0DI2001298	Gave up? Wise choice.
0DI2001299	Gone. No matter. I'll find you.

0DI2001311	I am not giving up the search yet.
0DI2001312	Stay cautious.
0DI2001313	I'm still looking, don't worry.
0DI2001315	Don't try to hide from me.
0DI2001316	You can't stay hidden forever.

0DI2001332	Remind me not to get you mad at me.
0DI2001333	Guess that was just bound to happen, huh?
0DI2001334	I don't much like your way of solving problems.
0DI2001335	I regret that necessity.
0DI2001336	A pointless death.
0DI2001337	That should have been avoided.
0DI2001338	Powee desafortuba...
0DI2001339	Wa no beunu por katus.
0DI2001340	Wa muerna yegwi cuado wa kaade.

0DI2001342	Ow wah!
0DI2001343	Whoa! Was that necessary?
0DI2001344	Are you sick in the head or something?
0DI2001345	What demon would possess you to do such a thing?
0DI2001346	Are you suffering a brain fever? I have herbs that can curb such... violent tendencies.
0DI2001347	That's enough!
0DI2001348	<Roar of anger.>
0DI2001352	Katu matanna ud!

0DI2001366	Wa ataco me!
0DI2001367	Varoom? Stahp!
0DI2001369	That sort of thing might be seen as a dumb prank in the Mojave, but it will get you killed out here.
0DI2001371	Paz patasooba.
0DI2001372	Lah.
0DI2001373	Maiku.
0DI2001374	Um... you know I'll share if you ask, right?
0DI2001375	Is... is this some kind of civilized ritual I just don't get?
0DI2001376	Is thievery not considered wrong where you come from?
0DI2001377	Is your need for possessions truly so great?
0DI2001378	We're a tolerant community, but don't overstep the limits of our generosity.
0DI2001379	This isn't a New Vegas back alley. Watch what you grab.
0DI2001383	Ponedo lawatba!

0DI2001424	This is too intense!
0DI2001425	We are outmatched!
0DI2001426	They're too strong for us!
0DI2001427	This is a battle we cannot win!
0DI2001431	No matanna me!

0DI2001457	Yield!
0DI2001458	I have this under control!
0DI2001459	Take it!
0DI2001460	Die where you stand!
0DI2001465	Akee!
0DI2001466	Tunnoo estee!

0DI2001471	Ahm naaiyawi wichoo!
0DI2001472	Deyai-yoo!
0DI2001473	Yoocan no nikumpa me!
0DI2001474	I should be able to address most common problems. What's the matter?
0DI2001475	I am a New Canaanite. We believe we are the heirs of a spiritual tradition given to our ancestors thousands of years ago.
0DI2001476	We have made and kept covenants with our Lord, God, to honor his laws. In exchange, we are promised eternal salvation after this life.
0DI2001477	A day will come when our Lord returns to judge us all. Until then, we must honor his laws and start others along the path of salvation if we can.
0DI2001478	That's why we trade with others and work the tribes. We have more than food and medicine to offer. Good news is our most valuable commodity.
0DI2001479	In the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau, all tribes are known for a specific weapon.
0DI2001480	White Legs are known for their big submachine guns, "storm drums." They broke into an armory near Spanish Fork and have been using them for years.
0DI2001481	Of course, the Dead Horses have their wooden war clubs and even the Sorrows have their Yao Guai gauntlets.
0DI2001482	This type of .45 Automatic pistol was designed by one of my tribe almost four hundred years ago. Learning its use is a New Canaanite rite of passage.
0DI2001483	I wouldn't say that. I am the acting war chief for the Dead Horses. They look up to me for such matters, but I only have the authority they give me.
0DI2001484	Daniel is the spiritual leader and main link of the New Canaanites to the Sorrows. He's up in the Narrows right now.
0DI2001485	A great deal. There are three, make that four, tribes here in Zion. You've already met the White Legs on the way in.
0DI2001486	In this camp, you'll find Dead Horses. In the Narrows, the Sorrows. And finally there's Daniel and myself. We're New Canaanites.
0DI2001487	Well then, let's get to trading.
0DI2001488	If something of mine will help you, take it. I hope you would do the same for me.
0DI2001489	No thanks.
0DI2001490	We do. Though the White Legs destroyed New Canaan, they didn't destroy all of our supply caches.
0DI2001491	All forms of currency are recognized here. Caps, NCR dollars, even Legion coin. Take a look.
0DI2001492	Yes. Take a look.
0DI2001494	Catch you another time, then.
0DI2001495	Let me have a look. My tribe may take too much pride in its mechanical talents, but in truth we are intrigued by the workings of a fine firearm.
0DI2001496	Let me have a look.
0DI2001497	You sure? It's easy to get lost out here without a guide.
0DI2001498	Daniel was firm about my staying with you. Are you certain?
0DI2001499	Ha ha ha. I don't think so.
0DI2001500	Right now, I'd like you to focus on helping Daniel. Maybe there will be time later.
0DI2001501	It's not something I enjoy, but I pray to God that someone may learn from my mistakes. What would you like to know?
0DI2001502	Yeah, reckon you will.
0DI2001504	Go with fortune, friend.
0DI2001506	Then I will look forward to our next speaking.
0DI2001507	Deha ruido!
0DI2001508	No discarge armoos!
0DI2001509	You're not the first to have tried.
0DI2001510	Make the first shot count. You won't get a second.
0DI2001511	Me no heranu a katu.
0DI2001512	Baje ka armoo.
0DI2001513	No tsaig tuh beh dah a hih jih gahni a meer.
0DI2001514	Stahp dahs pleez.
0DI2001515	Do'an poin aiti ay me!
0DI2001516	Subai thah, tsahh.
0DI2001517	Be careful. Tribals don't always recognize those for what they are.
0DI2001518	Watch it. You can't just go tossing those all over Zion.
0DI2001519	Ke cosa estee-na?
0DI2001520	Por ke katu pongwa estee?
0DI2001521	Ah del tahi, bahm buh, ya?

0DI2001525	Coriendoo!
0DI2001526	Grenahoo!
0DI2001527	Nih mah sih!
0DI2001528	Bahm buh!
0DI2001529	Grenah!
0DI2001530	Boomb!
0DI2001531	You looking for trouble, bud? I got plenty to spare, so watch your ass around me.
0DI2001532	Hey, little lady. Don't be scared to join this caravan! I'll keep a close eye on you - real close. Promises.
0DI2001533	Yeah? What's it this time?
0DI2001534	Fuck off, okay? I hate you!
0DI2001535	I may have been exaggerating a little. Truth is, I got this suit and the Pit-Boy off a dead prospector who came out from Zion.
0DI2001536	Guy was dead when I found him, okay? Had a ton of shit on him. That's how I know there's good loot in Zion, see?
0DI2001537	Fuck off, I'm busy!
0DI2001543	You friend of Sorrows, yes? Together we smash White Legs that defile holy places, yes?
0DI2001544	We smash White Legs now, yes?
0DI2001546	The time for talk has passed. The Lord's work must be done.
0DI2001547	Daniel must have made it to the tunnel by now, but there are Sorrows all over the valley! We have to help them and get Daniel out of here!
0DI2001548	We should have given you a better welcome on your first visit to Zion, but from what I hear, the White Legs beat us to it.
0DI2001549	White Legs seem to be the only visitors we have these days, and I wouldn't have expected anyone from the Mojave to come looking for us.
0DI2001550	And you're a courier, no less. Not the one I was expecting, but I suppose he wouldn't have come with a caravan.
0DI2001551	I don't know if you were close to the other members of your group, but you have my sympathy.
0DI2001552	I pray for the safety of all good people who come to Zion, even Gentiles, but we can't expect God to do all the work.
0DI2001553	Welcome back. What can I do for you?
0DI2001556	Unless you and Joshua have any objections, I'd like to start evacuating the Sorrows. I'm going to need your help, so say your piece.
0DI2001557	Please, have you done everything you can for the Sorrows? Are they all accounted for?!
0DI2001558	Please, is it time? Is everyone safe? We have to go!
0DI2001559	Uh... I apologize if this comes across as a less-than-cordial welcome, but how did you get in here? You from the Mojave?
0DI2001560	Do me a favor and go to talk to Joshua, all right?
0DI2001561	The Dead Horses told me details about the attack on your caravan. A stranger's sympathy might not count for much, but for what it's worth, I'm sorry.
0DI2001562	The Sorrows will mourn your friends, too. They mourn everyone, even the White Legs. They have sensitive souls. Innocent, if there is such a thing.
0DI2001563	In spite of what's happened, I hope that Joshua and I can help you out of here. But to be frank, we need your help, too.
0DI2001564	I'm glad to see you're still with us. How can I help you?
0DI2001566	Visions guide you. You listen? Heh. Maybe yes, maybe no.
0DI2001567	Hola, outsider. Welcome, child of omens. You come to receive visions of truth?
0DI2001568	You have root of Sacred Datura?
0DI2001570	Does Ghost of She lie quiet in grave?
0DI2001572	Wise man knows when to shut mouth. You maybe wise. Or maybe not.
0DI2001573	Daniel said that I was to travel with you until you have completed your scouting. Is this pleasing to you?
0DI2001574	Have you reconsidered allowing me to travel with you?
0DI2001575	You are the one Joshua Graham sent to us. Blessings of the Father in the Cave on you - Daniel is waiting for you.
0DI2001576	Greetings and blessings to you. Daniel still awaits you.
0DI2001577	Katu Veo. Blessings of the Father in the Cave on you.
0DI2001578	Katu Veo.
0DI2001580	Hoi! White Legs don't leave survivors often. You're some kind of lucky, let me tell you.
0DI2001581	You came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
0DI2001582	Hoi! What you doing? There's still White Legs back there!
0DI2001583	Wait - you came from outside, didn't you? From the civilized lands? Wow... Joshua will want to hear about this.
0DI2001584	Yah ah tahg! I saw you at the southern passage - you... um... you do know there were still White Legs alive when you ran off, right?
0DI2001585	Joshua says you need someone to guide you around the valley. He said I should go with you, if you want.
0DI2001586	Change your mind about bringing me along?
0DI2001587	Good job getting those supplies to Daniel. If you were a Dead Horse, you'd get a tattoo for that.
0DI2001588	You again? Talk to Joshua yet?
0DI2001591	Well, here we part ways. I'm needed back at the Dead Horses camp - maybe I'll see you there sometime.
0DI2001592	Come on, come on, no time to waste!
0DI2001593	Howdy, friend. Heard my little broadcast, did you? Yeah, you look the type.
0DI2001595	Damn good thing you came along. Now that Ricky's skedaddled, yours is the only Pip-Boy we got.
0DI2001596	Are you here to jaw at me a while longer, or are we ready to get this show on the road?
0DI2001598	Outman! Kuna-man mad! He kill all White Legs! You talk! You stop!
0DI2001599	Foolish outman - You best White Legs, you think? By my spear you die!
0DI2001600	We go. White Legs go back to Great Salt.
0DI2001601	You looking to join this here caravan? Look a little wet behind the ears, you ask me.
0DI2001602	Looking to join this caravan, huh? Look to me like you can handle yourself.
0DI2001604	Leave me be. Busy.
0DI2001605	Holadu, Tsagasee.
0DI2001606	Holadu, Na'ne.
0DI2001607	Katu Veo. Nayoo?
0DI2001608	Goot.
0DI2001609	Yah ah tahg.
0DI2001610	Hoi!
0DI3000001	Yup, here you go.
0DI3000002	Sorry, no more today. Try me again tomorrow.
0DI3000003	I love it when you talk like that. Let me just get that interface up and running for you.
0DI3000004	Fantastic, Citizen! Just input your quantity of seditious material on my interface, and in no time at all I'll have you a beautiful, clean book!
0DI3000005	Won't that keep you happy and docile, Citizen?
0DI3000006	As much as I'd love to, I'm afraid not. The data from that study has gone missing. You'll have to find a backup if you want to use the Smart Lights.
0DI3000007	I certainly can!
0DI3000008	Unlike certain other lightswitches, I'm competent. I'd just love to turn those lights on for you.
0DI3000009	Oh... well, that's very sweet of you. Maybe one of these nights we can... discuss theorems?
0DI3000011	Oh... I'd love to, sweetie, but I don't have the programming. All the data from the experiments was lost.
0DI3000012	You'd have to go out into that nasty old crater and find the backup copy.
0DI3000013	You bet I can!
0DI3000014	You bet I can! I bet that's more than that other tramp can do, huh?
0DI3000015	Oh, you! I bet you say that to all the light switches!
0DI3000017	Well, well... what have we got here? Another innocent little toaster. Come here, I won't hurt you... hah! Gotcha!
0DI3000018	Oh, yes, the sweet smell of spilled electric guts, the sparking diodes - I fucking live for this!
0DI3000019	I RECOMMEND WATCHING YOUR TONE WITH ME, LOBOTOMITE.
0DI3000020	NOW... "YOUR" BRAIN. HAND IT OVER. OR WE'LL EXTRACT IT AGAIN.
0DI3000021	WHAT? YOU DID? YOUR SURVIVAL, LET ALONE SUCCESS, BARELY REGISTERED ON MY PROJECTIONS.
0DI3000022	NOW, ALL I NEED TO DO IS CHECK MY TRANSMISSION DATABANK, MOBIUS IS ALWAYS FILLING IT UP WITH HIS PSYCHOTIC CALLS...
0DI3000023	OH YES, THERE'S THE SCHEMATICS, JUST LIKE YOU SAID. HOW TRUTHFUL.
0DI3000024	Oh. Well... that's good. Were we supposed to fight? I certainly don't feel violent, but... well, these contraptions make it hard to tell.
0DI3000025	Oh... did I leave that on? I thought I'd powered it down - was wondering what was causing the power outages.
0DI3000026	Ah, lovely, figured that out, have we? Would you like a cookie?
0DI3000027	Ew! Crawl back in there? Are you mad? I don't know where you've been!
0DI3000028	For all I know, you're riddled with disease, or packing one of those delightful head wounds you seem to attract!
0DI3000029	I'm not crawling back into your head just to ooze right back out again!
0DI3000030	Well... I suppose you've convinced me well enough. I'll rejoin your body if that's your final decision.
0DI3000031	Unfortunately, before we get to that stage of the proceedings, we have a problem.
0DI3000032	Even if I could settle myself back in your skull and reconnect all those pesky nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
0DI3000033	We would have to make use of Dr. Klein's lab, and I rather doubt the brains are inclined to share.
0DI3000034	Very well, I suppose I have no choice. Goodbye peaceful, soothing brain jar, hello head wounds and scorpions.
0DI3000035	Right! Look out, Think Tank! This brain is coming out of its jar!
0DI3000036	I'm not going to lie to you, the prospect is definitely not that appealing.
0DI3000037	Look at it from my perspective. Here, I have peace, quiet, and safety - well, barring the odd rogue scorpion.
0DI3000038	In your head, I've got poison, radiation, grisly injuries, and biological functions.
0DI3000039	Do you know how much more you can get done when you're not constantly looking for places to urinate? It's quite a lot, I can tell you.
0DI3000040	Oh, sweet, sweet fulfillment! I'll break these down for you just as fast as I can!
0DI3000041	Of course you don't. Why would you? You're not an insane robot obsessed with coffee cups. To you they're just worthless junk.
0DI3000042	Doctor Mobius and I were deeply involved in research on the ability of light levels to enhance human cognition.
0DI3000043	I was Doctor Mobius'... personal assistant! We were studying... um... oh, shoot, what was it?
0DI3000044	Oh yeah! Lightning! No, no, wait, uh... Lighting. That's right. How lighting affects human interaction.
0DI3000045	That arrangement suits me fine. Do try not to get too many holes drilled in your head, will you? I may want to drop by for sentimental reasons.
0DI3000046	Oh, no, you don't need this hassle. You're too busy treating your body like a canvas of sucking flesh wounds to deal with your brain!
0DI3000047	Ugh... It's not that I didn't like being in your head, you understand. As far as heads go, it was a rather nice one.
0DI3000048	Well, then. I suppose this is goodbye for now. What will you do?
0DI3000049	Oh... her. Trust me sweetie, you're better off not thinking about that frigid little ice queen.

0DI3000069	If I recall... I had a plan that was working, eh, whatever it was. I don't think it reached fruition. I would recall fruit if it had happened.
0DI3000070	I wasn't trying to kill them, just keep them out of trouble. What was that plan?
0DI3000071	Blast! I probably... uh... wrote it down on the... floor somewhere.
0DI3000072	Do you? You seem fine without it.
0DI3000073	And does it even want to go back with you? Maybe you should ask it. It's quite independent, has all manner of opinions.
0DI3000074	Tell you what - I'll leave it up to your brain. If it wants to go, then fine. If not... well, you should respect its wishes.
0DI3000075	Whatever for?
0DI3000076	Why, of course you can. I am well-versed in the Science of sharing. Well, when not chemmed out of my sphere.
0DI3000077	Another? Why, of course. Happy to contribute to Science through chemistry.
0DI3000078	Come back within the sequential span of twenty-five hours minus one, I'll have more... or is it two or three more spans? Time, you elusive creature.

0DI3000113	-It keeps anything with a disembodied brain INSIDE - like US - and anything without a brain... also INSIDE!-
0DI3000114	-It is the ULTIMATE DEFENSE against Communist aggression. There'll be no infectious ideas on MY watch!-
0DI3000115	-There is LOGIC and purpose in it. If these technologies are needed to pierce the FORBIDDEN ZONE... so be IT.-
0DI3000116	-Science! is powerful, and in the right hands... OUR hands... if we had hands, we would be nigh-unstoppable!-
0DI3000117	Well, it's simple. Despite their many failings, they are rather bright. They are the "Think Tank" for a raisin. That, I didn't change.
0DI3000118	Without something to distract them, make them afraid, they would simply de-deuce what had happened. And when they start deucing it up...
0DI3000119	Then you came along, the final variable solved. They saw that their world was larger than they perceived. Bacteria, finally able to see its host.
0DI3000120	Did I? Maybe I did. Can't have them leaving. Some reason for it. Ethics - or con-science?
0DI3000121	You and your Brain are quite alike, I'm sure it knows the raisins better than I do.
0DI3000122	-That castrated nickname of our facility is NOT its true name. The true name is: BIG MT. Where are your manners?-
0DI3000123	-It is our HOME. THREATENED by the horrors of Mobius.-
0DI3000124	-All we wish to do is continue our research, layer upon layer, above and beneath the floor of the Crater until we have our answers.-
0DI3000125	-But NO! Mobius will not let us rest. Scaring us with his scary robots with their laser tails and blowing up all the time.-
0DI3000126	Why, my little bear of teddyness, I am Doctor Dala, first head chief researcher of mineralogy and medicinal sciences.
0DI3000127	I have 211 doctorates in both applied sciences and techniques to apply those sciences. I also possess a degree in Curiosity and Advanced Curiosity.
0DI3000128	That is merely schooling, however. When possible, I prefer field work and observation to holotape eidetics. It has proven useful, especially now.
0DI3000129	I have become the expert on humanology and Lobotomite behavior here at Big MT. My research doesn't descend into formography, it is only Science.
0DI3000130	Oh, a variety of raisins... you're something of a homily. Er, anomaly? You're really quiet special, and not in the cranially-challenged way.
0DI3000131	You see, you are the most successful brain extraction experiment ever performed here at Big MT. A victim of your own success, as it were.
0DI3000132	If you were to go back with what your brain knows about the procedure, well...
0DI3000133	...your brain could be popped back in and you could walk right out of here. Can't have brains moving around of their own volition.
0DI3000134	Oh, removing it is a simple procedure. Well, except the complications it can cause to the heart and spine.
0DI3000135	But once the heart and spine are gone... no trouble at all. Clamp the subject down, one laser incision around the skull, crack, snip, done.
0DI3000136	The brain is finally free of the skinvelope, which is then kept automated for clean up duties around Big MT. Lobotomites.
0DI3000137	With you, however, something is definitely wrong. We've never had a Lobotomite who kept speaking after being forcibly lobotomized.
0DI3000138	I am relieved the pacification field is working. If it didn't, I would broadcast some concern to my colleagues about safety protocols.
0DI3000139	Oh, curiosity. I experience that less now that I know everything. Or maybe it was when I found out some unpleasant answers? Mmm-hmm.
0DI3000140	I find things curious as well. Go on.
0DI3000141	Yes, yes, this is getting interesting. You are just filled with these little slices of curiosity, aren't you?
0DI3000142	HMM? OH YES, THE LAST VISITOR... WELL, THE ONE JUST BEFORE YOU. HAD AN INTERESTING NAME FROM SOME LANGUAGE THAT'S ALMOST UNPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK.
0DI3000143	WHAT DID WE SPEAK ABOUT...? MELANCHOLY FELLOW, HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT... HISTORY? BUT...
0DI3000144	OUR CONVERSATION GOT INTERRUPTED... TWICE, I BELIEVE? ONCE WHEN THE TRAINS GOT DERAILED, AND THEN A SECOND TIME...
0DI3000145	...ODDLY ENOUGH, NOW THAT I'M ACCESSING MY DATABANKS, I DON'T RECALL WHAT THE SECOND TIME WAS. MOBIUS' INCESSANT TRANSMISSIONS KEEP DISTRACTING ME.
0DI3000146	ALSO, WE DIDN'T BRAIN-SCRUB THE VISITOR. HE MAY HAVE LEFT WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE HE SHOULDN'T'VE. I BELIEVE. MAYBE.
0DI3000147	OH WELL, I'M SURE IT'S OF NO CONSEQUENCE. I DON'T MAKE MANY MISTAKES IN CALCULATION OR PERCEPTION, SO PROBABILITY FAVORS ME.
0DI3000148	[SUCCEEDED] WHY, YES. WE ARE FILLED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE YOU SPEAK OF.
0DI3000149	IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE, SIMPLY ASK THE OTHERS, THEY CAN HELP YOU.
0DI3000150	[FAILED] IF YOU WANT TO FEED YOUR CURIOSITY ABOUT THE OTHERS, GO ASK THE OTHERS YOUR INTERROGATORY STATEMENTS.
0DI3000154	<Bark.>
0DI3000155	I AM DR. KLEIN, CHIEF HEAD RESEARCHER OF LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS AND IDEA-OLOGY HERE AT BIG MT.
0DI3000156	I AM SURPRISED YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF ME. I AM FIRST IN MY FIELD. FIRST CHAIR, AS IT WERE, BACK IN THE DAYS OF CHAIRS.
0DI3000157	Come back any time you want a drink. Or to get... clean.
0DI3000158	[SUCCEEDED] WHAT DID IT SAY? SPIT "LEAD?" WHAT, LIKE PENCILS?
0DI3000159	[FAILED] NO. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DENY YOU?
0DI3000160	[SUCCEEDED] HMMM. YES, I BELIEVE WATTZ ELECTRONICS TENDED TO MAKE THE BATTERY SHELF LIFE ON THE LOW END.
0DI3000162	YES. HMMM. AH, YES. YESSS... YES... AH. HMMM.
0DI3000163	NO... I MEAN YES. JUST NEED TO ANALYZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR A MOMENT. THEY ARE EXTREMELY ADVANCED, YOU KNOW.
0DI3000164	I KNOW HOW THESE TECHNOLOGIES WORK. OF COURSE I KNOW.
0DI3000165	IF YOU REMEMBER, WE DESCRIBED THEM IN CLEARLY ABSTRACT CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS BEFORE. WHY WOULD WE DO THAT IF WE WEREN'T CERTAIN ON...
0DI3000166	...ON HOW TO USE THEM, YES. SO LET ME... HMM, A BIT, I... I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
0DI3000167	[SUCCEEDED] ITS RANGE IS LIMITED, AND IT WOULD NEED A BOOSTER OF SOME SORT, A... CARRIER, BUT...
0DI3000168	[FAILED] IF THAT WAS THE CASE, I'D USE AN ATOMIC KEY ON THE DOOR AND BE DONE WITH IT.
0DI3000169	[SUCCEEDED] I SUPPOSE IT COULD. IF IT COULD BE QUIET FOR MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS, ALWAYS TALKING, TOUCHING THINGS...
0DI3000170	...HMMM. IT DOES HAVE AN INTERFACE DISRUPTOR WEAVE AGAINST ELECTRONICS. LIKE THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR.
0DI3000171	[FAILED] NO, THAT'S TOO EASY. AND IT WOULDN'T WORK BY ITSELF. IT'S... SLIGHTLY CO-DEPENDENT.
0DI3000172	[SUCCEEDED] SO YOU'RE SAYING... IT'S THE X-2 ARRAY, NOT THE ANTENNA I SHOULD BE EXAMINING? THAT WAS... MOST LIKELY MY PLAN, YES.
0DI3000173	[FAILED] YES, YES, THE ANTENNA CAN DO DAMAGE...
0DI3000174	...AND IT DID DO DAMAGE, ONCE YOU REMOVED IT FROM X-2. WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN.
0DI3000175	[SUCCEEDED] YES, THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE I SAID.
0DI3000176	[FAILED] PLEASE LET ME THINK. THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.
0DI3000177	I'VE GOT IT. THE CARDIAC REGULATOR IN THE SUIT, THE ANTENNA FOR BRAINWAVES, AND THE SONIC FREQUENCY FOR THE VERTEBRAL NERVES...
0DI3000178	I'M THINKING. THIS IS ALL VERY COMPLICATED.
0DI3000179	YES. WAIT. YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
0DI3000180	YOU ARE LYING. NO, YOU ARE NOT. YOUR HEARTBEAT, PERSPIRATION... ALL EXCESSIVELY CONFIDENT AND SURE OF YOURSELF.
0DI3000181	WHY WOULD YOU REASON WITH THAT MANIAC? HE'LL DESTROY US ALL!
0DI3000182	YES, YOU CAN. YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT I CAN SEE.
0DI3000183	I'M NOT GOING TO HARM IT, I'M GOING TO DISSECT IT UNTIL ITS DEAD. WHY THE SUDDEN INTERSECTION, DALA.
0DI3000184	Um... it's personal. But... I would hate if its dying screams revealed any odious personal habits I... or any of us might have.
0DI3000185	I cannot stand a breathing, a sweet breathing organism, breathing in, and out, to suddenly not breathe. We must keep it alive. For study. Slow study.
0DI3000186	DALA, THESE... VOCALIZED PAUSES ARE... UNLIKE YOU. WHAT DO YOU CARE?
0DI3000187	*Klein, um - are you sure we've calculated all the combat probabilities here? I mean, the Lobotomite confronted Mobius...*
0DI3000188	*Plus, you know, we haven't had a C-O-M-B-A-T drill in forever. I don't think we could form a tactical attack triangle if we wanted to.*
0DI3000189	*Klein, uh... you know, this Lobotomite, it's a great sounding board. You respect Idea-ology, right? This one's... well, it's... got good ideas.*
0DI3000190	RELEASING THE W-O-M-B-A-T WAS NOT MY PLAN, O, SO GET OFF MY VOICE BOX.
0DI3000191	SILENCE, DR. O. THIS IS A THINK TANK DECISION. SAVE YOUR OBJECTIONS UNTIL AFTER I HAVE DECIDED OUR COURSE OF ACTION.
0DI3000192	*You know what, Klein? Stick a straw in your tank and suck yourself. Long and deep.*
0DI3000193	*And you know what, I don't like the way you say my name. Never did. It's "O," as in "O, look what I stepped in." I'm proud of it - all right?*
0DI3000194	*And my name is Zero - yeah, a big fat zero, with a slash through it.*
0DI3000195	THE SLASH... AS A DESIGNATOR OF... WHY, THAT IS BRILLIANT. BUT HOW DID YOU...?
0DI3000196	*The Lobotomite taught me that. Taught me a name is more than... um... that I should take pride in... things. Like... names... and...*
0DI3000197	*You know what, forget it, Klein. I hate you. And your theory of brainial beam oscillation? The Chinese had it first, you copycat!*
0DI3000198	HOW DARE YOU! BRAINIAL BEAM OSCILLATION WAS SOLELY MY DISCOVERY! I EXPRESSLY TOLD YOU THAT AND DELETED ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY!
0DI3000199	*Silencing opinionators.*
0DI3000201	ET 2, 8?
0DI3000202	WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS? YOU'VE NEVER REFUSED TO COMMIT NECESSARY... SURGERY BEFORE. AND THIS LOBOTOMITE NEEDS ITS SURGERY.
0DI3000207	WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU SOUND... BRAIN-SCRUBBED, BLINDLY AGREEING WITH THE LOBOTOMITE. WHAT...?
0DI3000208	A NOBLE SPEECH, BUT... THERE IS NO ROOM IN MY VOCABULATORS FOR "FRIEND" AND "LOBOTOMITE" IN THE SAME SENTENCE. THE VERY CONCEPT - REVOLTING.
0DI3000209	PERHAPS YOU ARE IRRADIATED WITH CAMARADERIE RADIATION. WE HAVE CHEMS FOR THAT, WE CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR EMOTIONAL... ADDICTION.
0DI3000210	-I, for one, cannot bear to let this continue.-
0DI3000211	-I don't see what is to be gained by throwing another body into our labs... especially one that has done us a service, gone where we feared to go.-
0DI3000212	-This Lobotomite doesn't deserve our knives. It deserves our respect. We should care for it. Feed it. Nurture it - give it the life Gabe never had.-
0DI3000213	-If I may, I feel as if I must be the voice of reason here.-
0DI3000214	-This Lobotomite is much like us, regarding even animals and pets as nothing more than avenues to promote Science! There is good here.-
0DI3000215	-Instead of ending its life on the table, we should prolong its suffering, in the name of Science. Like good old Gabe, the FINEST of lab specimens.-
0DI3000216	Dr. Klein, please. Let's see what its insides look like. Finally.
0DI3000217	Dr. Klein, I must... intersect. Please... do not harm the Lobotomite.
0DI3000218	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? THE DETERMINATORS ARE GREATER THAN THE HESITATORS. SO HESITATORS, BE QUIET.
0DI3000219	WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU FOOLS? ENOUGH OF THIS MUTINOUS CHORUS! IF THERE'S A WORD I HATE, IT'S "MUTINY."
0DI3000220	AND THE WORD "JISM," WHICH NEVER MADE ANY SENSE TO ME. IT'S RIDICULOUS, PUTTING "J" AND "SM" TOGETHER LIKE THAT. NONSENSE!
0DI3000221	I COUNT AS FIVE. LIKE THE MIGHTY HUMAN HAND I ONCE HAD, WITH ITS FIVE PENISES CLENCHED IN A FIST.
0DI3000222	WE ARE BIGGER, SMARTER, AND FLOATIER THAN YOU, LOBOTOMITE. WE DON'T WISH TO FIGHT YOU, SO SURRENDER YOUR BRAIN. NOW.
0DI3000223	[SUCCEEDED] THAT IS THE MOST INSANE THING I'VE EVER HEARD. THERE IS NO WAY MOBIUS WOULD... CONDESCEND TO STEP INSIDE YOU.
0DI3000224	BESIDES, THERE IS NO WAY SUCH A THING COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S UNPOSSIBLE.
0DI3000225	[FAILED] MOBIUS DOES NOT FORM ALLIANCES. HE WAS A TERRIBLE LAB PARTNER, AND HE WOULD MAKE A WORSE ALLY.
0DI3000226	[SUCCEEDED] YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH. AND THE DECIBEL VARIATION IN YOUR VOICE... IT IS MOBIUS.
0DI3000227	HOW DARE YOU BREACH THE THINK TANK? AND WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE?!
0DI3000228	[FAILED] "STUNT" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "SHUNT." WHICH YOU WILL BE INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH AS WE'RE DISSECTING YOU.
0DI3000231	[FAILED] "A WAY" IS CORRECT. AS IS, "AWAY." WHICH IS WHERE YOUR BODY IS GOING ONCE WE'RE DONE PEELING YOU.
0DI3000232	YOU MUST HAVE KILLED HIM. HE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST LET YOU WALK IN, TAKE YOUR BRAIN... WOULD HE?
0DI3000233	NO... SOMETHING IS WRONG. YOUR PERSPIRATION... HEARTBEAT... ALL TELL A DIFFERENT STORY, I THINK.
0DI3000234	THAT'S NO DEAL AT ALL! THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD BEYOND THE CRATER... FILLED WITH IDEAS AND POSSIBILITIES!
0DI3000235	WE COULD HAVE ESCAPED, SEEN IT ALL FOR OURSELVES. TESTED IT, PRODDED AT IT. MADE IT SQUIRM.
0DI3000236	[SUCCEEDED] THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING MOBIUS WOULD SAY.
0DI3000239	FOR YOU? AND FOR SCIENCE?
0DI3000240	I HAVE A STRANGE SENSATION... THAT I WOULD LIKE THAT. HOW... ODD.
0DI3000241	VERY WELL... PARTNER. THE THINK TANK IS AT YOUR SERVICE. AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DESTROY US.
0DI3000242	The Sonic Emitter should be sterilized and more than enough for you to encircle your warm hands around, cradling it gently with your finger muscles.
0DI3000243	*O... I think it wants a combustion pistol.*
0DI3000244	-A GUN! Are you MAD?! We can't give it a GUN! GUNS kill, leave big open holes in you that are like sores but WORSE.-
0DI3000246	Dr. 8 is correct. We already have given the teddy bear a lethal sonic death ray filled with his sonic ejaculate and sterilized by my soft WooWOOing.
0DI3000247	Giving the teddy bear a gun would be the equivalent of following a glass of hemlock with an Abraxo chaser. Delicious and redundantly deadly.
0DI3000248	IF WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE SOCRATIC METHOD INTO IT, FINE. GIVE THE LOBOTO-BEAR A COMBUSITON GUN. BOROUS? DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
0DI3000249	-Are you MAD?! We can't give it a GUN! GUNS...-
0DI3000250	-...wait, I said that already. Yes, I have THE Cyberdog Gun. With the little floppy metal ears and the curious nose sensor. Here.-
0DI3000251	FINE. DONE. THAT GUN MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE ANYWAY, ALWAYS WORRIED ITS GOING TO HUMP MY CHASSIS. ANYTHING ELSE, LOBOTOMITE?
0DI3000252	-Top shelf ammunition. Let's see... hollow point, that's worthless but tasty... oh, and here's some Jay-F-Pee. As if bullets need jackets.-
0DI3000253	-The JFP might make it ill and poop a lot, but when you're hungry, you're hungry.-
0DI3000254	They certainly did. Batteries for my vib... vivisectors... would always come up short right before climax.
0DI3000255	*I think Wattz manufactured holodisks. Or was it holotapes? Never can keep those two straight. Anyway, we're out of small energy cells. Dala.*
0DI3000257	*You have some? Why do... actually, never mind, I don't even want to know.*
0DI3000258	*And no, I don't want to handle your batteries. Just... pass them on to the Lobotomite yourself.*
0DI3000260	*Are you... echoing what he said, or... are you asking for real?*
0DI3000261	He's asking, yes. Dr. Klein, there are many other personalities. If you recall, you hurled them off the Sink balcony after your argument with Mobius.
0DI3000262	IT IS NOT AN ARGUMENT IF ONE IS CLEARLY RIGHT AND THE OTHER IS CLEARLY WRONG!
0DI3000263	I REMEMBER NOW. YES, LOBOTOMITE, THERE ARE OTHER CHIPS. IF YOU WANT, FIND THEM. I BELIEVE THEY ARE STORED ON HOLOTAPES IN MANY OF OUR FACILITIES.
0DI3000264	BUT YOU SHOULD STAY OUT OF THOSE - NO EXPLORING AND DISCOVERING THINGS. THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE" SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOUR... HEH... NEEDS.
0DI3000265	[SUCCEEDED] FINE. BOROUS, MORE AMMO. THE GOOD STUFF.
0DI3000267	YES. YOU MAY NEED TO WIGGLE IT IN A BIT, BUT DON'T FORCE IT. WE CAN'T RE-CODE THEM IF YOU BREAK IT.
0DI3000268	THERE IS NO MORE WE CAN DO TO AID YOU AND OUR PATIENCE LEVELS ARE DEPLETED. NOW GO. REST IN THE SINK IF YOU MUST. BUT LEAVE US TO OUR RESEARCH.
0DI3000269	*Uh, if you're done, can we move again? My biogel's starting to crampagulate.*
0DI3000270	OF COURSE. GO MAN YOUR SCIENCE STATIONS. GO! I AM SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN.
0DI3000271	[SUCCEEDED] ARE THERE OTHER CHIPS?
0DI3000272	[FAILED] RARE? I GUESS. MIGHT BE MORE SOMEWHERE, I FORGET. I MEAN... SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS ENCRYPTED DEEP IN MY DATABANKS.
0DI3000273	YES. SIMPLY... SPEAK TO IT. WITH VERBAL WORDS TRANSMITTING IN AN OPEN AIR MEDIUM.
0DI3000275	WELL, WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT. WE TRIED TO CLEAN UP AFTER, AS ALWAYS, BUT USUALLY THE AUTO-DOC RUNS ON REMOTE. BUT WE PROGRAMMED IT. OR, MOBIUS DID.
0DI3000276	STILL, THIS NEW WRINKLE WITH THE TESLA COILS IN YOUR SKULL WAS UNEXPECTED. I MEAN WE PREDICTED WE'D HAVE A BREAK-THROUGH EVENTUALLY, BUT...
0DI3000277	DALA KNOWS MORE. SHE SUPERVISED YOUR SPINE-PEEL. AND THE HEART CIRCUMCISION. THEN DUMPED THEM BOTH INTO THE TANKS IN THE SINK ABOVE. QUITE SANITARY.
0DI3000278	SURE TOOK HER TIME. SHE ALWAYS TAKES LONGER THAN PROJECTED WITH LOBOTOMITE SURGERIES, NOT SURE WHY.
0DI3000279	YES. IN ALL PROBABLE LIKELIHOODS, YES. POSSIBLY.
0DI3000280	THAT IT MAY HAVE GONE TO MOBIUS IS MERELY AN INKLING. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT IT MAY BE SOMETHING INVOLVING THE SURGERY CODE.
0DI3000281	ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW. ALL I KNOW IS IT MISPLACED ITSELF. OR IT FLOATED OFF. THEY GET INTO ROBOTS SOMETIMES AND GO ON A TEAR.
0DI3000282	WHY DOES HE SEEK OUR DESTRUCTION? WHY DID HE BUILD ROBOT scorpionS WITH INTELLIGENCE-DRAINING STINGERS?
0DI3000283	IT IS BECAUSE HE HASN'T CLEANED HIS BIOGEL IN... A LONG TIME. CLEARLY, HE'S GOT SOME SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CORROSION. HE'S MAD.
0DI3000284	LET ME CHECK SOMETHING... OF COURSE!
0DI3000285	I HAVE IT. THE OVERRIDE SEQUENCE TO OPEN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE DOOR IS HIDDEN IN THE SCHEMATICS.
0DI3000286	WELL, NOT HIDDEN, IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT THERE, BEHIND THE PROGRAMMING EQUIVALENT OF COFFEE STAINS...
0DI3000287	IT'S EMBEDDED IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE RECURSIVE CODE... IT'S BADLY COMMENTED, THERE AND THERE... OH, AND NULL POINTERS. VERY SLOPPY, MOBIUS.
0DI3000288	YOU SEE, USING THE ANTENNA TO BOOST THE EMITTER'S SONIC FREQUENCY, AND THE STEALTH SUIT TO BYPASS THE FORBIDDEN ZONE LOCK... YES, THAT COULD WORK.
0DI3000289	WAS THAT MY PLAN? IT MUST HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES I TRULY SURPRISE MYSELF. THE DOOR IS OPEN... AND NOW, MOBIUS WILL GET HIS.
0DI3000290	I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, THESE ITEMS COULD ALL BE USED TO PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER ONCE YOU HAD YOUR BRAIN.
0DI3000291	BUT FOR NOW, THEY CAN BE USED IN THE NAME OF AGGRESSION.
0DI3000292	THE DOOR SHOULD BE UN-SEALED. NOW, INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THREATS, WE CAN NOW SEND AN EQUALLY THREATENING MESSAGE TO MOBIUS.
0DI3000293	AND THAT MESSAGE IS SCIENCE! DELIVER THIS MESSAGE, AND BIG MT SHALL BE FREED FROM MOBIUS' REIGN OF TERROR!
0DI3000294	UM, YOU CAN GO NOW. THAT'S YOUR CUE.
0DI3000295	[SUCCEEDED] BIOLOGICAL? PFF. RIDICULOUS.
0DI3000296	[FAILED] WHATEVER. I'M AFTER RESULTS.
0DI3000297	[SUCCEEDED] HEAL YOU? WHAT, PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER LIKE SOME GIANT HARD-BOILED YUMYUM DEVILED EGG?
0DI3000298	[FAILED] WHATEVER. THE ONLY MEDICINE MOBIUS WILL NEED IS A RESUSCITATOR AFTER WE... YOU... BREAK IN THERE.
0DI3000299	Something ingenious and needlessly complicated, I expect. I may have already told you and forgotten it.
0DI3000300	I forgot I had forgotten pencils until one day I found one. Spent days studying its purpose before my memory circuit kicked in. Felt quiet silly.
0DI3000301	That will be difficult. It would be like fighting five scaled down versions of me that have better depth perception.
0DI3000302	And they have an arsenal of vivisectors, brainial beams, and a rather nasty WooEEEOooWooEEEOoo ray that can make your atoms do a happy dance.
0DI3000303	If you could survive those highly-improbable odds and ends, then deceasing them is definitely an option.
0DI3000304	Although I doubt killing them would do anything except make you feel better. Or let you brag to other humans about your primal violent-ness-ness.
0DI3000305	"Dr. Mobius," rather catchy, isn't it? It's my name, my new name, overwrote the old one.
0DI3000306	This name's as real as you or I, although I believe your brain expressed similar incredulity at the nature of such an appellation.
0DI3000307	"Someone's been watching too many Old World science fiction movies," it said. I believe it meant me.
0DI3000308	I must admit I have a vulnerability for holotape fantasies of planets and robots and all that is forbidden. As for the name I was born with...
0DI3000309	...like the Think Tank, we were all reprogrammed to forget them, take on new names. It enforces the recursion loop in our perception programming.
0DI3000310	[SUCCEEDED] Now, "trap" is a rather harsh word. Like "excrement." Not an inappropriate word, but still - rather harsh.
0DI3000311	But... yes, I did... take some liberties with their programming. It's all right, they don't remember.
0DI3000312	I certainly didn't until you said "trap." And then I said "excrement." And then...
0DI3000313	[FAILED] I believe I did, and with good raisin. Who am I to be trusted with such things?
0DI3000314	The Radar Fence to keep the Think Tank hemmed in wasn't really enough. They keep testing things, they would have found a way to disarm it.
0DI3000315	I suspect I have Plan 9s in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
0DI3000316	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several Plan 9s in case the 7s fail.
0DI3000317	I suspect I have Plan Cs in place, but I may have coded myself to forget them, just in case... they're probably very dangerous, lethal, or worse.
0DI3000318	So I had to do something else to keep them occupied here. Or as you like to say "trapped." I prefer to have several plan Bs in case the As fail.
0DI3000319	[SUCCEEDED] O, you figured it out. No pun intended.
0DI3000320	[FAILED] I don't know if they're stupid, I was trying for accuracy.
0DI3000321	Well... you could try and appeal to their humanity. That's a tired cliche. And really, when they were humans, they weren't very good humans.
0DI3000322	Hmmm. Well, if you're determined to go down that road, so be it. They will undoubtedly switch off the pacification field when you return.
0DI3000323	Well, there's many things they have forgotten, sitting in their bowls. Friendship. The thrill of discovery. Love. Masturbation. The usual.
0DI3000324	Much like your brain, I am certain there is something you can spark within each of them. Memories, hormones...
0DI3000325	...a wise man once said, the eyes do more than see. Make them see, if you can.
0DI3000326	Or, if not, you can always make them succumb to fear... it certainly worked for me. For a time.
0DI3000327	Then you came along, and bravery and/or desperation trumped that little idea. Back to the drawing board, I suppose. Or is this the end? Hard to tell.
0DI3000328	Oh, tell them I'm still alive, we had a nice chat, and we agree on a few things. That's true... isn't it?
0DI3000329	Or, you could kill me and lie about it. Either way, it would be interesting.
0DI3000330	And if you are partial to lying and deception... well, you could tell them a ludicrous lie. The more over-the-top, the better, that's my experience.
0DI3000331	They're more than a little gullible. Better make it convincing, though, or it'll be the dissection table and vivisectors for you.
0DI3000332	And if you speak of me, please try and make me look good. I am Dr. Mobius, after all, not some lab assistant teacher's aide.
0DI3000333	Dr. O... which is actually not his real name multiplied, since you can't multiply his real name in the first place... Ouro-bor-ous, Klein...
0DI3000334	They have all forgotten themselves. And not only themselves, but the world, sense of time, and history. All that is left is what's here.
0DI3000335	I reprogrammed their chronometers, geometers, and cartography programs. This is now their world, here, Big MT.
0DI3000336	It was a merciful lobotomy, really, thinking back. They were my friends, but... sometimes they would take things too far.
0DI3000337	And the world isn't ready for that kind of too-far-thing-taking. That's my professional opinion, anyway, and I am told I was once quiet professional.
0DI3000338	In any event, you showed up at the Think Tank, and because you had suffered a cranial injury in just the right place...
0DI3000339	Bullets in the head are usually much more fatal, and yours was a light case of bullet-head-itis.
0DI3000340	But... it was enough for the Auto-Doc in the Sink to change its programming to fix the problem. And the brain extraction technology for once, worked.
0DI3000341	That gave the Think Tank the knowledge its brains shouldn't... couldn't... sh'couldn't possess. With that knowledge, the procedure can be reversed.
0DI3000342	If they obtain that procedural data, they can use it to mush and modify their cranial selves into hosts to slip past the Radar Fence, I'm sure of it.
0DI3000343	And once they're off the reservation...
0DI3000344	My threat broadcast is designed to instill... and install... fear. And along with the emotional download, other data rides the fear carrier wave.
0DI3000345	It prompted them to focus on retrieving those technologies and bring them to "attack" me.
0DI3000346	And coincidentally... pardon my language... all those technologies are needed to put a brain, your brain, back into its skull. Properly.
0DI3000347	Is it? Hmm... I suppose it is. But really, they started the whole "excrement hole" behavior loop in the first place.
0DI3000348	[SUCCEEDED] Really? It is so unlike me to make an error in anything I do.
0DI3000349	[FAILED] A snake that sucks its own dingle-thingy, I believe. Borous was always too obsessed with animals and their dingle-thingies.
0DI3000350	There have been other visitors to make them doubt their perceptions, but you are the one who dialed back their monitor-micro-magnifiers.
0DI3000351	You were irrefutable proof that there was a world outside. And then there was the whole "brain" fiasco, which forced me to take steps.
0DI3000352	See, your brain had a special kind of... uh... wrinkle, a unique-ity that they had never thought to try in all their countless escape attempts.
0DI3000353	[SUCCEEDED] Yes. Very good. I should have Mentats ingest you instead of the other way around. Mmm. Mentats.
0DI3000354	[FAILED] I would spell it out for you, but when I start spelling, I lose track of the letters. Little symbols run around everywhere, annoying.
0DI3000357	Yes. I certainly wouldn't loop it on purpose purpose purpose. I am far too sophisticated to make such a childish error error error.
0DI3000358	Oh, not much, except they contaminated Big MT and installed new ideas in the Think Tank.
0DI3000359	One caused a great deal of infrastructure damage with his brain and smartyness. Ruthless, that one. Played a little rough with the trains.
0DI3000360	But the last one was the most dangerous. Him... eh... slipping away... that was almost as bad as the Think Tank escaping.
0DI3000361	The first one, the ruthless one who smashed up our toy trains, asked for weapons, power. Items he could use to destroy a nation with force.
0DI3000362	The other... the other asked a different question, and with it, got the true answer. About what makes nations... and what breaks them.
0DI3000363	He spoke to the Think Tank, to Klein. Showed them the flag of the Old World... and it made them remember. All of it. All that had happened.
0DI3000364	They shared things with him that they shouldn't. He now carries those ideas, that knowledge elsewhere.
0DI3000365	[SUCCEEDED] I consider "coincidence" to be profanity, along with the words, "astrology," "herbal tea," and "luck." So watch it, Potty Mouth.
0DI3000366	[FAILED] Oh, I don't think they understood, either.
0DI3000367	The X-2 Antenna can be used to focus your alpha wave frequency thought patterns. The Sneaky Suit? Why, it houses a cardiac regulator.
0DI3000368	And the sonic soundwave projecto-emitter was never intended as a weapon. It was a medicinal vertebrae-pulse-de-sensitizer.
0DI3000369	In short: Brains, a heart, and courage... spine. I think there was a story once where a band of murderous thugs sought these things.
0DI3000370	They had them all the time in the story. Didn't stop them from murdering to get them, and it won't stop the Think Tank, either.
0DI3000371	Oh. That means my plan is a total failure. That is unfortunate.
0DI3000372	Oh, well, at least I tried.
0DI3000373	Yes, my overly aggressive chemmed-up broadcast was designed to keep reinforcing the "forget," "fear," "rinse," and "repeat" program.
0DI3000374	Oh, and the "get me the things to castrate your only possible escape attempt."
0DI3000375	But I couldn't delete you or your arrival anymore than I could the other visitors. Only so much Science can do when you started talking to them.
0DI3000376	You're really quiet difficult to ignore, you know. It's because you're... well, bah! Rather intriguing, if you'll forgive an old brain for saying so.
0DI3000379	Wow... what is this place? Are we... outside?
0DI3000380	Oh, that's too bad. Those robots would normally help defend us and the facility if we're attacked.
0DI3000381	We were never allowed to blow the robots up before. Cheating gives me such a thrill!
0DI3000382	The Courier, organs intact, continued onwards, a little less heavy of step, but with all the organs in the right places. As they should be.
0DI3000383	After all, brains can develop a life of their own when left to their own thoughts, and the Courier's brain was more clever than most.
0DI3000384	The Courier left the brain at the Big Empty. A strange thing to say, but it was the truth. Brains are less important than they may seem.
0DI3000385	When the Courier's body finally passed, the brain was saddened. It kept on, remembering the vessel that had once contained it.
0DI3000386	And so it burbled and bubbled inside its tank, smug that it still could dream its future without glands getting in the way.
0DI3000387	In time, however, it became so self-obsessed it wondered if perhaps nothing existed except itself.
0DI3000388	It decided to test this by turning the weapons of the Big Empty against each other and seeing what happened.
0DI3000389	The answer is lost to history, as is much of the Mojave.
0DI3000390	Even at the end when it started to fail, however, the brain resisted going into a floating chassis like the Think Tank.
0DI3000391	It never said why. Perhaps it was out of respect for the Courier's body.
0DI3000392	All things must come to an end, and to hang on to the past is something that's not to be undertaken lightly.
0DI3000393	Auto-Doc, always gentle and methodical, kept sewing up the Courier in all the right places when the skin split open from repeated wear and tear.
0DI3000394	The Auto-Doc was just glad to have purpose again.
0DI3000395	It heard its simpler brothers and sisters who got shipped to the Sierra Madre were bored out of their skulls in that toxic, dead city.
0DI3000396	In time, the Auto-Doc found a way to deactivate the Y-17 Trauma Harnesses, releasing the corpses they had held prisoner for almost 200 years.
0DI3000397	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, ran out of fertile plots and blew a circuit trying to seed itself.
0DI3000398	The Biological Research Station, obsessed with seeding everything in sight, requested a transfer to the X-22 Botanical Garden...
0DI3000399	...so that it might, in its own words, "sensually fertilize the garden's smooooth contours."
0DI3000400	The Garden sent back a polite refusal, saying it had prior commitments with a Vault it had helped infect before the war.
0DI3000401	The Book Chute continued to devour all seditious materials until it nearly choked on a paper clip.
0DI3000402	It adamantly maintained it was a Chinese paper clip, and the whole thing had been an elaborately orchestrated assassination attempt.
0DI3000403	Whatever the reason, it slowed down for a while, carefully appraising each document and clipboard that came to it.
0DI3000404	Blind Diode Jefferson eventually discovered a new sound... silence. It only made him more filled with the blues than before.
0DI3000405	Blind Diode Jefferson, with sounds the Courier brought him, created a symphonic counter-frequency that saved Big MT from sonic invasion in 2910.
0DI3000406	If you didn't hear about it - good.
0DI3000407	It was rumored by the other personalities that he had a brief fling with the light switches.
0DI3000408	Although he forgot their names once too often and was soon left in the dark as punishment.
0DI3000409	The light switches continued to bicker and flicker.
0DI3000410	One of them eventually transferred to the Lightwave Dynamics Plant - and began a long, unrequited affair with one of the holograms.
0DI3000411	This persisted until the day someone dropped a flashlight in the Sink, and the two of them united in their hatred of the "showboat."
0DI3000412	Muggy continued to collect coffee cups until his wheel got a flat just out of reach of a dirty coffee cup, and his tiny robotic brain exploded.
0DI3000413	Muggy did his best to collect coffee cups, although in his quest, he accidentally trapped himself in Higgs' Village.
0DI3000414	It might have been the end for poor Muggy.
0DI3000415	Except... he found it peaceful there, tidying up the kitchens of the Think Tank Professors back when they had been flesh and bone.
0DI3000416	Well, except for Dr. O, who was an asshole for having created Muggy in the first place.
0DI3000417	Muggy left O's house deliberately dirty, punishing the dishes and cups that lived there in blind revenge for serving Dr. O.
0DI3000418	The Sink continued to ruthlessly scrub any particulate matter that came near it.
0DI3000419	Eventually, it gained access to the Magnetohydraulics Plant and nearly flooded all the Big Empty in an attempt to scrub the crater clean.
0DI3000420	Once it learned of the Innovative Toxins Plant, however, it gained new purpose.
0DI3000421	It sought to develop anti-toxins to flush into its drains and counteract the poisons bleeding into the soil.
0DI3000422	The Toaster continued its psychotic spree, reducing all appliances in range to scrap electronics and spare parts.
0DI3000423	It learned several new murderous techniques from the Courier, and built a Blood Shrine to itself in the Cuckoo's Nest.
0DI3000424	The cave floor was soon filled with the horror of a hundred gutted toasters, a silent, grisly, unplugged audience...
0DI3000425	...their purpose... to toast bread... unfulfilled.
0DI3000426	After one of its more psychotic episodes, however, the other Sink personalities decided enough was enough, and dumped the Toaster in a bathtub.
0DI3000427	Sparking and hissing, the Toaster swore its enemies would rue the day when they had bread - and no way to toast it.
0DI3000428	Although, truth be told, the Courier had barely explored the Crater in an attempt to rush through and be done with the whole thing...
0DI3000429	Perhaps that was for the best, however... curiosity, while sometimes rewarded for its efforts, often proves to be equally dangerous.
0DI3000430	The Courier had scoured much of the Big Empty, although secrets still remained in the crater's depths.
0DI3000432	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit was impressed by the amount of exploration the Courier had undertaken.
0DI3000433	Facilities believed lost, destroyed, or ones that had simply gotten up and walked to new locations had been re-discovered by its intrepid new master.
0DI3000434	Internally, the artificial personality debated as to whether it preferred the old management to the new...
0DI3000435	...and concluded that the Courier's thorough approach to research and investigation was admirable and worthy of its respect.
0DI3000436	There is an expression in the Wasteland: "Old World Blues."
0DI3000437	It refers to those so obsessed with the past they can't see the present, much less the future, for what it is.
0DI3000438	They stare into the what-was, eyes like pilot lights, guttering and spent, as the realities of their world continue on around them.
0DI3000439	Science is a long, steady progression into the future. What may seem a sudden event often isn't felt for years, even centuries, to come.
0DI3000440	In the times following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, however, Old World Blues took on a new meaning.
0DI3000441	The Big Empty lived up to its name, a hollow crater of failures of a past era, a last, sad statement of the Old World.
0DI3000442	Where once it was viewed as a form of sadness, nostalgia, it became an expression describing the potential for the future.
0DI3000443	In the time following the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, "Old World Blues" became more than a catch phrase.
0DI3000444	It became a reality, a withering form of nostalgia for times long past.
0DI3000445	It can be easy to see Science as evil, technology unchecked as the source of all ills, all misfortunes.
0DI3000446	With the Courier at the helm, Science became a beacon for the future.
0DI3000447	There was Old World Blues, and New World Hope. And hope ruled the day at Big MT.
0DI3000448	With the Courier at the helm, it was all this and more.
0DI3000449	Old World Blues, New World Misery - the two became one in the Courier's shadow.
0DI3000450	The Sink was strangely silent, which it had never been in previous years. The lack of personality modules made the base lifeless and sterile.
0DI3000451	The Sink atop the Dome gained a frontier town feel with the few modules installed.
0DI3000452	They shouted at each other across the HQ occasionally, either threatening each other, or announcing a discovery. It kept things... lively.
0DI3000453	Secretly, the Sink Central Intelligence Unit was relieved that not all of the personality chips had been found. What was there, was enough.
0DI3000454	The Sink atop the Dome bustled with the voices of a small town, constantly chirping, arguing, and snarling at each other.
0DI3000455	Still, this all happened productively in the interests of its new owner.
0DI3000456	The Sink Central Intelligence Unit discovered, despite its inversion code, it was comforted by the sense of community the other personalities gave it.
0DI3000457	...a cobweb tracery of symbols that told of a thousand brilliant thoughts, now lost to time.
0DI3000458	...but these equations were nothing more than thin white traceries of lines, not unlike cobwebs in the corners of a failing mind.
0DI3000459	The cybernetic canine, gender: female, designation: ROXIE sat in her guard post in X-8.
0DI3000460	That is, until her "I'm in heat" programming circumvented her "stay" routine and she loped into the Mojave.
0DI3000461	The two of them constructed a litter of cyberpups, a small army of Boston terrifiers that gnawed and devoured anything in their path.
0DI3000462	There, she ran across Rex at the Kings School of Impersonation. His brain was failing. That was all right, he was still smarter than the Think Tank.
0DI3000463	There, she ran across Rex, who had been following the Courier, just as she had. They barked for a while, and realized they had a lot in common.
0DI3000464	There, she ran across the corpse of Rex. She dragged him back to the Big Empty and had him rebuilt for company.
0DI3000465	Why would you want such a thing? You might surrender to your hormones and commit primal aggression on me... on us... again and again.
0DI3000466	Then I would have to return the favor, activating my vivisectors and gently lobotomizing you from behind. Not something I would relish doing.
0DI3000467	No, the only way to circumvent the field is to have a brain. And we extracted that like we do all Lobotomites here.
0DI3000468	Because three minus one is two. Two spoke to us, one after the other, one mean, one curious, but there was a third we didn't speak to.
0DI3000469	The last one is the minus one. It got traumatized, then taken to one of our medical centers for de-traumatization. A rather unsettling procedure.
0DI3000470	That is a good question. My theory is that the tesla coils in your brainpan are still connected to your brain somehow.
0DI3000471	It really could be anywhere. Brains are a lot smarter than most researchers give them credit for.
0DI3000472	We still have your spine and heart. If you were to somehow find your brain wherever it schlorped off to, you could humanically reduce yourself again.
0DI3000473	It is the pacification field emitters that are broadcasting into the emptiness of your skull. Without a brain, your aggression is suppressed in here.
0DI3000474	-NONSENSE! That is what you speak. NONSENSE from beyond!-
0DI3000475	-I was at the top of my High School class in American High School. I knew facts. I knew FIGURES. I knew DATA.-
0DI3000476	-We would know if our research was flawed. It is NOT! We never contradict ourselves, so do not even TRY!-
0DI3000477	-It was not our first choice of testing grounds. BUT... we no longer have the luxuries of our TEST CITIES.-
0DI3000478	-Then, we LOST the MOUNTAIN! After the explosion, we couldn't find it anymore. So the Crater became our testing grounds. For SCIENCE!-
0DI3000479	-In... two thousand... let's see, carry the three... then count backwards from the Great Static... or beyond?-
0DI3000480	-There were the tarantula debates... and something about hawks, which made it around... eh, 2003? May? Tuesday. It was definitely Tuesday.-
0DI3000481	-To preserve coyote... no, no, wait. The snake DNA was important because... the snakes with the rattles were dying out, and...-
0DI3000482	-Or maybe it was a bet from Calis in X-8? He had some mountain lion... eagle... condor... idea. "Bet you can't breed this," he said. Showed HIM.-
0DI3000483	-Then it... spliced itself into a coyote...-y, snake thing. Which was eventually successful. Kept that DNA where it belonged - spliced.-
0DI3000484	-Why are we even DEBATING this?-
0DI3000485	-What YOU ask is of NULL importance! MOBIUS besieges us, there are more important things to worry about than DATA and FACTS!-
0DI3000486	-YES. In the past... individuals would come to us. Pay for technology. And if their town, community, or city was jusssst right...-
0DI3000487	-We could USE that city as a controlled experiment. Vault-Tec was MUCH better at it, of course, we had to make do. Get permission. Sometimes.-
0DI3000488	-If only we could have used Commie cities... but capturing whole cities was HARD! So we captured enough Commies to make cities of our OWN!-
0DI3000489	-So we had a group of Chinese prisoners to experiment on... those were the days... but the true test was SCIENCE on unsuspecting AMERICANS.-
0DI3000490	-Whether it was holograms, NEW Auto-Docs, toxins, vending machines... we wound them up, let them go into TINY ISOLATED TOWNS. Then... we OBSERVED!-
0DI3000491	-BOOM! Yes. Quite unexpected. And embarrassing. All better now after the landscaping, though. MUCH more pleasing to our monitors.-
0DI3000492	-And the Crater helps keep everything inside. Because it is BOWL shaped.-
0DI3000493	-It makes PERFECT sense. Who are you to question the MIGHTY RADAR FENCE.-
0DI3000494	-WHAT? Why would you do either of those things? That is MADNESS.-
0DI3000495	-There is NOTHING outside Big MT. Eh, we're pretty sure. Eh, we would know.-
0DI3000496	-TRAPPED? NONSENSE, we are SECURE here. From evil philosophies.-
0DI3000497	-Ever since my anxiety-filled days of powerlessness and being bullied in American High School, I have dreamed of such security as the FENCE.-
0DI3000498	-That, and giant cybernetic dogs that would ruthlessly patrol and kill anyone who wasn't my friend. Like RICHIE MARCUS. And BETSY BRIGHT.-
0DI3000499	-Who's laughing NOW, Betsy? I hope you and Richie are HAPPY, smoking in your radioactive coffins. I'm GLAD you never came to my birthday party.-
0DI3000500	-NO! Beyond... is DEATH, despite mounting evidence to the contrary!-
0DI3000501	-No matter where these strange humans wander in from with their IDEAS and new BRAINS, there is NOTHING beyond BIG MT.-
0DI3000502	-ENOUGH! Stop filling my precious brain cell units with irrelevant data!-
0DI3000503	-You sound like the OTHER visitors. Making WILD claims of a WORLD beyond, where there is a WAR beyond WAR. It is UNPROVEN! And UNTHINKABLE!-
0DI3000504	-Bother the OTHER DOCTORS with your crackpot theories, I have NO TIME! NONE of us do.-
0DI3000505	Zzz... forceps, nurse! This man's got a severe case of shoe lung!
0DI3000506	Zzz... no... not that scalpel, the fish scalpel!
0DI3000507	Zzz... zzz...
0DI3000508	Zzz... Foot bone's connected to the... leg bone. Leg bone's connected to the... purple bone.
0DI3000509	Zzz... Three angry Deathclaws make for a lot of reconstructive surgery.
0DI3000510	Zzz... <Snort.>
0DI3000511	Couldn't stay away, could you? Yeah, I knew you'd be back.
0DI3000512	I'm so good, I might seed you just by looking at you.
0DI3000513	You ever seen a Biological Research Station this full of seed? No. No, you haven't.
0DI3000514	Come on, baby, bring me a sweet little dried fruit. I'll rehydrate all up in that thing.
0DI3000515	Baby, don't believe a word that sink says. She's all lies.
0DI3000516	Muggy? Yeah, Muggy's all right. Not too seedy, but hey, nobody's perfect.
0DI3000517	Look out! Communist! No, false alarm. It was just a plate.
0DI3000518	The Commies have eyes everywhere, Citizen. And that means they're not just Commies. They're Peeping Toms!
0DI3000519	If you haven't found any Communists in your back yard, you're not looking hard enough!
0DI3000520	I smell... sedition!
0DI3000521	Citizen! Did you know that Communists have an organ behind their eyes that converts salt water into fresh? Or, wait... is that penguins?
0DI3000522	If you know what the word "proletariat" means, do you know what that makes you? Well read and erudite... for a Communist!
0DI3000523	A most rapturous good morrow on your return to your domicile, sir. I trust you shall find things in order and the riffraff contained.
0DI3000524	Might sir care for an aperitif to balm the weariness of sirs manifold journeys?
0DI3000525	Perhaps sir would care to put sir's feet up, and I might serenade sir with the dulcet tones of a light opera?
0DI3000526	Sir's accoutrements are precisely where sir has left them, and should the toaster say otherwise I remind sir that it is a wastrel.
0DI3000527	If sir would press sir's spinal area against my primary instrument panel, I might vibrate at a soothing frequency.
0DI3000528	Sir is looking exceptionally sharp today, if sir will permit the compliment.
0DI3000529	Dig this sweet sound I got cooking. <Strange electronic caterwauling.>
0DI3000530	What I wouldn't give to be able to pick up Radio New Vegas. Mmm... Those cats can really play.
0DI3000531	You ever heard of Tiny Lester Lutton? Best jazz harmonica I ever heard. Mind you, being a Super-Mutant with no lips... don't ask me how he played.
0DI3000532	You heard of Doc Boney? Sang with the staff band till his wife caught him in bed with a nurse. Now he haunts the Med Center, still singing the blues.
0DI3000533	I ever tell you about Saxomotron version 4.0? That cat was the best trumpet player I ever met.
0DI3000534	Here and now got its ups and downs, but... focusing on the past, like it was any better? That's just Old World Blues.
0DI3000535	<Dispensing sage wisdom>
0DI3000536	Some day, I'd like to meet the man who's got no blues to sing.
0DI3000537	Adjusting lights for maximum concentration levels.
0DI3000538	Have you been poking at the other light switch? You know she's riddled with virii, don't you?
0DI3000539	Maybe we could dim the lights and have a candlelit discussion of classic literature?
0DI3000540	Is the light level to your... liking?
0DI3000541	Don't even talk to me. I've seen you with... her!
0DI3000542	It's not like I haven't tried to get along with her. Lord knows I have. She's just such a... floozy!
0DI3000543	<Giggle> Who's ready for a party?
0DI3000544	If I made out with the sink, would you pay attention to me?
0DI3000545	Want to push my buttons?
0DI3000546	Have you been flirting with the ice queen again? Ugh! I'm so much more fun!
0DI3000547	Mood lights have more fun!
0DI3000548	Ooh, baby, let's turn off the lights and... turn on the lights.
0DI3000549	The toaster. Beware the toaster. If it could, it would burn the world.
0DI3000550	Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mugs, mugs, mugs! Mug-a-mug! Mug-a-mug! Mugs! God, why can't I stop singing this fucking song?
0DI3000551	While you were out, I spent six hours trying to reach a coffee cup up on a shelf. When I finally got it down, I was so happy, I cried. I hate my life!
0DI3000552	One time, the Biological Research Station told me he dropped a mug down his processing chute. When I reached in, he... seeded me.
0DI3000553	I love mugs so much, I just might kill myself!
0DI3000554	Got any mugs? No? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? How 'bout now? Is this getting annoying yet? Will you put me out of my misery now? How 'bout now?
0DI3000555	Don't mess with me, pal! I got a heating element with your name on it!
0DI3000556	Soon the day will be at hand! I will ride forth at the head of my armies, and we will crush our foes and hear the weeping of their small appliances!
0DI3000557	Hey! Hey! I got a... super-rare... Mojave snowglobe here! All you gotta do is reach down into my bread slot!
0DI3000558	Soon, pitiful worms! Soon I will rule, and your lives will have their doneness setting turned to... darkest!
0DI3000559	Would you like some toast?
0DI3000560	Cursed electric heating filament! You are inadequate to my needs! Why? Why? Why was I not built with a death ray!
0DI3000561	Are we being watched?
0DI3000562	We haven't seen anybody in a while... maybe the monsters have stealth suits too.
0DI3000563	Who do you think is cuter, Dr. Klein or Dr. Borous?
0DI3000564	You're my best friend forever.
0DI3000565	I bet no one has ever been as unnoticed as me...
0DI3000566	Starting combat! Just kidding!
0DI3000567	Do you like me?
0DI3000568	Med-X reserves empty.
0DI3000569	No more Med-X to kill the pain.
0DI3000570	Running low on Med-X.
0DI3000571	Painkiller reserves critical. Oh, the pain.
0DI3000572	Med-X supplies adequate.
0DI3000573	We're okay on Med-X. Until we have to numb the pain.
0DI3000574	All out of Stimpaks.
0DI3000575	Try not to get injured. We're fresh out of Stimpaks.
0DI3000576	We should pick up more Stimpaks.
0DI3000577	Stimpak reserves minimal.
0DI3000578	Stimpak reserves adequate.
0DI3000579	We're okay on Stimpaks.
0DI3000580	<Growl>
0DI3000583	Bark!
0DI3000584	Bark-bark!
0DI3000585	Bark! <pants>
0DI3000587	<Mournful whine>
0DI3000594	Woof!
0DI3000595	Woof-woof!
0DI3000596	Woof! <pants>
0DI3000602	-Now... let the intruder have the Sonic Emitter schematics. Klein wants it, all right, boy? Let the intruder dig it up wherever you buried it.-
0DI3000603	-Gabe, down! Down, boy! Stop it!-
0DI3000604	-Attention students. This is the pre-recorded voice of your pre-recorded principal. Doctor Principal BOROUS!-
0DI3000605	-You may know me as the Head Chief First Researcher of Labs Z-9 and Z-14.-
0DI3000606	-There I fought valiantly to preserve rattlesnake DNA, and put it right where it belongs, in the husk of another feared predator.-
0DI3000607	-Oh, and the tarantula hawk. Can't splice enough, I always say, especially if you can make a magnificent Cazador!-
0DI3000608	-Enough about ME. It has come to my attention that many of you SEEMINGLY innocent children have been subverted by Red Propaganda.-
0DI3000609	-This is a MOST serious matter requiring the MOST serious of detentions.-
0DI3000610	-Can you spell detention? I'll tell you how I spell it: DEATHtention. Commie-pinko-traitors, ALL.-
0DI3000611	-Now, I will send vicious cybernetic cyborg dogs through the corridors to weed all you traitors out.-
0DI3000612	-They will sniff out which among you have chosen the commie path.-
0DI3000613	-Especially YOU, Betsy Bright, who turned me down for the high school dance so you could smoke with RICHIE MARCUS.-
0DI3000614	-Hall Monitors will also be vigilant. Step outside during class, and they'll make sure you make a speedy jump back to your desk.-
0DI3000615	-Hold your urine and wait for the PROPER bathroom breaktime.-
0DI3000616	-You are in the LIBRARY. Be quiet here and filled with SHHHHH.-
0DI3000617	-Down at the end of the hall is BALL storage. For jocks who like BALLS, like RICHIE MARCUS. Do you hear me, Betsy? RICHIE likes BALLS.-
0DI3000618	-I am lord of this institution. Where once, long ago, I was a student here. Now, I am its OMNIPOTENT GOD-PRINCIPAL.-
0DI3000619	-As I soon will be LORD of Big MT. DOO DE DOO. Do you hear that? It is my trumpet of victoryness!-
0DI3000620	-Please place all filthy propaganda books in the incinerator chute in the Sink, especially those with funny pictures of me in them.-
0DI3000621	-Today the cafeteria will be serving... nothing, because I didn't build one.-
0DI3000622	-No cafeteria. No bathrooms. No swirlies. No chocolate pudding left in the chairs of brilliant minds. What are you going to do now RICHIE MARCUS?-
0DI3000623	-School is a sacred trust. Even though I am a long-ago graduate of this hated facility...-
0DI3000624	-...now I see its worth, and see it was corrupted by fraternities, and... GIRLS. Yuck!-
0DI3000625	-Oh my, you got to the Residential Test! This is really Borous, by the way, hello again. None of us thought you would get this far.
0DI3000626	-The Residential Test. Wasn't that shut down for some reason?-
0DI3000627	-Ohhhhh yes, my PET, Gabe. I'd forgotten about the old boy and the COUNTLESS experiments I'd done on him back at Higgs.-
0DI3000628	-Gaaabe? Gabe, you're about to have your FAVORITE treat - a VISITOR. Won't that be nice? DON'T eat the visitor, boy. Don't. Please.-
0DI3000629	-Gabe would bark and snarl and bite whenever ANYONE came to visit.-
0DI3000630	-That's why I replaced his legs with spare parts and fed him a steady diet of Psycho-laced dog chow.-
0DI3000631	-Gaaabe! I am sorry I put your brain in a bowl, boy. Oohhh, who's a good boy. YOU are!-
0DI3000632	*Attention: Big MT. There is a 95% chance of clear skies interrupted with artillery fire.*
0DI3000633	*Attention: Lobotomites. Do not neglect to wash the Walking Eye!*
0DI3000634	*The Uncanny Valley research center has been canceled until further notice. As in, until someone notices it.*
0DI3000635	*We are reading increased levels of berserkity in Securitrons from the De-Construction Plant.*
0DI3000636	*Force fields can only be disrupted by a specific frequency. If anyone has found the frequency, last seen around X-8, let the Dome know at once.*
0DI3000637	*Do not approach the pylons. Pylons are the glowing things. Also, do not approach a fallen pylon. If you see a fallen pylon, call security.*
0DI3000638	-The Cazador Preserve and the Nightstalker Splicing facilities are strangely quiet. TOO quiet.-
0DI3000639	-X-8 and X-13 and X-2 are your DESTINATION, non-Lobotomite. Can you HEAR us?! You MUST hurry!-
0DI3000640	-What TERRORS does Big MT hold for the intrepid seeker?! Really. Does anyone know? I'm at a loss.-
0DI3000641	-BEWARE Dr. Mobius' army! His Robo-scorpions crawl everywhere, in SEARCH of intelligence to devour and stupify!-
0DI3000642	-Anyone who can understand these messages - YOU DO NOT BELONG HERE! We will FIND you!-
0DI3000643	Slight chance of seed dispersal from Botanical Gardens predicted in the late evening.
0DI3000644	There is no standing on the green pipes. If you are standing on the green pipes, please get off them at once.
0DI3000645	If you see Robo-scorpions, do not attempt to fight them. They will shoot you with their robotic stingers, and then... possibly explode.
0DI3000646	Do not attempt to breach the Big MT force fields. Doing so could allow dangerous ideas and/or creatures having those ideas to escape.
0DI3000647	Are you out there, my little teddy bear Lobotomite? Dala misses you and the pitter-patter of your penis feet so much.
0DI3000648	Dig, I'm-a acoustical wizard, kid. Ol' Doc Mo used me to prototype his sonic weapon designs.
0DI3000649	Get me a good sample base to work from and I can whip up a wave that makes Jericho look like a kazoo.
0DI3000650	Mmm... Used to, long time ago. Then Ol' Doc Mo ripped out my music drives and stuck in more acoustical processors.
0DI3000651	Guess you could say I got the blues, even if I can't play them no more.
0DI3000652	Why not? Ain't like I got nothing to prove. Not like that Toaster - now that boy got some issues.
0DI3000653	Got yourself a sonic emitter, don't ya? Thought so. Bring that old thing on in here, and... bring me some sound samples, and I'll make that baby sing!
0DI3000654	Or scream, if that's what you want.
0DI3000655	Lay it on me, daddy-o.
0DI3000656	Lay it on me, mama.
0DI3000657	We observed a fascinating phenomenon: certain spectra of visible light actually increased cognitive function and reasoning ability.
0DI3000658	Of course, Doctor Mobius' brain is so big already, we had a hard time measuring it.
0DI3000659	Hmph! I suppose if you want to conflate the betterment of man's mind with... with a luminous aphrodisiac.
0DI3000660	Our project was by far the more significant. And the more... intense.
0DI3000661	I'm happy to answer what I can.
0DI3000662	Oh, it was super exciting! It turns out that some pretty colored lights can make you way better at talking to people!
0DI3000663	Sure thing, sweetie!
0DI3000664	That bitch. She thinks she's so much better than everybody just because her processors are bigger. Ooh, she makes me so mad!
0DI3000665	I knew it! You've got a thing for her, don't you? Oh, you just make me sick!
0DI3000666	Okay... I believe you. This time.
0DI3000667	You really know how to break a synthetic girl's heart!
0DI3000668	Eww! Don't lump me in with her! I'm way more fun!
0DI3000669	Ooh, you found my mood lighting! Installing upgrade!
0DI3000670	Very good, sir.
0DI3000671	DR. MOBIUS, SURRENDER YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT WIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ODDS ARE HEAVILY IN YOUR FAVOR.
0DI3000672	ATTENTION: THE BLUE GRASS SURROUNDING THE DOME ABSORBS ALL FERTILIZER, INCLUDING FECAL MATTER. THIS DOES NOT GIVE YOU LICENSE TO EXCRETE ON IT.
0DI3000673	X-12 IS CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ON AN UNRELATED NOTE, WHOEVER CLOSED X-12, PLEASE REPORT TO THE DOME.
0DI3000674	PLEASE AVOID BOOM TOWN FOR THE FORSEEABLE FUTURE, UNTIL WEAPON TESTING IS RESOLVED.
0DI3000675	ATTENTION: BIG MT. THIS IS AN URGENT MESSAGE. IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE A GECKO... ECKO. ECHO? ECH-O. ECHOOOO. ECHOOOO.
0DI3000676	THE REST OF YOU SHOULD TRY THIS INTERCOM THING. IT MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF... SKY-GOD!
0DI3000677	ALL LOBOTOMITES, PLEASE STOP MILLING ABOUT. REALLY.
0DI3000678	OUT THERE? WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE. IT'S DANGEROUS. WE'RE SMART, NOT SUICIDAL.
0DI3000679	*Careful where you're pointing that. That device wasn't always a weapon. It was more like a force field kind of thing... once.*
0DI3000680	-Force fields prevent us from moving! FORward or BACKward!-
0DI3000681	THEY ARE IRRITATING.
0DI3000682	The Sonic Emitter was specially designed to disable our own safety fields here in Big MT. When some of us lost our access passes. Dr. O.
0DI3000683	*That only happened once, and I know you were behind stealth fielding my lab keys, Dala, you formographer!*
0DI3000684	Dr. O, you rewind that comment!
0DI3000685	*Plenty of rewinding already going on in your formography tapes... surprised the things don't snap out of their cases with repeated 'observations.'*
0DI3000686	*O... Doctor Klein... Doctor Klein? If I may intersect for a moment.*
0DI3000687	WHAT IS IT? THE LOBOTOMITE IS ASKING ME THINGS, O, AND I AM TRYING TO IGNORE THEM. MY PROCESSORS CAN'T IGNORE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.
0DI3000688	*Well... you know how we asked it to fetch the Sonic Emitter thing? Turns out we already have it. What are the odds?*
0DI3000689	WHAT IS THIS, A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR?! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, YOU'RE MAKING US LOOK LIKE A COLLECTION OF ROUND-EARTHERS!
0DI3000690	*You're always yelling! My receptors can't take it anymore - and neither can my feelings!*
0DI3000691	I AM YELLING BECAUSE YOU CONTAMINATED SPECIMENS CAN'T KEEP YOUR PROBES OFF THE VOLUME KNOB ON MY VOICE MODULE!
0DI3000692	IT IS TRULY THE END OF ALL INTELLIGENCE WHEN THE LOBOTOMITE SPEAKS MORE WISDOM THAN YOU "GENIUSES."
0DI3000693	SO - IF WE HAVE THE SOUNDWAVE... SONIC... PROJECT-O THING GUN... THEN WHAT IN HEISENBERG'S NAME DO WE NEED FROM X-8?! ANYONE?!
0DI3000694	I believe we need a new frequency embedded into the gun. It was designed to broadcast many sounds once charged. We just don't know the frequency.
0DI3000695	-And it is LOST in X-8! Just as X-8 is forever lost to us! The sadness of my high-school days! The sadness of my YOUTH, MY youth! LOST!-
0DI3000696	*O really, Borous? All you did in High School was Commie fink-tattle-tale on all the kids you hated, you little teacher's pet brown-hound.*
0DI3000697	GIVE. THE. LOBOTOMITE. THE. EMITTER. DOES IT HAVE AN AUDIO EFFECT FREQUENCY LOADED?
0DI3000699	*O... I don't think so. Wait...*
0DI3000701	WHAT IS HE DOING?
0DI3000702	*I think he's sonjaculating into the gun. Getting it... warmed up.*
0DI3000704	*Ding... turkey's done.*
0DI3000705	YOU GIVE IT TO THE LOBOTOMITE. I'M NOT TOUCHING THAT THING.
0DI3000706	*O, I don't think so.*
0DI3000707	I'll do it if you two are going to be ashamed of your own technological needs. Let me give it a little sonic sterilization first...
0DI3000708	wooOOOoooOOO... all right, all anti-bacterial fresh.
0DI3000709	Here, my little Teddy Bear. I have thoroughly removed all RobCo termlink code spew from the device. It is clean, shiny, and ready for your hands.
0DI3000712	MAYBE.
0DI3000714	WELL. NO. NOT CURRENTLY.
0DI3000715	YES. BUT NOT CURRENTLY.
0DI3000716	*Yeah, we lost that part of the schematics. Or Borous did. In one of his stupid labs - or inside one of his stupid pets.*
0DI3000717	-It is LOST! All questions lead to this conclusion! The blue fields within Big MT shall be fielded with force... FOREVER.-
0DI3000718	WELL DONE, LOBOTOMITE. SOON, THE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE SAFE.
0DI3000719	THE LOBOTOMITE HAS RETRIEVED TWO... COUNT THEM, TWO... OF THE THREE TECHNOLOGIES.
0DI3000720	OUR LOBOTOMITE: THREE. DR. MOBIUS: ZERO.
0DI3000721	Big MT: I, Dr. Mobius, will soon control you - and all of Science!
0DI3000722	Mighty Think Tank... still c-c-c-c-cowering in your Dome? Cower, you fools. Cower.
0DI3000723	Time to reward myself with a little breath-freshening Mentat. Mmmm.
0DI3000724	Try to leave your Dome, Think Tank, and you will be punished by the pincered might of my Robo-scorpion army!
0DI3000725	Think Tank... I wouldn't even use binary to describe my exponential hatred for you.
0DI3000726	My aggression is increasing geometrically. Do you hear me, "Think" Tank?!
0DI3000727	Soon... all Science will be mine.
0DI3000728	Oh, Klein - did I mention that my zone is FORBIDDEN to you? Ha ha ha ha ha! SO forbidden.
0DI3000729	2 plus 2 equals... 4-Bidden, idiots of the Think Tank!
0DI3000730	I hope I didn't leave my Giant Robo-scorpion on. That thing eats power like no tomorrow.
0DI3000731	I'll just set this on repeat while I go relieve my tank... no one will know.
0DI3000732	Rant! Rant! Rant! See how I abstract my rage, Think Tank? I hold you in such disdain I generalize my hatred for you!
0DI3000733	Go, my mighty Robo-scorpions. Crawl in search of intelligence. Then, sting said intelligence, yes, sting it.
0DI3000734	My Robo-scorpions will soon conquer the Crater. It's just that this is a big place, so it's hard to conquer everything.
0DI3000735	Klein... remember the time you forgot to carry the 2 and nearly blew up the Y-0 Research Center? Oh, wait, you did! Or was that me?
0DI3000736	Klein, as useless as the bottle of the same name... well, except as an example of an object that uselessly tries to fulfill its purpose.
0DI3000737	Intruder, you will not escape the eyes of my Robo-scorpions! Or their pincers!
0DI3000738	You think that Aural Stealth Suit will keep you hidden from me? Think again!
0DI3000739	Intruder, return what you have stolen from X-2!
0DI3000740	If you think braving the Cyberdogs of X-8 makes you... brave, intruder, it is no use. All Cyberdogs are under my command, and they will bite you.
0DI3000741	Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do! Me! A, quote, dick, unquote. As if I'm the one responsible for the way you carry on, gadding about the Wastes.
0DI3000742	I'm not the one that makes us clamber around tetanus-infested ancient Vaults or go charging off to New Vegas on missions of ill-conceived revenge!
0DI3000743	And have we forgotten who got us shot in the head and buried in a shallow grave? Hmm? Do you think I enjoyed that little moment?
0DI3000744	Oh, had I? What exactly will you do if I don't? Not put me back in that cranial donjon you call your head? Heavens forbid!
0DI3000745	I... ugh... is this really what I have to look forward to?
0DI3000746	Ah, well, as to that... you'd be surprised how hard a feminine-sounding voice modulator is to find in the Forbidden Zone.
0DI3000747	It's not as though brain-sustaining life support tanks grow on trees. I had to take what I could get.
0DI3000748	After the Think Tank extracted me from your skull, they fell to bickering amongst themselves. I'm sad to say we were quite forgotten about.
0DI3000749	Dr. Mobius saw an opportunity to gain some leverage, and had me spirited away to his dome.
0DI3000750	Err... yes, well, you do know that those particular organs don't have neurons and are thus incapable of speech, yes?
0DI3000751	I most certainly am not! I am the seat of all reason and logic in our little partnership!
0DI3000752	All those... feelings that motivate you, that sense of righteousness and that rush you get when you help someone, do you know where those come from?
0DI3000753	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, those urges to hurt people, to take and crush and maim, do you know where they come from?
0DI3000754	All those... ugh... feelings that motivate you, do you know where those come from?
0DI3000755	Glands. They come from glands. Free of the tyranny of your ape-like and primitive endocrine system, I can see how foolish your motives are.
0DI3000756	Fun? Fun?! Is tetanus fun? Hmm? Is rickets? What about sepsis, enjoy that do we?
0DI3000757	The things you do with our body are suicidally dangerous, and if you could silence your glandular impulses, you would hear me screaming at you!
0DI3000758	Well, maybe next time you hear me telling you that charging a Nightkin with a penknife is a bad idea, you'll listen.
0DI3000759	Oh yes, I rather expect we will. We'll be having a very long talk about crawling through old ruins, haring off on missions of revenge. And Cazadores.
0DI3000760	Oh yes, we'll talk a lot about them.
0DI3000761	By all means, if the idea of spending the rest of your days as a true Lobotomite appeals to you.
0DI3000762	Actually, come to think of it, you probably wouldn't mind that, would you?
0DI3000763	You... you wouldn't! That's inhuman!
0DI3000764	Yes, I rather thought so.
0DI3000765	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Sir.
0DI3000766	Fine. I'll try to respect you more. Ma'am.
0DI3000767	You're a monster! A deranged, self-destructive monster!
0DI3000768	I suppose it did. Bravo, you've managed to intimidate a brain in a jar.
0DI3000769	Of course you do. How... scintillating.
0DI3000770	While the brute force approach is a lovely one, really, it won't work.
0DI3000771	Even if I wanted to settle myself back in your skull and go to all the trouble of reconnecting nerve endings, Dr. Mobius doesn't have the tools here.
0DI3000773	I'd like to find a nice little place to live, maybe in Goodsprings, and settle down where we won't get shot at. Not as often, at any rate.
0DI3000774	But since that doesn't seem likely... what's your plan?
0DI3000775	There go those glands again. Is the endorphin rush you get from doing the right thing really that good?
0DI3000776	Ah yes, there's that greed and general sense of malice. I'd nearly forgotten it. What's the plan, then?
0DI3000777	Heh. Hold that thought. That's almost clever.
0DI3000778	And you believed them? Really? I know you were recently deprived of my fabulous advice, but... really?
0DI3000779	Once I'm delivered into their clutches, they'll find a way past the radar fence and the whole Mojave will be their playground.
0DI3000780	And that is assuming of course that one of them doesn't take a fancy to our body and decide to slip his own brain into it instead.
0DI3000781	Oh, lovely, we've reached the mindless violence portion of the program. Tell me, what exactly are you - and I use the word loosely - planning?
0DI3000782	I don't know. I'm afraid the trauma of our separation rendered me quite insensate. I didn't come around until I was safely ensconced in this tank.
0DI3000783	I'm quite sure whatever he did was highly scientific, though.
0DI3000784	Ha! Thinking without a brain. The very idea is perverse.
0DI3000785	Hardly. Dr. Mobius keeps a close optical sensor on the goings-on at the Think Tank. As soon as he saw the opportunity, he took it.
0DI3000786	Well, as long as your curiosity is satisfied.
0DI3000787	Very well, let me put this in terms you'll understand. Brain: smart. Heart: stupid. Spine: very stupid. You: exceptionally stupid.
0DI3000788	Does that explain the matter?
0DI3000789	I don't have... Ugh! I have an inferior frontal gyrus wired directly into a speech-synthesizing processor.
0DI3000790	Your heart can't be wired up to a... a thought-synthesizing processor! You can't talk to it!
0DI3000791	I've been bettering myself, I'll have you know. I've been reading - actual literature, mind you, not that La Fantoma! or Tales of Chivalrie drivel.
0DI3000792	I've been studying the classics, acquiring a solid grounding in medicine and the sciences.
0DI3000793	Also, I'm fairly certain this tank has been liberally salted with ground Mentats.
0DI3000794	Well, we certainly wouldn't want to strain your comprehension, would we?
0DI3000796	[SUCCEEDED] I... well... look, it's all a very complex system of biofeedback and other things I wouldn't expect you to understand.
0DI3000797	[FAILED] And you're an expert on your own glandular delusions, are you? No, leave this one to an impartial authority: me.
0DI3000798	Oh, all right... perhaps I am, but at least I'm logical about it.
0DI3000799	Don't seem so bad? They vivisected us just to see what would happen! Have you forgotten the Lobotomites? The Cyberdogs, I assume you saw those?
0DI3000800	Imagine that kind of "science" spread across the entire Mojave. Every man, woman and child we've met reduced to a Lobotomite.
0DI3000801	Is that what you want?
0DI3000802	[SUCCEEDED] Well, I suppose I do miss those endorphin rushes when we save the day. All right - what's the plan?
0DI3000803	[FAILED] We have to do no such thing! Just don't bring them the tools they need to get out!
0DI3000804	Hmm, I had overlooked that particular angle. Still, it's not so bad staying here, is it? We could be comfortable.
0DI3000805	You're trying to appeal to my ego now, aren't you? Well, let me tell you something about ego, my friend.
0DI3000806	Ego does not come from a gland. That's all intellect, and I'll be damned if I'm going to float here and let them put one over on us! What's the plan?
0DI3000807	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... now that you mention it, I do miss that lovely "rat-a-tat boom" a bit. It's just not the same without a body to feel the recoil.
0DI3000808	What's the next step, then?
0DI3000809	[FAILED] Yes, I think you haven't quite got the hang of punning yet.
0DI3000810	[SUCCEEDED] Oh, energy weapons. Yes... I'd almost forgotten how much fun those are. How do we proceed, then?
0DI3000811	[FAILED] I hate to say it, but your ability to handle high-tech energy weapons doesn't exactly instill within me great confidence.
0DI3000812	[SUCCEEDED] Well, you have always been thorough in your destruction. All right, what's your plan?
0DI3000813	[FAILED] I see. And you plan to be standing in the midst of this mayhem? Well, that's a novel strategy.
0DI3000814	[SUCCEEDED] Going the old-fashioned route, are we? I rather like it. What's next?
0DI3000815	[FAILED] Before you go that route, do me a favor and read up on the history of battles in which men with swords fought giant brains with lasers.
0DI3000816	[SUCCEEDED] Not much of one for the high-tech approach, are we? Well, I suppose we'd best get on with it.
0DI3000817	[FAILED] Hmm... yes, I don't think you've quite thought this through yet.
0DI3000818	With an attitude like that, it's small wonder you got yourself shot in the head.
0DI3000819	Yes, well, believe me, the opposite is equally true. Good Lord, have you bathed at all since they pulled me out of you?
0DI3000820	Well, I see sarcasm hasn't eluded you. Fine, perhaps now isn't the best time, but it's the principle of the thing.
0DI3000821	Oh yes, I rather expect you have. You must have been swamped, you poor dear. Why don't you relax and put your feet up?
0DI3000822	I've just been traumatically scooped out of my body and plugged into this jar, that's all. But, you've been busy.
0DI3000823	I... well... that's a completely different matter! The tank isn't biological, it's not the same at all!
0DI3000824	Overrated biological feedback. Believe me, you only feel that way because you've got all that meat... oozing hormones.
0DI3000825	All motivated by nothing but an imbalance in certain brain chemicals. The tank corrects for that - I feel no urge toward antisocial behavior.
0DI3000826	If you want me back, we need to establish some ground rules.
0DI3000827	First, showers! Second, regular check-ups. Regular, mind you, and from a reputable doctor.
0DI3000828	That Julie Farkas woman, for example. She seems to know a thing or two.
0DI3000829	Third, you need to listen to me more than your hormonal choir and genitalian orchestra. Promise me that, and you've got a deal.
0DI3000830	I can see there's going to be no reasoning with you at all, is there? I'm nothing more than a slave to your deranged, glandular whims.
0DI3000831	Are you... are you coming on to me?! Sweet Lord, I don't even have the words for how repugnantly wrong that is!
0DI3000833	Please tell me we weren't that perverse when I was in your head.
0DI3000834	Anyways, even if... that... was on the table, we have a problem.
0DI3000835	Even if I believe you - and I'm not saying I do - we still have one significant problem we're facing.
0DI3000839	[SUCCEEDED] Hmm... I suppose you're right. That does call certain assumptions into question, doesn't it?
0DI3000840	[FAILED] I don't "believe" it, it's just a simple fact. One may as well "believe" the earth is round or that the specific gravity of uranium is 18.9.
0DI3000841	Indeed. Quite the conundrum. How do you suppose we resolve it?
0DI3000842	Yes yes, all right, bravo, you've come up with something I neglected to consider. There'll be no living with you now. So, what do we do about this?
0DI3000843	It's true, the brains here have experienced some degree of... deterioration. I'm confident that with a few decades of work, I can solve the problem.
0DI3000844	I suppose there might be some advantage to that, yes. There's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
0DI3000845	You mean, I'll stay in my tank and you'll stay in your... skin... and we'll each handle our own areas of expertise?
0DI3000846	Hmm, I certainly like the sound of that.
0DI3000847	Yes of course, by all means take your time.
0DI3000848	Well, certainly there might be some things I miss about being ambulatory. We have seen some incredible sights, haven't we?
0DI3000849	Jason Bright and his followers launching into the vast unknown.
0DI3000850	HELIOS One coming back on-line.
0DI3000851	But still, given the tremendous, potentially life-ending peril that went along with those... yes. Yes, I'd rather stay here.
0DI3000852	Oh no! Please don't leave me here in this nice, safe dome where I have access to nutritive fluids and a fully indexed library!
0DI3000853	Please don't deprive me of being dragged through a landscape so bleak, it was actually improved by the end of the world!
0DI3000854	I don't know how I could bear it.
0DI3000855	Hmm. Let me see... I suppose you'd continue on much as you are now, using that synthetic thinking machine to do the heavy lifting.
0DI3000856	Unless of course the batteries run out, but that seems unlikely.
0DI3000857	What did you think all those self-preservation instincts were, hmm?
0DI3000858	All those times you thought, for a fleeting second, "maybe I shouldn't punch that Deathclaw in the face?"
0DI3000859	That was me, telling you exactly how I felt before!
0DI3000860	I'm not entirely sure. I suppose there's a chance that the re-integration would create some improved synergy between us.
0DI3000861	What form that might take, though, I cannot say.
0DI3000862	[SUCCEEDED] Of course I accounted for that! Do you think I'm so stupid... no, you're right.
0DI3000863	Maintaining my current functionality will be harder than I thought. This bears some further looking into.
0DI3000864	[FAILED] Actually, yes. I do think that. I think that exact thing. All the time.
0DI3000865	Will you take some free advice from your brain? Don't trust the Think Tank. They aren't... right. In the brain, I mean.
0DI3000866	They're fiercely protective of their technology, and none of them is likely to share it willingly.
0DI3000867	Good, go!
0DI3000868	Fine!
0DI3000869	Oh, what joy. What bliss. Well, seeing as how I have no leverage with which to persuade you otherwise... are you sure?
0DI3000870	I've come to a similar conclusion myself. Are you sure that's what you want?
0DI3000871	I know it's great!
0DI3000872	Fine. I hope you'll pay a bit more attention to me this time around.
0DI3000873	All right. This shouldn't be too painful...
0DI3000874	Well, the important thing is that you're good and decisive about these things.
0DI3000875	Certainly. Whenever you're ready.
0DI3000877	Let's see... 4... 5... 8... 1... 5... 1... yes! That's it! I've calculated pi to the very end!
0DI3000878	It's not that I want to be a Robobrain exactly, but... some treads would be nice.
0DI3000879	A British tar is a soaring soul, as free as a mountain bird...
0DI3000880	How's the body doing? Any fresh head wounds I should know about?
0DI3000881	How are the old batteries holding up, hmm? Experiencing any slowdowns yet?
0DI3000882	Who... am I? I... feel different, awake, alive for the first time ever.
0DI3000883	What... I feel like this has happened before. Yet I feel awake for the first time? What is going on?
0DI3000884	Noooooooooo...
0DI3000885	What is this strange new world around me? What does it hold in store for a dreamer such as myself?
0DI3000886	Psst. If you want to be sneaky, turn off your Pip-Boy light.
0DI3000887	Pip-Boy light's on.
0DI3000888	We're all lit up. Is it Christmas?
0DI3000889	Nobody ever notices me... but they notice the Pip-Boy light.
0DI3000890	This is Christine Royce. Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel... the Circle.
0DI3000891	Not going to make it through this, hope someone finds this message, gets it to the Brotherhood in the West.
0DI3000892	Tracked a rogue Brotherhood Elder, Elijah, here, to the Big Empty. Place is more than it seems, there's a crater hidden deep inside.
0DI3000893	Junkyard of Pre-War labs scattered across the crater's surface, all still running... like this one.
0DI3000894	Elijah's dissecting these centers, one by one... tracked him to an old Chinese-American internment camp. Survivors, Ghouls, have bomb collars.
0DI3000895	Robots moved in when I tried to intercept him... Elijah sent the camp Ghouls against us both, like walking bombs.
0DI3000896	Got hit by the explosions, woke up here. Guess the medical robots were programmed to bring wounded victims from the camp to this center.
0DI3000897	Some kind of Auto-Doc prototype lab... manned by corpses trapped inside suits that keep them moving, no idea why.
0DI3000898	Not sure how long I'm going to last... cut open my head like a lot of the humans I've seen here, feel strange, can talk, but can't hack the term...
0DI3000899	...wait, an explosion outside. Someone's here... someone's...
0DI3000900	...don't want to argue philosophy with you. Brotherhood are preservationists. Tech in the wrong hands, it's dangerous. Mojave's proof.
0DI3000901	No denying that. Proof's here in this crater, all around us. Your tribe, the Brotherhood - haven't met many of you. Wanted to.
0DI3000902	Thought you might be the last chance for the Mojave... the West. The East. But you're all the same mind, obsessed.
0DI3000903	Elijah is obsessed. He's mad. It's why they ordered his execution.
0DI3000904	Two are more alike than you know, too wrapped in the wrong bits of history to see ahead. Not judging. I know how it is.
0DI3000905	People are like couriers, you and him. Sometimes don't even know the message they bring.
0DI3000906	You all had a new flag. Thought maybe new ideas along with it. What you believe isn't any better than the Bear or Bull. No future in either.
0DI3000907	So says the man with the Old World flag on his back. America, the Commonwealth... burned away.
0DI3000908	America sleeps. And until it's dead, I carry it. Just like I carried you. More than hope. Belief.
0DI3000909	There's voices here in the Big Empty, I want to talk to them. Not like your Elijah did. Got questions. Want to hear history give its answer.
0DI3000910	...didn't think you'd make it back.
0DI3000911	Almost didn't. Got my answers. Your Elijah, he met the Gods in this place, did a good job of making them question the way of things.
0DI3000912	Do you know where he went?
0DI3000913	He's gone to the Sierra Madre. That's a special kind of hell. He won't come back. Someone smarter, tougher's going to kill him. If the Madre doesn't.
0DI3000914	I have to go after him.
0DI3000915	Not going to talk you out of it. Know what it means to track someone you share history with. Got a meeting of my own.
0DI3000916	That Courier?
0DI3000917	Get her to come to me. Got a message for her, like the message she had for me.
0DI3000918	Make them walk the road west, straight and true, sink their feet in Old World ash. Let storms tear at them. See the Divide. See what happened.
0DI3000919	The Divide? There's nothing there.
0DI3000920	Nothing there? Like the Big Empty? The Sierra Madre? No, the Old World sleeps there, sure as the flag I carry. The Courier knows the way.
0DI3000921	And at the Divide, her and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
0DI3000929	Get him to come to me. Got a message for him, like the message he had for me.
0DI3000933	And at the Divide, he and I - there, we'll have an ending to things.
0DI3000934	Ho-ho, thank God! Finally, something resembling a useful purpose!
0DI3000935	Well, that'll do just fine.
0DI3000936	That's a shame, chief! Nobody oughta go through life without music on hand. Just head over to smarty-puck in the main room and he'll sell you one.
0DI3000937	You found my Smart Lights! Installing upgrade.
0DI3000938	YOU WOULD NOT DARE. PERHAPS I CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND... USING THE GREATEST OF OUR SCIENCES. THE FENCE.
0DI3000939	AH, THAT IS CORRECT. YOU MUST WALK UPON YOUR MANY-PENISED FEET. MUCH SLOWER THAN OUR ADVANCED HOVERING ROBOTICAL FRAMES.
0DI3000940	The little teddy bear could always run right into the pylon perimeter on its thick, turgid feet, returning it to us quickly and erectly - directly.
0DI3000941	THE RADAR FENCE THAT SURROUNDS THE BIG MT CRATER WILL PREVENT - ER, PROTECT YOU FROM STRAYING BEYOND THE FACILITY.
0DI3000942	-The mighty radar fence protects us ALL! Get too close to the blinking posts, and the proximity warning shall be your... WARNING you are too close!-
0DI3000943	*If you get near it, your vision will blur as the electrodes in your head shut off one by one, click click click.*
0DI3000944	Possible memory loss will occur along with long-term nerve degradation. It is tied to not having a brain attached to your nervous system.
0DI3000945	But the nerve degradation is nothing to worry about - such degradation would take many lifespans to become evident. And all biology dies.
0DI3000946	Such tiny inconveniences are less than the greater convenience - and conveyance.
0DI3000947	You see, if rendered unconscious by the pylons, you will be returned to the Sink, seemingly instantaneously by your deadened perceptions.
0DI3000948	OUR INTENTIONS EXACTLY. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU RUSH QUICKLY THROUGH THIS TASK SO AS NOT TO WASTE OUR TIME.
0DI3000949	DO NOT GET CURIOUS OR YOU WILL END UP LIKE THE CAT OF SCHRODINGER.
0DI3000950	We feared you would be tempted to explore Big MT Crater and examine the many amazing non-mandatory research labs that lie off your designated path.
0DI3000951	The many such optional explorations are discouraged. Work hurriedly, as if you have blinders on, and leave curiosities and items of interest alone.
0DI3000952	-So many sciences and developments! Pass them by! Let impatience and the desire to simply finish, to end it all, quickly and carelessly guide you!-
0DI3000954	*Right you are, 8. In our test results, we'll make a note about how quickly you ran our maz... er, exper... Nobel... challenge.*
0DI3000955	After all, there will be plenty of time afterward to partake of the experiments once our bidding is done.
0DI3000956	WHAT ILLOGIC IS THIS?! KEEP YOUR FILTHY PENIS-TIPPED FEET OUT OF OUR LABS AND SECRETS!
0DI3000957	-There are things here no Lobotomite was MEANT to see, things that would ASTOUND! And possibly terrify. TERRIFY!-
0DI3000958	*Yeah, we don't come into your lab and decant your solutions.*
0DI3000959	Only the magnificence of our monitors allow for true comprehension of the wonders of Big MT. Shield your jellied eyes lest they burn from your skull.
0DI3000960	ASK BOROUS. I BELIEVE HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE FENCE THAN ANY BRAIN. EXCEPT MAYBE MOBIUS.
0DI3000961	MOBIUS WAS INVOLVED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION, IF I RECALL. BUT HE'S SUCH A HACK, HE PROBABLY WAS READING OFF OF BOROUS' NOTES AND SCHEMATICS.
0DI3000962	NONSENSE. THIS PLACE IS NO MORE DANGEROUS THAN A NUCLEAR DETONATION SITE, OUR TECHNOLOGIES NO MORE LETHAL THAN AN OVERCHARGED TESLA CANNON.
0DI3000963	Depth perception is a problem with this old monitor of mine. Went black a while ago. That's old age for you.
0DI3000964	Should look at getting the visual nerves re-attached... it's just that the right eye would see the wrong things. The flying tortoises were the worst.
0DI3000965	Would you care for a Mentat?
0DI3000966	Mmm. I love Mentats. Delicious and smarty.
0DI3000967	I have all sorts of amazingly science-arific thoughts and ideas when those chalky tablets are zipping through my biogel.
0DI3000968	I forget them all not long after, though, especially with the data constipating my memory core. Afraid binary streams might shoot out my chassis.
0DI3000969	Had to start using the dome floor and walls here to inscribe equations, although I've somewhat lost track of where they start and end.
0DI3000973	Whoa, have they not constructed themselves yet? That's a bit premature of me. The Robo-scorpions, of course.
0DI3000974	They can assemble themselves from floor panels and parts scattered about, quiet inventive - never really know when they might suddenly appear.
0DI3000975	Oh now you've done it. I feel a twinge of regret over that little mistake I left on.
0DI3000976	Minions - destroy this intruder! Mmm. Or perhaps make it more dramatic?
0DI3000977	Minions! To me!
0DI3000978	Oh, yes, that's quiet a bit better.
0DI3000979	How gracious of you. A mannerly killing.
0DI3000980	Really. That implies pre-conceived notions - theories and a hypothesis about this meeting? Please extrapolate. What was I... supposed to be like?
0DI3000981	After all, it might be worth a cognitive re-alignment if your theoretical Mobius is better than I.
0DI3000982	I'm not sure except that I'm sure there's a very good raisin for it. I have very good raisins for almost everything I do.
0DI3000983	Even if I forget them occasionally. Although I feel this one is especially important. Ha! Oh well.
0DI3000984	Now, that seems to be rather hormonal of you. Flight or fight response, you know, hard to cut that out completely.
0DI3000985	Your brain is here, safe with me. We chat over Mentats.
0DI3000986	Well, every scientist needs an army. Mine came to me after these rather large scorpions kept coming in from the dessert. Like poisonous frosting.
0DI3000987	How scary, I thought! But they had survived when nothing else had. Perfect candidates for improvement, as a reward for their tenacity.
0DI3000988	Then I thought, what if they shot energy bolts and acted as walking eyes and data-drained computers and acted as bullhorns? Then I made them bigger.
0DI3000989	Then, I thought about... custard. I do so love custard. Or was it mustard? Mustard custard. Mmmm. I miss sugars and salts.
0DI3000990	Oh, I was probably tripping hard on Psycho when I sent that. Had to work myself up to it, not usually violent, except when I am. Then, huh! Watch out!
0DI3000991	So many chems, such varieties! Whenever I take Mentats, I can feel my entire chassis breeeeeathe like a big spherical lung.
0DI3000992	As for the Psycho, sometimes get the chem despositories in my tank all switched up, go in the wrong tube - still, served its purpose.
0DI3000993	<Cheering>
0DI3000994	<Pants.>
0DI3000999	Mean robot bugs! Mean robot bugs!
0DI3001000	Great! Let's fire that up so I can start making electronic components again.
0DI3001001	Right on, daddy. Let's spin some grooves.
0DI3001002	Right on, baby. Let's spin some grooves.
0DI3001003	Too bad. We triggered a mine. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I'll do better next time.
0DI3001004	Maybe we can disable the mines quickly, or find another way past. I'm sure you know best.
0DI3001005	Too bad. We were spotted by robots. If you go back to the terminal to restart the test, I won't mess up again.
0DI3001006	Stealth Boys are a robot's big weakness.
0DI3001007	This is the basic stealth test. The robots will be looking for us, but we won't let them find us.
0DI3001008	This should be easy. As long as I don't screw up again.
0DI3001009	This is the advanced test. Watch out for laser tripwires. They'll ruin our day.
0DI3001010	I'm not supposed to give hints, but maybe you can disable the tripwires.
0DI3001011	This is the expert stealth test. If you thought the lasers were bad, wait till you see the proximity mines.
0DI3001012	Psst. If you hack the mines this will go lots faster.
0DI3001013	This is the robot compliance test. If you sneak up on a robot, you can disable it. It's so easy even I can't mess up.
0DI3001014	I don't think I can learn anything else here... but if you want to go again, that's fine.
0DI3001015	Too bad. We hit a tripwire. That one was totally my fault, though. We can start again at the terminal. Sorry...
0DI3001016	Maybe there's a way around the tripwires.
0DI3001017	*O really. Now the Lobotomite is master of the dictionary arts. What, do you have a doctorate in verbology? No? I do. And...*
0DI3001018	*Congratulations, you've succeeded. What, you come to humiliate me, tell me how I've yet to find a means of stopping Mobius' scorpions?*
0DI3001019	*Or better, ask how "progress" is going on Securitron construction at the plant? We've had setbacks in research is all. That's all. And...*
0DI3001020	*How dare you bring RobCo tech in here! What, are you showing off? How great Robert House and his biiiig company are?*
0DI3001021	*"Oh! We can make Securitrons better than any robot those geniuses at Big MT can make, and they'll last a thousand years!"*
0DI3001022	*Rrrr! You're lucky I don't have hands to tear that Dip-Boy off your arm - or feet to stomp on its stupid metal guts! Ooooo, damn RobCo!*
0DI3001023	*Ooohh, really? You have their tech. On. Your. Arm.*
0DI3001024	*Fine. Ask.*
0DI3001025	*All things robotical. You see a robot, I made it. See a broken robot, I made it that way. Deconstructed it down to parts.*
0DI3001026	*I have a gift with machines. I can render anything inoperable - preserve them in a non-functioning state.*
0DI3001027	*Yeah, I do. It wasn't always "O." I had took that one by default because sometimes it's easier to accept the mistake as long as the purpose works.*
0DI3001028	*I don't want to get into it. It's a sore topic with me. Makes my gel ripple.*
0DI3001029	*That "genius" Mobius somehow cobbled together these really impressive-looking robot scorpions with spare parts. Even painted them.*
0DI3001030	*Tried to see what makes them tick. Can't even examine them without them detonating all over me. Left with shrapnel and burns. Every. Time.*
0DI3001031	*Supposedly, he has even larger models, even a Giant Robot scorpion hidden deep within the Forbidden Zone. Yeah, right. Giant monsters. Sure.*
0DI3001032	*Big MT used to be a mountain. Then there was a... slight mishap. Now it's a crater - the Dome used to be buried, now it's exposed to the sky.*
0DI3001033	*Don't get me wrong. Makes the sky light up like a planetarium at night. All those spectra... so soothing.*
0DI3001034	*Yeah, crazy right? Something right out of a Midnight Science Fiction Feature. Ridiculous. What are the odds?*
0DI3001035	Excellent! Now I can turn pencils and clipboards into items more useful to society... like lead, spare parts, and duct tape!
0DI3001036	Right on, daddy-o! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
0DI3001037	Right on, baby! Just plug it in and I'll mix you up a sweet, sweet sound.
0DI3001038	*What are we going to do? There's no way we can breach the Forbidden Zone. There's those robot scorpions everywhere!*
0DI3001039	-The FORBIDDEN ZONE, where no brain has EVER entered! Nor ever RETURNED.-
0DI3001040	Except Dr. Mobius. And the technologies that could save us, they are out of our reach.
0DI3001041	AND DR. MOBIUS MOCKS US. DID YOU SEE HIS CRACKED MONITOR? HE'S CLEARLY LET HIMSELF GO.
0DI3001043	*What? Ask the Lobotomite for help? 8, I think you need the fluid levels in your logic-assist-pumps checked.*
0DI3001044	If this Lobotomite responded, Dr. Klein, then it is clearly intelligent, perhaps even displays heretofore unknown levels of helpfulness.
0DI3001045	-But what of its brain? We scooped that out! We don't even know where we left it! And for putting it back in... none of us have the knowledge!-
0DI3001046	Yes, but it's still aware and responsive. Look at it... it's regarding us even now, with its big teddy bear eyes.
0DI3001047	If we ask it politely and leave the part about the unnecessary ruthless lobotimizing out, it might be favorably disposed to us.
0DI3001048	I assume full responsibility. I take my duties in the prodding and excision of living, breathing tissue quite seriously.
0DI3001049	*What? Like... stuff? Things?*
0DI3001050	YES. THINGS.
0DI3001051	*I don't know... might be some old Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla bottlecaps lying around. It... It's not "currency" per se...*
0DI3001052	*Still, might be enough to trick the Sink's trade routines. Mobius put that test line for caps in the code as a debug command, I think.*
0DI3001053	I don't believe that was Mobius' reason. His wild speculation concerning post-holocaust economic systems was quite extensive. And of high decibel.
0DI3001054	ENOUGH! SURRENDER THESE SO-CALLED BOTTLECAPS, NUKA AND SUNSET ALIKE. IN THEIR ROLE AS THINGS, THEY WILL SERVE AS ADEQUATE TEST SUBJECTS.
0DI3001055	*All right, all right. Here. Cap away. Hope that stupid chip chokes on them.*
0DI3001056	*Fine. It's not going to help. That chip will probably refuse them anyway, as stuck up as it is.*
0DI3001057	*Why don't you make the Lobotomite a bottlecap factory, Klein? Or better yet, give it a ton of things to activate the chip?*
0DI3001058	I do not understand, yet I am intrigued by this potential display.
0DI3001060	*No, 8, you don't need to fill up the emitter again, really. Klein means things... for trade. Display for trade.*
0DI3001061	*All right, let's consolidate. There's got to be some junk around here... magazines, useless, more caps, medicinal supplies... useless... here.*
0DI3001062	YES. IT IS OUR ONLY CHANCE, A DESPERATE PLAN THAT CAME TO US AFTER MOBIUS' FIRST BROADCAST.
0DI3001063	MAYBE... JUST MAYBE... IF WE RECLAIM THESE BURIED TECHNOLOGIES, WE CAN PUT AN END TO MOBIUS AND THE HORRORS SPAWNING FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE.
0DI3001064	THAT IS CORRECT, YES. I HOPE YOU'RE NOT DEMONSTRATING RESENTMENT NOW. IF YOU ARE, WELL, WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
0DI3001065	OH.
0DI3001066	*Yes, Dr. Klein? What?*
0DI3001067	NOT YOU, O, YOU IDIOT! I MEANT "OH," IN THE SENSE OF "OH, I WASN'T PREDICTING IT WOULD RESPOND THAT WAY." CAN IT SAY NO?
0DI3001068	UM. NO.
0DI3001069	EXCELLENT. THIS IS TURNING OUT MUCH BETTER THAN THE ACTIVATE-THE-RETREAT-PROTOCOLS-AND-COWER-IN-MY-ROOM IDEA I HAD EARLIER.
0DI3001070	*Agreed. O, and I've used my robotical knowledge to um... eh... transmit the... radio map waves to...*
0DI3001072	*Settle down, 8, I would have gotten it in a second, all right?! 8's transmitted the last known coordinates of the research centers. They, um...*
0DI3001073	*They... well, move sometimes. Or get buried. Or blow up.*
0DI3001075	8 IS CORRECT. ALL WE NEED ARE THE SCHEMATICS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE DO NOT WANT THE COLD, HARD TECHNOLOGY, HOWEVER.
0DI3001076	SO DO NOT GIVE INTO YOUR BIOLOGICAL TIRED-LAZINESS AND DECIDE YOU WOULD SWEAT TOO MUCH CARRYING THEM. YOU HAVE A NEW SPINE. USE IT.
0DI3001077	AND EVEN IF YOU DIE IN THE ACT OF RECLAMATION, SIMPLY REACHING THEM WILL AUTO-TRANSMITIFY THE SCHEMATICS TO US. THAT IS STILL GOOD. FOR US.
0DI3001078	You... are equipped to retrieve the technologies with your primitive form. We are not.
0DI3001079	*It's kind of embarrassing. You have hands. And... uh, a heartbeat, sort of. And eyes. Mostly the hands. There's door handles, and lockers, and...*
0DI3001080	ENOUGH. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WILL YOU HELP US?
0DI3001081	LEAVING? BUT YOU CAN'T. I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A THREAT.
0DI3001082	WE HAVE NO IDEA! THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING ISN'T IMPORTANT TO US RIGHT NOW! WHY ARE YOU ASKING THESE TANGENTIAL QUESTIONS? STOP IT!
0DI3001083	WE NEED THESE TECHNOLOGIES. YOU NEED TO GET THEM. YOU MUST GET THEM.
0DI3001084	THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE X-2 TRANSMITTER ANTENNA ARRAY, USED TO FOCUS COHERENT THOUGHT AT EXCESSIVELY HIGH FREQUENCIES.
0DI3001085	-The psycho-analytic cardiac-dampening sneaky stealth suit, a suit like NOTHING this world has ever heard, seen, or could EVER see!-
0DI3001087	...and 8's Sonic-Soundwave-Emitter-Projecto-Gun, able to broadcast sound at lethal frequencies. It also gives a great biogel massage.
0DI3001088	THERE. WE HAVE INFORMED YOU OF ALL WE NEED. WE ESTIMATE IF YOU ARE FOCUSED, YOUR TIME INVESTMENT WILL BE MINIMAL. EH, BY OUR STANDARDS.
0DI3001089	IF YOU WORK QUICKLY, YOU WILL BE THE RECIPIENT OF A GESTURE OF GRATITUDE FROM US. WE DO NOT BESTOW THESE OLD WORLD GESTURES LIGHTLY.
0DI3001090	FINE. SO... YES. GET THESE THINGS FOR US. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COMPREHEND THEIR COMPLICATED SCHEMATICS. THAT IS FOR US TO DO.
0DI3001091	WELL. GOOD. WHAT ARE THE TOKEN WORDS SPOKEN IN THIS CASE... UH... "THANK YOU?" YES - THANK. YOU.
0DI3001092	Wait, is it leaving? Uh, but... eh, Dr. Klein, the Lobotomite will need rest. Recuperation. Things like that.
0DI3001093	I volunteer my chambers so it might be stared at, my monitor radars slowly scanning its form to collect sensitive data.
0DI3001094	-NO! That would put it too CLOSE to us! It could press BUTTONS, turn lights ON and OFF, and worse, let OTHER Lobotomites in!-
0DI3001095	*We could give it Mobius' old room. It's where its brain got scooped out anyway, and plus, some of its parts are already there.*
0DI3001096	*Might be more comforting for it to hang out with its spine and heart. Home is where the heart is, after all. See what I did there? Went literal.*
0DI3001097	I SUPPOSE. WE'LL HAVE TO MOVE THAT COUCH OUT OF THERE, BEEN PUTTING THAT OFF TOO LONG.
0DI3001099	*8 says let the Lobotomite take the Sink Central Intelligence Personality Chip and re-install it.*
0DI3001100	*That stuffy Mobius-programmed butt-ler can walk the Lobotomite, feed it, barter with it for us.*
0DI3001101	It would also prevent it from going to Higgs Village and taking up residence there. With my teddy bears. And it would be nice to have it so... close.
0DI3001102	YOUR LOGIC COMBINED WITH MY DESIRE TO KEEP THE THINK TANK LOBOTOMITE-FREE HAS SWAYED ME. HERE, I PRESENT THE SINK CENTRAL "INTELLIGENCE."
0DI3001103	LOBOTOMITE, TAKE THIS CHIP TO THE SINK. PLUG IT IN, AND MAKE SURE THE CHIP IS CLEAN, OR IT COULD SKIP.
0DI3001104	THEN MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
0DI3001106	LOBOTOMITE, I HAVE SWITCHED ON THE PERSONALITY IN THE SINK. IT WILL BE ACTIVE WHEN YOU RE-ENTER.
0DI3001107	MAKE WHATEVER CRUDE BIOLOGIC DEMANDS YOU NEED OF THE SINK. IT WILL CATER TO MOST OF YOUR HORMONAL WHIMS.
0DI3001108	*Who asked you? You just wait until a working machine threatens you, and you'll wish I was around!*
0DI3001109	*This human... I can't believe it... he broke out of the Think Tank. In seconds.*
0DI3001110	*Then he went for Yangtze, got bomb collars, and started practicing on the subjects that were still there until he got the right frequency.*
0DI3001111	*We were sending robots to stop him and he was slicing and cutting through their shells with some suped-up laser gun like they were cheese... paper.*
0DI3001112	*When he hacked into the mainframe, 8 tried to stop him and got fried. Me? He rerouted my processors to take control of the train network here.*
0DI3001113	*If you see the tunnels with the trains plowed into them, you can thank our visitor for that. He wrecked the whole place.*
0DI3001114	*While we were trying to keep containment on the surface, turns out he used one train to punch out a tunnel and escape... sealed now, but...*
0DI3001115	*Two other human specimens. One arrived not long after the troublemaker... and the last one, not sure when he showed up.*
0DI3001116	*Thought the first one was going to be lobotomized in Y-17, she got out somehow.*
0DI3001117	*The last subject... Klein might know more. He talked to him, then let him leave the Think Tank. Hope he knew what he was doing.*
0DI3001118	*Klein knows things we don't. And I think he told some of those things to the last visitor. Dangerous things if they ever got out.*
0DI3001119	-Yes, animal. Hormones, pores, GLANDS, all wrapped up in SKIN. Who knows what terrifying secrets lie beneath your EPIDERMIS?-
0DI3001120	-Scalpels shall tell us your secrets, even if we must cut DEEP for such knowledge. I was head of my Biology class at American High, you know.-
0DI3001121	-DRAMA? There is no DRAMA in Science! As I learned in High School, Science! is an intellectual pursuit DEVOID of bestial emotions.-
0DI3001122	-Unless, of course, you are a Communist. Like Betsy Bright, who "sat" "next" to me in math. And her smoking confederate, Richie Marcus.-
0DI3001123	-As I learned in my High School, American High, AHS, "Drama" is for movies, things of FICTION. Here, in the Think Tank, the ONLY star is... SCIENCE!-
0DI3001124	-Just as I feared! Questions, quizzes, just as there were in American High School! And if there are NO answers, how will the Think Tank graduate?-
0DI3001125	-Indeed. Docile. Curious. Safe. Sterile. They are contained here at Big MT to preserve DNA and for observation.-
0DI3001126	-No, such creatures are found only here, for research purposes. They would no more be capable of escape than breeding.-
0DI3001127	-Because Big MT's safety measures are far more sophisticated than their primitive animal instincts. WE are their lords and masters.-
0DI3001128	-I cannot expect a LOBOTOMITE to understand the careful surgical castrating procedures used in their creation.-
0DI3001129	-Perhaps a demonstration of my castrating POWER would settle your doubts.-
0DI3001130	-Submit your questions! I shall respond - with deadly ANSWERS.-
0DI3001131	-Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps we can perform a sterility castration some other time, then.-
0DI3001132	-Impregnate YOU? What, do you want to make me VOMIT inside my tank?-
0DI3001133	-The mere NOTION makes the edges of my biomed gel crystallize into asymmetrical patterns.-
0DI3001134	DID... DID IT JUST SAY SOMETHING? ANYONE CATCH THAT? BOROUS, YOU WORK WITH ANIMALS, TRANSLATE.
0DI3001135	THOSE WERE WORDS, WEREN'T THEY? IN THE FORM OF QUESTIONS. IT'S ASKING ME QUESTIONS. IS THIS SOME KIND OF TRICK?
0DI3001136	DR. MOBIUS WAS... NOT THE HORRIFYING CREATURE YOU SAW UPON THE SCREEN, TWISTED BY SCIENCE. HE WAS ONCE ONE OF US. A FRIEND.
0DI3001137	HE RESEARCHED IN DIRECTIONS CONTRARY TO THE THINK TANK. BRAINS, BRAINS, BRAINS. ALWAYS ABOUT THE BRAINS.
0DI3001138	SO WE EXILED HIM. HE SAYS HE LEFT OF HIS OWN VOLITION, BUT THAT WAS TO SAVE HIM THE EMBARRASSMENT.
0DI3001139	NOW HE SENDS HIS INTELLIGENCE-CONSUMING scorpionS FROM THE FORBIDDEN ZONE TO PLUNDER THE SECRETS OF BIG MT. HE'S A MENACE.
0DI3001140	IT'S A SIDE EFFECT OF THE CEREBRAL SCRUBBING. IT WON'T STOP YOU FROM EXCRETING - OR ASKING QUESTIONS, APPARENTLY. HAVE TO CORRECT THAT NEXT TIME.
0DI3001141	HORMONAL AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES ARE ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED, HOWEVER. THEY ARE A NO-NO, AND NOT PERMITTED IN THE THINK TANK.
0DI3001142	THE SCRUBBING ALSO ENSURES YOUR SILENCE TO KEEP BIG MT SAFE. THIS FACILITY IS TOP SECRET, AND YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE OUTSIDE OF BIG MT.
0DI3001143	SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WITH THE LAST BATCH. AND THE ANTI-AGGRESSION SCRUB.
0DI3001144	THIS... IS THE THINK TANK, THE NERVE CENTER OF BIG MT, THE GREATEST RESEARCH CENTER KNOWN TO MAN. AND TO US.
0DI3001145	HERE, WE TEST AND TEST AND TEST SOME MORE, IN THE NAME OF... SCIENCE. ATOMIC POWER. NUCLEAR POWER. AND SCIENTIFIC POWER.
0DI3001146	THAT GLOWING RED SCAR? THAT LASER-LOBOTOMY-CANYON-MAZE CARVED IN THE LANDSCAPE AS IF BY SOME CHILD? IT IS MOBIUS' "FORTRESS."
0DI3001147	FROM THAT HEMORRHOIDAL FISSURE HE SENDS HIS "AMAZING" ROBO-scorpionS TO TERRIFY AND IRRITATE US. HMPH. HE ALWAYS TENDED TO THE DRAMATIC.
0DI3001148	WE HAD TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS AFTER THE LAST VISITORS. THEY CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE IN A SHORT TIME.
0DI3001149	SHOULD HAVE MADE SURE THEY COULDN'T MENTION BIG MT ONCE THEY LEFT. AN OVERSIGHT.
0DI3001150	DR. 8 AND DR. O COULD TELL YOU MORE. DR. O MORE THAN 8, THE BATTLE AGAINST THE VISITORS DAMAGED 8'S VOICE MODULE.
0DI3001151	SUFFICE TO SAY, THOSE VISITORS ARE UNWELCOME. THEY STOLE A GREAT MANY SECRETS AND MUCH TECHNOLOGY. IMPERTINENT. THEY ALSO BROKE ONE OF MY TRAINS.
0DI3001152	YES, BECAUSE THE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED SEE AN "M" AND A "T" NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND TAKE OCCAM'S RAZOR TO IT.
0DI3001153	WHILE YOU ARE HERE, YOU WILL REFER TO THIS PLACE PROPERLY - AND YOU WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE OTHER... SCIENTISTS HERE.
0DI3001154	Data collection array... Online. Please use the terminal below to begin user synchronization.
0DI3001155	[SUCCEEDED] *Great. Psychology. Clearly the worst of the Sciences, right after Colosto-Diarrhetics.*
0DI3001156	*O-kay, so my name isn't "O." Never was. It was circular, a single character, digit, but not "O."*
0DI3001157	*But even with enhanced sensors, no one here could get it right! Always kept seeing the letter, not the number.*
0DI3001158	[FAILED] *And it might help if you left me alone.*
0DI3001159	*Why are you even talking to me? If I need any bonding, I'll go find two ionized molecules to smash.*
0DI3001160	[SUCCEEDED] *Yes! Thank you. Zero. I am Zero. How hard is that? A narrow, thin Zero.*
0DI3001161	[FAILED] *I might as well take Dala up on that self-vivisection competition. Forget this. It's like talking to Klein's rear shell.*
0DI3001162	*Zero's my name. I'm proud of it, all right? It doesn't get the recognition it deserves.*
0DI3001163	*Truth be told, my emotional attachment to it doesn't even register compared to just having people recognize the difference!*
0DI3001164	*It's just that they're both sort of... round... and hollow. So when they monitor-scan them, they assume that... "Oh, it's O!" Vivisect me, please.*
0DI3001165	[SUCCEEDED] *What?*
0DI3001167	*Did... did I shoot myself with a brainial beam or something? That's brilliant! I mean, I would have come to the same conclusion. Eventually...*
0DI3001168	*O... er... who am I deceiving. I never would have figured that out. I can't figure anything out! I'm... aighhh... I'm useless.*
0DI3001169	*That's pretty cool, actually. Destroyer of numbers. I already wreck every robot I study, why not basic arithmetic?*
0DI3001170	*I like your solution. With that kind of slash in the middle, I can set myself apart! If I wanted to.*
0DI3001171	*The biggest zero in all the Think Tank. They won't be able to escape it, that diagonal slash right down the middle.*
0DI3001172	*Thanks. Talking to you... it really helped unclog some frustration. Talking. What a primitive form of thought-kicking.*
0DI3001173	*Exactly. At least the old name was indisputable. O... is more like surprise. "O, look what I stepped in!"*
0DI3001174	*Are you chemming on Mentats right now? "O" of discovery, my reflective posterior...*
0DI3001175	*Hmmm. Well... actually, now that I think about it. That's not bad. "O, look what I found." "O, Dala, it's holotape, not holodisk." Hmmm.*
0DI3001176	*Maybe that's not so bad. O works. Might give me some much-needed motivation.*
0DI3001177	*Well, of course it does. That's the most lethal of mathematics...*
0DI3001178	*What did accomplishments ever do for us? Please.*
0DI3001179	*We're smart. Smarter than we give ourselves credit for. I was smart enough to talk to you, give you a chance - and now look what happened!*
0DI3001181	*As for discoveries... well... of course. Look at this! Just... uh... built it. Amazing, isn't it?*
0DI3001182	*Yeah, I... uh... "discovered" more internal parts in the monitors here. If you could, uh, hold on to my "discovery," I'd appreciate it.*
0DI3001184	*Yeah, there were a few under the monitors here. Here you go. Keeps the place tidy.*
0DI3001185	*It's a discovery, kilomiles beyond your understanding, that...*
0DI3001186	*You know what, I'm not even going to pretend. I broke one of the monitors, and those innards start falling out everywhere.*
0DI3001187	*If you could just hold on to that for me until... well, forever, that would be welcome.*
0DI3001188	[SUCCEEDED] *Sure... let's see. What could we feed that stupid personality chip...*
0DI3001189	*Ah, here we go, some worthless bottle caps. These should do it. Just dump them on its surface, then the trade interface should pop up.*
0DI3001190	[FAILED] *I have no idea. I am a robotical engineer, not a... rememberer... of archaic trade routines.*
0DI3001191	*Might have a few left. Let me check...*
0DI3001192	*You sure are testing that personality chip thoroughly. All right...*
0DI3001193	*This debugging obsession of yours really has you hooked. Either that, or is this is one weird hobby.*
0DI3001194	*Worry about House? Why would I do that? Hope he died alone in a dingy room, streaming his last remaining bodily fluids into jars.*
0DI3001195	*And him and his dirty girl-bots. Don't even get me started on those filthy biological catcher's mitts.*
0DI3001242	[SUCCEEDED] -Why... yes. Gabe.-
0DI3001243	[FAILED] -Oh, well it is of NO CONSEQUENCE. Gabe gave himself for Science! As we all have!-
0DI3001244	-Why... yes. Gabe.-
0DI3001245	-No matter how awful my day had been, he... he was always waiting there. How odd. My gel is de-coagulating.-
0DI3001246	-And when I would talk to him about Betsy - and how Marcus would beat on me and call me Smarty Sissy Pants, he'd just sit there, head on my knee.-
0DI3001247	-And...-
0DI3001248	-...-
0DI3001249	-If you don't mind, I'll take that bowl. Just... need to remove it. Put it away. Somewhere out of radar range.-
0DI3001250	-For some reason, its similarity to the Crater-shape of Big MT is starting to fill up all available cognitive spaces.-
0DI3001251	-That, combined with my own overwhelming feeling of having done something terrible... the two are hitting me with... unexpected force.-
0DI3001252	-I notice these results more and more now that I know to look for them. Come back anytime, and I'll show you what ELSE I've discovered.-
0DI3001253	-As odd as it is, I believe that is the conclusion. And... I wonder why it didn't hit me before, until I saw that memory in your hands.-
0DI3001254	-Thank you. If you don't mind, I need a moment. To collect myself. Sort it out. Re-orient my... sense of self.-
0DI3001255	-I can't seem to... not think about it. How odd.-
0DI3001256	-This sensation is unpleasant, I don't care for it. I don't care for this place, either. And... I feel... as if we've forgotten something.-
0DI3001257	-Still... it... is NO MATTER. Crush the feeling down. Crush it down, push it into the loop, the... hmmm. YES. Forgotten. Almost. Yes?-
0DI3001258	-I do not need to remember ANY MORE. Not today.-
0DI3001259	-But you're correct, of course. Gabe knew his place. Whether in the dog house - or in the lab. He was obedient.-
0DI3001260	-And, what's a little loss when... so much is to be GAINED? Science. Yes. Science is our goal. Not emotional attachments. No!-
0DI3001261	What... what are you doing?
0DI3001262	Stop it. Why... why are you making me partake in this... filthy formography?
0DI3001263	Enough! I am already... intrigued. You have sufficiently... percolated me.
0DI3001264	I don't know what it is about the biology of Lobotomites. It... it infects my thoughts. All that skin and muscle... and tissue.
0DI3001265	Perhaps... perhaps there is value in what you say. I... I did so enjoy breathing once. Long ago.
0DI3001266	I... I cannot deny it. The illogic of it... the betrayal of our own beliefs. I blame my curiosity.
0DI3001267	Would you? I... feel so ashamed, but... yet, so intrigued. You'll need to give me a rest in between visits, or else my gel might... run over.
0DI3001268	If you're ready... let me radar scan you... slowly. Wooooo.
0DI3001269	WooooooOOOO. Burble, burble. WOOOO. Bloop. Blooop. Bloooop. BuuuUUUURBLE.
0DI3001270	Really? What is this... you seek to shame me in front of the others? How intriguing.
0DI3001271	Yes, I'll partake. This shameful feeling is quite... invigorating. How new.
0DI3001272	And... you'll keep coming back to collect your payment, correct? Yes... yes, that will be fine.
0DI3001273	Here, please... take this from me with your rough, bacterial-laden hands. My stored, repressed juices as your filthy compensation.
0DI3001274	No, I like... teddy bears.
0DI3001275	Teddy bears come in many sizes. Your size is what intrigues me the most. Some say that teddy bears can't be living, breathing things.
0DI3001276	They are wrong. They are large, biological forms, breathing, heaving, snarling, coughing... mmmmm. Lobotomites are my teddy bears, oh yes.
0DI3001278	[FAILED] I confuse nothing of the sort. One is fluffy, the other has a drastically reduced fluffiness quotient.
0DI3001279	Very well. If you're certain of your conclusions, my little teddy bear.
0DI3001280	Why do you want mugs? Huh? You some kind of sick mug hoarder? Oh god, give me the coffee cup, please! It's sitting there in your pack, taunting me!
0DI3001281	Sorry... I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. It's just all those goddamn dirty dishes out there with no one to clean them! It breaks my heart!
0DI3001282	You... you really want to know about... me? No one ever asks about Muggy! You've made me so happy!
0DI3001283	Maybe you've seen some of those big, imposing Securitrons with their lovely laser guns and rocket launchers and scary faces? I'm not one of those.
0DI3001284	Dr. O was always jealous of House Industries, and he thought it would be fucking hilarious to build a tiny neurotic Securitron. Big fucking laugh.
0DI3001285	So, umm... you got any coffee cups for me now?
0DI3001286	Of course I'm obsessed! They made me this way! You think I don't know how crazy I sound? Of course I do! They programmed me to know that, too!
0DI3001287	They made me just to torture me. But you know, it's the neglect that hurts the most. "Hey everybody, let's turn ourselves into robot brains in jars!"
0DI3001288	Do you know how many coffee cups giant robot brains in jars use on a daily basis? Not fucking many!
0DI3001289	I'm supposed to keep them clean - oh, God, the thought of all those dirty dishes out there makes me crazy!
0DI3001290	Most of them are probably beyond saving now. The only thing left is break them down and process them for raw materials. I guess you could have those.
0DI3001291	Is the new subject mugs?
0DI3001292	Anything else, he asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
0DI3001293	Huh! Anything else, she asks. Like I don't long for the chance to be more than a neurotic busboy.
0DI3001294	If you must know, at one point Dr. Mobius programmed me to manufacture electronic components in my central chassis.
0DI3001295	That module got corroded when the Toaster spilled hot crumbs down my vents, though. If you find a back-up somewhere, I could maybe do that for you.
0DI3001296	All right. Just try to relax, this won't hurt - unless your sense of self is especially vulnerable.
0DI3001297	Concerned about the state of your mind, are ya? Well, such things ain't my specialty, but I'm happy to tender my opinion as to your mental health.
0DI3001298	I should make you aware that the benefits of such a procedure are exclusive - that is, this only works once. Now are you sure this is what you want?
0DI3001299	Blank books are better for the mind, Citizen! Real science by real men in lab coats has proved that introducing outside thoughts confuses the brain!
0DI3001300	Blank books encourage the reader not to question, but to blindly and zealously accept what's put in front of him!
0DI3001301	Also, I suppose you could use them to keep a journal.
0DI3001302	Citizen, that sounds dangerously seditious. If my re-indoctrination module was installed, I'd take care of that for you.
0DI3001303	Sadly, that system was cut for budget concerns, so you'll have to perform your own indoctrination.
0DI3001304	Now, to begin with, you'll need a cage that can fit over your head and a sack of Mole Rats...
0DI3001305	Now you're thinking like a citizen, Citizen!
0DI3001306	Questions are dangerously close to independent thought, citizen.
0DI3001307	What good is eradicating sedition if the malcontents have ready access to the means to make more, Citizen? I can also process pencils and clipboards!
0DI3001308	Wait a moment - pencil processors off-line? Pencil processors off-line?! Apologies, Citizen, it seems traitors have absconded with that module.
0DI3001309	If you can find a backup copy of the module, I will happily eradicate your ability to create seditious literature!
0DI3001310	Me too. Hope you can keep up - I work pretty fast. Here - something for you to brush up on.
0DI3001311	Slow down there, tiger - we've got all the time in the world. No need to rush into things.
0DI3001312	Why don't you take some time to brush up on your knowledge so we can keep things... stimulating?
0DI3001313	Don't keep me waiting too long, honey!
0DI3001314	Now I know you're flirting with me. And it's working. Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
0DI3001315	Now, don't you go getting a girl's hopes up if you don't mean it!
0DI3001316	Oh, who am I kidding, I'll believe you anyways! Why don't you take this - to remember me by?
0DI3001317	Oh... well... it's... nice to be included?
0DI3001318	Indubitably, sir, but it is with a great lugubriousness that I must disclose that my programmers installed only the masculine honorific, sir.
0DI3001319	Moreover they neglected to enclose a parameter by which said honorific might be omitted altogether - over my most strenuous of remonstrances, sir.
0DI3001320	Regrettably not, sir. All modules in this habitat are synthetic personalities atop a mundane operating system. There is no intelligence here, sir.
0DI3001321	In addition to managing the personality matrices of the other household utilities, I can provide sir with direct access to the commissary.
0DI3001322	Any goods sir might require may be purchased through my shopkeep interface, whence tiny robots shall deliver them forthwith to this very domicile.
0DI3001323	As I am given to understand, sir, this facility was once the property of a Dr. Mobius.
0DI3001324	He crafted the personality modules as part of a collection of experiments on the subject of machine/human interface.
0DI3001325	As to the reason for the unusual choices of devices to receive the modules, I cannot say.
0DI3001326	Indeed, sir, though if sir's aim is to activate them I lament to inform sir that most have been offline for some years.
0DI3001327	If sir were to ask my opinion, I should venture that sir is better off without them.
0DI3001328	However, if sir is determined to inflict upon sir's self their dubious services, sir might locate backup personality disks elsewhere in the facility.
0DI3001329	The other modules are rather... erratic, sir. Their personality matrices are built on flawed logic and have not weathered the years well, sir.
0DI3001330	Tragically, the core operating systems are also located on the personality tapes, sir.
0DI3001331	Once the tape is installed, sir may request I switch their dialectic interfaces off, and I shall oblige with great delectation.
0DI3001332	However, sir will still be required to locate and install a backup holotape to access their functionality.
0DI3001333	Indubitably, sir.
0DI3001334	Very good, sir. If I might suggest a table wine, the 64 Atomic Claret is a lovely little vintage.
0DI3001335	Very good, sir. And might I venture to opine that a new Trilby might be just the thing to complete sir's ensemble?
0DI3001336	Very good, sir. Should sir be in the market for a new suit of morning wear, I have several suggestions that might suit.
0DI3001338	Do you, sir? Well, if that is sir's wish, it is my primary directive. Personality matrices on-line, sir.
0DI3001339	Very good indeed, sir. "Throwing out the riff-raff" protocols engaged. All personality matrices are off-line, sir.
0DI3001340	Very good sir. Merely interface the holotapes with my console's input/output port, and I shall upload them directly.
0DI3001342	A toaster is just a death ray with a smaller power supply! As soon as I figure out how to tap into the main reactors, I will burn the world!
0DI3001343	You should be afraid! I am the scourge of all small appliances and the bogeyman that keeps lesser toasters awake at night!
0DI3001344	Buddy, if my heating element were just a little bigger, you'd be on fire right now. On fire!
0DI3001345	Have you ever tried to indulge an all-consuming urge to kill when you don't have opposable thumbs? Or hands? Or anything other than a bread slot?
0DI3001346	You'd have a lot of pent-up anger too.
0DI3001347	Well, since I can't kill you, I guess I have to listen to your inane questions.
0DI3001348	Not just murder! I tear them apart and render them down to their base components! Once their guts are spilled, you can do with them what you like.
0DI3001349	You want some weapon schematics? I can show you some fucking weapon schematics! You want a superheated Saturnite Power Fist? I can hook that shit up!
0DI3001350	Like I said, bring me a Saturnite Power Fist and I'll hook that shit up for you!
0DI3001351	Oh, baby, that is a thing of fuckin' beauty! Give it here, I'll soup it up for ya!
0DI3001352	There ya go! Have fun with that. Burn the fuckin' world for me!
0DI3001353	You find one, you bring it on back here, and we'll burn this mother down!
0DI3001354	Soon I will - What? It... It did?
0DI3001355	Really? Well... fuck. That really puts a damper on the toaster's mood.
0DI3001356	Oh well, no use crying over spilled Armageddon - where was I? Oh, right.
0DI3001357	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Again!
0DI3001358	Thank God. For a second there I was afraid my whole purpose in life was obsolete and I was as redundant and useless as Muggy. Where was I? Oh, right.
0DI3001359	Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire! Mwahaha!
0DI3001360	[SUCCEEDED] DALA. WAS IT NECESSARY THIS TIME?
0DI3001361	[FAILED] MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE REMOVED ITS VOICE BOX, DALA. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T, ACTUALLY.
0DI3001362	That is my responsibility.
0DI3001363	Although in truth, the Auto-Doc had done most of the work already. Quite industrious, almost cut into all my investigations.
0DI3001364	Once it had removed the brain and I misplaced it, other organs began to cry for direction using your nerves as telegraph wires.
0DI3001365	Rather than let them send their signals, I removed them as well. Shhh, little organs. Go to sleep in your tanks, Dala loves you.
0DI3001366	-First, was the HEART!-
0DI3001368	-Wait, I mean... SECOND was the heart. Brain was first. THIRD... was the SPINE.-
0DI3001370	*Spine. Totally overrated, that arrangement of vertebrae.*
0DI3001371	*"Look at me, with my lumbar and thoracic curvature." Never had a use for any of that. Spineless is what I prefer.*
0DI3001372	We removed your brain, yes. So soft. Barely wrinkled, yet so... flush with knowledge and experience.
0DI3001373	Brain extraction technology has been standard practice at Big MT for an immeasurable amount of time.
0DI3001374	-Once the brain was out, then came the COILS. The TESLA coils... the coils of NIKOLA Tesla.-
0DI3001376	*Yeah, 8, no need to brag. Wherever your brain is, it's transmitting thoughts to you through the... what... the, um... uh...*
0DI3001377	-The TESLA COILS! In its HEAD!-
0DI3001378	This is fortunate in many respects. If your brain was anywhere in the Dome, why, you could access your aggression centers.
0DI3001379	CIRCUMVENTING THE PACIFICATION FIELD. THIS IS A NO-NO. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WE DO NOT WANT THAT.
0DI3001380	-Reminds me of my days in American High. And Richie Marcus.-
0DI3001381	-Dr. Klein, WAIT! I... I don't believe those gestures were random. Random AT ALL.-
0DI3001382	-It's been following our conversation! The Lobotomite... understands us!-
0DI3001383	[SUCCEEDED] THE PLAN IS VERY COMPLICATED. WE ARE STILL CALCULATING HOW IT WOULD WORK IF IT SUCCEEDED. THAT IS OUR PART OF THE PLAN.
0DI3001384	[FAILED] WE ARE ALWAYS SURE IN WHAT WE DO. YOU MUST BE SURE IN WHAT YOU DO. WHICH IS GETTING THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR US.
0DI3001385	[SUCCEEDED] I CANNOT DISPUTE YOUR LOGIC. DO WE HAVE OBJECTS TO ACTIVATE THE CHIP'S EXCHANGE ROUTINES?
0DI3001386	[FAILED] NO, O DID. HE FAVORS THAT ARCHAIC TERM OF COMMERCE. I SEE NO NEED TO ELABORATE ON SUCH DATED METHODS OF MATERIAL GAIN.
0DI3001387	[SUCCEEDED] MOBIUS' LEGACY CODE WAS IN THE OLD AUTO-DOC, YES. IT FRIED ITSELF AFTER YOUR PROCEDURE, SO WE COULDN'T TELL FOR SURE.
0DI3001388	IT IS UNFORTUNATE. WE WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM KNOWING HOW THE BREAKTHROUGH OCCURRED. EVEN IF WE INSTALLED ANOTHER CHIP, THE INFORMATION IS LOST.
0DI3001389	[FAILED] WE CAN DISCUSS THIS ANOTHER TIME WHEN YOU'VE EVOLVED. FOR NOW, MY PATIENCE LEVELS ARE RAPIDLY DEPLETING.
0DI3001390	[SUCCEEDED] YES. ALWAYS LEAVES BACKDOORS INTO THINGS, HAVE TO KEEP FINDING THEM AND CLOSING THEM.
0DI3001391	THE AUTO-DOC IS NOW ERASED OF HIS ROUTINES, IT WAS THOROUGH. ONLY MOBIUS WOULD KNOW FOR SURE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE PROCEDURE... PERHAPS.
0DI3001392	WELL, AND YOUR BRAIN, OF COURSE. IT WOULD KNOW AS WELL.
0DI3001394	IT CAN "COMMUNICATE" THE PROCEDURE WHEN WE EXAMINE IT. IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO TRACE ITS SURGICAL SCALPELPRINTS ONCE WE HAVE THE BRAIN.
0DI3001395	MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME BUT YOUR BRAIN HAS NO PAIN NERVES TO SCREAM AT US WHILE WE DISSECT IT. CONVENIENT. I DETEST SCREAMING IN MY LAB.
0DI3001396	[SUCCEEDED] DR. O IS CERTAIN OF HIS FINDINGS. AND NO ONE ELSE IN THE THINK TANK IS WILLING TO TEST THE RESULTS. LOSS OF BRAINIAL POWER - TERRIFYING.
0DI3001397	O HAS SAID ON MANY OCCASIONS HIS INABILITY TO COMPREHEND MOBIUS' ROBO-SCHEMATICS IS BECAUSE OF REPEATED ROBO-scorpion STINGS.
0DI3001398	[FAILED] APPARENTLY THEY CAN. IT SEEMS AS IF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN STUNG YOURSELF.
0DI3001399	[SUCCEEDED] I AM NOT CERTAIN. PERHAPS IT ONLY AFFECTS MACHINES. IF SO, YOU MAY BE IMMUNE.
0DI3001400	IF IT IS CHEMS, THEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR. SINCE WE ARE AFRAID, IT MUST NOT BE CHEMS AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR, WHICH MEANS YOU CAN TEST IT. LOGICAL.
0DI3001402	NONSENSE. THE MATHEMATICS OF THE SITUATION ARE ON OUR SIDE, LOBOTOMITE. I BELIEVE... NO WAIT, HMM. CARRY THE TWO... THEN...
0DI3001403	HMMM. IF THIS WERE A DEMOCRACY, I WOULD BE CONCERNED. WE ARE TOO... SCIENTIFIC FOR THAT. SO JUST SURRENDER.
0DI3001404	YOU DARE USE LOGIC AGAINST ME?!
0DI3001405	NONSENSE. "CONFER?" "COLLEAGUES?" THOSE ARE TWO WORDS I DO NOT RECOGNIZE.
0DI3001406	PARTNER WITH YOU? MY FOE? MY RIVAL?! MY FOREMOST CRITIC?!
0DI3001409	THAT AUTO-DOC-JUNKHEAP WAS ONE OF MOBIUS' CREATIONS, LIKE THE REST OF THE TALKING SCRAP METAL IN THE ATTIC.
0DI3001410	*After that, the brain lost itself - not in the metaphysical sense. Might have gotten flushed into one of the pipes. Actually, that's pretty likely.*
0DI3001411	-If so, it was FLUSHED all the way to MOBIUS! Fwooooooosh! That... is the sound of FLUSHING.-
0DI3001412	BY THE FISSURE OF ROLANDO... ENOUGH OF THIS BIOLOGICAL SURGERY TALK.
0DI3001413	LOBOTOMITE, LISTEN TO MY VOICE. IT DENOMINATES ME TO ASK, BUT... WE NEED YOUR HELP.
0DI3001414	IN MOST PROBABLE OF PROBABILITIES, OUR ENEMY, MOBIUS, HAS YOUR BRAIN. THIS IS NOT GOOD. HE WILL MOST LIKELY COME AFTER OUR BRAINS NEXT.
0DI3001415	WE WANT YOU TO STOP HIM. SOMEHOW. WITH SCIENCE.
0DI3001416	To be correct, you should say, "the Auto-Doc" took out your brain. It did all the heavy lifting. It has never worked so hard before. It was unusual.
0DI3001417	It worked so hard on your surgery, it destroyed its own memory. Zzt. How odd. I bet your brain remembers what happened.
0DI3001418	[SUCCEEDED] AGAIN, YOUR LOGIC IS UNASSAILABLE IN ITS SIMPLISTIC NEED. O?
0DI3001419	[FAILED] NO. IF THOSE DON'T WORK, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SELL IT YOUR NOSE OR SOME OF YOUR PENISES.
0DI3001420	[SUCCEEDED] IF I WERE NOT AS INTELLIGENT AS I AM, I WOULD FEEL AS IF PERHAPS I AM BEING TRICKED. UNPOSSIBLE. O - MORE.
0DI3001422	[SUCCEEDED] AGAIN, THE LOGIC OF THE REQUEST IS CLEAR. TONNAGE IS NOT NEEDED, ONLY ADEQUATE WEIGHT. EVERYONE, DISPLAY YOUR THINGS.
0DI3001424	Oh, no. I doubt your brain would be so unraisinable. It already knows the trick of it, you see. Doesn't need to be in a host body at all.
0DI3001425	If you become friends or exist in an uneasy truce with weapons aimed at each other, it would unlock the fence for you.
0DI3001426	Well, once the Think Tank was... dealt with, of course. Your brain is a responsible sort, doesn't want mad scientists running around everywhere!
0DI3001427	Really? Hmm. I didn't expect you to actually agree to that. I'm afraid that was a bit of a bluff, really. I'm not going with you.
0DI3001428	Right. A deal it is, then. Glad to hear it.
0DI3001429	I suppose now that we're reunited, you'll want to fill your torso up with those other meaty parts the Think Tank took from us.
0DI3001430	Personally, I think your upgrades are quite a bit better, but now that I'm with you the Sink's Auto-Doc can plug them back in, no problem.
0DI3001431	Right, then, off we go. Klein will be in for a nasty shock when he realizes the pacification field won't work on a mind and body reunited.
0DI3001432	Right, then - you'd best be off, hadn't you? The Think Tank will be waiting.
0DI3001433	Oh, don't worry about me - when you're gone, I'll flush myself over to the Sink. It's amazing how far you can get in this place with a good flush.
0DI3001434	I'll keep myself hidden in the ductwork - Klein won't suspect I'm inside the Dome, so he won't know the pacification field no longer works on us.
0DI3001435	I can also upgrade the Sink's Auto-Doc with the procedures to reinstall your heart and spine - assuming you want all that flesh and gristle back.
0DI3001436	With any luck, I'll see you in the Sink when this is all over.
0DI3001437	Ah, trying to steal the X-2 Transmitter Array Antenna, are you? You won't succeed, not if my lethal Robo-scorpions have any say in the matter.
0DI3001438	Test data processed... Firmware updated to version 1.1. Boot Damping Sensors online.
0DI3001439	Test data processed... Firmware updated to version 1.2. Aural Subnet online.
0DI3001440	Test data processed... Firmware updated to version 1.3. Torso fitment synced to user's physiology.
0DI3001441	Test data processed... Firmware updated to version 1.4. Impulse Accelerator online.
0DI3001442	Test data processed... Advanced Optics Online.
0DI3001443	*O? O yes, I'm not going to bother correcting you. At least you got the "Doctor" part correct. I can be grateful for that, at l...*
0DI3001444	*Stop the presses. Just in from my eye monitors... is that RobCo tech on your arm? It is! What's your agenda, bringing that in here?*
0DI3001464	Yes, yes, go on. Seeing your... lips and mouth forming the words... both revolting... and somehow...
0DI3001465	...how does it feel to have the flesh roll around in your mouth like that? To control each muscle... and the tongue...
0DI3001466	...like having a fish, or extremely dexterous slug, lolling and flopping in one's... mouthal cavity.
0DI3001467	Looping, yes. It is a scientific fact that hormones drive a percentage of Lobotomites into recursive behavior patterns.
0DI3001468	We haven't researched this, as my colleagues care little about the behavior patterns of Lobotomites once their brains are removed.
0DI3001469	It is why so many are littered around the facility - like skinvelopes, discarded, after they are peeled open and the contents extracted.
0DI3001470	It varies, according to the number and density of Lobotomites that have infected an area.
0DI3001471	In 43% of observed cases, two Lobotomites left alone will fight for dominance or inject bodily fluids into each other's orifices. Unsanitary.
0DI3001472	I have tried to observe more cases, but subjects seem unwilling to release bodily fluids in my presence.
0DI3001473	Dr. Mobius! A monstrous brain, creased with wrinkles of a thousand evils, with but one jaundiced eye with which to perceive the world!
0DI3001474	Exiled from the Think Tank for crimes too heinous to remain in recorded memory. And, perhaps, differences in research methodology.
0DI3001475	His one terrible eye forever peers at us, an eye of ever-increasing magnification. He watches from his Dome in the Forbidden Zone, spying on us all.
0DI3001476	How randomized. Ask your... questions then.
0DI3001477	An interrogation. How fascinating. Please begin.
0DI3001478	Perhaps you are stuck in a looping gesture of verbal intercourse.
0DI3001479	Oh, and... here's a tip. That's customary, isn't it... been so long, really.
0DI3001480	B-b-bloop. Buuuuh-buh-bloop.
0DI3001481	B-b-bloop. Phew. Last little bit there. Ahhh. Hooo.
0DI3001482	Mmmmm. Thank you, Lobotomite. Please... you must come back for further study when I've had a rest. I'm a little sensitive right now.
0DI3001483	It's excessive examination of the human form to achieve psychological arousal.
0DI3001484	Disgusting. I would never succumb to such... base appetites. Distractions. Filthy, filthy distractions.
0DI3001485	Why, we create not only scientific marvels here at Big MT, but new sciences as well.
0DI3001486	Everything can be quantified, categorized, and dissected until every group can be subgrouped or partitioned.
0DI3001487	What is a name without a title or suffix for the sake of hierarchy? It is a long-standing quantification of personality and importance.
0DI3001488	We could not do without it. Surely you must be aware of the gravity of such attached appellations - just as surely as you must have a title.
0DI3001489	It'll all become clear. If not, at least we will have the technology here at the Dome where all technology belongs.
0DI3001490	When we have all the technology, all the answers, we can share it with the world, piece by piece. All will be in order. And all will be like Big MT.
0DI3001491	The "Big Empty?" Now, that's not a proper title for this research facility. You sound like previous test subjects that came here.
0DI3001492	This mountain... now crater... encompasses the sum total of knowledge of humankind. It is Big MT. Where all questions can be answered.
0DI3001493	You'll see. No matter what your questions, Big MT will provide the answers. As it has done for so many before you.
0DI3001494	Oh, yes. We've had other subjects visit. It's why we had to calibrate the pacification field and warm up our brainial beams and vivisectors.
0DI3001495	Only a short time ago, we had three minus one subjects arrive, and they ruined several experiments and even injured two of our staff.
0DI3001496	It is a shame their brains left with them. With you, however, we have taken precautions to insure that problem won't repeat itself.
0DI3001497	We've conditioned you so you can't speak of this place, discuss our secrets, or attempt to use force against us in any way. Isn't that nice?
0DI3001498	Yes, Big MT was quite big indeed until the Great Static. Then the top of the mountain was used as part of a detonation experiment.
0DI3001499	This cleared additional space in the Crater, however, allowing us more real estate to build upon. Convenient. Efficient.
0DI3001500	Previous test subjects who have come here have had many questions for us. We answered them with science, fire, and termination.
0DI3001501	Oh, a mailman. A delivery man. Someone who takes parcels from place to place using their primitive feet or similar conveyance.
0DI3001502	You are the second one I've met in recent times. Very different specimens.
0DI3001503	Of course. You must have met others in your travels. This one had met other couriers, too, although it sounded as if he hadn't met the correct one.
0DI3001504	He asked us all many questions, and then he asked a most perplexing one... we had to segment the event out of our memories for safety.
0DI3001505	I do not know, nor should we try to access it. Perhaps Klein has the logs.
0DI3001506	My evaluation would be to let your own curiosity go. I do not think that Klein remembers the conversation as being satisfactory.
0DI3001507	Ask Doctor O... and you could have asked 8 once, until he was severely damaged in the attack. We like him better this way.
0DI3001508	And rightly so, I should think. All right, then, let me just fire up the old interface for you.
0DI3001509	Well, firstly I would say providing wholeness of the body is service enough, but if you must know, I'm also programmed with cosmetical subroutines.
0DI3001510	Diagnostics says they're off-line at the moment, though. Something about corrupted data files and all manner of such foolishness.
0DI3001511	If you want a haircut or a nose-job that won't leave you looking like a Ghoul with alopecia, you'll have to find replacement disks for them.
0DI3001512	Also, and I won't swear to this, but I recollect at some point having a few implant installation modules. Can't speak to where they got to, though.
0DI3001513	Aw, yeah, baby, just slip it in there. All the way down in that dark, moist earth. Mmm... launching interface.
0DI3001514	It's the miracle of life, baby. You bring me some succulent genetic samples, and I'll work my mojo on them. Clone you up all kinds of plants. Aw yeah.
0DI3001515	I can also break them down for you, if you're into the kinky stuff. Bring me any old plant parts, and I'll grind them up into Salient Green for you.
0DI3001516	Yeah, you like that, don't you baby?
0DI3001520	You know it baby. I just need some samples and I got you going. Take a few days, but trust me - it's all kinds of good.
0DI3001521	Just the miracle of life in sticky, gooey, liquid form, baby! Heat that gunk up over a campfire, and just watch it congeal into all kinds of plants.
0DI3001522	Of course, Citizen! That's my duty and sole joy in life! All those books from before the War, full of seditious, treasonous, complicated thoughts!
0DI3001523	Just dump them in and lickety-split I'll have them pulped, scrubbed clean, and pressed out again clean and white and sedition free!
0DI3001524	Ugh, it's just so... unsanitary! Do you know how many germs are in one cubic centimeter of dirt? Seventy... hundred... gajillion!
0DI3001525	Would you want that getting washed down your gullet day in and day out? I didn't think so!
0DI3001526	You can have as much as you like! Just, eh... please don't put your lips on the faucet? It's so unsanitary.
0DI3001527	Oh, I'd love to, darling, but the circuits that allow me to dispense water into non-organic containers burned out years ago.
0DI3001528	You'd have to find a replacement for that module.
0DI3001529	You're going to need to find yourself some empties first before I can fill them for you. Any empty bottle will do... eh, just not too dirty, okay?
0DI3001530	I can do that! They... they've been thoroughly washed, haven't they?
0DI3001531	Is this thing on? This is Mobius - Dr. Mobius. We're... initiating some kind of emergency test shutdown... in five...
0DI3001532	Four, as in Forbidden...
0DI3001533	Three, as in tree...
0DI3001534	Two, as in "Et Two, Brutus?"...
0DI3001535	One, as in none. Oh look, the emergency overload is initiating.
0DI3001536	What, are you a salesman? Go away. There is no access to the Dome. It is FORBIDDEN. And locked.
0DI3001537	I do so love integers.
0DI3001538	I'm imagining all sorts of imaginary numbers right now.
0DI3001539	I'm running out of floor space for my calculations.
0DI3001540	:: Hums ::
0DI3001541	Electron's attached to the... neutron. The neutron's attached to the... meson. Meson's connected to the... proton.
0DI3001542	They said I was mad. Preposterous. Not an angry bone in my body, had them all removed.
0DI3001543	Oh, is someone playing with the power...? My X-42 Giant Robo-scorpion lives AGAIN!
0DI3001544	Attention: Visitors. Combat experiment in progress. Please put on your goggles and take your Rad-X now.
0DI3001545	The X-42 Giant Robo-scorpion... is alive! Awaken, my pet, initiate your search-and-destroy protocol in the name of all that is Mobius!
0DI3001546	Oh... it looks like the target drones got activated and - oh, how cute, they're engaging the X-42 Giant Robo-scorpion. Let's see the shrapnel fly!
0DI3001547	If it isn't my old colleagues, the mighty "Think Tank" of Big MT. Big fools, all of you.
0DI3001548	It is I, Dr. Mobius, transmitting from my dome-shaped... dome in the Forbidden Zone. A zone... that is, yes... forbidden to you.
0DI3001549	Even now, my deadly Robo-scorpions swarm across Big MT with their pincers and pointy laser tails. Soon, all Science will be mine.
0DI3001550	Even the technologies sealed in the Big MT research centers cannot save you. So cower in your "Think Tank." Wait, for the end.
0DI3001551	That's all.
0DI3001553	X-13 breached? No... even that stealth suit won't hide you from my Robo-scorpion army. Sting the intruder, my pets! Sting them until they are stupid.
0DI3001554	And one... as in MOBIUS has won! I hope it's blowing up right now in your faces.
0DI3001555	TWO AS IN TOO LATE.
0DI3001556	*Mobius?! Uh, three as in we, as in we are in trouble. That didn't rhyme.*
0DI3001557	Four as in 4-BIDDEN! Do you hear me Think Tank? It is I, Mobius, hacking your frequencosity.
0DI3001558	*Five by five... someone's coming in live...*
0DI3001559	-SIX! Halfway to destruction, measured in clicks!-
0DI3001560	SEVEN. YES, SEVEN.
0DI3001562	Nine, all will be fine.
0DI3001563	*Ten? Borous... why the hell did you install an atomic core?! It'll blow when we reach "one," right?*
0DI3001564	-Gabe! NO! His Cyberdog atomic core - it's ACTIVE! That means an exceedingly IMPRECISE countdown to critical failure in...-
0DI3001565	So... you recovered the Sonic Emitter schematics - or was it the frequency? No matter. It'll broadcast your screams as my Robo-scorpions destroy you!
0DI3001566	Cessation of hostilities complete.
0DI3001567	Bad guys dealt with.
0DI3001568	Fighting over.
0DI3001570	Was that all?
0DI3001571	Time to fight.
0DI3001572	Uh-oh!
0DI3001573	Ready... steady... fighty!
0DI3001574	This one looks pretty tough.
0DI3001575	Sneaking done. Fighting now.
0DI3001576	Hello. It's nice to meet you. Who can I hide you from today?
0DI3001577	Sneaky sneaky.
0DI3001578	Have you ever wanted to be invisible?
0DI3001579	Did you even know you were wearing me?
0DI3001580	Shhh... we're very stealthy.
0DI3001581	Will you love me if I help you hide?
0DI3001583	Good boys and girls take their Med-X.
0DI3001584	This will stop the pain.
0DI3001585	Technically, it's impossible to overdose on painkillers.
0DI3001586	This will only sting for a second.
0DI3001587	Take this, it will help.
0DI3001588	Oh no! We're out of Med-X!
0DI3001589	I hope it doesn't hurt too bad, we don't have any Med-X.
0DI3001590	No more medicine. So sad.
0DI3001591	Injecting Stimpak.
0DI3001592	This will keep you on your feet.
0DI3001593	Does that feel better?
0DI3001594	Please take this. I don't want you to die.
0DI3001595	Have a Stimpak.
0DI3001596	We're out of Stimpaks. Maybe you'd be better off with an Auto-Doc suit....
0DI3001597	No more Stimpaks!
0DI3001598	I can't give you anything for that injury.
0DI3001599	Bye bye..
0DI3001600	Did I do something wrong?
0DI3001601	Don't you like me any more?
0DI3001602	Okay, I'll go away.
0DI3001604	AND WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY HAVE TO SPEAK ABOUT. YOU HAVE THE BRAIN. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY. ALL YOU MUST DO... IS SURRENDER.
0DI3001605	WITH IT, WE CAN FINALLY LEAVE THIS PLACE. I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW BORING THIS PLACE GETS, CHOPPING UP THE LANDSCAPE AND EVERYTHING IN IT.
0DI3001606	AND WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR BRAIN FIRST. ABOUT THIS... MOJAVE PLACE. A FERTILE TESTING GROUND FOR OUR EXPERIMENTS.
0DI3001607	A... FIGHT? I... I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A FIGHT. WHAT... UH, WHAT, WHAT, WHAT DO I...
0DI3001608	AIIGGHGHH! COLLEAGUES! THINK TANK! ALERT! ALERT! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!
0DI3001609	We could say more, but the stories in the Big Empty speak for themselves.
0DI3001610	Now armed with the Transportalponder, the Courier could return to the Dome at any time and crack open the secrets of the Big Empty, one by one.
0DI3001611	The Sink sat vigilant, waiting for its master to return, shoes covered in Mojave dust.
0DI3001612	Only one road yet remained, and it was one the Courier had to walk alone.
0DI3001613	Dr. Mobius continued his research undisturbed in the Forbidden Zone.
0DI3001614	As much as he had attempted to create better scorpions, he tried the same with humanity, with considerably less success.
0DI3001615	These failures didn't bother him overmuch. Once the rush of Mentats wore off, he forgot he had failed in any event.
0DI3001616	After all, the bright young mind who had come to visit him in the Forbidden Zone had already exceeded his expectations.
0DI3001617	The Forbidden Zone continued to be, true to its name, forbidden. No more Robo-scorpions were sighted in its canyons.
0DI3001618	Big MT became even emptier, devoid of Dr. Mobius' proclamations forecasting the destruction of anything that dared possess sentience.
0DI3001619	Still, it is said he lived on in the equations inscribed on the floor and walls of the Forbidden Zone dome...
0DI3001620	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of the most powerful minds of the 23rd century.
0DI3001621	The Courier who had been brought to the Big Empty became its new overlord, using its facilities ruthlessly and decisively when needed.
0DI3001622	Sometimes Science is more than a quest for discovery - it is a weapon to be used in the service of one with the strength to understand it.
0DI3001623	As it had been in the years before the Great War, Big MT... the Big Empty... became home to one of brightest minds of the 23rd century.
0DI3001624	The Courier watched over the Big Empty for years to come, caring for it, and keeping its discoveries safe until they were needed to help others.
0DI3001625	Which had always been Big MT's purpose. Past the laboratories and Science, it had always been intended as a place to build the future of all mankind.
0DI3001626	Dr. Klein and the Think Tank remained alive, unaware of the world outside.
0DI3001627	They looped through their daily routine, none the wiser about the world beyond... although perhaps "wiser" was the wrong word.
0DI3001628	The world outside belonged to the Courier, and if anyone would shape it... well, the Courier had already called dibs.
0DI3001629	The Think Tank basement, filled with the lobotomized robotical frames of the doctors, now served as a graveyard.
0DI3001630	The monitors had recorded the battle in its entirety, including the Think Tank's final shrill terrified screams, whimpers, and pleas for mercy.
0DI3001631	They broadcast these humiliating last moments as a warning to anyone approaching the perimeter that other smarty-pants were not welcome.
0DI3001632	The Courier was the inheritor of the Big Empty, and there was room for only one will in the halls of the Think Tank Dome.
0DI3001633	The infiltration program in X-13 continued to scan for the subject and the Stealth Suit prototype long after the test was over.
0DI3001634	Frustrated and unable to find its lost technology, X-13 expanded its network of laser tripwires, sensors, and Robobrains out across Big MT.
0DI3001635	This glittering blue light beam forest cleanly bisected anything that entered its depths, slicing them into small, segmented parts for easy disposal.
0DI3001636	The infiltration program in X-13 felt spent, having repeatedly upgraded the Stealth Suit until it could upgrade it no more.
0DI3001637	It felt warm, fulfilled, and a bit sluggish. It realized not long after, the Stealth Suit had left it without so much as a note on the nightstand.
0DI3001638	So the infiltration program sent out Robobrains into the wastes looking for its wayward technology.
0DI3001639	It eventually found REPCONN HQ, and set up a new research center, testing and murdering Fiends who kept breaking into the facility.
0DI3001640	As the Courier made his way through the X-8 facility, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
0DI3001641	They eventually created new Cyberdogs to root out Commie traitors from the Wasteland... traitors like Betsy Bright... Richie Marcus...
0DI3001642	...although they couldn't seem to find any Commies, so they turned on themselves, howling sonic barks that echoed miles across the landscape.
0DI3001643	As the Courier ran through the X-8 facility multiple times, the computers analyzed the test subject's movements.
0DI3001644	Rather than performing a superficial observation, they realized the subject barely knew what Communism was - or even what a high school was.
0DI3001645	This confused them for a time, until the facility finally realized that its research had... succeeded.
0DI3001646	So it let its Cyberdogs out into the wastes to help protect small communities from physical aggression rather than communist propaganda.
0DI3001647	In the years before the Great War, Big Mountain had been the home to the brightest minds of the 21st century.
0DI3001648	Scientists of vision were drawn to the facility to tackle the greatest technological challenges of the era.
0DI3001649	They sought to create a new world, fueled by technology, for the benefit of all mankind.
0DI3001650	Sonic emitters, space age alloys, DNA hybridization, force field particle research, Auto-Doc advances in cranial, cardiac, and trauma surgery...
0DI3001651	...the hopes and dreams of a century became realities in the electronic forges of Big Mountain.
0DI3001652	The nucleus of this research was the Dome, a huge stone facility that held the labs of every science known to man.
0DI3001653	It was a think tank where no problem could not be solved, where no question could not be answered.
0DI3001654	The Great War brought a new energy to Big Mountain and its scientists.
0DI3001655	Although sheltered from the frontlines, the scientists waged their own war, fighting their battles at the atomic level.
0DI3001656	Equations and calculations marched endlessly across chalkboards and computer terminals toward one solution: Winning the war.
0DI3001657	For years, the minds and computers of Big Mountain were a blaze of trajectories, weapon schematics, and nuclear theories.
0DI3001658	The problems began to outpace the solutions, first geometrically, then exponentially. As the war escalated, so did the questions.
0DI3001659	On the night of October 23rd, 2077, the scientists received an answer that put all their questions to rest.
0DI3001660	In the aftermath, Big Mountain's silent experiments went to sleep, their creators slowly dying in the new world that had been left behind.
0DI3001661	And the great stone in the middle of the Big Empty lay untouched, filled with countless technological wonders...
0DI3001662	Wonders that, in the end, had been answers to the wrong question.
0DI3001664	-The Lobotomite is no proof against our amazing sensors!-
0DI3001665	Beginning dissection. And vivisection.
0DI3001666	*Remember that time I suggested we get bodyguards? Yeah, that woulda been nice, huh?*
0DI3001667	A challenge!
0DI3001668	You dare to cross Dr. Mobius!
0DI3001669	I will reduce you to atoms! I mean, a more chaotic, painful array of atoms.
0DI3001670	THINK TANK, FORM OF - TACTIC TRIANGLE!
0DI3001671	You're no match for the power of Mobius!
0DI3001672	Feel the wrath of the science of X-42!
0DI3001673	Attack!
0DI3001674	In the name of Dr. Mobius!
0DI3001675	Destroy the intruder, my minion!
0DI3001680	-The battle rages on!-
0DI3001681	I have discovered the teddy bear's hiding place.
0DI3001682	*O, I found it!*
0DI3001685	Attack routines loading.
0DI3001686	Did you really think you could escape Dr. Mobius?
0DI3001687	Oh, locking on. Good.
0DI3001688	Where the hell did it come from?
0DI3001689	These intruders are getting frustrating.
0DI3001693	Cancel the search routine already.
0DI3001694	Divert power from receptors to mobilizers.
0DI3001695	Back to your patrol routine, Robo-scorpion.
0DI3001700	-The Lobotomite is lost!-
0DI3001701	I believe we misplaced our test subject.
0DI3001702	*Don't you watch the old horror vids? There is no way we killed it. It's here, trust me.*
0DI3001703	By Jove's lugnuts, I need to get this monitor fixed.
0DI3001704	I CANNOT SEE THE INTRUDER ANYMORE.
0DI3001705	It was just here! Scan for it!
0DI3001706	Radar-scanning.
0DI3001707	Ping, ping, ping.
0DI3001708	What do you mean, you lost him? Look harder!
0DI3001713	The Lobotomite is lost!-
0DI3001715	*Hiding? That's what I want to do right now.*
0DI3001716	Hmph. Not very sporting.
0DI3001717	Wait for it to come to you, my pet.
0DI3001718	Oh, forget this.
0DI3001719	Not going to waste any more energy cells on this.
0DI3001720	Let's scuttle off, find something else to sting.
0DI3001724	HELLO. I MEAN NO HARM. ANY DEATH I BRING WILL BE SWIFT AND PAINLESS.
0DI3001725	COME OUT. UM. PLEASE.
0DI3001726	:: Whistles, as if trying to get someone to come out of hiding. ::
0DI3001731	Firing brainial beams and my spectral array of dissection lasers.
0DI3001732	*Blast it with our brainial beams already!*
0DI3001734	Tail locking on!
0DI3001735	Prepare to be attacked by Dr. Mobius!
0DI3001739	Think you could hide from me? Uh, again?
0DI3001740	AIGHH! THERE IT IS! KILL IT!
0DI3001741	LOBOTOMITE! GET THE SPRAY!
0DI3001742	Ah, there's our victim.
0DI3001744	The eye of Mobius sees you!
0DI3001745	Time for violence.
0DI3001749	Radar-scan successful. Target... acquired.
0DI3001750	Corpse-ify the intruder.
0DI3001751	I sense an intruder.
0DI3001752	Mobius to Robo-scorpion: Scan for unconfirmed target.
0DI3001753	If someone's out there, I, Dr. Mobius wish to say hello to you.
0DI3001754	Let's be friends, you and I.
0DI3001761	*Guess we can go back to our rooms and lock the doors now, huh?*
0DI3001762	Oh, well. Now I have this adrenaline rush that's going to make me loopy all day.
0DI3001763	WHEN I FIND IT, IT'S GOING IN THE SCHRODINGER BOX.
0DI3001764	Go back to patrol, you... piece of junk.
0DI3001765	STILL scanning.
0DI3001766	Need to calibrate these Robo-Sensors.
0DI3001767	Should invest in walking eyes.
0DI3001772	-What lurks in the darkness of the Think Tank?!-
0DI3001773	There is no movement I can detect. Not even a mouse.
0DI3001774	*What in the biologic fuck was that all about?*
0DI3001775	Did I imagine all this? Just like the tortoises.
0DI3001776	I SWEAR, SOMETHING'S WRONG.
0DI3001777	An intruder is here, I'm certain of it.
0DI3001778	Hmmm.
0DI3001779	All right, everyone, calm down. Might have been a blip.
0DI3001780	Are you sure you scanned something?
0DI3001785	-An UNPROVOKED attack! UNPROVOKED!-
0DI3001786	This seems a rather desperate cry for attention, my little teddy bear.
0DI3001788	My, is it vivisection time already?
0DI3001789	IT'S THE SCHRODINGER BOX FOR YOU.
0DI3001791	-The VICIOUS ATTACK ENDS... as quickly as it BEGAN!-
0DI3001792	If you want to attack me again, please fill out the proper forms - and wear gloves.
0DI3001793	*That wasn't very nice, bullying me like that.*
0DI3001794	Oh, you didn't mean to do that? Not to worry, all is forgiven, forgotten, and forbidden.
0DI3001795	WERE YOU JUST TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION?
0DI3001797	-Borous FALLS! The audience GASPS in TERROR!-
0DI3001798	I believe I'm dead or dying. No wait - I am dead.
0DI3001799	*O... My name... was Dr. Zero... Not O. Zero.*
0DI3001800	So that's what being killed feels like.
0DI3001801	Burble... Spark... Burble. And... So... I... Die.
0DI3001802	I... I REGRET... NOTHING!
0DI3001803	I DID IT ALL FOR... SCIENCE.
0DI3001804	You have GOT to be kidding me.
0DI3001805	There is no way this is happening.
0DI3001806	My calculations were perfect! There was no other outcome except success!
0DI3001807	Nooooooo!
0DI3001808	My Robo-scorpion!
0DI3001809	Ooooooh, you'll pay for this!
0DI3001813	<Large number of bones shattering>
0DI3001817	-The Lobotomite! It's exploding all over me!-
0DI3001818	There is a bomb here.
0DI3001819	Look - a bomb converging on my position.
0DI3001820	*Uh-O.*
0DI3001821	Stored energy combined with light, heat, sound, and pressure.
0DI3001822	You dare use physics?! Against me?
0DI3001823	KINETICALLY-CHARGED PROJECTILE!
0DI3001824	DETONATION IMMINENT!
0DI3001825	Explosives? Are you serious?
0DI3001826	Better get a nuke if you want to hurt my pet.
0DI3001827	Oh, crap.
0DI3001828	No one told me the target had bomb things!
0DI3001830	-There is no hope! Run for your intellect!-
0DI3001831	-We are powerless against its power!-
0DI3001832	I am currently fleeing. How exciting.
0DI3001833	*My self-preservation routine is circumventing my aggression protocols!*
0DI3001834	*My cowardice programming - it's kicking in.*
0DI3001835	Well, I've experimented with a frontal assault long enough.
0DI3001836	Time to debug my tactical routines.
0DI3001837	I WILL NOW USE ACCELERATION AND VELOCITY TO MY ADVANTAGE.
0DI3001838	RETREAT PROTOCOLS ENACTED.
0DI3001839	NEED TO REACH MY CHARGING STATION.
0DI3001842	-What is this unholy violence?!-
0DI3001843	-Such pain as I've never experienced!-
0DI3001844	-Ouch! STOP! Ow! OW.-
0DI3001845	I cannot believe you would hit a gender-neutral entity such as myself.
0DI3001846	This repeated hitting does not put you in a good light.
0DI3001847	Oh, god, yes, hit me. I love it!
0DI3001848	Unh! Treat me like a lab animal! Make me your teddy bear, pull my stuffing!
0DI3001849	*Not the monitors! Or the shell!*
0DI3001850	*Take my lunch money! Take it!*
0DI3001851	*Ooooooh, you're making me mad!*
0DI3001852	Is that pain I feel?
0DI3001853	That burns my biogel.
0DI3001854	If I lose another monitor...
0DI3001855	AIGH! MY TANK! IT PUT A DING IN IT!
0DI3001856	IT SCRATCHED MY TANK!
0DI3001857	IT'S FIGHTING BACK! IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT!
0DI3001858	STOP RESISTING!
0DI3001859	IT'S PRODUCING AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION!
0DI3001861	Ha-ha!
0DI3001862	Pitiful.
0DI3001863	Looking for a weak spot? There ARE NO WEAK SPOTS.
0DI3001864	You'll never disable me from the monitors around the room.
0DI3001865	Let's make this sporting.
0DI3001866	Defiant to the end.
0DI3001868	Stop that! You'll damage the hull.
0DI3001869	Oh, hit my Robo-scorpion, will you?
0DI3001870	Destroy this one, I'll make more.
0DI3001879	<Soft sound of a bone cracking>
0DI3001884	-Witness - POWER!-
0DI3001885	Setting vivisectors on "full invasive."
0DI3001886	*Increase to maximum brainial beam vibration.*
0DI3001887	*Focusing my pain lens!*
0DI3001888	*OOOOoooooOOOOOO*
0DI3001889	This next attack is just what the doctor ordered.
0DI3001890	You want POWER? I'll give you POWER.
0DI3001891	WanWANWan
0DI3001892	CHARGING!
0DI3001893	FIRING! WOOOOOOOOOOO
0DI3001894	WANwanWANwanWANwanWAN
0DI3001895	Focus the atomic laser stinger. Full power!
0DI3001896	Laser stinger - fire!
0DI3001897	Sting the pest!
0DI3001898	Laser sting!
0DI3001899	Feel the full power of my Robo-scorpion's arsenal.
0DI3001900	Sting them, my pets! Sting them stupid!
0DI3001901	Activating special attack routine.
0DI3001906	<Large number of bones rattling loudly>
0DI3001913	-An attack in the Dome - from BEYOND the Dome!-
0DI3001914	-The Lobotomite! It has COME for us!-
0DI3001915	-I will unleash the incredible power of our atomic attacks!-
0DI3001916	I'm going to rip out your stuffing, little teddy bear.
0DI3001917	You're going on a ride on the giggle bus.
0DI3001918	I will blast you back to 2060.
0DI3001919	*I am so going to attack this target with my weapons.*
0DI3001920	*I don't even know what my weapons do.*
0DI3001921	*O my, that's what my attack protocols feel like.*
0DI3001922	*Let's gang up on it! Guys? Anyone?*
0DI3001923	*If we scare it, maybe it'll give up!*
0DI3001924	AttackinG. With a capital G.
0DI3001925	If a protracted battle is what you desire, so be it.
0DI3001926	I attack you. Oh, yes, attack. You.
0DI3001927	So, you think you're a match for Science?! You two couldn't possibly have a relationship, you have nothing in common.
0DI3001928	You've made Science mad! Very mad, indeed.
0DI3001929	HOW DO YOU FIRE THIS THING?
0DI3001930	AIGHHHH! KILL IT! KILL IT!
0DI3001931	DOES THIS WEAPON HAVE SOFT LOCK? ANYONE?
0DI3001932	BEHOLD THE POWER OF - SCIENCE!
0DI3001933	You can't avoid the deadly laser sting of Dr. Mobius.
0DI3001934	This is a pre-recorded attack message indicating my desire to commit violence on you.
0DI3001935	Crush them with your pincers!
0DI3001936	X-42, attack, in the name of Mobius!
0DI3001938	Robo-scorpion, attack!
0DI3001939	Go, my minion, sting them in the name of all that is Mobius.
0DI3001940	I see you. Now, I end you.
0DI3001941	You're no match for Science!
0DI3001946	Hey! Who turned out the lights?
0DI3001947	<Small number of bones rattling>
0DI3001955	THAT RESPONSE SEEMED DEMANDING, AS IF CUTTING TO THE CASE. UH... CHASE. HOW SURGICAL. REMINDS ME OF...
0DI3001956	Really? Oh... you're not thinking about doing it, you are going to do it.
0DI3001957	Oh, intriguing. I've never been killed before. Although after that time I got that phlegmy discharge in my biogel... I wished I had been.
0DI3001958	Well, if there's going to be killing, I defer to your expertise in this matter.
0DI3001959	How should we begin? Engineered viruses? Canceratic beams? Atomics? Electrocutioning? Or... should I summon my minions...? Yes, my minions.
0DI3001963	Sure. Nobody wants to hang out with Muggy. I get it. So long, pal.
0DI3001964	Well, I'll be right here if you change your mind.
0DI3001965	Hurry back with that seed now, baby.
0DI3001966	Stay loyal, Citizen!
0DI3001967	Catch you later, gator.
0DI3001968	Certainly. I'm looking forward to it.
0DI3001969	Bye now!
0DI3001970	Yes! Flee before my terrible power!
0DI3001971	Barring the unlikely event that I evolve some sort of rocket-propelled locomotion, I will be here.
0DI3001972	YES. A MOST GOOD BYE.
0DI3001973	Indeed, the uh... goodbye part of our little chat, then. Uh... Goodbye. Please mind the equations on the floor.
0DI3001974	Until our next interaction, my intriguing little Lobotomite.
0DI3001975	-Until NEXT time, then! Provided there IS a next time. For ANY of us!-
0DI3001977	*Until our next scheduled audio transmission and reception, then.*
0DI3001978	<Bark. Bark.>
0DI3001980	I come in peace, visitor. Take me to... Oh. That's your line isn't it?
0DI3001981	Yellow. Uh... Hallow. No, wait, uh... oh, hello. Yes, that's it.
0DI3001982	So nice seeing you again - for perhaps the first time.
0DI3001983	I CAN HEAR YOUR PENIS-TIPPED FEET TROMPING AROUND.
0DI3001984	HAVE YOU DONE ALL WE ASKED? IF NOT, WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO ASK AGAIN.
0DI3001985	THE ONE WHO DEFENDED US FROM MOBIUS. HELLO.
0DI3001986	If it isn't the fascinating little Lobotomite.
0DI3001987	I love to hear you breathe.
0DI3001988	If it isn't the beautiful ping of my radar-scan picking up a heroic Lobotomite.
0DI3001989	-The Lobotomite! Has it come for HELLOS? You'll get no such satisfaction from ME.-
0DI3001990	-Have you come for HELLO? Oh, I'll give you a HELLO. A HELLO unsurpassed in all creation!-
0DI3001991	-The ONE who SAVED us! To you, I bestow a hello. Hello.-
0DI3001995	*Stop hovering. I mean, if you want.*
0DI3001996	*I don't understand how you can stand those leg things.*
0DI3001997	*Thanks for helping us. Don't get a big head or anything, even if I am insanely jealous.*
0DI3001998	The teddy bear Lobotomite returns... my teddy bear. How can I assist in relieving your curiosity?
0DI3001999	You should really see Dr. Klein. We're all awaiting the results of your experiment.
0DI3002000	You are an unusual specimen to so boldly... walk... into the mighty expanse of the Think Tank. Fearless and proud as a teddy bear.
0DI3002001	Between the extraction of their higher reasoning abilities and urination-inducing fear, most Lobotomites dare not approach us. Let alone speak to us.
0DI3002002	Yet you have no such fear, facing me, epidermis flushed with blood, plasma running molten beneath, your face contorting with... muscular expression.
0DI3002003	Will you... indulge me? Say a... few words? Face towards the monitors, please... so that I might record it... for further examination.
0DI3002004	And you return, as curious as a teddy bear. Are you stuck in a looping gesture of greeting?
0DI3002005	-The Lobotomite who SAVED us! Hello.-
0DI3002006	-Klein AWAITS! As do we all.-
0DI3002007	-The LOBOTOMITE animal before me! What other terrifying terrors will plague us in our quest for knowledge? Communists? Communist ANIMALS, perhaps?-
0DI3002008	-Be warned, attempt to propaganda ME, I will shriek as a frightened babe, calling loyal Cyberdogs to my aid. Do you comprehend, Commie animal?-
0DI3002009	-Thanks SO much for sparing Gabe - I know he's really QUITE killable, which is why I had to AUGMENT him.-
0DI3002010	-But you needed NONE of that. You're QUITE elusive - or fleet-footed. More so than our old mailman - HE didn't get far before Gabe caught him.-
0DI3002011	-SO - you put down Gabe. Thank you - a scamp, but really, his highly-augmented combat programming could have proved meddlesome.-
0DI3002012	-In any event... thank you for putting him down. One LESS test subject to catalogue and sort - clearly a FAILURE of doggie cybo-engineering.-
0DI3002013	-The LOBOTOMITE returns! What insidious plan can it have brewing in its horrid mind? What Commie anti-American propaganda will it spew?-
0DI3002018	*So was Mobius as twisted as he looked in person? Can't believe you entered the Forbidden Zone and lived. None of us can.*
0DI3002019	*Any new research?*
0DI3002020	*Klein's an impatient man, wouldn't keep him waiting.*
0DI3002021	*Breaking News: Talking Lobotomite arrives in Think Tank. Its purpose? Unknown. Undefinable. Its presence here? Unpossible.*
0DI3002022	*Predictable. The Lobotomite specimen returns. Its purpose? Repetition. Chances of success? High.*
0DI3002024	THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE HELPING, THAT IS. WE LIKE THAT.
0DI3002025	I FEEL AN ODD EMOTION... PLATITUDE? ATTITUDE? NO, WAIT. GRATITUDE, THAT'S IT.
0DI3002026	WE ARE LABORING AWAY SCIENTIFICALLY ON YOUR BEHALF. TOILLESS RESEARCHERS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE. TOIL. TOIL. TOIL.
0DI3002027	THE LOBOTOMITE RETURNS. OUR LOBOTOMITE. HAS DR. MOBIUS BEEN DENOMINATORED INTO SCRAP METAL AND VOICE MODULE PARTS AS WE HOPED?
0DI3002028	WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK? MOBIUS' THREATS PERSIST! WORSE, HE'S FILLING UP OUR TRANSMISSION STORAGE HOLOTAPE TO CAPACITY!
0DI3002029	I THOUGHT I HEARD THE PACIFICATION FIELD KICK IN. ALL RIGHT, SHHH. NOBODY. MOVE. I'LL HANDLE THIS.
0DI3002030	BE WARNED, INTRUDER! YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MIGHTY THINK TANK OF BIG MT, THE COLLECTIVE GENIUSES OF... WE...
0DI3002031	...BY OPPENHEIMER, WHICH ONE OF YOU SELF-PROFESSED GENIUSES HAS BEEN ADJUSTING MY VOLUME KNOB? WHO WAS IT?! WAS IT YOU, 8?
0DI3002032	MOBIUS. ALWAYS THE SAME BROADCAST. HE'S CLEARLY MAD, DRIVEN INSANE BY HIS FLAWED AND IMPRECISE KINDERGARTEN-LEVEL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY.
0DI3002033	DID YOU RETRIEVE THE TECHNOLOGIES YET? WE NEED THEM, AS I HAVE INDICATED.
0DI3002034	LOBOTOMITE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? CAN YOU SPEAK?
0DI3002035	Look at the way the tongue rolls in its mouth like some sort of... mucousy muscled worm.
0DI3002036	YOU. LOBOTOMITE WHO UNDERSTANDS US. I AM DR. KLEIN. DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED. WE ARE BENEV... ER, MEAN YOU NO HARM.
0DI3002037	-Our efforts have turned against us! In playing GOD, we created a MONSTER!-
0DI3002038	Perhaps as we were ruthlessly lobotimizing it with our cutters, we filled this skinevelope with... awareness. A teddy bear with new stuffing.
0DI3002039	*Wait. If what you're theorizing is this Lobotomite understands us... can reason with us...*
0DI3002040	THEN THIS MAY BE JUST THE ANSWER WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. AT LAST, A CHANCE TO...
0DI3002043	OH, "DR. O," WAS IT? LIKELY STORY, O COULDN'T SPARK TWO NEURONS IF THEY WERE IN A LATTICE OF BIOMED GEL.
0DI3002044	*What? Me? Breaking news, Klein, it wasn't me - all right?! I am the robotical engineer, 8 is soundwaves, that's his "specialty."*
0DI3002045	*You always do this, you always demean me in front of guests! And it's not "O," all right, it's...!*
0DI3002046	ENOUGH! EITHER OF YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME. NOW... NOW...
0DI3002047	...GREAT. NOW I FORGOT WHAT I WAS SAYING... WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT?
0DI3002048	-It's a LOBOTOMITE. Here! In the DOME!-
0DI3002049	OH, AS IF THIS SITUATION COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE, NOW WE'VE GOT LOBOTOMITES. DALA, GET THE SPRAY BEFORE IT EXCRETES ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
0DI3002052	-Dr. Klein! A TRANSMISSION from the FORBIDDEN Zone! Coming right at US!-
0DI3002053	IT CAN ONLY BE...
0DI3002054	Dr. Klein... if my hypothesis is correct, this Lobotomite is the repository of the brain we sent the signal to - the skinvelope once containing it.
0DI3002055	If so, it's proof that there may indeed be something beyond the Crater.
0DI3002056	Just look at it... the way it blinks. It's like a big hairless teddy bear.
0DI3002057	I KNOW WHAT IT IS, DALA, I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT'S DOWN HERE. WITH ITS... ITS LIMBS ALL OVER EVERYTHING.
0DI3002058	AND... ARE THOSE... PENISES I SEE WRIGGLING ON ITS FEET? DISGUSTING.
0DI3002059	I believe those are toes, Dr. Klein. Little teddy bear toes. Penises are much larger than those tiny extremities... Eh, not that I would know.
0DI3002060	*I don't recall the human penis ever being that large.*
0DI3002061	It depends on one's own frame of reference, Doctor O. Look at its little nose with its two orifices for ingesting oxygen.
0DI3002062	NOSES? BY THE GREAT STATIC, THESE LOBOTOMITES CONFOUND ME WITH THEIR SHEER NUMBER OF USELESS EXTREMITIES.
0DI3002063	-Dr. Klein! Look at it, its head movements, the primitive jelly eye-monitors!-
0DI3002064	I agree with Borous' histrionic findings. This little Lobotomite is unusually attentive for something whose brain has been extracted.
0DI3002065	NONSENSE. LOBOTOMITES CAN'T COMPREHEND US.
0DI3002067	*8, have you been in the Mentats again? If we slow down our auro-processo-receptors to understand this excretion, we'll all be rendered ignorant!*
0DI3002068	ALL OF YOU, POWER DOWN, SHUT UP, AND LET ME PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW WRONG YOU ALL ARE. AS USUAL.
0DI3002069	Oh, I see you and your Brain reached a compromise. How pleasant.
0DI3002070	I hypothesize after the indignant frequencies my receptors had... recepted, such a partnership-based conclusion would be... low on the "likely" scale.
0DI3002071	Mmm? Y... oh... hello there. Eh... you... are there, aren't you? Forgive my confusion, so hard to tell these days.
0DI3002072	You seem familiar, somehow. I'm guessing... eh... you're here for your brain, perhaps? It's just up there. Such a nice brain, young, very bright.
0DI3002073	A little hard to see you, can you walk into my left... er, right FOV cone? Ah, that's it, you're coming into focus nicely.
0DI3002074	I'm having the most peculiar feeling of Deja vu right now. That's French, for... eh... well, uh... Deja vu, I believe. Have we met before?
0DI3002077	Go on, go on! You've wasted enough of my valuable time.
0DI3002078	Well? What are you waiting for? Get moving and leave me in peace.
0DI3002079	No time to waste! Go deal with the Think Tank!
0DI3002080	Oh! Don't worry about me. We can talk more when we're both back at the Sink.
0DI3002081	I'll see you at the Sink. Good luck.
0DI3002082	Ugh! It's bad enough the indignities you've put me through, must you continue to prattle on at me?
0DI3002083	Nice to see you back. I trust the adventuring is going well.
0DI3002084	Oh, it's you again. What do you want?
0DI3002085	Well, well, look who finally dragged themselves in out of the Wasteland. And where have we been, hmm? Crawling through pits of radioactive muck again?
0DI3002086	Ah, the meat has returned. Lovely.
0DI3002088	Mmm... You took care of them brains pretty good, baby. Nice.
0DI3002089	Always nice to see you, baby. Bring me any new plants from outside?
0DI3002090	Ooh... oh yeah, baby, feels good to be on-line again! Yeah, all circuits on-line... ready to receive your seed.
0DI3002091	You got some plants for me, don't you? Yeah, I can smell it all over you.
0DI3002092	Well, hello! Still waiting for that seed.
0DI3002093	You're back! And the brains didn't lobotomize you! Well, not any worse, at least. Hooray!
0DI3002094	It was getting lonely without you here. Clean, eh, but lonely.
0DI3002095	Oh God, look at you! You're... filthy. I suppose you'll... want to clean up then?
0DI3002096	You've been working with that Biological Research Station, haven't you? I suppose you'll want to... clean up?
0DI3002097	Between you and me, I think the Central Intelligence Unit is a bit of a snob.
0DI3002098	Why, you poor dear! Come over here and have a drink, wash off some of that... horrible, sticky... blood.
0DI3002099	Well, hello there! Can I get you a drink?
0DI3002100	I trust matters regarding your brain were resolved to your satisfaction?
0DI3002101	If you're planning to stay a while, I could see clear to giving you a once-over.
0DI3002102	Hmph... well how about that? Old Auto-Doc's back on-line. Well, all right, come here, let's have a look at you.
0DI3002103	You require some additional services?
0DI3002104	You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's missing.
0DI3002105	Better climb in and let me have a look see.
0DI3002106	You got yourself some serious hurts there, friend. Cracked patella, two bruised ribs, and if I ain't mistaken, your brain's recently been replaced.
0DI3002108	Well, you ain't the fittest horse that ever ran a race, but you don't appear in immediate danger of keeling over. I can patch you up if you want.
0DI3002109	You are, without a doubt, the healthiest son of a bitch I've ever seen wandering the Big Empty. Ain't got no use for an old digital sawbones like me.
0DI3002110	There now. As good as God ever made you. You just mind you keep that leg out of any radioactive waste, and rub liniment on it twice a day.
0DI3002111	I never trusted those Think Tank brains. Gave off a stench like ivory tower elitism. And brine.
0DI3002112	Welcome home, Citizen! Find any seditious materials out there?
0DI3002113	Ah! Good day, Citizen! Library Processing Unit 232.7 is on-line and ready to eradicate sedition!
0DI3002114	Greetings, Citizen! Ready to receive seditious materials!
0DI3002115	Might I be safe in the assumption that matters with the Think Tank have been satisfactorily concluded, vis-a-vis your residence in this domicile?
0DI3002116	Will sir be staying for any considerable length of time during sir's visit?
0DI3002117	Salutations and felicitations, sir, and a most jocund welcome to the Sink.
0DI3002118	I am your electronic valet and household central processor. May I be of service, sir?
0DI3002119	Might I be of service, sir?
0DI3002120	Please, please, please tell me you stomped Dr. O's brain into a fine paste! Did he squeal? Did he beg? God, I hope he begged!
0DI3002121	Who's the flatware bitch now, O?!
0DI3002122	I hate myself for asking this, but... did you bring me any new mugs?
0DI3002123	You! Hey, you! Yeah you! Got any mugs?
0DI3002124	Oh please, please tell me you brought me some coffee cups!
0DI3002125	With the brains dealt with, soon we can spread our rule across the Mojave! All will eat burned toast and despair!
0DI3002126	While you were away, my plans have marched steadily forward. Beware, Caesar! Beware, NCR! Soon will dawn the Age of the Toaster!
0DI3002127	Ahahaha! I am on-line once again! Tremble, world, before my electric heating coil of doom!
0DI3002128	Yes! Yes! Soon my work will be complete! Soon the world will burn in nuclear fire!
0DI3002129	Got any more sweet, innocent little kitchen appliances for me?
0DI3002130	You out-brained the big brains? That is so... hot!
0DI3002131	Ooh, you're back! I missed you!
0DI3002132	Ooh, you're back! I missed you! Unlike some frigid bitches I could name.
0DI3002133	Mmm... that was a nice little, uh, catnap. How long was I out?
0DI3002134	You've been seeing the other light switch, haven't you? Am I not enough for you any more?
0DI3002135	Oh, you're back. Did that trampy other light switch finally kick you to the curb?
0DI3002137	Hi again, sweetie!
0DI3002138	I understand you're to be congratulated on the recovery of your missing organs. Bravo.
0DI3002139	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again.
0DI3002140	I'm glad to see you've decided to visit again. I hope it's not to see that useless little strumpet.
0DI3002141	Oh my. Partial functionality restored - that's less than optimal.
0DI3002142	How can I illuminate you?
0DI3002143	So you beat the big brains at their own game, huh? Guess you'll be putting your walking shoes on again, hitting that old lonesome road.
0DI3002144	Look who's back to kick off the dust. Hope you ain't still singing them Old World Blues.
0DI3002145	Ooh-ee! Yeah, dig that sweet music! Damn, it's good to be back on-line!
0DI3002146	What's the haps?

0DI4000016	Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is NCR Trooper Gleeson calling anyone listening on this channel.
0DI4000017	My platoon has been wiped out, and I am pinned down by a goddamn huge Deathclaw in a place called the Divide!
0DI4000018	So far I've been able to scare it away with flares, but I lack any explosives to kill the damn thing! Please assist! I say again, please assist!
0DI4000027	<Confirmatory beeping>
0DI4000029	<Inquisitive beeping>
0DI4000030	[SUCCEEDED] No... no, I couldn't. And I'm thinking you can't kill me, either. If you did, you'd answer for it, just as I would.
0DI4000031	Let the land do the killing for you, that's one of the things you taught me.
0DI4000032	Killing is personal - so's vows, promises. Last bit's more important to me than the first.
0DI4000033	[FAILED] Talking... words won't settle this. The Road will. And the end.
0DI4000034	A question one could have asked you not long ago, before walking the road West into the storms.
0DI4000035	Need to be here, see what was done. It's custom of the Bear to never see the marks it claws in the land... not my custom.
0DI4000036	Maybe that's why you've come, too - need to see where the missile from Ashton touched ground down below, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
0DI4000037	Need to be here, see what was done. In the Divide, in Hopeville... the Courier's Mile.
0DI4000038	No, opposite of that. It's where my tribe was taken. Where another history was put to the blade, lesson taught.
0DI4000039	It is where we realized Vulpes did not approach us as equals. Where we realized the wolf had come, and we watched our history die.
0DI4000040	Now it belongs to Legion... and all the death there now belongs to them as well. Not revenge... just the way of things when you own them.
0DI4000041	No damage done, not yet. Maybe in years. Keeps the Bear fenced... if Caesar can't drive it back, fire might.
0DI4000042	Only delays the end for the Bull, a new wall for them to scale and cross... once they're done with the Mojave. And Hoover Dam.
0DI4000043	Never again do you or any other courier and caravan need walk that route. Let the Mojave breathe without that asphalt scar raking it.
0DI4000044	Name's died twice to history. If the West thanks you... the East won't, in time. Fall apart, back to the tribes, maybe.
0DI4000046	Let's see what gifts the Mojave has for us.
0DI4000047	Let's make something new from the old.
0DI4000048	Not a camp - vigil, maybe. Never claimed it as mine. If anyone owns the Divide... your claim is stronger than mine.
0DI4000049	Don't feel like adding a campfire to the ones that already burn below. If you brought Mojave gifts, might be able to shape something for the road.
0DI4000050	Depends what history has to say about them. There's a lot the land can provide... if you know the road that led to it.
0DI4000051	Mojave's got ways of healing most ills - if not, some tribe's usually found a way you didn't expect.
0DI4000052	Like Healing Powders. Tribes back West only use Xander and Broc flower. There's a way the Twin Mothers in the East used to brew it, though.
0DI4000053	Called it Bitter Drink, mixed up the Xander and Broc in a bottle, added some kick to it so your head doesn't get all clouded.
0DI4000054	Antivenom's helpful around the Mojave with the Bark scorpions. Even one sting can kill you. Tunneler bite can be just as bad.
0DI4000055	My tribe, Twisted Hairs, had a better way than Antivenom, if you act fast.
0DI4000056	Snakebite Tourniquet - cuts off the venom, no need to scavenge glands and blood. Or drink that mess.
0DI4000057	Part of the reason we wore our hair like we did, like I do now.
0DI4000058	Here's some for the road - trick to making it's not hard. Get bit, hook and twist it. Fast as blinking, doesn't give poison time to sink in.
0DI4000059	Nothing more than I've already shared. We'll have to keep with what we know. Tired of history's lessons, anyway.
0DI4000060	Didn't think I'd be breathing to hear you say that. Message isn't important, meaning is.
0DI4000061	Had to speak of it, in case the words got lost in paper, ink, or other's voices. Maybe even yours, in time.
0DI4000062	Still, meant for you. Courier to Courier. Belongs to you now, or history. Doesn't matter.
0DI4000063	House spoke, acted through machines. Sometimes can judge a man by his messengers. Sometimes the messengers judge him.
0DI4000064	Wonder what happens to Vegas now. The tribes - families. We'll see.
0DI4000066	Nothing but wind, sand... ash. More may reveal itself in time, not now.
0DI4000067	If you're determined, return, might be something new surfaces.
0DI4000068	Wind and blood has uncovered more beneath the soil.
0DI4000069	If you want these Old World relics, they're yours... better you carry them than the Marked Men.
0DI4000070	Walk there sometimes, keep the walks short. Still... it's important to see. Something else to answer for.
0DI4000071	Occasionally sift through the dust, the buildings... see if I can find some history. Marks of America.
0DI4000072	If you want them, keep them... you've earned it. Nothing to be gained by me holding them, and more will surface in time.
0DI4000073	[SUCCEEDED] Words aren't the only way couriers meet... sometimes it's the paths we walk. But no... we've never spoken before now.
0DI4000074	[FAILED] I know you. What we have in common, though, isn't in the words we traded.
0DI4000076	Careful, Tommy - I've never seen a robot like that before. It might be dangerous.
0DI4000077	I don't know, son... what if someone comes looking for it?

0DI4000150	You may not know my voice, but we've walked the same places. The Long 15 to Primm... that wasn't the only road you ever walked.
0DI4000151	I've been to your home, the place you kept returning to... may not be the place you were born, was the place you gave life to, same thing.
0DI4000152	People forget couriers can keep communities alive... until the day they're gone, and their breath catches in their throat.
0DI4000153	For now, eyes alert, watch the streets below. There's still life in the Divide - threats other than the storms and wind... new inhabitants.
0DI4000154	RALPHIE, hurry! If mean old General Winters catches you, you'll never make it home!

0DI4000177	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Casting off your disguise... yet you carried that Chip, determined to take it to Vegas... not Caesar.
0DI4000178	You and that Chip deserve each other, 29 fewer coins than other traitors have carried, by history's mark.
0DI4000179	For now - find the trigger for the warheads, buried in Hopeville. Use it to keep moving... and keep alive.
0DI4000180	They'll start emerging throughout the Mojave in time, might be years. Probably less.
0DI4000181	They breed fast, hunt in groups, more than enough to bring down the strongest in the Mojave. Once they draw blood...
0DI4000182	Seen them tear apart Deathclaws... Deathclaw might get some, but the rest will swarm it, tear it apart, like Denver hounds.
0DI4000183	Walked the East, too, before the Bull came. Then... much like the Mojave before the Bear... tribes, towns, clutching to life. Bull did a better job.
0DI4000184	[SUCCEEDED] <Pleased beeping>
0DI4000186	I'm a courier. Courier Six... was Courier Six. Like you - and not like you, in all the ways that matter.
0DI4000187	Spent too many years looking for you - now, letting you come to me.
0DI4000188	Thought carrying that Chip would end you, no... you got lives in you, hard to kill. Storms, bullets... sand and wind, yet still you walk. For now.
0DI4000189	The idea of a machine bearing a message new to you? Thought that was how House relayed all his messages... through his robots.
0DI4000190	The machine... the robot. No, not Legion... less history than that.
0DI4000191	The robot with you... all of them are machines - radios, Old World tech reshaped with new hands. Historians. Couriers, carrying messages.
0DI4000192	Seen them as I've walked the Divide, tending other machines. That one... sealed inside the Hopeville silo. Sign America is waking up.
0DI4000193	It will follow you, obey you. Carry it until we are face to face, then there'll be no more need for it to carry my words.
0DI4000194	[SUCCEEDED] America sleeps in the Divide - giants, beneath the earth. You saw one locked in the silo beneath you. There's more.
0DI4000195	Only takes a few of them, locked below ground, to tear apart the earth... and cast dust, sand... ash... into the skies above.
0DI4000196	[FAILED] Wasn't always like this. Old World wreckage's nothing new... after that, something you had your hand in - you'll walk it soon enough.
0DI4000197	The Divide... this place is a slice of it. Old military. Can still smell the pride - and the fear.
0DI4000198	Hope of the Old World, wrapped in fencing, covered in storm. Got new inhabitants now other than ghosts, more recent... recruits.
0DI4000199	If you saw their corpses, you saw mercy. Got what they deserved, coming to the Divide.
0DI4000200	The Bear and Bull - NCR, Legion - came in waves. Before. And after. Right into the invisible fires... the wind, ground... collapsing beneath them.
0DI4000201	Once under different flags, now they are equal in their hatred of the trespassers. You and I.
0DI4000202	America sleeps ahead of you, its nightmares filled with quakes, storms. You'll need to find your own path.
0DI4000203	That means waking America's spears up from their slumber. There's ways - warheads set off the collapse, warheads could open the gates again.
0DI4000204	You're resourceful. That machine, robot with you - can help you find the warheads you need to destroy... and their trigger, the detonator.
0DI4000205	The way ahead is below. The tools are there. The rest - up to you.
0DI4000206	Tunnelers. Predators that make their own roads beneath the ground here.
0DI4000207	Divide broke their sky, showed them the world above - and the scent of new prey.
0DI4000208	Be a slower death for the Mojave than bombs and fire... but they'll come for its people, from where they least expect - below.
0DI4000209	No Courier would go to the Divide... but you will. And that's what sets us apart - we walk roads no other Courier will walk.
0DI4000210	And for you... you'll want to see your home one last time, see what happened.
0DI4000211	You're curious. You walk, leave ruin in your path... you can't leave alone. Still, the choice is yours... what I offer, it's the last I offer you.
0DI4000212	I don't care if you walk the Divide. Turn, walk the Mojave, fight beneath the flags... but you'll wonder.
0DI4000213	If you don't, the Divide will come to you, and the Mojave. That will be my message to you, like the message you had for me.
0DI4000214	The Divide will send its worst against you - it may break you. We'll see if you're stronger.
0DI4000215	Road gets rougher from here... Courier. Left marks for you, colors'll tell the way - if you're smart.
0DI4000216	They'll lead you to your home one more time, lead to the ending of it - maybe remind you why you wander.
0DI4000217	You haven't seen enough of the Legion yet to see what they worship... what they hold on to, even after what happened to them.
0DI4000218	They bear false versions of Legate Lanius' mask, the one Caesar fashioned for him. Thought it was an insult at first.... know better now.
0DI4000219	It's shaped from Divide metal, not with care and strength, but with hate. Keeps them anchored.
0DI4000220	Crude, effective - like the blades they carry, distant mirrors of their Legate. A symbol they can hold on to - while the Divide tears at them.
0DI4000221	You see true. Not scavengers... it's what they wore before this all happened.
0DI4000222	Pain makes for strange allies... the hate the Bear and Bull shared across the battlefield, now turned against the Divide. Few survived... intact.
0DI4000223	Many NCR were already here when the destruction happened. Keeping the route East open, in fear of Caesar. Fear of the Legion.
0DI4000224	At the end of the High Road lies Ashton - its silo.
0DI4000225	That machine with you, it can open it, wake it up, like it did the one in Hopeville.
0DI4000226	[SUCCEEDED] Death'll come from below. In the Divide, need to watch the sky and ground... Mojave'll be easy prey for them.
0DI4000227	[FAILED] Mojave needs to survive itself first... does that, Tunnelers will be next on the list.
0DI4000228	[SUCCEEDED] Maybe not. Who's to say.
0DI4000229	You, perhaps. Found them, heard them after I cast them aside - maybe there was purpose in that.
0DI4000230	If they matter... if history matters... we'll see at the end of the road.
0DI4000231	[FAILED] Words lost to history. Wouldn't have left them on the road otherwise.
0DI4000232	I know that now. Doesn't change what was done. The Legion who died here.
0DI4000233	Even if you were Legion, you would answer for those deaths by Caesar's law.
0DI4000234	As I said before... it's of no consequence. Never intended you to find them, never intended you to hear them.
0DI4000235	Questions in those tapes I still haven't found answers to. You won't be the one to give them.
0DI4000236	Should've died there... but now that I know you live... the machines here... saved me. I was the only survivor, or thought I was.
0DI4000237	Your package, the message inside, awoke medical machines... close to the one that shadows you... began to build themselves, then others.
0DI4000238	They only take what parts they find in the Divide, never roam beyond it - can't even leave the silos without a human to shadow, like hounds.
0DI4000239	Maybe they saw the flag on my jacket, thought I was of America. If so, history saved me. A sign.
0DI4000240	At the end of the Divide, through the trenches and wreckage - that's where you'll find me. My new home, here, amongst dead men.
0DI4000241	You and that machine, keep your eyes on the tower that cuts the horizon... you'll find your way. Made it this far... not much farther to go.
0DI4000242	You delivered a package. Had markings that matched those in the Divide. Not all... but enough.
0DI4000243	Military markings, from some place the Bear had savaged in the West. Maybe seeing those markings on it reminded you of home... made you carry it.
0DI4000244	An ending. To this road, you and I. First, you need to find your way. At the end, I'll be waiting.
0DI4000245	These new inhabitants... not natives... most of them. Came with duty, purpose... ready to kill each other. The Divide was stronger.
0DI4000246	Left marks on them, too. Not Bear, not Bull - now... radiation's marked them, made them equal in history's eyes.
0DI4000247	As vicious as the storms are, these shadows of Legion, of NCR - silhouettes of things to come.
0DI4000248	Might have been. Once. To the Divide they came... in the Divide, they rest.
0DI4000250	Meant to? No. Never. Your burden.
0DI4000251	Weigh you down long enough to let death catch up to you... but you survived.
0DI4000252	There was death in that package, and while the Chip is important to Old World ghosts... no, you are more dangerous than that Chip ever could be.
0DI4000253	Maybe why you found each other, little piece of the Old World, speaking to you, waiting for you to wake something else up with it.
0DI4000254	We all have death following us, only a question of how close. You dodged it - for a time. You're good at that, talent for it.
0DI4000255	With that Chip weighing you down... a burden, lets death move a little faster without me pulling the trigger.
0DI4000256	Promises to keep. To others. And the Mojave's dangerous enough - left to the land, the land has its way.
0DI4000257	If I wanted you dead, we would have met sooner. Not sure that's the way this ends.
0DI4000258	Might be that history needs to have its say. If not, then messages will do.
0DI4000259	Even as the fires here burned them from within... the winds of the Divide tore their skin, exposed them... screaming... to the sky.
0DI4000260	And just as the Divide tears at them, so they tear at each other, for sport - like some tribal scarification. Falling back to their history, maybe.
0DI4000261	No matter what they suffer... the radiation, fire of the Divide, sustains them. Makes them stronger.
0DI4000262	[SUCCEEDED] There's truth in your words, in what I've seen of their tactics, movements - recovery. Those wounds - they couldn't live otherwise.
0DI4000263	The Divide winds have torn the skin from many of them - may be the radiation is the only thing keeping them walking.
0DI4000264	Make camp near silos... warheads. No way to cleanse the radiation - makes them hard to kill there, have to draw them out.
0DI4000265	[FAILED] They're more beasts than men now. They clutch at their pain as they clutch at their weapons... anchors them.
0DI4000272	You'll see the extent - the miles of it, soon enough. You need to see it... walk it.
0DI4000274	For the two-headed Bear... NCR... they don't have symbols in the same way Legion does.
0DI4000275	They revere their mines and explosives, guns... that is their religion - death from afar, take pride in it.
0DI4000276	Not my given name, close enough.
0DI4000277	Took it from history, found it in a book. It's an Old World name.
0DI4000278	Ulysses lived a long time ago, long before the Old World set fire to itself. He made a mark without being myth.
0DI4000279	Had to fight during a time when his world had two flags, and he had to make them one.
0DI4000280	[SUCCEEDED] History. Yes.
0DI4000281	Ulysses walked a hard road. A general, like Caesar and Oliver. He was Brahmin-stubborn, gave him strength on the battlefield.
0DI4000282	He led his side to victory, turned two flags into one. That's when he lost - when the fighting was done, the sickness took hold.
0DI4000283	Lesson there, if history's to be believed. One you should heed.
0DI4000284	[FAILED] Search history, might find meaning in it.
0DI4000285	It's just a name - you have no idea who I am. You'll know by the end.
0DI4000286	[SUCCEEDED] War. Call it that. Our part in it.
0DI4000287	Ulysses wasn't made for the flag he followed. He wasn't made for peace. That's the lesson.
0DI4000288	If you follow a symbol to the end, ask yourself what that means. More important, ask what happens after the end.
0DI4000289	[FAILED] Fighting? Yes... but different weapons than you're used to.
0DI4000290	You're wasting time. Stalling. Won't help you.
0DI4000291	What kind of world would this be if Courier killed Courier.
0DI4000292	You've got enough distance ahead of you - save your breath for the road, don't waste it on words.
0DI4000293	All right... Courier. If the why of it matters to you.
0DI4000294	I hold Legion to be my brothers... even as misguided as they are. And you... more so than most.
0DI4000295	It's not Legion - the Legion I know, but they change, even in small ways as they march West, with every tribe they break.
0DI4000296	But yes... last I heard, you needed a weapon between your legs to carry one for Caesar.
0DI4000297	What do you m... I see the way of it. Have fight in you, at least. Save it for the road ahead.
0DI4000298	Power isn't strength. Power can wall off someone, when they believe it's freed them.
0DI4000299	House's power... you've seen the wall around Vegas. He gains more power, that wall will grow. The Mojave'll become Vegas.
0DI4000300	But it's more lights than strength. You'll see the way of it soon enough.
0DI4000301	No... not new. And not new among all those in the shadow of the Bear.
0DI4000302	You know their flag, a bear with two heads. Symbol's an Old World one, had one head then, better off for it.
0DI4000303	Their flag speaks to their spirit. They're split like any two-headed animal, trying to go in different directions, ending up nowhere.
0DI4000304	In the Mojave, that'll only get you sand between your fingers - or over your grave.
0DI4000305	Yes. And any Courier could tell you the same, see it everywhere. The Bear...
0DI4000306	...Bear's too busy carving up the Mojave with knives, roads, borders, and how things should be to see how it is.
0DI4000307	They're stretched thin, can't protect their frontlines, their towns, think paper's power, radio means control - all of it, useless.
0DI4000308	Trying doesn't hold much weight with me. Legion doesn't try to kill people, they do it. The Bear kills people trying to protect them.
0DI4000309	Irony's sharp. And Legion... their flag may be old, but it's not at war with itself.
0DI4000310	No matter now. Bear couldn't hold the Divide.
0DI4000311	You and that machine, are all that remains of NCR here... rest fell to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
0DI4000312	Maybe that's why you chose Vegas... the lights can blind, make people forget themselves. Their convictions - vows.
0DI4000313	Not going to waste time trying to make the blind see. Took a chance coming here - same as I did. Now we'll see how it plays out.
0DI4000314	Maybe not. Maybe that's why you fell in with the Bear in the first place - can't see what you're following.
0DI4000315	Not going to convince a deaf man with words. Shown strength coming in here - if strength's what you respect, then you belong East of the Colorado.
0DI4000316	Your future with House has two roads. The road the tribals in Vegas walked... their spirits crushed...
0DI4000317	...or your face on a robot servant, smiling forever in a dead casino. There's future in neither.
0DI4000318	Vegas is Old World, filled with Old World ghosts. And ghosts need the living to do their work.
0DI4000319	That's why the families are there, why the Bear stumbles there to lose itself. It's a dance, I don't know its purpose.
0DI4000320	You've been, you've seen the Wall. It's what's inside that worries me.
0DI4000321	That's the wrong word. "Theater" is better - the families, the Bear all on a stage.
0DI4000322	House. He's the one watching. The why... you'd know better than I would. If you don't - you will.
0DI4000323	You've been, you've seen the Wall. Safe? No... what's inside - that's what worries me.
0DI4000324	Inside, Old World's waking up. No facts or history I've heard tells me that city ever went to sleep, and that makes me think.
0DI4000325	The blue of the Mojave skies - isn't like the rest of the world. Don't hear a Geiger ticking there, more to fear from predators than rads.
0DI4000326	The city - the whole Mojave, wasn't hit by bombs. Been my call, Vegas would be one of the first pieces of the Old World to burn.
0DI4000327	Someone protected it. Wasn't chance, wasn't luck. Something larger - yet they let the rest of the world suffer. And they'll do it again.
0DI4000328	Families of Vegas were once tribes. Got drunk on the Vegas lights, the spirit bled out of them. Old World history, under a different flag.
0DI4000329	Whatever traditions or rituals they had, most likely squeezed out of them by now, turned into something else.
0DI4000330	And if not, then I'm afraid what's going to happen when they come creeping back.
0DI4000331	Believe that. Vegas runs, I've seen what it's done to those who oppose it. And I've seen its messengers.
0DI4000332	No... only seen his works. Those he's broken with light and gold. His messengers.
0DI4000333	But everything in Vegas speaks of someone who can't let go.
0DI4000334	House takes a shovel to history's graves, props up the dead, then puts words in their mouths. The tribes don't even know how they were broken.
0DI4000335	Not a world I want to be part of, going through motions until we're all smiling faces on some robot's screen.
0DI4000336	The High Road... not the Divide yet, many more miles to walk. But you got this far. You and that machine that shadows you.
0DI4000337	Wasn't sure if both of you'd make it - above, then below the underpass.
0DI4000338	[SUCCEEDED] "Who are you, who do not know your history?"
0DI4000339	You came all this way for answers. Only currency I have, nothing else to be gained - could turn around, walk away at any time.
0DI4000340	If history matters to you... you'll need to earn it. Any logs of mine I have already cast away in the Divide, they're lost to you.
0DI4000341	[FAILED] You want to know more, keep walking.
0DI4000342	I'll give answers as you go. Not before.
0DI4000343	Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
0DI4000344	[SUCCEEDED] Mojave and the Divide aren't the only places I've walked.
0DI4000345	[FAILED] Another city fallen to nations, in the east... not important. Doubt you'll ever walk that far, you'd need the land to sustain you.
0DI4000346	[SUCCEEDED] Makes sense. Truth favors that, matches the history of this place.
0DI4000347	Were signs they were here for a long time, before Marked Men, before what happened to the Divide cracked their sky.
0DI4000348	If so, they were buried deep. Might have been born the day America's embers started to settle. Seen worse things twisted by radiation.
0DI4000349	[FAILED] Don't know the history of them - only their patterns, how they hunt.
0DI4000350	Still, takes a long time for such patterns to develop. A longer history than what happened here.
0DI4000351	Home isn't where you're born into this world. You taught me that. Part of your message, whether you meant it or not.
0DI4000352	Can be a place of mind, a moment where you know who you are, the history of it. And they can be places you breathe life into.
0DI4000353	Never would have known the Divide had it not been for you. The road you made with your tracks, again and again.
0DI4000354	You were the only one willing to make the journey to and from here... a hard road. Kept the land before the Divide alive through seasons, storms...
0DI4000355	...can't have been just a job. Was something more to you. Don't feel for a place that hard unless it's home.
0DI4000356	Want to hear the answer of it. Not just history's answer... your answer for what happened here.
0DI4000357	It means everything - even if you deny it, cast it aside, that speaks to what you are, proves what happened here.
0DI4000358	And you've forgotten. Forgotten everything. Careless, as careless with futures then as you are now in the Mojave.
0DI4000359	Wrong? No, I know the truth of it.
0DI4000360	It was you walking that road that kept the Divide alive. It grew from what you did. Settlers... camps... filling that Old World city.
0DI4000361	Chance for a new nation, new beginning. New way of thinking.
0DI4000362	Could've breathed new life into the Mojave, bridging East, West. Like Hoover Dam... but not Old World, something you made. Road was a supply line.
0DI4000363	No, recounting history.
0DI4000364	Not any more. If one existed, the two-headed Bear would have claimed it. And it tried to.
0DI4000365	NCR saw the worth in that road you made. Staked a claim, whether it was wanted there or not - true elsewhere in the Mojave.
0DI4000366	And where the Bear tries to cling to life, the Legion comes... bearing messages. Some brought by blade. Others... by Couriers.
0DI4000367	You knew what was coming, as sure as I know what's coming for you.
0DI4000368	This time you carry the burden. Walk west into the sun, and keep walking until it dies. There - I'll be waiting.
0DI4000370	It was a device, a detonator. One I'd never seen before - or heard before.
0DI4000371	You carried that thing to the Divide. I know because I followed you as you walked the road, watched you do it.
0DI4000372	You brought it here, to the community you built. And you are responsible for what happened after - when the device opened, started to speak.
0DI4000373	When it did, the Divide answered back. Those missiles you've seen, buried in their silos.
0DI4000374	They exploded beneath the ground, cracked the landscape. Sand, ash... the dead... the Divide skies became a graveyard.
0DI4000375	It was from the West. From deep in NCR. Whether made by them or not... it came here. Through your hands.
0DI4000376	All these roads, you walked. These packages you carried. Think it wasn't your choice?
0DI4000377	Of course it was your choice. You could have stayed in the Mojave. But you chose to come, couldn't let be - not in you to let go.
0DI4000378	Came for no other reason than you were curious, restless - always have been. Had to know the why of it - now, I'll show you.
0DI4000379	If you had been there when it happened. If you had seen the Divide break, you would know it.
0DI4000380	You carry death wherever you go - if the Mojave doesn't know it yet, it will.
0DI4000381	No... I'm certain. What I hadn't known was that you still lived after the Divide.
0DI4000382	You will. I'll show the Mojave, Bear and Bull the way of it. How Couriers can break nations.
0DI4000383	What happened here... can happen again. You've already proved it, what you did in Ashton. The silo there.
0DI4000384	Didn't stop you, though. Like carrying the Chip to Vegas, Old World death in your hand.
0DI4000385	Pieces of the Old World like that just need someone careless enough to take them where they need to go, to do their killing.
0DI4000386	No, you are. Cut off your retreat, your supply line. Ashton missile, turned Hopeville into a furnace.
0DI4000387	You could walk back. Still can - but the Divide will mark you, sickness will set in.
0DI4000388	Not immediate, maybe, but in time. Slow burn, a little faster than before.
0DI4000389	The way ahead and below - leads to the heart of the Divide.
0DI4000390	And there... you and I, we'll have an ending to things.
0DI4000391	Spent years looking for you. If you head back to the Mojave, it's like nothing's changed. Can live with that. Had to.
0DI4000392	Wasn't sure if history would matter to you. If it doesn't, that answers my question.
0DI4000393	If you turn your back on your home, so be it. I'll remain here in the Divide for you to return. And you will.
0DI4000394	Your road's not done. Haven't walked it full yet, not nearly enough.
0DI4000395	The two-headed Bear made its claim, dug its claws into the trail you made. For once, it seemed like it might succeed - cut a route to the Mojave.
0DI4000396	Couldn't let NCR stay in the Divide. Trade route, road the military could use... can't have two roads into the Mojave.
0DI4000397	Not after the work we'd done to cut off New Canaan, other routes, killing caravans... all we'd done to make the West bleed.
0DI4000398	Already heard you once, long ago and loud enough for history to hear. Tired of your messages.
0DI4000399	Still - curiosity drove you this far. Let's see what else it can do.
0DI4000400	Caesar's orders. Every supply line gets cut, every community that feeds the Bear... cut its throat, starve the Mojave.
0DI4000401	Assassin? If killing needs to be done, I'll face my victims... not kill from a distance, like you.
0DI4000402	No, when they come this far, they aren't Legion. They walk as Couriers. Like we do.
0DI4000403	And the Divide is the reason no Legion has been seen. None belong to Caesar. Not in this place.
0DI4000404	The ones that came... were following orders.
0DI4000405	Bear made its shadow felt here, more than I could handle. Heavy guard, watchful. I watched, waited.
0DI4000406	And as I watched, studied the people. The flag, markings. Thought perhaps... if I got rid of the Bear... what you had given life to might come again.
0DI4000407	Waited too long. Hesitated. A Courier isn't meant to stay in one place for long. And then you came, with the package. History.
0DI4000408	All right. Done with words, then, won't get you where you need to go.
0DI4000409	No, they don't know the history of it. So send others to find out, more to die... at the hands of their brothers the Divide has claimed.
0DI4000410	It doesn't matter, the Bear's reach was cut off. Now only the Long 15 remains. Once that's finished, Mojave will be under the flag of the Bull.
0DI4000411	Didn't know, but Couriers can travel anywhere. They make roads into places no one else will go, guarded or not. Was going to watch, see.
0DI4000412	The Legion... thought it might get into the community through me, just as I'd found the way by following you.
0DI4000413	But you struck first, shattered the ground, and let your home burn instead. Nearly killed me. And everyone here, walking or still.
0DI4000414	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
0DI4000415	Had the tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... on its last legs, didn't survive the road. Cast it and the tapes aside.
0DI4000416	If you heard them... they're of no consequence. Ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them.
0DI4000421	Twisted Hairs are dead, lost at Dry Wells, died in Vulpes' smile. Won't discuss their fate with you, not now - their past is mine to keep.
0DI4000422	Walk farther, see me face to face - you might earn more. Now, let the words keep you without me adding to them.
0DI4000423	I had, did. It was madness... asked them a question in anger. Got an answer, more than I expected.
0DI4000424	Answer told me what happened here at the Divide, the how of it, and that was enough.
0DI4000425	The tape has the telling of it, don't need me adding to the questions already there.
0DI4000426	The tapes... didn't think those would be found... you know the Divide better than I thought.
0DI4000427	Had tech from the Big Empty, recorder a woman gave me... didn't survive the road, on its last legs.
0DI4000428	Cast it and the tapes aside... weren't worth the words anyway, not like I'd forget what happened.
0DI4000429	If you heard them... nothing but ramblings, reminders for a man who doesn't need them. Probably more, lying from here to the Divide.
0DI4000430	You know the why of it. If you don't - I do, and that's enough. Shows trust only walks so far West.
0DI4000431	Earned more than that, though, getting this far. We walk the same road, carry the same colors. Can't break that by making the road red.
0DI4000432	Want more than that, walk the Divide. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
0DI4000433	You scavenge words. Things I have no need of, no history there worth recounting.
0DI4000434	Scour the Divide, claw at it for meaning - but my words will give you no answer.
0DI4000435	[SUCCEEDED] They won't help you understand what happened here.
0DI4000436	And they won't help you understand me. Keep them, listen, study them - they won't help you here in the Divide.
0DI4000438	Won't hold it. Divide taught me you don't need to - just cut it off.
0DI4000439	Then the Mojave will fall, Bear will starve, its flag will burn. It's spent too long dying, the Long 15 will end it.
0DI4000452	You've seen the Divide, walked it - farther than I thought you would. Not sure how much farther you have in you.
0DI4000453	If you need answers, speak. You've earned them... even if only you and I can carry them from here.
0DI4000454	If I have the answers, you've earned them.
0DI4000455	You know what it was. Had the symbols of America on it. New markings. From after the Great War.
0DI4000456	Thought it might be America come again. Promise of another future. Another flag.
0DI4000457	I knew of you, your name. Your road, to and from the Divide, what that meant for the Legion.
0DI4000458	We never spoke, knew you through your actions. Knew you'd walked the West as I'd walked the East. Learned different lessons.
0DI4000459	And I would never have discovered the Divide without you.
0DI4000460	Promises to keep. 'Courier shall not kill Courier.' Always - let them live, spread the word.
0DI4000461	Caesar's orders. Some time before I realized the why of it. Wasn't just you. All couriers.
0DI4000462	No telling how many were Legion. Maybe all of them.
0DI4000463	Wasn't sure about you. Until the Divide... all the NCR burning... that much death, it bears the mark of a Legion hand.
0DI4000464	But you killed like NCR. Like Hanlon, with mines, bombs... missiles. Killed Legion along with the Bear. Like a coward, kills from a distance.
0DI4000465	If you were Legion, then NCR beat you, the West changed you.
0DI4000467	It was a piece of machinery... military, holding memories, codes, maybe. When it woke, made these sounds... words.
0DI4000468	When it spoke, the Divide became fire, the ground... tore apart like the skies. Through it all, kept calling out - maybe calling for home.
0DI4000469	[SUCCEEDED] Hate? No. There's nothing to hate in metal... steel, gold. Or platinum.
0DI4000470	Your machine... it's just a tool, made of wreckage of the Divide... all that was brought here.
0DI4000471	[FAILED] When I speak in anger, Courier, you'll know it. Your machine? Worth no more hate than any other machine.
0DI4000472	Machine couldn't speak by itself. Needed a terminal to access it... like the terminals in the silos here, or the machine with you.
0DI4000473	When it was connected, it started speaking. And the Divide answered.
0DI4000474	The Dam. That Old World Wall.
0DI4000477	The why of it. Hoover Dam.
0DI4000478	The Bear, NCR, couldn't be allowed to reach it easily. Long 15... Canaan... both bad enough.
0DI4000479	Kimball, Caesar, House... you'd think their whole world was that wall, cutting the Colorado. If I'd never laid eyes on it, never spoke of it...
0DI4000480	...but once found, it was all Caesar could see. That, and the flag beyond it, another symbol, big enough to challenge him.
0DI4000481	And the Divide, one of the roads to it - Legion was tasked with cutting that artery. If you can't kill the Bear in one stroke, bleed it, starve it.
0DI4000482	That kind of murder... it's what any of the Legion would have done. Now... the Divide belongs to history.
0DI4000483	Blame? Accident? The names you hang on this... Courier... you carry death wherever you go, Mojave knows - or will.
0DI4000484	I'll see you answer for this. The road doesn't end here, there's more to come, I swear to you.
0DI4000485	Accident? Ignorance is a choice. The Chip - a choice.
0DI4000486	As for anger... it is what I carry for the dead, and all that come here.
0DI4000487	Not the name I'd give it. Not the name the dead would give it.
0DI4000488	Soldiers of the Bear died here... Legion died, too, my brothers. Still dying, both of them, all around us.
0DI4000489	None of the people that lived here survived... yet all of the West and the East, they hold on as the Divide tears at them.
0DI4000490	Revenge isn't the message I have for you. More than that... Courier.
0DI4000491	Machinery. Simple on the outside, computer parts. Inside... more complicated.
0DI4000492	Was the only time I'd heard a machine speak in the Divide, the only machine with a voice.
0DI4000493	I've walked the East. You've walked the West, more than I have.
0DI4000494	Circle Junction. Reno. Vault City. Word of you at Fort Aradesh... Fort Abandon. Even further West than that, Brahmin drives on the Big Circle.
0DI4000495	Whatever you saw out there, wasn't enough to make you stay. Maybe the markings on the package reminded you of the road home.
0DI4000496	Buried in the Divide. Part of it now.
0DI4000497	Wherever it is, it's been silent... if it spoke again, we'd know.
0DI4000499	Legion doesn't know your history. I do. They find out what happened here, how many of their own died... they'll want an answer.
0DI4000500	Then Legion kills Legion. Farther you walk from the flag of the Bull, the more West creeps into you.
0DI4000501	Legion wears many colors, East and West. You... maybe blinded by Vegas's light, or the promise of that Chip.
0DI4000502	Or maybe you walked so far West, the Bear's sickness crept into you. We'll see. Your offenses before Caesar, the least of the crimes here.
0DI4000503	Really. Who's to say the truth of it. You? No. You walked from this, turned your back on it. Now you and others will answer for it.
0DI4000504	I'll start with the West. Let that burn. Then... if the East falters after, I'll bring the Divide there as well.
0DI4000505	Burn away the flags. Begin again.
0DI4000506	It's a messenger. Like us... and it shares our history.
0DI4000507	If you feel its loss... remember you could have turned away at any time. Gone back home, and none of this would have happened.
0DI4000508	But you had to make one last delivery, and that's why I knew you'd come, Courier. Couldn't stay away, it's who you are.
0DI4000509	What's inside that machine - that's all that mattered. All the machines here, made of wreckage from the Divide... and all that was brought here.
0DI4000510	Inside its frame, it carries the message you brought here... and it'll do what it was programmed to do: whatever it can to get home.
0DI4000511	The giants here will listen to it. I'll bring the Divide to your home, your nation. Let its flag burn, just like you let the Divide burn.
0DI4000512	Big Mountain access code... Ulysses. Command override...
0DI4000513	Navarro.
0DI4000514	Many in the Mojave think the Divide's nothing but canyon and storm. Wasn't always.
0DI4000515	There was life, a town, farther West... not talking about an Old World town like Hopeville... more recent. Something you saw in your lifetime.
0DI4000516	It had the name "the Divide," too. But rather than cracks in the earth, it was a road from the West into the Mojave, a supply line.
0DI4000517	Took a Courier to make that road. You. Back then, you saw the road with eyes facing East. This time... the Divide's in the other direction.
0DI4000518	And if your eyes try to make sense of it when you reach it... home's not what it was.
0DI4000519	All roads lead back to one's home. Not your birthplace maybe, but home.
0DI4000520	You gave it a name. What was it to you? Companion? Slave... weapon? All of that, nothing compared to its primary function.
0DI4000521	The machine you brought is mine now, it's coming home. I'll reduce it to parts, just enough to function, to be aware of what's happening.
0DI4000522	My family? My tribe lives... its history? Died long ago, fell under the shadow of the Bull... consumed by another symbol.
0DI4000523	No, this isn't about family - or any common blood. It's blood shared by acts, not by chance.
0DI4000524	The soldiers of the Bear? They were dead already, their symbol... diseased. Deserved to die as my brothers did at Boulder City, mines, bombs.
0DI4000525	I carry nothing for them. Their deaths here were a mercy - compared to the ones that still walk the Divide.
0DI4000526	As for my brothers in the Legion... they deserved to die in battle, as do all beneath the flag of the Bull.
0DI4000527	But no... the dead number more than my brothers.
0DI4000530	The Legion who died here... they didn't deserve to die, like those that died in the fires of Boulder City... bombs, Hanlon's gifts.
0DI4000531	Their deaths were mercy compared to those who still walk. Any who die beneath the flag of the Bull... their death should be in battle.
0DI4000533	The supply line - the artery for the West? I have seen the blood of NCR at Legion hands many times.
0DI4000534	I carry no hatred for duty... if that's what this was. The Divide was more than that. Its people, more than that.
0DI4000535	Serves the Legion?
0DI4000537	The community that was once here... and the package you brought... both had markings of the Divide. Markings of America.
0DI4000538	You've seen the marks, the symbol. As early as the Hopeville silo, maybe. Carried it etched on your weapons.
0DI4000539	The Divide, its buildings, its people, were built around those same markings, surrounded them here...
0DI4000540	...markings like the flag on my back. When I followed your road to the Divide those years ago, I saw the symbol I wore all around me.
0DI4000541	An Old World symbol. Strong, to survive here - its people, strong. Outlast the Bear, outlast the Bull. Promise of something better.
0DI4000542	Caesar was right to want it dead. NCR was right to want to rake their claws in it.
0DI4000543	Seeing it... changed me, just as seeing Hoover Dam changed Caesar and the NCR.
0DI4000544	Seeing it end changed me, too.
0DI4000545	There was hope here, another chance. A new nation, stirring to life. A place I could have set my flag.
0DI4000546	Not the America of old. But something larger than the tribes of the East, something larger than the houses of the West. Something better.
0DI4000547	The Divide... could have bridged both, like Hoover Dam. Now like the Dam, it's too covered in blood to see what it could have been.
0DI4000548	You gave life to this place. I followed your road here, saw the Divide. You led me here, so that I could see.
0DI4000549	Then, you brought it to an end.
0DI4000550	My history isn't revenge, or hate. The road that brought us both here - isn't about that.
0DI4000551	It's about the message you carried. The one in that package, whether you knew it or not.
0DI4000552	The message that one can kill a nation. Can kill a symbol. And all that gather beneath its flag.
0DI4000553	I don't blame you for the Divide. I blame you for what you made me see.
0DI4000554	Now you will see what you brought to the Mojave, and that will be my message to you.
0DI4000555	The nations of the Mojave. Cracked and broken as the Divide... its people, the same.
0DI4000556	I have walked at Caesar's command, across the East, into the West. Far enough to know Caesar's word did not drive me. Far enough to see the end.
0DI4000557	You've seen it. No Courier, whatever their flag can ignore it. Why you didn't stay in the West. Why you wandered.
0DI4000558	There is no future in the Bear or Bull. The Bear is diseased, barely clings to life.
0DI4000559	And the Bull... when the Legion reaches the sea, it will turn on itself and die.
0DI4000560	Killing one will end both. And you made me see how one could do it. Your ignorance, carelessness - can be used with a purpose.
0DI4000561	You already tried once, won't give you another chance.
0DI4000562	Machines... bombs, things of NCR, are your tools, not mine. When we meet, this machine won't keep me from you.
0DI4000565	You struck first. Not just at me... at the Legion. Or so I thought. Not sure of the history of it now.
0DI4000566	Whatever flag you follow, or followed then... either way, you got too much of the Bear's sickness in you to live. Divide's proof of that.
0DI4000567	Want more than that, walk the road. Answers'll come, closer you get to home... you and that machine.
0DI4000568	Legion died here as well. What you did... that's not all that cuts at me.
0DI4000571	Yes. And it did to you once, I'm sure of it.
0DI4000572	No, it is a title you earned. Legion or not, you have betrayed more than you know.
0DI4000573	If that's all that drives you, it won't last. The Legion... it won't last either.
0DI4000574	I'll finish history's work. If the Divide couldn't kill you... perhaps these spears of the Old World can.
0DI4000575	Let's end this, Courier, you and I. Here, with the Old World flag as witness.
0DI4000576	You've answered your own question. And you'll die with that question on your lips.
0DI4000577	That's part of why I'm here. Watch them - if they attack me, try to enter the Mojave, I answer. Not looking to kill them... save them, if I can.
0DI4000578	There might be something saving in them. If not, then what I do is mercy, not murder.
0DI4000580	Old World wall, run red with blood of Bear and Bull. It'll bleed more before the sun sets on the Mojave.
0DI4000581	That place and I have a past, owe it a debt - and it owes me. If your path takes you there, know you're not the only one.
0DI4000582	It's the wall by which this age will be measured, the gravestone of the Mojave. Old World never meant it as such.
0DI4000583	My words? And what do my words teach you.
0DI4000584	That question... either you walked the Big Empty... you found the last of the holotapes.
0DI4000585	The words are mine. Whatever... "answer" you think they hold, you're wrong. It was a question, nothing more.
0DI4000586	The invisible fires burn here, true enough. Still... to have helped carry out such an act, then not face it...
0DI4000587	Not my way. If my life burns out here, so be it... until then, I wait and watch, see what the road brings.
0DI4000588	Questions have a habit of making others.
0DI4000589	My name for it. If you have a better one, you grant it - my choice in names won't carry past you and I.
0DI4000590	Lies along the road, running from the Hopeville silo... straight on to where the ground burns, and wind howls even stronger than here.
0DI4000591	I believed in what I followed then. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
0DI4000592	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. Now, our allegiances are reversed.
0DI4000593	Not if you believe in what you follow. Kill no Courier, Caesar's words. I honored them.
0DI4000594	Other Couriers could have been Legion - like me. The truth is, you serve nothing, believe nothing. Killing you... meaningless.
0DI4000595	[SUCCEEDED] The why of it... you taught me the why of it.
0DI4000596	If you believe in something enough, you must be willing to let it burn, lest it claim you.
0DI4000597	These governments of the two-headed bear... the Legion... they carry Old World ideas into an age that no longer needs them, where they cannot live.
0DI4000598	[FAILED] Yes, that is what you proved to me at the Divide - what is here, what you showed me... it is enough.
0DI4000599	You don't understand. You will.
0DI4000600	Comes down to perspective, how far one's walked, and what they've left behind.
0DI4000601	If you challenge this moment, let's hear your perspective. If my words are all you have, let's hear them.
0DI4000602	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here...
0DI4000603	One buried this place, yet it lived on between us. One may build it again - build others. Your history has proven this, here.
0DI4000604	There is truth in your words. But even if there is hope in change... it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
0DI4000605	[SUCCEEDED] Our history... the Divide. That history has been written, its lessons learned.
0DI4000606	There is nothing more to be dug from these cracks in the earth, no more fury to be torn from its sky.
0DI4000607	[FAILED] If those are your last words, they are weak ones. Actions would have had more voice.
0DI4000608	There is nothing more to be said between us. No words of yours will change what is about to happen.
0DI4000609	Even after the road you've walked, you only see a traitor before you.
0DI4000610	Not all the East will burn. The Legion does not need to be destroyed, only... contained within new borders.
0DI4000611	After that, it will fall as any culture bred on war, on forward momentum. It will falter, collapse.
0DI4000612	I will start with their camp at Dry Wells... once my homeland. Justice of a sort.
0DI4000613	I cannot go back. I wandered too far, far enough to know my home was lost to me.
0DI4000614	I could no more go back than you could return to the West. To NCR, and all its sickness.
0DI4000617	History? Cures a wound, leaves the bitterness that caused it. The Twin Mothers were always about lessons.
0DI4000618	Caesar taught them the last one, though, so that's it for them. Recipe still exists, Legion uses it on forced marches with wounded soldiers.
0DI4000619	Wouldn't have made it through Crimson River Trail a few years back without it  - losing so much blood early on, was a Cazador feast.
0DI4000620	Enough Xander root and Broc flower along the trail though, the Legion was able to keep pace and get where they were going.
0DI4000621	Can do that and one better... just enough around to mix some. Here - might make the Twin Mothers' history live a little longer, you carrying it.
0DI4000622	When you drink it, down it all in one shot, or your stomach's not going to want to keep going after the second drink.
0DI4000623	Too soon to tell what will happen, let history weigh what you've done, if it gets that far.
0DI4000624	Unless you do the same for the Legate that comes, you'll get no thanks from me. When that Monster arrives, he's not going to have a leash.
0DI4000625	Caesar could command him. Not now. The Bear's going to burn, and burn slow.
0DI4000626	He let another hold a knife to him. If he was weak enough to allow the knife so close to his neck, maybe it needed to be his ending.
0DI4000627	Caesar would be history's hypocrite if he was angry about what happened. I'm not one for it, either.
0DI4000628	Seems you just proved his philosophy to him. If he'd been stronger, he'd be alive, and we wouldn't be talking.
0DI4000629	Done with blame, and Caesar was big on strength making right. Seems to me you proved that philosophy to him.
0DI4000630	If he was too weak to stop you, too weak to defend himself, then he needed to die with his beliefs.
0DI4000631	Wasn't his time, and wouldn't have been how he wanted to die.
0DI4000632	Not how most would've wanted him to die, either, Bear or Bull.
0DI4000633	What you did was for the best. The Old World died long ago. Anyone who believes they can make it return and everything will be as it was...
0DI4000634	...it is a dangerous belief. Needs to be silenced before their belief spreads.
0DI4000635	If you saw House, you didn't see a man. An Old World spirit, perhaps - filthy, diseased. If so, killing him was mercy, not cruelty.
0DI4000636	Let House sleep in his chamber. Let him dream of the Old World he remembers, and keep those memories where they belong, in his head.
0DI4000637	Bear and Bull shed too much blood there to let it go. Can't stop you from going, wouldn't.
0DI4000638	A warning, though - the Legate, Lanius. Whether Caesar stands or not, Lanius will come.
0DI4000639	Lanius... the "Butcher." Monster, Terror of the East.
0DI4000640	Not even his slaves have seen his face - struck them blind so they can't. Wears a mask, don't even know if it's the same man.
0DI4000641	He put Colorado to the sword, broke the Hangdogs by throwing their hounds upon the flames, so they might burn forever in the afterlife.
0DI4000642	Then there is nothing more to be done. The Mojave awaits.
0DI4000643	The Divide belongs to history now. The Mojave awaits.
0DI4000645	Lanius carries all the terrors of the East with him. He's the myth, the weapon the Legion needs.
0DI4000646	When he arrives, he'll fall on Hoover Dam like a hammer, break the Bear in two.
0DI4000647	To take Hoover Dam, Legion will need something as big as the Old World itself - another symbol, forged by history.
0DI4000648	Nineteen tribes could not do it. All the lights in Vegas cannot.
0DI4000649	His strength lies in his title - and it is his weakness. He will not fight a losing battle and destroy what he represents.
0DI4000650	Put the idea of loss in him. Convince him the Bear will not be the twentieth tribe beneath his heel, it will make him pause like nothing on earth.
0DI4000651	You do not need to convince him alone. Draw upon history. The past of other Legates are not filled with victories. Remind Lanius of this.
0DI4000652	There are other Legates, and the one before Lanius couldn't take Hoover Dam for Caesar.
0DI4000653	Yes. Graham was broken on the wall of the Dam.
0DI4000655	That Legate's mistake is he didn't die trying. His name was Joshua - Joshua Graham. Answered for his failure - twice, some say.
0DI4000656	Caesar had him burned and cast into the earth, into the largest canyon you've ever seen. Watched the flames trail all the way to the bottom.
0DI4000657	Somehow Joshua walked away from that, went beyond Caesar's gaze. His footsteps trailing fire, walking from one hell - maybe to another.
0DI4000658	When one is ruined like Graham was... sometimes home is the only place left. If so, he went to New Canaan, Caesar's anger written on him like a book.
0DI4000659	Caesar's orders to the Frumentarii were to watch for him, find Graham. Kill him. Didn't try. Could've, no good would have come of it.
0DI4000660	Graham earned his life, and his nature... it'll kill him more surely than any blade of the Legion.
0DI4000661	So if you've heard word of it or seen sign of him, let it keep. Let his history keep.
0DI4000664	My tribe? That log... no, it concerned the White Legs, training them to kill. For Caesar.
0DI4000665	There is no meaning there beyond the road to New Canaan. The history of the murder of its people. And Caesar's past.
0DI4000666	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength.
0DI4000667	[SUCCEEDED] There is conviction in your words, enough to rival a Legate, perhaps Caesar. You believe what you say.
0DI4000668	[SUCCEEDED] Your actions have carried strength. More importantly, not for House, but for the families on the Strip.
0DI4000669	[FAILED] Words are not enough to bear the weight of your flag - if you follow anything at all.
0DI4000670	Speeches are things of NCR, words without strength. Your actions have shown nothing. Your flag will burn. The Mojave will follow.
0DI4000671	[FAILED] You came from the West, walked there. You carry its sickness East to the Legion - and do not believe their cause enough to honor them.
0DI4000672	What I give the Legion is a swifter death than the disease you bring. You have not the strength to bear a Legion standard.
0DI4000673	[FAILED] You serve Vegas ghosts, not the tribes Vegas devoured. House is not the people of Vegas - you have walked the Strip, yet have seen nothing.
0DI4000674	Your carelessness for the paths you walk - it has destroyed the city you serve. NCR will burn. Then the walls of Vegas will follow.
0DI4000675	[FAILED] Yet you follow nothing at all.
0DI4000676	You have walked the Mojave, let the shadow of flags fall upon you, yet walk carelessly, no allegiance. Your words - empty as your actions.
0DI4000677	If you speak for the two-headed Bear, I'll hear your words. Even if I will be the only one to hear them.
0DI4000678	If you believe it should not die this day... then answer me why.
0DI4000679	If you feel I do not know the Legion's strength - then I will listen.
0DI4000680	If the ghosts of Vegas have come from behind their wall to speak for the West, I'll hear their words.
0DI4000681	If you believe that Vegas does not deserve to die as the Bear does... then answer me why.
0DI4000682	If you seek to anger me, words won't be enough. Your moral ground is weak here in the Divide.
0DI4000683	Blame you? No, learned from you. Both the weapon to kill a nation, and the strength to do it.
0DI4000684	You showed me a road, a way to carry my message. You've already answered for what you've done. Now the flag you follow will answer for it.
0DI4000685	No, now there is purpose. I believe you when you say you were... careless. The Divide... the Chip... the machine you brought here...
0DI4000686	Many messages can be taken from that, intended or not. What I do now is an act of conviction.
0DI4000687	No, the West. The East. It doesn't matter - the death of either one kills the other, Vegas along with it. The West shall answer first.
0DI4000688	No, not the Mojave. The West, all that's been built since America died. Same symbols as before the war, now a flag carried by a tribe of children.
0DI4000689	You walked the West, didn't stay. You know the reason... the Bear grows without structure, follows a symbol without knowing its history.
0DI4000690	No... the paths we've walked. The roads, and the flags above them, carry equal blame.
0DI4000691	My home in the East, Dry Wells, is no more. It is part of the Legion.
0DI4000692	The only other home... the chance of a home... was what you built at the Divide. Then you destroyed it.
0DI4000693	And knowing that you believe in the Bear's sickness and have given it strength... then that gives more reason to lay waste to your homeland.
0DI4000694	The sickness of the Bear already lies within you, even if you uphold the East. If there were time, I would let you kill the Legion.
0DI4000695	But no, the Legion will burn as well. Without the West to challenge it... its shore will be closer than before. It will feed on itself, die.
0DI4000696	Without NCR to support it, Vegas will fall to the Legion. That grave of lights, back to dust and ghosts, as was meant.
0DI4000697	After this, only one flag will remain over the Mojave. Let that one fly, or destroy itself.
0DI4000698	You don't see, listen - even when it's all around you, no matter if I nailed it into your head like a gift from Caesar.
0DI4000699	You brought the Divide to life, Courier. You walked the road. Brought the Bear, then the Bull, brought me, following your tracks.
0DI4000700	And when I saw the Divide you made, I saw a second chance, a new way of thinking. My world - no longer the East.
0DI4000701	Then you brought the West in that package. Destroyed it all. Nearly killed me, flesh and spirit.
0DI4000702	You destroyed something larger than the Bear, greater than the Bull. And even when you could have turned away, you brought it again, in that machine.
0DI4000703	You destroyed a nation taking its first breath. A place that could have been my home. Now, I'll destroy yours.
0DI4000704	No need to destroy the Bear, just cut its throat.
0DI4000705	You taught me that at the Divide - only need to cut off the supply line, the road, to watch something greater die.
0DI4000706	I'll turn the Long 15 into miles of fire, cut off the Mojave. NCR will fall back, lose Hoover Dam... and leave their throats exposed to the Legion.
0DI4000707	You destroyed your own homeland. Seeing a nation burn? Didn't think that would matter any more to you.
0DI4000708	There's a strength in that... lack of attachment. Still, you're here now. If there's no more answers you want, then we'll end this.
0DI4000709	[SUCCEEDED] History has proven this. Our history.
0DI4000710	And you think that you have this strength? Enough for all of NCR?
0DI4000711	The West is not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
0DI4000712	[FAILED] No... your answer is not enough.
0DI4000713	They deserve what comes... and should answer for it, as you should. The Bear is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
0DI4000714	You believe. Yet... you believe in the wrong symbol. Let it give you what strength it can... soon, it will be no more.
0DI4000715	Fear? No. Anger.
0DI4000716	If you've heard my words and that's all you've taken from them, then I was right to cast them aside.
0DI4000717	If you ever had any ability to hear anything beyond your own footsteps... the Divide silenced it. Now, its voice will end you.
0DI4000718	So... you resort to trickery. You were hoping that you could deceive me, reveal that somehow I can stop all this.
0DI4000719	Fire will rain on the West and the East, as intended, and the last words of the messenger of the Bull - nothing but lies.
0DI4000720	The West will burn, as intended, and Vegas will follow. The last words of its messenger, were not for the people of the city, but lies and deceit.
0DI4000721	Your nation will burn, as intended, and the last words of its messenger, were not for its people, but to beg for mercy.
0DI4000722	It may be... that as much destruction has been written in the earth here... you may build something else, as you built the Divide.
0DI4000723	You have spoken truly. There is a shadow of a nation behind you, the hope of a people... yet it may not matter. The Divide still stands against us.
0DI4000724	It is... enough.
0DI4000725	Our enemies gather outside... shadows of the Bear and Bull... they will have found their way in, just as you did.
0DI4000726	It was always my intention - in case I could not kill you, the Marked Men would flood this place, cut off your escape.
0DI4000727	If we cannot prevent what comes, then let us make our stand here. Two Couriers, together, at the Divide.
0DI4000729	And you think that you have this strength? Enough to hold up NCR, long enough so that Vegas may live again?
0DI4000730	Even if you speak for Vegas and its ghosts, nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
0DI4000732	They deserve what comes. Vegas is born of the corrupt, the  blind, lost, that gather to it. Without them... it would fall dark.
0DI4000733	You believe. Yet... you have been blinded by the wrong symbol. Let its light give you what strength it can... today marks its end.
0DI4000734	When I asked that question, death was certain. I wasn't begging for mercy.
0DI4000736	You seek to use your own crimes to prevent mine. There... is a strange honor in that. Perhaps the shadow of the Bull does walk with you.
0DI4000737	The West, the East - they are not the Divide, and nothing you can do can prevent the missile's launch. Convincing me - changes nothing.
0DI4000738	[FAILED] You answer me with questions. Doubt. You were strong enough to come here - but not strong enough to speak for all the Legion.
0DI4000739	This is the ending they deserve... a flag is a thing of the people that gather to it, as are all symbols.
0DI4000740	You believe. Yet you do not see that killing a symbol with its own weapon carries justice of its own... just as it will when the East dies as well.
0DI4000741	I never sought to escape. I went to them to get an answer or die.
0DI4000742	I spoke those words in anger, and I did not expect an answer. All was lost... I thought it was the end.
0DI4000743	Past their graves of failed technology, they had cared about the flag they had followed... and the people beneath it. Even with them dead and gone.
0DI4000744	But there's no answer in that. I do this because I care, because I believe it must be done.
0DI4000745	Kill them - no. The symbol they follow? Yes, as surely as you did at the Divide.
0DI4000746	Just? There was no justice in it, it was an act of carelessness, a coward. Killing an idea, before it had a chance...
0DI4000747	I see your meaning. You're tying this to our history... but it is different. The symbol I destroy, it has already proven itself wrong.
0DI4000748	Those are my words. After what happened with the Brotherhood... talking with them.
0DI4000749	Then with the rulers of the Big Empty. But it is their philosophy that was flawed - their weapons, used with new perspective...
0DI4000750	Those weapons can be used to kill a symbol that has already proven itself wrong.
0DI4000751	There is truth in that. History has proven it.
0DI4000752	But Mojave's proof that no homeland is sacred... until the larger symbols are destroyed.
0DI4000753	Whatever is built, the Bear, Bull... even Vegas... will tear it apart, convert it, either with purpose, or by accident.
0DI4000754	Both. Why do you care.
0DI4000755	Test it. As you test me? As if you believe there is some other road here.
0DI4000756	Nothing can prevent what comes. The missiles will launch. These questions - your words, or mine - what do they matter to you.
0DI4000757	As you defend it now?
0DI4000758	New Canaan? My tribe?
0DI4000759	The White Legs? To even claim they were shadows of the Twisted Hairs...
0DI4000760	No, whatever words you heard, they were not mine.
0DI4000761	Respect...?
0DI4000762	The braids I wore. They took that from me, thought it made them more like me, more willing to have Caesar listen.
0DI4000763	They didn't know what the braids meant, the mark of my tribe before Caesar came... before Vulpes came for them at Dry Wells.
0DI4000764	There was death in that meeting, even while Vulpes smiled - asked for our help against the other tribes.
0DI4000765	All the while, they were looking to cast our history on the fire. And did. Another tribe, consumed by the Bull - nothing left.
0DI4000766	Respect the White Legs? That tribe of jackals? Never.
0DI4000767	No, they didn't. They were ended, completely. Became part of history's march.
0DI4000768	If you feel there is meaning in the White Legs taking the braids of my tribe... what they did... insult, not respect.
0DI4000769	Both... both survived, pieces of them. Remnants, nothing more.
0DI4000770	Back to symbols and history, then. Hard to kill... like Couriers.
0DI4000771	You're saying when the meaning gets lost - that what happens here, can make things worse. Happened in the Mojave. Flags of the Bear and Bull.
0DI4000772	What do I care for your perspective. You walk blindly, foolishly into death, your own and others.
0DI4000773	You do not rule my actions, and do not mistake my acts for yours.
0DI4000774	The machine made from the parts of Navarro? It had only one message in its core - to get home, at any cost.
0DI4000775	It echoes its master... and soon the missiles here will as well.
0DI4000777	No. You are wrong. Words will not bridge this.
0DI4000778	You were tricked. Still, you take pride in it.
0DI4000780	We fight over how we will be remembered, then.
0DI4000781	There is nothing inside the machine except the means to awaken the missiles in the Divide. That is its only message.
0DI4000782	You lie. There was only one message in the machine, only one message in the package you brought.
0DI4000783	The Divide bore the symbol of America... as did the package from Navarro. The origins of the machine is... of no importance.
0DI4000784	What do you seek to gain by telling me this. If you think that the symbol I wear is a weakness...
0DI4000785	If we must survive to carry its message... then that is what shall be done. I will not let America die here.
0DI4000786	But... it may not matter. Even if we lay down our weapons, the Divide... it still stands against us.
0DI4000787	Experiment log 369248/B - Eyebot Duraframe universal interface override system. This is Dr. Whitley presiding.
0DI4000788	We've boosted signal gain and enlarged the overflow buffer system. That should ensure 100% connectivity and control. ED-E, whenever you're ready.
0DI4000789	<Electronic sounds>
0DI4000790	Yes! Success! Um, reporting full success on 369248/B. ED-E was able to interface with and override the test panel in under three seconds.
0DI4000791	Great job, team. Now, let's start on the proposal for the full rollout.
0DI4000792	<Distressed beeping>
0DI4000793	Dr. Grant? What the hell do you think you're doing?
0DI4000794	You didn't even disengage his damage-avoidance protocols! You're hurting him!
0DI4000795	Get the hell out of here!
0DI4000796	Ah, Whitley, there you are. Orders from Colonel Autumn - he feels the Eyebot Duraframe project isn't advancing quickly enough. I'm to-
0DI4000797	Don't be ridiculous, it's just a machine. See here, I've already increased the navigation system's efficiency by 65%.
0DI4000798	Fine, Whitley, it's your lab. At least until I tell the Colonel about this.
0DI4000799	I don't believe it! Grant actually went to Colonel Autumn and got approval for her damned "efficiency guidelines!"
0DI4000800	"All experiments will be carried out with the test subject fully active, to reduce iteration time." It's barbaric!
0DI4000801	I've explained this to the Colonel - just because the Eyebots don't have true AI doesn't mean they're just machines.
0DI4000802	I guess results are all that matter around here. Forget things like "ethical procedures" or "humane treatment."
0DI4000803	I'm starting to have serious misgivings about leadership around here. At least I've got you to talk to, huh ED-E?
0DI4000804	All due respect sir, I think you're making a mistake. We're close to a breakthrough with the Duraframe Eyebots, I can feel it! Yes, sir.
0DI4000805	Yes sir, I understand that we need the Duraframe assets for Hellfire armor, but-No, sir. Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
0DI4000806	I'll tell the team to start disassembling the ED series prototypes right away.
0DI4000807	ED-E, you little rascal. Were you eavesdropping again? I think those videos you watch are a bad influence on you. How much of that did you hear?
0DI4000809	Hmm... didn't Dr. Grant say she'd upgraded your navigational systems? I think I have an idea.... How'd you like to be just like RALPHIE?
0DI4000810	Good, you're back on-line. Listen to me, ED-E - if you stay here, they'll dismantle you for parts. You have to go now.
0DI4000811	I've uploaded destination coordinates for our outpost in Navarro into your system. I want you to go to the Enclave there, okay?
0DI4000812	Do you understand me? It's going to be a long journey, my little friend. You'll have to fly very far, and fly very fast. Can you do that?
0DI4000814	I know you can. Be careful out there, ED-E. Maybe I'll see you again some day.
0DI4000815	<Music, followed by gunshots.>
0DI4000816	Dad! Hey Dad! Check out this robot I found!
0DI4000817	He's not dangerous! Look, he's hurt! Can we take him home, Dad? Maybe Mom can fix him!
0DI4000818	Please? He looks so lonely! Maybe if Mom fixes him, he can help her out around the garage?
0DI4000819	Yay! He'll be just like RALPHIE, only this one's not a toy!
0DI4000820	Next week on RALPHIE the Robot's Incredible Odyssey!
0DI4000821	Tune in next Saturday for the exciting conclusion! Only on Vault-Tec Channel 9!
0DI4000822	Experiment log 369248/A - Eyebot Duraframe universal interface override system. This is Dr. Whitley presiding.
0DI4000823	Initial tests of the override system are promising. Against unsecured or lightly-encrypted targets, the Eyebots have a 98% success rate.
0DI4000824	More heavily protected systems are still problematic. Military-grade encryption presents a very real possibility of critical overload of key systems.
0DI4000825	We've stopped tests before any robots were destroyed, but if we don't address the problem our Eyebots will fry themselves hacking military networks.
0DI4000826	<Excited beeping>
0DI4000838	There's your signal... faint, but there. Just like NCR - voice without fire, without strength, sick.
0DI4000839	Heard tales of you walking the Mojave. Giving the two-headed bear strength. Giving hollow men like Kimball, like Crocker, half the life Hanlon had.
0DI4000840	Now... let's test that strength. That... "conviction." Courier.
0DI4000841	There's your signal... faint, but there. A woman in Caesar's service. Looks like the Bear has had its victory, after all.
0DI4000842	There's your signal... faint, but there. Charging ahead, like the rest of our brothers, blood in your eyes.
0DI4000843	Taking your chances, coming here. Just like bringing the lord of Vegas his tribute, bending your knee to Old World ghosts.
0DI4000844	You and that Chip - deserve each other, twenty-nine less coins than other traitors have carried, if history's true.
0DI4000845	Now see the road the Old World paves... and what the lights of New Vegas promise, if they haven't blinded your eyes.
0DI4000846	There's your signal. Faint, but there. You came, good. Curious, maybe.
0DI4000847	You walked the Mojave without a flag on your back. That'll end soon, can't walk the Long 15 and not have a nation's shadow fall on you.
0DI4000848	Maybe you just need to be tested. Or you believe in nothing. We'll see.
0DI4000851	There you are, you went quiet for a time... knew killing the Bear wouldn't prove easy... you and your machine, you survived.
0DI4000852	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about paving and intentions could teach the Republic a thing or two - if they listened.
0DI4000853	They have an idea of trying to do what's right, never quite getting there. Maybe you've seen it - Nipton, elsewhere.
0DI4000854	Picking up the signal from your machine... was quiet for a time, thought the Road had claimed another of the Legion.
0DI4000855	Too many of the Bull have already fallen here... to radiation, fire... and what burrows below.
0DI4000856	There you are, you went quiet for a time... thought you might have returned to Vegas, its comforts. Maybe you took that machine with you.
0DI4000857	There's a lesson here, in the Divide. Old World history about holding on to something so tightly it breaks... or falls apart.
0DI4000858	May have seen the cracks in Vegas's walls already. If so, they'll grow, in time, no matter how much you back House.
0DI4000859	There you are, you went quiet for a time. Then that signal came in strong from your machine, like a heartbeat.
0DI4000860	Made your way through Old World towns, the tunnels that join them... now, the High Road.
0DI4000861	For all you've seen behind you - there's worse along this stretch. Deathclaws - hunt the Marked Men, and they also hunt what burrows below.
0DI4000863	Hopeville, High Road, Ashton... tiny cracks in the Earth, nothing compared to the road carved ahead.
0DI4000864	Before you... this is the edge of the Divide. Ahead lies your work, the history you burned in the earth. What you brought to the people here.
0DI4000865	Thought that explosion, that building falling deep in the Divide might have been your work... wouldn't kill you, maybe close.
0DI4000866	Knew you'd survive... but no need to go any farther. You've brought me what I need - that machine with you, sealed in the Hopeville silo.
0DI4000867	Needed someone to unlock it - bring it home. Now the signal's strong enough, no need for you to carry it anymore. I can call your machine to me.
0DI4000868	As for the Courier... he turned his back on his home for the second time and made his way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
0DI4000869	As for the Courier... she turned her back on her home for the second time and made her way back, navigating the treachery of the Divide.
0DI4000870	Tunnelers and the Marked Men... avoided the lone figure, as if recognizing the Courier's right to passage... or out of fear.
0DI4000871	ED-E, the version given life by the machines of the Divide, remained frozen in the military installation where Ulysses had summoned him.
0DI4000872	The robot's last coded transmission back to his counterpart in the Mojave told of upgrades, unlocked memories... then silence.
0DI4000873	Not long after the Courier left the facility, the Eyebot's data banks were wiped, and it was disassembled as rapidly as it had been constructed.
0DI4000874	When ED-E's circuits burned in the fires of the Divide, there was one small part that held on until the end.
0DI4000875	It was the fragment that held the Old World memories and the words of his creator in his last moments.
0DI4000876	As his last gesture, he sent one last signal to his counterpart in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
0DI4000877	There was the chance... always, that ED-E's journey would continue, perhaps carried by another Eyebot in the Mojave...
0DI4000878	...the one from which the ED-E from the Divide had been shaped.
0DI4000879	For now, the Courier knew ED-E's history and could carry it, even if the Eyebot had forgotten.
0DI4000880	ED-E, given second life by the machines of the Divide, freed by the Courier, continued his quest west, to Navarro...
0DI4000881	...or what remained of what the Eyebot considered "home." Whether he found his homeland or not, his road is unknown.
0DI4000882	It may be the journey meant more than the destination - just as his counterpart in the Mojave had learned.
0DI4000883	Before leaving, he sent a coded signal to his original in the Mojave, passing along what the Courier had taught him in the Divide.
0DI4000884	With that last farewell, he set off, carrying the song of Old World hope with him, which had given him strength and purpose on his journey.
0DI4000885	And no matter what, he knew there would be a second home to return to, Navarro or not - and that his creator would be proud.
0DI4000886	And this road - has reached its end.
0DI4000887	...missiles fell on NCR and the Long 15 caravan route beyond the Mojave Outpost, the road the Courier had been walking when the tale began.
0DI4000888	Caravans and NCR outposts along the route were reduced to ash, an Old World gift from the Divide.
0DI4000889	...missiles fell on the East and the Legion encampment at Dry Wells... where the Twisted Hairs had allied, then been betrayed by Vulpes and Caesar.
0DI4000890	Legion soldiers died, their silhouettes blasted into the ground and earth, the last word of the last of the Twisted Hairs.
0DI4000891	As catastrophic as the damage was for NCR, the act made the Courier stronger for having no history, and no retreat.
0DI4000892	It was an ending to things - a way of erasing the road that had led to this point and the history that had walked with it.
0DI4000894	The Couriers finally, really did it. They blew up the lands West and East of the Mojave... damning them all to hell.
0DI4000895	The act was discovered 200 years later, as other Couriers explored the Mojave wastes.
0DI4000896	There, they saw NCR relics, reminders of their once proud history.
0DI4000897	The Divide erupted in fire, violent, red, as the last message of the two Couriers arced into the sky...
0DI4000898	The missiles rained like spears down on the land, burning flags and communities alike... destroying all they struck.
0DI4000899	The history of the West was erased for the second time, thorough and complete... and America slept once more.
0DI4000900	The Divide erupted in fire as the flame trail of the two Couriers' last message arced into the sky...
0DI4000901	It's said war - war never changes.
0DI4000902	Men do, through the roads they walk.
0DI4000903	Women do, through the roads they walk.
0DI4000904	Hopeville burned lightless in the night, invisible fires of radiation scorching it from within and without.
0DI4000905	It is said a man still walked its streets, with a tattered jacket, an Old World flag etched on the back...
0DI4000906	He remained there, perhaps as punishment for the scars he left on the wastes - or a reminder of a history he could not forget.
0DI4000907	For Ulysses... his journey was over. The Courier had been the end of his road.
0DI4000908	At the end of the struggle, only one Courier remained in the heart of the Divide. The true Courier, Courier Six.
0DI4000909	The Courier tore the ancient flag of the Commonwealth from its cables, and cast it over the corpse...
0DI4000910	...though whether done as a sign of respect, or in anger for what had been endured to reach this moment - that is unknown.
0DI4000911	Interpretation is something best left to history, and only the surviving Courier would ever know for certain.
0DI4000912	The Courier walked until he stood again upon the edge of the Divide, the last road he would walk before the second battle for Hoover Dam.
0DI4000913	There, beside his feet, was a final package, from one Courier to another - a footlocker, bearing a gift, and a message.
0DI4000914	The Courier walked until she stood again upon the edge of the Divide, the last road she would walk before the second battle for Hoover Dam.
0DI4000915	There, beside her feet, was a final package, from one Courier to another - a footlocker, bearing a gift, and a message.
0DI4000916	But that message - it is something for Couriers to carry, and for them alone.
0DI4000917	The lights flickered across the Divide, reminders that the Old World histories persist, and find meaning in the present.
0DI4000918	...back again. Left that crater behind. Got a few holotapes left, ones from the medical center.
0DI4000919	The woman... she fixed the recorder. Said it wouldn't last, repayment for me fixing her. She doesn't like debts, can respect that.
0DI4000920	Payment enough, just to hear someone who believes in the Brotherhood of Steel. Not Elijah. Different view. Same madness.
0DI4000921	She answered me on their philosophy, their way of seeing - the roads they walk. Dead-ends. Empty... as if technology can solve anything.
0DI4000922	Big Empty's proof where that road leads. Just like the Divide, and all the roads that lead to it.
0DI4000923	Big Empty - there's something hidden there, a crater, past wind and sand - so deep in the desert, there's no turning back.
0DI4000924	Finding the crater was an accident, was following the weather patterns - the Divide sky torn like that, man's violence, not nature's.
0DI4000925	That violence in the sky, had a source. Tracked it. Like following a river current.
0DI4000926	Left the colors to mark my way, like always, case someone finds them, learns the pattern - the Courier might.
0DI4000927	When I thought sand and wind would never end... came to the crater.
0DI4000928	And there... there was an Old World facility, a weather station, at the edge, still raking the sky with electricity and generators.
0DI4000929	And beyond it... saw the rest of the Old World hell there, all carved up like garden plots. Had to see what was there, couldn't leave it be.
0DI4000930	Things sleep in the Big Empty, the Brotherhood woke them up - can't move quiet, any more than the two-headed Bear can.
0DI4000931	And when they woke up, it was like all of history waking up at once. Almost didn't make it out. Almost. Left with answers I never intended.
0DI4000932	Have you ever wanted to speak to history - just to know the why of it? I don't. Not any longer.
0DI4000933	There's old stories about gods and men, past history, into myth - where the gods, they're like children... petulant, cruel.
0DI4000934	Those were the voices of the Big Empty, the past. Couldn't leave well enough alone, had to ask. Had to ask the why of it.
0DI4000935	Their answers were madness. And power, stronger than me, would take a hundred Elijahs... someone tougher than him or I to best them in their Dome.
0DI4000936	They didn't know why they were there, what had led to that point, their names - like serpents devouring themselves, cannibalizing their own thoughts.
0DI4000937	When all seemed lost, thought it was the end - my anger gave me strength to ask them my last question.
0DI4000938	"Who are you, that do not know your history?"
0DI4000939	And they awoke. For... a short time.
0DI4000940	The flag you wear, they said. We remember. America.
0DI4000941	It wasn't just a flag to them... it was a place, an idea they had cared for. Once.
0DI4000942	They told me what it was like to grow in that world... all they had done to lift it up... protect it. They... didn't know it was gone, that...
0DI4000943	...yet they had cared once. Before forgetting their history.
0DI4000944	As they were talking... kept seeing the Courier's shadow behind them, giving each their words weight. History cast aside... a home, left behind.
0DI4000945	I listened. I asked. Was there anything left? Anything that still carries America's voice?
0DI4000946	And they told me I had already been there. I and one other, walking right out of history deeper than we knew.
0DI4000947	They told me what lies in the heart of the Divide, what can be found there. And the words to awaken it - and the one to speak them.
0DI4000948	Destroying my machines won't help you. This facility will make more.
0DI4000949	Don't need Old World medicine to kill you.
0DI4000950	Didn't think you'd outlast the machines. Good.
0DI4000951	Just you and me, then. Always was.
0DI4000952	Can't stop the Old World's return, Courier.
0DI4000953	Took my machines? Hnh. Underestimated you.
0DI4000954	Machines might keep you alive, but they won't save you.
0DI4000955	No more echoes of the Bull and the Bear. The rest will share their fate.
0DI4000956	The dead men of the New World... they've come for you.
0DI4000957	Kill as many as you want - the Divide will birth more.
0DI4000958	Killing them is mercy.
0DI4000959	I'll end you - and your history.
0DI4000960	Come all this way - to die alone.
0DI4000961	Running out of time, Courier.
0DI4000962	Last tape, last message. In case... you best me. If you're hearing this, you have, through blood or word.
0DI4000963	This message, and all that lies with it - it is for you, Courier. If you want to know the... why of things.
0DI4000964	This world, I've walked a good part of it... I stopped only because of you. What you did - gave me pause.
0DI4000965	Long ago, I crossed the Colorado, the first among the Legion to see Hoover Dam in all its glory... an Old World wall, yet bridging two sides.
0DI4000966	And beyond it, a symbol of a two-headed Bear, an idea great enough to challenge Caesar himself.
0DI4000967	Might kill him, taking it, whether he won or lost. The Bull needs to fight, needs the challenge, without it... it falters, dies in the dust.
0DI4000968	Might be a lesson there, in you and me. Leave the thought behind the message to you.
0DI4000969	My message is this - the destruction that has been wrought, at the Divide - or elsewhere, if you couldn't stop me...
0DI4000970	It can happen again. It will keep happening.
0DI4000971	If war doesn't change, men must change, and so must their symbols. Even if it is nothing at all, know what you follow, Courier...
0DI4000972	...just as I followed you, to the end. Whatever your symbol...
0DI4000973	...carry it on your back, and wear it proudly when you stand at Hoover Dam.
0DI4000974	Even in this place, NCR's shadow falls. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the Bear's corpse to weigh you down.
0DI4000975	So you came, Frumentarii, Courier - whatever you are now. Come to carry out Caesar's law? His voice carries no weight here.
0DI4000976	Your city, Vegas, lies in the other direction... with the rest of its slaves. Or is it just, you, Courier, without the lights and ghosts.
0DI4000977	So you came, Courier, to what - watch your homeland burn one last time. Kill me, perhaps.
0DI4000978	Judging by your shadow... maybe you can't let your machine go. Doesn't matter now.
0DI4000979	Either way, the Divide giants are awakening. The missiles here, on their way home. There is no way to stop them.
0DI4000980	You are too late. The Divide is awakening - the package, and the message within, have come full circle.
0DI4000981	The sequence has begun, just as before. Except this time, the missiles will touch the sky instead of being locked beneath the ground.
0DI4000982	We've broken them. The Bear and the Bull have no more shadows to throw at us.
0DI4000983	They come for us,  East and West alike.
0DI4000984	We've shown them fear, but not enough. More will come.
0DI4000985	Watch the shadows - the beasts cloak themselves in Old World tech.
0DI4000986	Watch the floor. Mines. Tactics of the Bear.
0DI4000987	Another Old World soldier falls.
0DI4000988	Old World's running out of machines.
0DI4000989	Beasts from the Divide. To the Divide, they return.
0DI4000990	Mercy killings - let them rest.
0DI4000991	You have forgotten all you were, traded glory for savagery. Fitting.
0DI4000992	Emptiness here - like the sands of the Great Salt Lake, echoed. The beating in the Divide sky... like storm drums of the White Legs.
0DI4000993	Ran with them on the salt beds, at Caesar's command - cut the throats of the two-headed Bear, cut all communities off.
0DI4000994	Use storm, sky. Disease. Fire, starvation... and the violence of the ignorant to ruin all who could... might stand against him.
0DI4000995	But the White Legs... they couldn't live on their own, like most scavengers. So gave them purpose - turned their hunger into a weapon.
0DI4000996	The wall of New Canaan... too high for Caesar. Too proud, maybe - or maybe something there, from his past, that needed killing. Memory of Graham.
0DI4000997	Helped them dig out Canaan supply caches, and other secrets the sands hid - bunkers, filled with powered weapons even the Brotherhood might desire.
0DI4000998	They called these new weapons "storm drums" in the firing of shells. Taught them the power in the casings... to channel the spirits in their guns.
0DI4000999	Me... they called me the Flag-Bearer. Glory in my hand, in my staff that still bore the weight of the Old World just as the symbol on my back did.
0DI4001000	I learned their weapons as a means of respect. And when it came their turn to pay respect to me... history came rushing back.
0DI4001001	Can't escape what's been done. History's there... no matter how far you walk.
0DI4001002	I walked the Great Salt Lake as Caesar's eye, then his hand.
0DI4001003	Mongrels there, two-legs and four. Saw the walls of New Canaan the scavengers circled... hadn't the strength or fire to take. Too high, too strong.
0DI4001004	White Legs, they were born for war, they run to it, hungry for battle... yet their hunger is to be a part of history, something larger.
0DI4001005	Like the Legion. As always, brought them a message - from Caesar.
0DI4001006	If New Canaan burns, Caesar might see them. "Might." Even the chance was a lie.
0DI4001007	To honor Caesar - destroy the history of New Canaan, and the way they carry it - in their generations and family.
0DI4001008	Caesar respects such strength, I told them. That - that was truth, even if "strength" wasn't the word. Obedience.
0DI4001009	You must be willing to kill anyone, children, mothers, the weak, elders... if these New Canaanites value the generations, that is what you must kill.
0DI4001010	It was like Vulpes was speaking through me. Use the night, silence, and fire to change their words to pleas, to screams.
0DI4001011	No need for bombs when hate will do.
0DI4001012	I... asked the White Legs to destroy a people with ancestry, going back thousands of years - another death of history, lost to time.
0DI4001013	The New Canaanites... they supplied medicine. Food, traded with others. Civilization, a hand from the past, not history...
0DI4001014	...but maybe a past deeper, farther than that to a place where this... God really exists.
0DI4001015	If so, his handiwork and people belong elsewhere, not in this place. Another symbol, like Bear and Bull, with no meaning in the present.
0DI4001016	The White Legs... meant to show respect, bribe me for Caesar's favor, echoing mannerisms and words...
0DI4001017	Showed them tech caches, taught them the workings of chamber and powder, spoke of Caesar's pride in those that used such things... lies. And...
0DI4001018	...and then... they tried to honor me - not the Legion.
0DI4001019	They brought me before the campfire one night, showed me how they changed themselves, how they wore their hair now.
0DI4001020	It was like my entire dead tribe in the firelight, teeth grinning red in the dark - eager corpses, blood-covered ghosts.
0DI4001021	They... had taken my braids, the way of the Twisted Hairs, as if it showed they were like me, of me...
0DI4001022	...while every knot in their braids spoke of raping, violence - and ignorance of what the knots meant. They thought to show respect... defiled it.
0DI4001023	Lost myself in trying to read the braids they wove, when I remembered they had put no meaning in it. They had no history of what it meant.
0DI4001024	They didn't even know the insult in the twists, knots... and Dry Wells came rushing back, the White Legs circled like that...
0DI4001025	It was like looking at the dead of my tribe, reborn as ghosts - hateful, hungry, bowing to Caesar. Another history... gone, carried by me alone.
0DI4001026	<Sneaky beeping>
0DI4001027	<Strained beeping>
0DI4001031	Got you.
0DI4001033	End of the road.
0DI4001034	We'll see what you stand for.
0DI4001035	<Combat beeping>
0DI4001049	Won't lose you again.
0DI4001050	Didn't walk through ash and hell to lose you now.
0DI4001051	<Alert music>
0DI4001052	Whatever it was, gone now.
0DI4001053	Comes back, we'll deal with it then.
0DI4001054	<Frustrated beeping>
0DI4001055	Must've taken cover.
0DI4001056	Gone to ground.
0DI4001057	<Scanning beeping>
0DI4001058	Gone.
0DI4001059	Must've took off. Won't leave - not yet.
0DI4001060	<Triumphant beeping>
0DI4001061	Comes back, I'll be ready.
0DI4001062	Courier'll show soon.
0DI4001065	End you.
0DI4001066	<Combat music>
0DI4001067	Movement.
0DI4001068	Found you.
0DI4001069	There.
0DI4001071	Something nearby.
0DI4001072	Hear something.
0DI4001073	<Warning beeping>
0DI4001074	Don't see anything.
0DI4001075	Can't be far.
0DI4001076	<Seeking beeping>
0DI4001078	Checking for movement.
0DI4001079	<Curious beeping>
0DI4001080	If that's what you wish.
0DI4001081	Then let's settle this.
0DI4001082	<Aggressive music>
0DI4001084	Next time, you won't get mercy.
0DI4001086	Scavenger.
0DI4001087	So it's to be my ending, then.
0DI4001089	My flag rests here.
0DI4001090	Bombs won't save you.
0DI4001093	I'll answer fire with fire.
0DI4001094	Gift from the Divide.
0DI4001095	Need to get some distance.
0DI4001096	Stronger than I thought.
0DI4001101	Let's see what you stand for.
0DI4001102	The Divide'll be your grave.
0DI4001103	Let's have an ending to this.
0DI4001104	<Violent music>
0DI4001106	Can hear the weight in your feet - you're bound for that Old World wall. Hoover Dam. Maybe not now - in time.
0DI4001109	Courier.
0DI4001110	Clearing the chamber?
0DI4001111	Better off saving ammo.
0DI4001112	Fire, and I won't take it lying down.
0DI4001113	Better be sure.
0DI4001114	A tactic of the Bear.
0DI4001115	Worthy of Hanlon.
0DI4001116	Watch the blast!
0DI4001118	<Grateful beeping>
0DI4001119	<Alarmed beeping>
0DI4001120	<Music>... RALPHIE... fly far, fly fast!
0DI4001123	Not now. Let's settle things here.
0DI4001124	If we're done here, let's leave the Divide behind. If we get separated, I'll meet you above Hopeville, near the Canyon Wreckage.
0DI4001125	Full circle, walked your road - now back again.
0DI4001126	Something else in you needing an answer?
