0NO0000006	Note: Patient checked himself in at the urging of friends regarding a serious dependency on the drug known as Jet. Preliminary tests show continued use of the drug is very dangerous due to the patient's pre-existing heart condition (coronary arterial disease). Under no circumstances should any sort of stimulant (like Psycho) be taken, particularly with the patient's current drug of choice.
0NO0000008	The last entry of the journal reads:
0NO0000009	Things finally seem to be turning around. I made a nice bundle of caps turning in some scrap in the last town I passed, and now I have a new traveling companion. Her name is Jacklyn, and she's pretty cute. I'm not going to get ahead of myself here, but things are looking up! And to think, I was actually beginning to doubt the power of my lucky necklace!
0NO0000012	Pearl really doesn't trust outsiders. Maybe if I improve my reputation with the Boomers, she'll change her mind.
0NO0000013	Hey, baby, I need to go have a chat with this farmer, Trent Bascom, over at the Sharecropper Farms about that water thing I've been boring you with. Hope I didn't wake you when I left. Back in awhile.
0NO0000014	- White
0NO0000015	If anyone other than me is reading this, it probably means I'm dead at the hands of whoever the NCR sent looking for Corporal White.
0NO0000016	I've bent or broken the law many times in my life, but it was always for the greater good. Such was the case with Corporal White. Killing him was regrettable but necessary - had he been allowed to interfere, Westside would've been cut off from the NCR's water and the crops here would wither and die. I wasn't going to let that happen.
0NO0000017	I've paid for my crime. Don't let the people of Westside suffer because of me.
0NO0000018	- Tom Anderson
0NO0000019	Dear Die-ary,
0NO0000020	I've been in this shack for almost a week now. Nothing is happening. I'm so bored. And this shack is so hot. And it's totally ruining my hair. It's like, so hard to find dye this color in the wasteland. This sucks, I want to be a ghoul now. I hate all this waiting. Life, ugh, living is so overrated.
0NO0000022	Good news Die-ary! I think it's finally starting to happen. Ok, so I do feel like, totally miserable (what else is new ha-ha-ha) and my skin is starting to peel off, but I'm pretty sure that is the first step. Oh, and my hair! I finally got it just the way I like it and now it starts coming out. Why does ghoulification have to be so unfair?
0NO0000024	I'm so done being confined in this human body. So, today I moved in to the shack at the abandoned test site. There should be enough radiation there to turn me into a ghoul. All around me this world is bleak and dreadful; is it so wrong to want a body to match it? I wonder what color my skin will turn and if I'll be able to find a good shade of lipstick to go with it. Probably not. God, everything is so miserable.
0NO0000025	I managed to get Ranger Morales' corpse away from the Fiends. I should return to Pvt. Morales and let her know her husband's body is safe.
0NO0000026	What does it mean?  Why was there a blue star under my bottle cap?  Are the Red's behind this?  Is this part of their mind control?  They must be making me see things now, things that shouldn't be there.  The star shouldn't be there, why do I see a star?  It won't go away.  No matter how long I close my eyes it won't go away.  I want the star to go away!
0NO0000027	I saw one of the guys in the mess hall pull a bottle cap off a Sunset Sarsaparilla and then run to his room.  I knew he was hiding something so I broke into his room when he wasn't there and saw the bottle cap.  It had a blue star underneath it.  I think he's been marked for something but I can't figure out what.  All I know is I want that bottle cap.
0NO0000028	Pacer,
0NO0000029	Your Jet's safe with me, you little fucking punk. Come and get it if you can.
0NO0000032	I've taken your Jet to make up some of what you owe. If you want it back, you know where to find me.
0NO0000034	To my dearest Ellen,
0NO0000035	We're in a tough spot here and none of the men expect to make it out alive. Things look pretty grim. I'm writing this so that if anything happens to me, you know how much you meant to me.
0NO0000036	I was foolish to join the NCR and leave you behind and I've regretted it every second of every day that I've been here. My only wish now is to see you again and hold you in my arms. The only thing that keeps me going are my thoughts of you.
0NO0000037	Just know that I made mistakes, but you were the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm sorry, and I love you.
0NO0000038	Harry
0NO0000039	Dear Janey,
0NO0000040	If you're reading this, that means I didn't make it. I want you to know that you were the most important thing in my world. You were my sun, my moon, my stars. Even out here on the battlefield I thought of you every minute of every day. At night, I put your picture on the bunk above me and looked into your beautiful eyes until I fell asleep.
0NO0000041	Even though I'm gone, know that I'll always be with you. Just close your eyes and think of me and I'll be there, right by your side.
0NO0000043	Dear Mom and Dad,
0NO0000044	If you're reading this, you know I won't be coming home.
0NO0000045	I'm sorry how this all ended. I'm sorry for all the times that I didn't listen to you. I'm sorry for storming out the way I did.
0NO0000046	But I want you to know that you are the best parents anyone could ever have. You gave me everything I could have ever wanted, and I only now see that.
0NO0000047	Thank you for everything.
0NO0000048	Your son,
0NO0000049	James
0NO0000050	Audrey,
0NO0000051	Things have gotten pretty grim since my last letter. The conditions here at Forlorn Hope just keep getting worse and worse - food is scarce, medicine and supplies are limited, and we're all scared out of our minds. We lose a handful of good men every day. It's hard seeing all your friends die.
0NO0000052	The Major does his best to inspire hope and confidence, but it's just not working any more. Too many people have died here. Dr. Richards is a good man, if a little odd, but there's just too many wounded for him to handle.
0NO0000053	Through all this strife, I take solace in the fact that I'm fighting to keep our family safe. And when the NCR wins this fight, it'll make the world a better place for all of us.
0NO0000054	Take care of the kids and I'll write you again soon.
0NO0000055	Ted
0NO0000056	Dear Ma and Pa,
0NO0000057	If you're getting this letter, then I'm sure you've already heard the news. I'm sorry, but know now that I'm in a better place. Tell Mikey I did good, okay?
0NO0000058	You were the best family ever and I hope I've made you all proud.
0NO0000059	Will
0NO0000060	To my darling Gracie,
0NO0000061	Know that I died fighting for what I believed in. I know you never understood why I had to do this, but I'm thankful that you supported me anyway. I appreciated every letter you sent. They gave me hope when we had none out here. You were always the one thing keeping me going, and I thank you for that. I wish that this could have turned out differently, but know that I loved you with all my heart.
0NO0000062	Geoff
0NO0000063	Dear Sister,
0NO0000064	They're sending me into the no-man's land tomorrow, and by the time you read this, I'll be dead. That means that once again you were right and I was wrong. Ever since we were kids, I was always a thorn in your side, always doing everything you told me not to. Now, as I'm about to go off to my death, I realize you were only looking out for me all these years. I'm so sorry.
0NO0000065	I can only hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
0NO0000066	Kevin
0NO0000067	To my brothers,
0NO0000068	If you're reading this, then I was probably killed by some slimy Legion scum who got lucky. Hopefully the bastard is dead and six feet under, but if not, you better avenge me or I will haunt you until the day you die.
0NO0000069	Quincy
0NO0000070	p.s. Kill all the Legion dogs that I wasn't able to.
0NO0000071	Blake ,
0NO0000072	Trent,
0NO0000073	I know no one in the NCR military believes you when you say water's gone missing, but I do. I'll meet up with you at the fields tomorrow and go over the evidence with you. Once I've confirmed my findings, I can go to Lieutenant Romanowski and get to the bottom of this once and for all.
0NO0000075	Boyd,
0NO0000076	Corporal White has once again been wasting my time with his crazy ideas about a water shortage. He was borderline insubordinate, and you need to put your people on a tighter leash. White's gone off to Westside to speak with that Follower of the Apocalypse, Tom Anderson, so look for him there.
0NO0000077	- Romanowski
0NO0000078	James,
0NO0000079	You and I served together for seven years, and I'm calling in a favor. I need you to convince General Oliver to stop transferring my men out of here and to deliver the replacements I was promised. I'm expected to put these prisoners to work making new rail lines and fixing the existing ones, but I can't do that if I don't have any guards to keep an eye on them. Does the general really expect the handful of men I have left to be able to keep several dozen hardened men in line?
0NO0000080	You owe me for that one time in Modoc. Don't let me down.
0NO0000081	Nathan
0NO0000082	Tyrone, you cheating bastard. Those supplies were paid up in full - you can't just raise the price all of a sudden. I can't afford the price, and besides, what am I going to tell Melissa?
0NO0000083	When you get this note, come up to Sloan. We need to talk.
0NO0000084	- Chomps
0NO0000085	Dearest Andrew,
0NO0000086	Writing this seems pretty morbid, but tomorrow we march into the no man's land between our camp and Nelson, which is crawling with Legion. The Major insisted I write this damn "if you get this, I'm dead" letter so here it is. What a crock. I have the luck of the devil and your love on my side, so I'll be home soon. Keep the porch light on for me.
0NO0000087	We'll party in New Vegas when I get back.
0NO0000088	I love you.
0NO0000089	Devin
0NO0000090	Dear Edna,
0NO0000091	Lost all our money at the casinos. Send more ASAP. Will get it all back. Trust me.
0NO0000092	Lenny
0NO0000093	Billy, don't be mad, but I lost all our savings at The Tops last night. It's not my fault, I was on a hot streak and was up 2000 caps, but then I had a run of bad luck and lost it all. I'm going to go see if I can scrounge up a few caps and try to get it all back. Please don't hate me.
0NO0000094	Sue
0NO0000095	Hey Mom!
0NO0000096	I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that I didn't lose all my money on the 'silly gambling games' as you call them. The bad news is that I lost all my money on one of the girls at Gomorrah. You would have liked her though, she was a real classy lady. Well, since there's nothing left for me here and I'm all out of caps, I'll be heading home soon.
0NO0000097	Love you!
0NO0000099	Nicole,
0NO0000100	All my years of hard work have finally paid off. I hit the jackpot last night over at The Tops! I'll have to use a lot of the money to pay off some of the debts I've accrued over the years, but there is plenty left over to live well for the rest of our lives. I told you it'd happen!
0NO0000101	See you soon!
0NO0000103	Bruce,
0NO0000104	I think it's time we see other people. We're just not a good fit anymore. Besides, I met this amazing and rich guy at The Ultra-Luxe last night. He's a real winner, not a dirty farmhand like yourself.
0NO0000105	I never want to see you again.
0NO0000106	Lacy
0NO0000107	Dear Tracy,
0NO0000108	Things have been going well for me here in Vegas. I've had pretty decent luck at the tables lately and have been able to almost break even. I'm going to hit the roulette tables again tomorrow - I'm going to win big this time, real big. I can feel it.
0NO0000109	Wish me luck!
0NO0000110	Mark
0NO0000111	Dear Bravo Company,
0NO0000112	Being transferred to the NCR Embassy on the Strip has been the greatest thing that has happened to me since joining the NCR. It's a pretty easy gig watching the troopers during the day and making sure they don't get in trouble and then we get to spend our free time hanging out at the bars and clubs, getting drunk and partying.
0NO0000113	Wish you were here.
0NO0000114	Private Seamer
0NO0000115	To: Private Humphreys
0NO0000116	This has been the best 3-day pass yet. I learned my lesson early and ditched the casinos for the girls at Gomorrah. Now that is money well spent. You can't get that kind of service at Camp Golf.
0NO0000117	Going to sleep now while it's daylight and head back out to Gomorrah tonight for one last hurrah.
0NO0000118	Private Watkins
0NO0000119	To: Private Jackson
0NO0000120	This is the last time I take your advice. I went to the bar at Gomorrah, like you said. I got piss drunk, kicked out after getting too friendly with the dancers, fell into the gutter and puked all over myself before being picked up by some MP's.
0NO0000121	Next thing I know I'm waking up in the drunk tank two days later. Thanks for wasting my pass, jerk.
0NO0000122	Private Daniels
0NO0000123	To: Private Erwin
0NO0000124	If I hear of you pulling another prank on one of my troopers that causes them to return to duty without their clothing fully intact, I will personally make sure you get transferred to Camp Forlorn Hope and don't come back.
0NO0000125	I'll be watching you.
0NO0000126	Lt. Ashville
0NO0000127	Angela, my sweet.
0NO0000128	How slowly time crawls without the touch of your lips. I know you're still angry I enlisted, but I did it for you and for country - I won't have Legion scum anywhere near you or on NCR soil. Those red-skirted pansies don't stand a chance against me, don't you worry your pretty little head.
0NO0000129	Soon as my tour's up, I'll be home and you'll be in my arms again. I'll have a ring in my pocket and a question to pop. You know what I mean.
0NO0000130	Yours always,
0NO0000131	Elaine
0NO0000132	These past few years, the very idea of "fine dining" has seemed beyond our grasp; indeed, where does one even begin to look for something artfully prepared and beautifully presented by a world-class chef? Well, fellow epicures, I have found the on place left on this Godforsaken earth with Real Food.
0NO0000133	I present to you the Ultra-Luxe.
0NO0000134	Ignore the rabble on the street, the petty farmers and everyman-types rubbing their pitiful few caps together in an attempt to elevate themselves to some semblance of class. Ignore the filthy, disease-ridden prostitutes of the Gomorrah, whoring themselves to anyone with coin. Walk briskly to the fabulous Ultra-Luxe, the only building in New Vegas worth your attention (you'll know it when you see it). Enter the doors of their restaurant, the Gourmand, and speak with the lovely Marjorie - she'll arrange for your care.
0NO0000135	Dally not, for reservations must be made as early as possible. A sumptuous feast awaits you, dear friends.
0NO0000136	Those gangsters at the Tops cheated me. I know it, they're cheats and liars and thieves, their games are rigged. I've lost every last cap, every NCR bill I had left. Those slot machines, you can never win. They're programmed to just make you lose lose lose. Their cards are marked so their dealers can cheat you, I promise you this. Invisible ink or something. And their roulette tables? Please, what a joke. The ball must be magnetic, and they can tell it to land wherever they want. The people that do win there are plants, employees. There's no way I could have lost like that unless they were cheating, no way. No way.
0NO0000137	Those fancy suits can't buy them class, they're just a bunch of damn con men. They've taken everything from me. I have nothing left. Nothing...
0NO0000138	What am I going to do? I was supposed to win big here, this is where dreams happen. People told me I could make a fortune here, I just had to have the caps, and I could win myself a new future, now it's all gone, all gone...
0NO0000139	Cooke,
0NO0000140	This man has been useful to us down here at the prison, and he's been of great help keeping the NCR away. Since he's proven to be competent and trustworthy,  I sent him in your direction. Maybe he can help.
0NO0000141	If so, we're even.
0NO0000144	This woman has been useful to us down here at the prison, and she's been of great help keeping the NCR away. Since she's proven to be competent and trustworthy, I sent her in your direction. Maybe she can help.
0NO0000147	BUILDING A DECK
0NO0000148	Caravan decks are comprised of at least 30 cards from one or more traditional playing card sets. The deck may have any number of cards of any type that suits a player's strategy, although it cannot have duplicate cards from the same set. For example, a King of Spades from Set A and a King of Spades from the Set B deck is acceptable, but more than one King of Spades from Set A would be illegal.
0NO0000149	RULES
0NO0000150	Caravan is played with two players building three opposing piles (or "caravans") of numbered cards. The goal is to outbid your opponent's caravan with the highest value of numbered cards without being too light (under 21) or overburdened (over 26).
0NO0000151	The game begins with each player taking eight cards from their deck and placing either one numerical card or ace on each caravan. Players may not discard during this initial round.
0NO0000152	Once both players have started their three caravans, each player may do ONE of the following on their turn:
0NO0000153	1. Play one card and draw a new card from his or her deck to their hand.
0NO0000154	2. Discard one card from their hand and draw a new card from his or her deck.
0NO0000155	3. Disband one of their three caravans by removing all cards from that pile.
0NO0000156	Caravans have a direction, either ascending or descending numerically, and a suit. The suit is determined with the first card placed on a caravan, the direction by the second. All subsequent cards must continue the numerical direction or match the suit of the previous card. Cards of the same numerical value cannot be played in sequence, regardless of suit. Face cards can be attached to numeric cards in any caravan and affects them in various ways.
0NO0000157	CARD VALUES
0NO0000158	Joker: Played against ace, 2-10. Effects change based on whether it's an ace or a numbered card (see below). Multiple jokers may be played on the same card.
0NO0000159	Ace: Value of 1. Jokers played on aces remove all other non-face cards of the ace's suit from the table. E.g. a joker played on an Ace of Spades removes all spades (except face cards and that card, specifically) from the table.
0NO0000160	2-10: Listed value. Jokers played on these cards remove all other cards of this value from the table. E.g. a joker played on a 4 of Hearts removes all 4s (other than that card, specifically) from the table.
0NO0000161	Jack: Played against ace, 2-10. Removes that card, along with any face cards attached to it.
0NO0000162	Queen: Played against ace, 2-10. Reverses the current direction of the hand and changes the current suit of the hand. Multiple queens may be played on the same card.
0NO0000163	King: Played against ace, 2-10. Adds the value of that card again. E.g. a king played on a 9 adds 9 to that hand. Multiple kings may be played on the same card for multiplicative effects. E.g. 4+ king = 8. 4 + 2 kings = 16.
0NO0000164	WINNING
0NO0000165	A player's caravan is considered sold when the value of its cards is over 20 and under 27. The other player may still outbid by increasing the value of their opposing pile while staying within the 21-26 range. When each of the three competing caravans has sold, the game is over. In the event that one of the three caravan values are tied between players, the game continues until all three caravans have sold. The player with two or more sales wins the pot.

0NO0000178	With the President's arrival today, security is running a final sweep of the area making preparations.
0NO0000179	Only members of the security team will have weapons at the President's speech. This means that all Troopers at the speech must relinquish their weapons beforehand.
0NO0000180	We will limit people allowed to see the speech to a small number to reduce any potential risk to the President.
0NO0000181	I've gotten word that the President is traveling with only two Rangers, so our security team will need to be on full alert.
0NO0000182	I'd still like to log my concerns about not having enough time to prepare for this, but we'll do our job here today.

0NO0000222	The Mormons are warming up to the idea of a Crimson Caravan branch being established in New Canaan. Naturally, the taxes are such that we'll be at a severe disadvantage to their own caravans.
0NO0000223	The long-term solution is to overwhelm them with a flood of cheap NCR goods. I'll have to call in some favors with our contacts back in California, but the potential profit margins are worth it.
0NO0000224	Efforts to "encourage" Henry Jamison to resign have so far failed. His parents are proving stubborn as well - obviously, they don't want him around anymore than I do. Getting the New Vegas branch up and running should have been a simple job for him, but this place is still as crude and primitive as any frontier branch. Very irritating.
0NO0000225	Alice -
0NO0000226	Your push for a new tariff on Gun Runner weapons didn't make it past the Senate. They've got too much pull in California. We're going to have to find some other way to get the upper hand in the weapons market.
0NO0000227	- Jason Tagg, Modoc Branch Manager
0NO0000228	McCarran has requested more frequent supply runs to their outlying outposts. I've been able to negotiate additional terms in our favor, but I may need to lower our hiring standards to meet the demand. I'm already concerned about the reliability of some of the caravaneers. Were it not for the work contracts, I know some of them would have run off a long time ago.
0NO0000229	Nobody seems to believe in hard work anymore.
0NO0000232	Seasonal Casualty/Loss/Injury Summary:

0NO0000252	Friday:
0NO0000253	* Rabid jackal wandered into camp providing much needed target practice.
0NO0000254	* Found crate of rifles in with some rations shipped last week - where are all these surplus weapons coming from?

0NO0000275	After Action for Incident FS-87,
0NO0000276	Victims include 4 NCR Militiamen - squad was most likely on an unregistered patrol as they were not being observed until after the attack. Assailants believed to be raiders (likely Great Khans) with hunting dogs (two dog corpses were left in the scuffle - tracks suggest as many as a dozen in the attacking pack).
0NO0000277	Threat Assessment: Trivial. Great Khans with dogs present virtually no matter of trouble. Incident likely caused by unskilled NCR patrolmen failing to radio us for an eyes-on backup.
0NO0000278	Radioed HQ with report at 12:40, received Hanlon's confirmation at 12:42 that he received the details.
0NO0000279	Chavez at the NCR Correctional Facility wants you to pick the lock to his cell.
0NO0000280	Pending the successful launch of ARCHIMEDES II, we ought to be able to begin field trials with the handheld rangefinder within a few weeks.
0NO0000281	Our small-scale tests have already proven the viability of sending power as microwave radiation from the plant to a remote receiver and converting it back into a useable form. All that remains is to extrapolate it to full scale and then prove out the long-range communication/targeting system on the rangefinder.
0NO0000282	Brig. Gen. Scott Lowe of the U.S. Army will be visiting the facility starting next Monday and staying onsite indefinitely.  When ARCHIMEDES goes live, he will be the only person here allowed to authorize its use for anything other than a test. Civilian employees are not required to salute, but it is expected of everyone that you observe thorough grooming and hygiene regimens and dress neatly while the general is with us. The general expects the best from all his men, and Poseidon men should be no different in the presence of such a fine and decorated soldier.
0NO0000284	As a member of the Poseidon Family, it will be natural for you to become enthusiastic about the incredible endeavors you'll be undertaking with us, and to want to tell others. But just a second there, my good man! Let's take a minute to consider what could happen if company information fell into the wrong hands, and whose hands those might be.
0NO0000285	"Can I tell my wife?" Well, let's say you do. You tell her not to tell anyone. Your bond is sacred. But a woman's idle tongue is the devil's plaything. No sooner do you leave for work the next day than she's on the phone telling her best friend Candy. Then Candy tells Gertie, Gertie tells Maxine, Maxine tells Lulu, and while Lulu is telling Doris, a Chinese agent posing as an American operator listens in, and the next thing she's on the line with the Forbidden City, singing like a treasonous canary. The following day you and your wife are bound in shackles and China is sitting at the controls of our entire arsenal.
0NO0000286	"Can I tell my children?" What father wouldn't want his kids to look up to him? Don't be that father. One day at school, Ivan Bullykov will get more than lunch money out of your kids. He'll have national secrets! And while they're parading him through Red Square as a national hero, your children will be working in forced labor camps, right next to you and your beautiful young wife, who's now wrinkled and homely since the communists have banned makeup because it expresses individuality.
0NO0000287	"Can I tell my drinking buddies?" Surely if there's somewhere safe a man can place his trust, it is with his other male friends. But how much do you really know about them? Are they friends... or *comrades*? Don't be too sure. Even the most transparent window can hide secrets when it's lined with Iron Curtains.
0NO0000288	Always remember: you are a member of two families now. And you have obligations to both. But your obligation to the Poseidon Family is greater, because while your children may misbehave and your friends may change and your wife may nag and cheat on you, Poseidon Energy will always be paying for and protecting your way of life. Don't tell anybody about anything about the projects of Poseidon Energy. When pressed, tell them that your job is repetitive and not worth discussing, but the Company is nurturing and gives good benefits and is always looking for new talent.
0NO0000289	On Tuesday February 16 at 2 PM, technicians will be running a test of ARCHIMEDES and its connectivity with our plant security system. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any employee be outdoors on the plant grounds until the alarm klaxon has ceased and an all-clear is given. We have death and dismemberment waivers from all employees on file and are not responsible for any accidents that should occur during this procedure.
0NO0000290	Protective eyewear is MANDATORY for all technicians observing from the tower deck.

0NO0000293	Major,
0NO0000294	This is to inform you that a small sniper nest has been successfully set up near Cottonwood Cove as requested. The nest should have some bedding and a small amount of supplies, but no weaponry.
0NO0000295	The sniper should be forewarned that the position is close to the enemy camp and upon completing his or her objective, should get the fuck out of there as soon as flamingly possible.

0NO0000305	You and I are well aware of the situation you're in, so I apologize in advance for the contents of this letter. Due to Camp Forlorn Hope's position as a high alert combat zone and the exceedingly high mortality rate of troopers assigned there, you are hereby ordered to pull all female NCR personnel (including non-combatants) from the field and give them marching orders to Camp McCarran for reassignment. Absolutely no female NCR personnel are to be stationed at Camp Forlorn Hope until further notification.

0NO0000329	This ledger is an extensive record of the Legion's prior dealings with tribal societies it has encountered in its expansion.
0NO0000330	Of particular interest is the fate of the Twisted Hair tribe of Arizona, who formed an alliance with Caesar to serve as his army's scouts during the conquest of that region. Once the Arizona wastes were pacified, the Legion turned on its erstwhile allies, stripped them of their tribal identity, and forced them into slavery. Those who resisted were crucified along the remains of Interstate 40.

0NO0000362	The Strip - Omerta Activity
0NO0000363	The receptionist at Gomorrah has proved invaluable for her services. Most of her tips have been fairly minor, however she did help us intercept a shipment of drugs as they were coming through Freeside.
0NO0000364	We don't currently have any pending investigations, but she will receive a few "prepayments" for information. That should keep her fairly supple if the need arises to go to her for a tip in the future.

0NO0000366	This journal consists of detailed records and observations from Karl's time with the Great Khans. Many of the entries go into great detail about his opinion of their "savage, barbarous customs," and at several points he waxes philosophic about how it's very likely that Caesar's Legion will have to execute the lot of them.
0NO0000369	The NCR at Camp Forlorn Hope are short on supplies. Quartermaster Mayes is looking for Holotags to track fallen soldiers and reallocate inventory. Your assistance will be appreciated.

0NO0000386	I won't be around for a while, but if everything works out right, you and me are a date, got it? Wouldn't miss it for all the caps in Vegas.
0NO0000387	Now don't get clingy and try to follow me.
0NO0000388	Ciao,
0NO0000390	Robert Edwin House, 261, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip, industrialist and technologist, founder, President, and CEO of the multi-billion-dollar pre-war robotics and software corporation, RobCo Industries, has died.
0NO0000391	Generally recognized by Mr. House to be mankind's only hope of long-term survival, Mr. House's passing may well sound a death knell for the entire human race.
0NO0000392	Lost forever is his bounty of knowledge concerning human longevity, the depth and breadth of which could, as he was apt to say, "fill several text books." He was not exaggerating. Though he did not achieve his goal of functional immortality, let us not forget that he died at the age of 261. How many people do that? I mean, come on.
0NO0000393	Also lost forever are House's singular personality, force of will, vision, and leadership ability. The probability of an equally capable figure emerging from the current human population to lead mankind to a future of equivalent quality is less than 0.000112% by objective measures too complex to detail in this obituary.
0NO0000394	Personality and force of will: Born June 25th, 2020, House was orphaned at an early age when his parents died in a freak accident (auto gyro, lightning). Though cheated of his inheritance, House attended the prestigious Institute in Massachusetts and founded RobCo Industries on his 22nd birthday. Within five years, it was one of the most profitable corporations on Earth.
0NO0000395	Vision: By 2065, House was certain that an atomic war would soon devastate the planet. At great personal expense, he developed technologies to ensure the structural integrity of the city of Las Vegas (as it was known at the time). On the day of the great war, 77 atomic warheads targeted the city. Mr. House defeated them all. Talk about vision!
0NO0000396	Leadership: Mr. House survived the war, of course, and would later recruit the Three Families, negotiate the Treaty of New Vegas, and rebuild the Vegas Strip. While these achievements yielded many immediate benefits, they were all part of House's master plan to re-ignite mankind's quest for technological advancement, a plan without which the human race has nowhere to go, and nowhere to turn.
0NO0000397	/// Will revise and finish this up later. Have set the age at death to update automatically. Obit makes salient points but "pearls before swine," of course. Let's hope the ingrates never have cause to read it. Who knows how many of them are even literate!
0NO0000398	Upon further reflection, I have determined that it is my best interests, and the best interests of the New California Republic, to transfer sovereignty of the Vegas Strip to the NCR.
0NO0000399	If all terms are agreed upon, annexation would occur one year from today.
0NO0000400	a) I am to be granted full status as a citizen of the NCR and immunity from prosecution for any activities prior to annexation.
0NO0000401	b) I will be recognized as the sole proprietor of the Vegas Strip, a commercial property.
0NO0000402	c) I will be subject to all laws of the NCR, including personal and property taxes.
0NO0000403	d) NCR functionaries will police the Strip; I will retire my Securitron police force and limit their movement to the grounds and interior of the Lucky 38.
0NO0000404	Please confirm that these terms are agreeable. I do not foresee any objections on your part.
0NO0000405	Robert Edwin House

0NO0000407	The New Vegas Strip
0NO0000408	Raul,
0NO0000409	Rhonda made me angry so I threw this. Now it doesn't seem to work.
0NO0000410	Please fix.
0NO0000411	Female, Age: 24
0NO0000412	Patient came seeking treatment for 'panic attacks'. Patient claims to often experience moments of extreme terror out of nowhere and that they often wake her from her sleep.
0NO0000413	Male, Age: 22
0NO0000414	Patient came to use claiming to be insane. Patient claimed he would often get the feeling of being 'outside' himself. This feeling was so intense that it would cause the patient to be off balance during episodes. Navigation through the clinic often difficult for him to achieve with out causing accidents.
0NO0000415	Male, Age: 31
0NO0000416	1687865 often misinterprets other's actions as hostile. He perceives friendly interactions with nurses as patronizing. We've also noticed that the longer other patients remain in contact with 1687865 the more readily they are to act aggressively towards him (due to 1687865's defensive nature) thus reinforcing 1687865's perceived hostility.
0NO0000417	Male, Age: 34
0NO0000418	Patient brought in by the police. This is the ninth occurrence of such and we are now seeking extended residence for the patient within our facility.
0NO0000419	Male, Age: 27
0NO0000420	Patient brought in by police. Patient claims to be hearing voices taunting him. Patient claimed that he, at one point, believed these voices were coming from his grandfather's radio. The patient now believes that the voices are coming from within himself and he is eager for help.
0NO0000421	Chief Fire Officer Report No. F1-218
0NO0000422	The local police department diverted several trucks from San Onofre carrying nuclear waste to Searchlight this morning.  I didn't get all of the details but I heard something about bombs going off nearby and that the trucks were being diverted for safety reasons.  Two of them were housed here at the Fire Station.  The third had to continue on to somewhere else because we didn't have enough room to accommodate them all.  For some odd reason it was headed toward Cottonwood Cove. I don't know what he's planning on doing with it down there.
0NO0000423	A few of our best men headed out around the same time as the patrols without my knowing about it. When I asked the Elder, he said they were on an important mission. Too important to tell his Chief of Security about? Something's up...
0NO0000424	People are really starting to get antsy around here. I've had to break up three fights this week alone. If the lockdown continues for much longer, p-
0NO0000425	Hold that thought, I've got a stranger approaching the outer door. Might have to do a meet and greet.
0NO0000427	Hold that thought, I've got Veronica and a stranger approaching the outer door. She's not scheduled back yet, but that's never stopped her before, I suppose...
0NO0000429	Hold that thought, I've got what looks to be one of our patrols returning. Only one of them, though. There must've been trouble.
0NO0000430	This is maddening! All of my research thus far points to a company called Poseidon Energy as having experimented far beyond the capabilities of our current power armor and weapons. It is possible they were behind the development of the equipment the Enclave used as well. Why then have we found numerous caches of military-grade equipment throughout the wastes, and nothing from this company?
0NO0000431	I have just discovered something horrifying. If my projections are right, we must-- but I shouldn't get ahead of myself. The Elder will know what to do. He must.
0NO0000432	It's been a hard day. I think I lost more than twice as many as I saved. At a guess, I'd say we've lost a little over half our number, and all for some broken down solar energy station that barely works. I think if Elder Elijah hadn't gone missing I might have refused to treat him. Would have served the prick right.
0NO0000433	Edit: God, I haven't looked over these in a while. I remember writing this like it was yesterday. Who would have imagined I'd spend the next few years of my life trapped underground?
0NO0000434	Nothing much to report this week. Just a few cases of mild respiratory problems. Come to think of it, there were a number of respiratory problems last week, too. I should talk to Lorenzo. Maybe something's breaking down.
0NO0000435	Damn that Taggart! I got stuck scheduling the junior scribes' experiments again! It's bad enough that we're stuck down here with one another, but of all the Brotherhood Scribes in the waste I get stuck with a lecherous scatterbrain for a boss.
0NO0000436	Perhaps Hardin is right. Maybe it IS time for a change.
0NO0000437	The Elder has asked me to provide a list of possible locations for the components needed. Unfortunately, our reconnaissance of the area is lacking due to Elijah's insistence that we concentrate all efforts on HELIOS. Ibsen and I have managed to retrieve some information from the datastore on sites of potential interest, but they are mostly military and industrial locations. If only I knew if there are other bunkers, or even one of those old RobCo vaults in the area!
0NO0000438	The goal of the Hidden Valley project is to create a self-sustaining shelter for high-ranking VIPs that can serve as a command structure in times of crisis. The bunker itself is located several hundred feet below the surface. Multiple layers of reinforced materials serve to prevent a breach of the inhabitable areas by anything save for a direct hit by a bunker-busting weapon utilizing a megatonnage considered outside the capability of America's closest competitors. In the event that our enemies become capable of such an attack, the bunker's DERVISH camouflaging system makes targeting the site impossible for automated systems, forcing aggressors to rely on guesswork and sheer luck.
0NO0000439	The Hidden Valley Bunker relies on two main systems:
0NO0000440	The CANDLE Fusion Power system provides power to all bunker systems. Built more for reliability and duration of service, the power output of the system has been exceeded by many current designs, but it can supply the bunker with power for an estimated 752 years.
0NO0000441	The DERVISH Camouflage system provides visual and electronic interference to prevent airborne or long-range enemy weapons from targeting the bunker. The normal soil around Hidden Valley has been supplemented with a combination of aluminum and various silicates, which are then dispersed using a widespread network of industrial fans to blanket the area in a cloud of what is essentially chaff. Combined with the electronic countermeasures of the nearby array at Black Mountain, the bunker at Hidden Valley is effectively impossible to target.
0NO0000442	We've begun to take stock of what's left here, but my first impression is "not much." The equipment here is in terrible condition, and will require extensive repairs to get even minimal power production started. Looks like we've got our work cut out for us, boys.
0NO0000443	Johnson, I've come across a crate with a couple of suits made of a material I don't even recognize. Do you know what the hell this is? Looks like pre-war tech to me. The eggheads we have down here are mostly glorified mechanics, so they just scratched their heads when I showed it to them.
0NO0000444	Remember those suits I told you about? Gone. Some jackass ordered a complete reorganization of our storage system and now I can't find anything. Wonderful. I guess they'll turn up sooner or later.
0NO0000445	Still no word from the missing patrols. I was beginning to get my hopes up that the Elder was close to ending the lockdown when they were sent out, but now...
0NO0000446	This recipe allows you to make a Dog Tag Fist.
0NO0000448	Everything is upside down now, all of my superiors are gone and there's no one left but myself and a handful of soldiers. I've been following a strict patrol schedule since the incident, making sure to cover the roads leading into Camp Searchlight. I like to keep myself moving in order to catch any wayward travelers who may not know the dangers that now lurk within the town. I don't think I could forgive myself if someone got past me and went into that hell hole of a place.  So far I've been able to maintain enough energy that I'm never away from any point on my patrol for long. I wonder how long before I can't keep going anymore?
0NO0000449	This recipe allows you to make Turbo.
0NO0000450	I'm having a competition to boost morale. Bring me an ear from every Legion you kill and I'll keep track at the mess hall. Only one ear per kill!
0NO0000451	-James Sexton
0NO0000461	It took some doing, but a few of us got together and managed to distract the people in the clinic long enough for me to get in and do some looking around, I found restraints and enough sedatives to kill a horse. She must be using them to control us, to make us forget, we're just pawns in her sick game.
0NO0000462	We confronted the doctor today, she refused to give us any information, and we were thrown out of the clinic, some of us quite literally. We tried talking to the overseer, but acted as if he didn't know anything about it. I don't believe him, I don't trust him, and I don't trust any of them.
0NO0000463	Some of the Blues caused some trouble in the clinic today. I bet they were stealing drugs, I've heard the vents coming on late at night, others have too, and I bet they are using the drugs to poison us; stealing supplies from the clinic and using them to kill us all.
0NO0000464	No, I know the truth, the commotion at the clinic, it was a trick, the doctor must be giving them the drugs, and she must be in on it. She never leaves her office; it must be because of the poison being pumped through the vents. Her office must be the only one that is safe.
0NO0000465	There's something strange about that other overseer; I think he's up to something. Maybe we were given different orders? Maybe this is all just in my head; the experiments we are conducting must be starting to affect me. The noises, I'm sure there is a perfectly logical explanation for them. I'll have write him, after all we aren't to be seen speaking to each other. Tomorrow then, maybe after a good night's sleep my mind will be in better order.
0NO0000466	Again, not two hours after I had fallen, asleep I heard that noise again, it's mechanical, like something heavy being pushed then, it's hard to describe, something that sounds like an elevator perhaps? I've seen the blueprints of the vault, there's no way there could be an elevator there; what would it lead to? I think I'll take a walk around on the second floor, it is late no one will notice me, besides if anyone did it might be good for the experiment anyway.
0NO0000467	I saw the Red's overseer walking around on our floor last night, he looked like he was searching for something and he was mumbling to himself.
0NO0000468	-data corrupted-
0NO0000469	... fake medical records. Paranoia must be induced through non-violent and non-chemical means in order for the experiment to be considered a success.
0NO0000471	...a group of technicians have been assigned to run the reactor, they are currently researching methods to improve the reactor efficiently. The reactor floor is fully staffed and completely self sustained. The only access between the vault proper and the reactor level is through the elevator hidden under the desk in this room. Currently the password to open this passage is 'Hyacinth'; please change this password a...
0NO0000473	...has not been informed of the research being undertaken in the lower levels.
0NO0000474	Voices, I can hear them through the vents. They sound like plotting, they sound like hate, the Blues never sit with us, they treat us as if we have a disease; maybe we do, this whole vault is sick.
0NO0000475	The others keep telling me not to worry, but I feel it sometimes; I think there's something in here with us. I can always hear weird noises coming from above my room.
0NO0000476	I haven't been able to sleep lately, one of the Blues, he's always creeping around by the security door, and I think he's trying to get in.
0NO0000477	I think they're in my head, sometimes I hear thoughts not my own. I think the Reds have done something to the intercom system, rigged it somehow to broadcast into our brains.
0NO0000478	I've been reading the bulletin boards for months now; I believe we have a spy among us, one of the Reds pretending to be a Blue. They are using the bulletin boards to communicate; I believe they want me to see it.
0NO0000479	I've noticed one of the lights flickering past the door in the Reds' hallway. I believe it to be morose code, from what I can tell it's an S.O.S.
0NO0000480	Greetings residents,
0NO0000481	We regret to inform you that there is a problem with one of the water purification filters. We assure you that we are working diligently to fix this problem; however, until the filter has been fixed please try to keep water usage limited and report directly to the clinic if you begin to feel ill in anyway.
0NO0000482	I can hear noises through the intercoms sometimes, dad says he can't hear it, but I can. It's really high pitch and sometimes I can hear a voice, but I can't make out the words. Mom says it's my imagination and that I shouldn't talk about it, that it might worry people, but I've talked to some of the other kids, they say they've heard it too.
0NO0000483	I've been asking around, there is no reason for those filters to fail, it must have been sabotaged, there's a rumor going around that one of the Reds did it. It wouldn't surprise me, whenever I walk by a group of them in the cafeteria they all start whispering, I bet they're plotting out what to do next.
0NO0000484	I couldn't sleep a few nights ago, so I stayed up reading, around 1:30 in the morning the vent above my bed began to push out more air than usual; it lasted for about five minutes then turned off. I did not think much of it at the time, but I had trouble falling asleep again last night; once again around 1:30 AM the vents turned on for about five minutes then turned off.
0NO0000485	I've been getting headaches; I think someone is poisoning us. I've been up every night this week, and night after night, an extra boost of air comes through the vents, it lasts for about five minutes, and then turns off. I spoke with one of the neighbors; he said he noticed the same thing in his room as well. We made a report the maintenance officer; he informed us that the system was running perfectly and that there was nothing to worry about, I don't believe him, maybe he's in on it.
0NO0000486	I don't trust that doctor; she has bodyguards, what kind of doctor has bodyguards? I've seen the guards bringing her meals; I don't think she ever leaves her office. There's always one posted outside at night too. I wonder what she's hiding.
0NO0000487	I've been working with a friend, he's been trying to hack into the doc's computer, and so far, we haven't had much luck.
0NO0000488	It took some convincing, but I finally got him to show me what he found on the doc's computer. He was right, I wouldn't like it. The patient files looked like those from an asylum, the patient names were all in code, but some of them seemed to fit the people around us. But they can't be us! I don't remember being insane, I think I would remember something like that. But, it must be true; it explains the doctor's behavior and the bodyguards, I don't know why I can't remember. It must be that doctor, maybe she's drugging us. I need to get into that office.
0NO0000489	Maybe, I am insane, maybe this isn't happening, maybe the war never happened, and maybe I'm just trapped in my head.
0NO0000491	Knight Torres in Hidden Valley wants me to find a laser pistol that's gone missing. The first thing to do is speak with the paladin in charge of the firing range to see if he remembers who was using it.
0NO0000492	To Whom It May Concern (You!),
0NO0000493	We got some pretty good stuff from the last raid, and unlike last time, I don't want any incidents. The only logical conclusion was to hide everything throughout this room. If you can read this, you have my permission to use any items you can find.
0NO0000494	Stuff I hid:
0NO0000495	1 Missile Launcher
0NO0000496	3 Missiles
0NO0000497	3 Bricks of C4
0NO0000498	5 Frag Grenades
0NO0000499	1 Super Stimpak
0NO0000500	Various Ammo
0NO0000501	Your Benevolent Supreme Overlord,
0NO0000503	Notice to all Regulators seeking Lawful Bounties in the Capital Wastes:
0NO0000504	Let it be known that the following individual is offered for bounty in the sum of 1,000 caps or similar compensation of expended equipment and/or medical expense, for crimes against the good people of the Capital Wasteland and environs:
0NO0000505	Name: [%]
0NO0000506	Race: [%]
0NO0000507	Sex: [%]
0NO0000508	Target is considered armed and extremely dangerous.
0NO0000509	Capture is NOT recommended -- Bounty will be paid upon proof of death (head).
0NO0000510	Let's put this devil in the ground and be done with it.
0NO0000511	Not many patrols out here lately, which means not much loot.  Our crew is thinking we should make a move soon.  Follow the tracks up north; head towards the Strip. You in?  Ain't on the chain gang anymore, but we still gotta stick together.
0NO0000512	Squad CG554-2 demonstrates a markedly increased proficiency in basic small-arms skill and CQB acumen. Squad accuracy is up 35% from previous examinations, and squad members work together as a cohesive unit to achieve goals.
0NO0000513	Final Analysis: Excellent
0NO0000514	Squad CG554-2 demonstrates consistently poor marksmanship and lacks basic firearms skills. Team coordination is minimal at best, and individual rivalries crop up frequently. Recommend further basic training and team-building exercises.
0NO0000515	Final Analysis: Poor
0NO0000516	Squad CG554-2 has shown good proficiency with explosive weapons, and has readily demonstrated the proper tactical uses of said weaponry. Based on this evaluation, full field certification is recommended.
0NO0000518	Squad CG554-2 has demonstrated an appalling lack of skill with regards to the basic explosive armaments of the NCR Army. It is, to speak frankly, a miracle they retain all of their limbs. Extensive retraining with dummy rounds is highly recommended.
0NO0000520	ACCESS DENIED - Ranger Detachment reports not available from this system.
0NO0000521	Major Polatli,
0NO0000522	Good intentions and a knife does not a doctor make.
0NO0000524	Richards
0NO0000525	Here's what I need you to research.
0NO0000526	1) Several casualty reports have come in saying that Alpha Station sustained heavy casualties and injuries in the vicinity of Hoover Dam - yet no new reinforcements have been sent in weeks. Speak with Senior Ranger Rebecca Lineholm, get an accurate casualty count and asses the situation, as several of us have been worried that something horrible is stalking the Hoover Dam area if it can claim NCR's elite Rangers.
0NO0000527	2) Ranger Station Bravo hasn't requested a resupply in four months. While the Rangers I can reach on the radio say things are 'just fine' I need you to speak to Ranger Ericsen, the commanding officer, and find out how they've been running on no supplies for so long.
0NO0000528	3) Charlie station received a substantial shipment of medical supplies despite having only a few serious injury reports. Check up on them and see if they have a surplus that could be redistributed to needed locations - I'm having a hard time getting anyone on the radio lately.
0NO0000529	4) Delta station radioed in a report of an NCR Trooper cadre being murdered to the last man in a horrifying display of brutality. The report mentioned a squad of Super mutants wearing Caesar's colors. This report has unsettled NCR command I need you to speak to Senior Ranger Pason to confirm the report and get an accurate count of Super mutants spotted.
0NO0000530	5) Echo Station has had a five-fold spike in reported enemy contacts, but NCR crews dispatched to follow up have a mere 10% success rate in intercepting these hostiles. The ghouls I've reached by the radio insist everything is 'just fine' but the numbers disagree - so speak Senior Ranger Erasmus for me please. Perhaps they're short-handed and need more spotters.
0NO0000531	6) Foxtrot station called in a report of an NCR Trooper patrol slaughtered by a Great Khan hunting team with trained Deathclaws. Senior Ranger Kudlow called in the report but I can't seem to contact her for a more detailed account of the incident - please to speak to her and confirm/deny this rather disturbing report.

0NO0000538	Camp Searchlight Quartermaster's Log
0NO0000539	Entry #1836
0NO0000540	Supplies being shipped to the camp recently are lower than usual. I asked the Comm Officer if there were any problems with communications and he insisted that everything was fine. I contacted our supply base and was simply told that all inventory requests were being filled and that every item on my request list had been shipped to the camp. Either I'm being lied to or someone is intercepting my shipments. I'll have to look into this matter further.
0NO0000542	Entry #2257
0NO0000543	During my off duty hours I decided to investigate the trade route being used to bring the supplies to the camp. I met a traveler on the road and asked him if he had seen any NCR supplies bound for Camp Searchlight. He told me he had seen some NCR crates being moved somewhere outside of Nipton but didn't know where they were being taken. He also mentioned that the men with the supplies didn't look like NCR soldiers. Next time I have enough time off I'll have to make my way to Nipton to see if anyone there knows where the supplies are.
0NO0000547	Cass wants you to supply a dozen bottles of whiskey for her Whiskey Challenge, after which she'll try to drink you under the table.
0NO0000548	Raquel, the Master at Arms for the Boomers, would be grateful if I brought her some missiles.
0NO0000549	Jack at Nellis is looking for scrap metal. He can't pay me, but earning the trust of people with that much artillery seems like a decent idea.
0NO0000550	Cuddles came in about his car again. He even brought a container of gas and asked if that would help. I tried to tell him that gas was not the problem, but he got really angry and dragged me outside. Tabitha killed him herself before things got too ugly.
0NO0000551	At least I don't have to hear about his damn car anymore.
0NO0000552	Tabitha came in today and said she's concerned about my safety. She's insisted that I change the lock on my door to require a password, using one of the other computers I fixed. I'm really starting to regret ever fixing those.
0NO0000553	The password is 123456789. Like anyone who cares will ever read this.
0NO0000554	As if I don't have enough pointless things to do here, Tabitha wants me to start keeping a log of all the repairs I do. So here's my first log entry. I fixed up several old terminals that were left over in the intact buildings here. I wonder what she's planning to use them for.
0NO0000555	Apparently, the mutants raided a caravan today. One of their rifles jammed. Took about seven minutes to fix. I also performed minor maintenance on the broadcasting tower outside. It's tempting to think that I could have just pulled a switch there and taken this accursed station off the air. No doubt she would have killed me soon afterward, but it might have been worth it just to see the look on her face.
0NO0000556	The mutant with the scar across his face, whom I've taken to calling Cuddles, stopped in today and asked me to fix his car. I told him that's outside my expertise and seriously thought he was going to kill me.
0NO0000557	Tried to escape today. Tabitha had one of her men beat me senseless when they caught me. Now they lock me up in the next room whenever I'm not working on something.
0NO0000558	Oh, and I fixed a toaster.
0NO0000559	Attention all structural engineers:
0NO0000560	There was a problem with the remote diagnostic protocols set up for the generators on the dam. It turns out that activating the remote diagnostics has a good chance to cause the generators to overload. Because of this the diagnostic program is going to be disabled.
0NO0000561	I've found it possible to create a sort of makeshift weapon using all of the dog tags I've been collecting over the past month. One of these days the NCR is going to pay for their continual mismanagement and idiotic bravado.
0NO0000562	The molerat Snuffles at Sloan appears to have injured his leg. Judging from the condition of the injury, it doesn't appear that any of the quarry workers have the appropriate medical skills to do anything about it.

0NO0000566	I've managed to get the password to Isley's computer. I'll forward it to you with the release notes to the Q-35. The prototype is going to be stopping here on its way to the Department of Defense. You should be able to intercept it on the road.
0NO0000568	Good afternoon. Each year it is the appointed task of the ombudsman not only to officiate the election, but to chronicle it in hopes that after the last overseer has finished his term and walked to his death in the chamber beneath his office, and the vault has become still, that one day some excavator from humanity or perhaps some yet-unknown race of super beings might find our records and incorporate them into historical canon.
0NO0000569	But lately it's occurred to me that that's not really why. I think the real reason we do it is because we want to believe that somewhere in the archives there's an answer to all of this, or perhaps there will be one when the historical records are completed and the whole story is told. We want it to make sense. To understand why the vault's mainframe will kill us if we do not offer one of our own as a yearly sacrifice. To fully comprehend why we continue to have these elections despite the unfettered corruption that has plagued it for what must be decades by now. There was a simpler time when elections meant shaking hands and kissing babies. But now with the rise of the voting blocs and this infestation of bribery, drug trafficking, smuggling, and God knows what else, we want to know why.
0NO0000570	Well I've been through the archives, and I can tell you you won't find the answer there. You'll find an account of the first overseer, who entered the vault as the only citizen aware of the sacrifices that would have to take place. But he didn't have the answers either. If he did, surely he would've foreseen the citizens' anger when he broke the news. Surely he would've guessed that they would want to choose a sacrifice democratically, in the way that we citizens are accustomed to washing our hands of terrible deeds, and that his name would be at the top of the polls, and that the simultaneous vacancy of overseer and martyr would forever fuse the two positions here in Vault 11. But he didn't. He had the answers no more than any of us, and the records state that after the citizens discovered that the sacrificial chamber's password was his wife Betty's first name, and its door was unsealed so he could be offered as the first sacrifice, he walked down into that room crying like a child.
0NO0000571	I can only wonder if there are no answers to be found, and we are just going along with this because we don't see another choice. Nevertheless, I still hold onto hope that we can find one. I urge you all to take the journey I took - to remember that it wasn't so long ago that we were ruled by our civility and our dignity, and that those were times when we didn't have to be quite so ashamed. Thank you.
0NO0000572	According to the text of a speech that was given or scheduled to be given in the Vault 11 Atrium on overseer election day, the terminal password is "Betty."
0NO0000573	Effective immediately, the traditional selection process for overseer is hereby ended. In lieu of a yearly election, a citizen will be chosen one month prior to the start of his or her term with our mainframe's random number generator, ensuring complete impartiality and fairness.
0NO0000574	Katherine Stone
0NO0000576	Excerpt from the deposition of the defendant Katherine Stone by Vault Attorney Gerard Miles
0NO0000577	Q. Okay, let's pick up where we left off, Kate.
0NO0000578	A. Katherine.
0NO0000579	Q. Sorry, right. Katherine. I keep forgetting.
0NO0000580	A. My husband calls me Kate.
0NO0000581	Q. You were telling us of a discussion you allegedly had with Roy Gottlieb of the Justice Bloc.
0NO0000582	A. Not allegedly. Had. We've been through this.
0NO0000583	Q. It's still just your word against his, Ms. Stone. But please, the discussion.
0NO0000584	A. [Sighs] He said my husband's name had come up in their meetings.
0NO0000585	Q. The candidate endorsement meetings?
0NO0000586	A. Yes. They were going to endorse him.  He wouldn't say why, but I know my husband had a regular poker game with some of them, and he'd been on a winning streak lately.
0NO0000587	Q. And according to you, what did Mr. Gottlieb offer?
0NO0000588	A. He said he could sway his bloc. Prevent the endorsement. But only if I...
0NO0000589	Q. Only if you what, Katherine?
0NO0000590	A. Only if I...
0NO0000591	Q. Only if you performed sexual favors.
0NO0000592	A. Yes.
0NO0000593	Q. Was this just for Mr. Gottlieb?
0NO0000594	A. No. All the bloc leadership. Their friends.
0NO0000595	Q. And you agreed.
0NO0000596	A. What else could I do? They had a majority.
0NO0000597	Q. How long did this go on before the endorsements came out?
0NO0000598	A. I don't know. A month, maybe.
0NO0000599	Q. And when they came out, and your husband was endorsed despite your supposed agreement, was that when you decided to kill members of the bloc?
0NO0000600	A. Yes. I thought, their majority is pretty slim. If I thinned things out a little, especially in the leadership, someone else might get elected.
0NO0000601	Q. Assuming you weren't caught.
0NO0000602	A. No, Mr. Miles. I expected to be caught. That was my best chance. Now they'll elect me.
0NO0000603	Q. A confessed murderer? You think voters would be willing to risk putting you in charge?
0NO0000604	A. They have to pick somebody and live with their reasons.
0NO0000605	Q. Yes, but-
0NO0000606	A. Wait and see.
0NO0000607	Fellow Citizens,
0NO0000608	Due to the tragic events of the past few days, the Coalition of Vault 11 Voting Blocs has unanimously decided to postpone the election for overseer pending further investigation into the murders. Your security team wishes you to know that they are working tirelessly day and night to find the perpetrator, and are already following up on a number of promising leads. God willing, if the killer is apprehended swiftly, we may have found a promising new candidate for overseer.

0NO0000612	Dear Fellow Vault Dweller:
0NO0000613	Congratulations! Your dedication to the democratic process is the bedrock upon which the continued stability of Vault 11 is based. Now, to help you make your decision for this year's election, the Coalition of Vault 11 Voting Blocs has put together this handy Dweller's Official Guide to Obtaining Overseers Democratically, or D.O. G.O.O.D., that contains a summary of the leading candidates for Overseer as well as their statements, key positions, and most importantly, endorsements.
0NO0000616	Chairman, Coalition of Vault 11 Voting Blocs
0NO0000617	President, Justice Bloc
0NO0000618	Candidate: Henry Glover
0NO0000619	Endorsements: Utilitarian Bloc, Divine Will Bloc, Allied Service Workers Bloc
0NO0000620	I'm a devoted husband and father of six beautiful children. My oldest, Sam, was on the honor roll this quarter, and I couldn't be prouder of him. My youngest, Henry Jr., just said his first word, and it was "Da-da." We've got this bond already and he's still just a baby. Friends, when you go to the polls this election, I want you to think of your own children. Then I want you to think of Sam and Henry Jr. Picture their faces. Nate Stone should be overseer, not me.
0NO0000621	Candidate: Donna Haley
0NO0000622	Endorsements: Human Dignity Bloc, United Vault Technicians Bloc
0NO0000623	I'm aware of the rumors circulating about me. I want everyone to know that they are vicious lies being spread by the other candidates in a desperate smear campaign. I have never in my life done anything so depraved, let alone four such things. But even if I had, that still wouldn't mean you should vote for me. Consider the fact that I am grossly underqualified for the position, and that both of my opponents are far more deserving. I know nothing about governance. You would be hard pressed to find a worse candidate than me. I can promise you my administration would be a disaster.
0NO0000624	Candidate: Nathan Stone
0NO0000625	Endorsements: Justice Bloc
0NO0000626	This is ridiculous. I shouldn't even be a candidate. And I wouldn't be if it weren't for all the dirty backroom politics going on around here. It's sickening. You should all be ashamed.

0NO0000630	Project: Quantum Plasma Modulation Matter Injection Rifle
0NO0000631	Version: 32
0NO0000632	Status: Failure
0NO0000633	Notes:  While v.32 didn't have the power yield of the v.31 or v.30, we managed to increase the stabilization threshold by approximately 27.35%. This is promising, however we still have yet to come up with a solution for the matter inversion issues.
0NO0000634	Version: 33
0NO0000636	Notes: Lab destroyed. Data Lost.
0NO0000637	Version: 34
0NO0000639	Notes: Interesting. I'm not sure where we got this data from, it is a completely different direction from what we've been working on. We managed to cycle the matter inversion using a polarized quantum spin. I think that we solved the issue with the Compensation field, I have high hopes for the next weapon.
0NO0000640	Version: 35
0NO0000641	Status: Success
0NO0000642	Notes: That data we received from Xuan did the trick. We managed to get a stable build model. I don't think this weapon is ready for mass production yet, but it should show that we have a working prototype. We should be able to get these issues resolved in a later build.
0NO0000643	As you requested, here are the improvements when compared to a standard plasma rifle.
0NO0000644	* Prototype materials not suitable for extended field use.
0NO0000645	* On average the Q-35 has a higher refire rate, but the time between shots is more consistent.
0NO0000646	* Increase in active bolt charge time, accurate at longer ranges.
0NO0000647	* Plasma charge has a 30% increase in energy.

0NO0000651	Hello Everyone,
0NO0000652	My name is Carl Rook, as I'm sure you can tell. I'm your new Vice President. Until recently I was at RobCo, working in their security division, but now that your family and my family are one big family, we thought it would be nice if they sent an older sibling over. Now I'm going to do as much as I can not to interfere with your daily operations here, my principal concern is going to be security.
0NO0000653	I hear that you all have been adapting well to some new security procedures. Well we've got some new kids to join your little family here. You'll see some friendly androids patrolling around the main building. As long as everyone remembers to wear their badges at all times and make sure they are properly registered with security, these friendly androids will stay out of your way. So as long as you all keep on as you have been, everything will be just fine.
0NO0000654	Thanks for your time,

0NO0000660	Hello again everyone,
0NO0000661	Those of you in the main building may be curious about the men doing all the work in your offices and hallways. They are installing some enhanced security measures. These measures are in place for your safety as well as the safety and privacy of your REPCONN family. Along with the hardware and software security changes, each of you will also receive a personnel packet with a identification badge. It is very important that you wear your badge at all times. Again this is for everyone's protection.
0NO0000662	Oh and everyone feel free to take a long weekend as soon as you have received your personnel packet.
0NO0000663	Have a great holiday!

0NO0000667	From: Leonard Steeple, Vice President
0NO0000668	Julia,
0NO0000669	I am sure you have heard by now about RobCo's intentions to buy out our company. In the past you and I have been of like mind when it comes to the moral and financial future of this company. When Poseidon showed interest those years ago, you helped me rally the board in order to keep REPCONN autonomous. I'd like your help again with RobCo.
0NO0000670	Piers claims that RobCo is buying shares in the company to force a hostile take-over if we won't sell willingly. I don't believe that they will be able to pull together enough shares without some approval of the board. I think that you and I will be able to sway enough votes to keep the company safe. I hope you will stand with me for this.

0NO0000675	I'd stand with you Leo. Give me a few days to try and gather some support from my allies on the board. I've run the numbers, and I'm pretty sure you are right. We can fight this.
0NO0000677	REPCONN Inter-office Correspondence #3262719
0NO0000678	To: Piers Isley, General Manager
0NO0000680	You were right. Leo sent me a message last night. I've made the call to the board. I think with the numbers we are looking at pocketing from the RobCo deal we will have no trouble getting the board to vote no confidence on him.

0NO0000685	Mr. Rook,
0NO0000686	For the last couple weeks I have seen a higher than usual rate of encrypted messages leaving the facility here. These messages use an unusual encryption protocol that I haven't seen before, I'm fairly certain that it isn't a DoD approved method. I fear that these messages may be a sign of someone sending insider information.

0NO0000691	Mrs. Wang,
0NO0000692	Please continue your investigation into the messages, and keep me appraised on any progress you make. In the meantime please keep this information private. I will make sure the appropriate parties are informed.
0NO0000693	And please, call me Carl.
0NO0000695	REPCONN Inter-office Correspondence #3458648
0NO0000698	Carl,
0NO0000699	I've made some progress decrypting the packets. From what I can tell someone is sending progress messages to a secure offsite server somewhere. Were I to venture a guess, I would say that the messages are going to Poseidon, but I don't have enough proof to make a serious claim.

0NO0000710	From: Carl Rook
0NO0000711	Hello Piers,
0NO0000712	Now that things have been set in motion, I am going to be your liaison and point of contact with RobCo. I'll be handling anything that arises during your transition to the RobCo family. My first priority is going to be tightening up your security. As you well know, RobCo handles many classified projects. Because of this, REPCONN will need a large increase to security. I'll be sending over some engineers and security personnel to discreetly install some enhanced security procedures. Most of it will be pretty innocuous, however all employees will be required to wear their security badges at all times.
0NO0000713	Please have your people start wearing their badges well in advance of our partnership becoming official. I think it will make the transition easier. None of the security measures will be activated until I arrive on site. Hopefully by then everyone will be comfortable with the new rules.

0NO0000733	Leo,
0NO0000734	It is good to have you back in the office, I hope Lisa is feeling better as well. That was a nasty bug going around, hopefully the kids didn't catch it. Either way it is good to have you back in the office.
0NO0000735	While you were out of the office I met with some executives at RobCo. They are very interested in the potential that our organization has been showing, and are making an excellent offer to buy out. I'll have one of my assistants run over with the draft they gave me. Take a look at it and let me know what you think.
0NO0000737	REPCONN Inter-office Correspondence #3262099
0NO0000740	I have no interest in selling my portion of the company to RobCo. We went over this with Poseidon. These companies deal in defense contracts. That isn't what we are about, and isn't something that I'm willing to support.
0NO0000741	I'm sending back the package. I'm sure you have a fairly solid idea where I think that you can put it.
0NO0000742	Yours Truly,
0NO0000743	Leonard Steeple
0NO0000744	REPCONN Inter-office Correspondence #3262105
0NO0000748	I've heard more from my contacts over at RobCo, and it sounds like they've already started buying up some of our public shares. With just a little bit of support from our stockholders and board members, it is not inconceivable that this amicable relationship could turn very hostile.
0NO0000749	It is in everyone's best interest if we take this deal while it is still sweet. I don't think that it will stay this way for long.
0NO0000752	We've been picking up a lot of activity from China's satellite network. The tension is pretty high around here. Frank's been talking about securing a place in one of those vaults for himself and his family, and when he didn't show up to work yesterday, I think we all knew where he went.
0NO0000753	Oh my god. It's actually happening. We have readings across the board of launches happening everywhere. They must've thrown everything they had, and it looks like we didn't hold back either. The computer says we have 2 minutes until the first missile drops.
0NO0000754	I can bsrely type. The mountian shielded us from the wost or the blasd but thr's too mucsd radiattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
0NO0000755	Note written by Marcus
0NO0000756	Wow, I can't believe these old machines still work. This place looks pretty defensible, and the radiation should keep the majority of people away. Looks like we've found a home, at least for now. First things first, though. We've got to get these corpses out of here. Poor bastards.
0NO0000758	Great news! A ghoul entered our camp today who has experience fixing machines! He seems to really like it here, so I hope he can stay long enough to fix Rhonda.
0NO0000759	Weird, Rhonda just asked me why she would need fixing. She has a point. What was I thinking?
0NO0000760	The leader of this community, Marcus, said I should start keeping a journal to get my mind off of Rhonda. He also said I might find something interesting inside this stupid old building. What could possibly be interesting here? The only think that works in here is this junky old terminal.
0NO0000761	It's amazing! This place is a radio station! If we can get it repaired, we can broadcast music across the wastes, just like Rhonda and I used to listen to. Ah Rhonda, how I wish you hadn't gone away. I asked all of the mutants here for help, but none of them could do anything for you. Which makes me doubt they can fix this place...
0NO0000762	The radio station is fixed, and we've begun sending our message out into the desert. Marcus thinks I spend too much time in here, but what does a first gen know? Rhonda says they're just one step up from dumb dumbs, and I agree.
0NO0000763	There was a fight in the yard today between some of us and the first gens. Marcus made a speech about how we need to work together, but why should we? We were the master's favorites! We don't need their help. Rhonda says we'd be better off without them.
0NO0000764	Marcus and the others left today. Finally, we have the whole place to ourselves! No more listening to lectures about what we can and can't say on the air. The airwaves will be free!
0NO0000765	Now Rhonda and I can host our own radio show like we've been planning. I don't know why Marcus always refused to let us do it before. He always started getting real nervous when I told him what Rhonda thought about things. Rhonda says he was afraid she was too smart to control.
0NO0000766	Anyway, this is the start of a new era! The only downside is most of the dumb dumbs chose to stay.
0NO0000767	I finally got Raul to finish installing the security measures on my door. Now I can have all the privacy I want.
0NO0000768	Just in case I have a dumb dumb moment, I've placed the spare key under the stairs behind my building. No one ever goes back there, so it should be safe from discovery.

I know these things are supposed to last forever, but I'm a little nervous working with just one spare.

Combined with the data from the sabotaged launch, I think you should have everything you need to complete the Q-35.

0NO0000838	Day 12
0NO0000839	We managed to get the rest of the path cleared. Some pre-war fencing was mostly intact, and we were able to set it up as a makeshift barrier, on the more dangerous cliffs. I hope none of these jarheads fall off. We found a few cave entrances, as we were clearing rubble. They lead back to each other, with just a single collapsed path which appears to lead down into the mountain. The damn survey team didn't mention any caves. I hope we don't find any more little surprises.
0NO0000842	Day 18
0NO0000843	We finally got the radio from McCarran. I've set it up on the peak so anyone on overwatch duty can quickly radio in if the Legion makes a move. I'd like to know which genius back at command decided to send a squad to this location, but didn't think to give us a radio so we could actually call in an attack. Probably another politician's son.
0NO0000846	Day 13
0NO0000847	It's been almost a week, and still no sign of a radio from McCarran. I'm sending a runner to Bravo to see if they can spare a handheld or any other radio gear, until McCarran can get around to sending the gear I requested. I swear those dumb bastards back at command expect us to use carrier pigeons or something.
0NO0000850	Day 20
0NO0000851	More surprises. Collins came across a cave entrance right behind our damn tent. The survey team should have caught this if they'd done a thorough job. I have no idea if anything is in there, but we don't have the manpower to deal with any serious pests. I'm going to have some choice words for Burke the next time I see him. This isn't the first time that idiot skipped over details while surveying an area. I hope to god we're not sitting on some kind of nest. I'm going to send in Frakes and Collins to scout the caves tomorrow. If we have to, we'll use explosives to collapse the cave.
0NO0000853	Sgt. Banner Reporting
0NO0000854	Day 7
0NO0000855	Okay, we're making good headway cleaning up the paths. With only the 12 of us, I'm amazed we've moved this much rock in such a short time. Kale and I made it to the top yesterday. The survey team was right. Guardian Peak has one hell of a view, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us. I sent our runner to Bravo to request a radio from McCarran. There isn't much point in having an overwatch camp here if it takes us at least an hour to sprint to Bravo to report a Legion Assault.
0NO0000858	Day 3
0NO0000859	This place is a mess. Most of the old hiking trails are buried in landslides, and the rest is so dusted you can't tell which direction you're supposed to go. I don't know what the hell the survey team was thinking when they said this was a strategically sound location. At least we were issued plenty of rations and the river has plenty of fresh water. We could eat for months. Let's hope tomorrow brings some headway cleaning this place up.
0NO0000860	Final Report - Ambassador Phillip Granger
0NO0000861	With my term here coming to a close, I'm taking a moment to reflect on my accomplishments here. Sadly, they are few and far between. The politics between the families and Mr. House have made it incredibly difficult to deal with any of them.
0NO0000862	The Omertas are a group of sleazy lowlifes pretending to be something they aren't. The White Glove Society gives me the creeps (there's something strange going on with them, and I'm not sure I want to know what it is.) The Chairmen are thugs that dress themselves up in fancy suits pretending to be cool.
0NO0000863	I'm surprised that they've lasted this long without killing each other, although it's probably due to Mr. House and his Securitron's.
0NO0000864	We have our work cut out for us here. I wish my term here was more fruitful than it was, but I'm glad to be returning to the NCR.
0NO0000865	Phillip Granger
0NO0000866	Final Report - Ambassador Susanna Edith
0NO0000867	The past two years serving as the NCR Ambassador to the Strip have been trying at best and downright horrid at worst.
0NO0000868	Living here in New Vegas has been horrible. The accommodations here are barely serviceable, which is a deliberate and malicious act by Mr. House to hinder the NCR's efforts here in New Vegas. On top of that, I have constantly surrounded by drunken idiots who gamble away their money.
0NO0000869	My work here has been fruitless. I've been unable to get anywhere with Mr. House (or actually meet Mr. House since all I have dealt with are his Securitron's that only serve to frustrate me further.) Still after all this time, we have been unable to find a common understanding between Mr. House and the NCR's goals for the area.
0NO0000870	I look forward to returning home to the NCR and I wish my successor luck. You're going to need it.
0NO0000871	Susanna Edith
0NO0000872	Latest information from our inside source reports that the Omertas are unhappy with House. We may be able to use this as leverage against him.
0NO0000873	Reports are coming in from Freeside detailing a rise in violence against NCR Citizens. We're going to need to look into this. All sources indicate that Pacer is involved, of course.
0NO0000874	Our farms on the east side of New Vegas are producing a good amount of crops. With the additional water allocated from Hoover Dam, we can increase the number of farms over the next few years by a substantial amount. That means more residents inclined to vote for annexation.
0NO0000875	The Fiends have been more active outside New Vegas. The NCR troops stationed at Camp McCarran are handling this for now, but the situation needs to be monitored.
0NO0000906	Personal Log - Liza O'Malley
0NO0000907	Things have been getting a little busy around here lately. I have a feeling that a lot of things are going on that I'm not aware of. There's a lot more papers and reports getting passed around, but also a lot of things under the table. All I know is that I need a vacation. I'm getting a little tired of spending all my time at the Embassy and need to get out. Maybe I'll hit up the casinos one of these nights.

0NO0000918	Security Lacking at Checkpoints
0NO0000919	There have been recent cases of civilians and some troopers sneaking in restricted items into the Strip. Security needs to be increased to make sure that this stops right away. I'm instructing the MP's to tighten security at the checkpoints and any violations will be severely punished.
0NO0000920	Recently confiscated items have been stored in the store room at the Military Police Headquarters. I have locked the room and have the key with me.
0NO0000922	I've notice and increase in the amount of smuggling of restricted items into the Strip. I'm increasing security at the checkpoints to prevent more of this. A report has been sent to Ambassador Crocker via Liza to address this.
0NO0000923	Private Erwin has been causing trouble again. His pranks are starting to go a little too far. One more complaint and I'll put him behind bars.
0NO0000924	Shift Reports from the MP's:
0NO0000925	Two drunk troopers were causing a ruckus on the Strip. MP's got involved and were able to resolve the situation before Securitrons showed up.
0NO0000926	MP's received a complaint of suspicious activity near the Lucky 38. The complainant reported seeing a man hugging several trees.
0NO0000927	An intoxicated man was sleeping in the lobby of the Tops.
0NO0000928	A woman reported a drunk man vomiting in the fountain in front of the Ultra-Luxe. MP's were unable to find the man once arriving at the scene.
0NO0000929	MP's responded to a report of a young woman behind Las Vegas Station who locked herself in handcuffs.
0NO0000930	MP's broke up a fight between twin brothers near the Gomorrah. The brothers stated they were fighting over one of the dancers at Gomorrah.
0NO0000931	The Brahmin barons are an important part of Senator Morales' political base, and he's up for reelection soon. The mutants at Jacobstown need to be driven off or provoked into an attack. The senator wants to be able to show he's taking a strong stance against the mutant presence, but there can't be any blood on our hands.
0NO0000932	So, use the same tactics as you did against those squatters back in Oak Creek. Harass the hell out of the mutants, but don't kill them unless they attack first.
0NO0000933	Astonishingly enough, the local Nightstalkers have developed a mutation not unlike the stealth field generated by Stealth Boys. Even more importantly, the brains I've dissected have shown heightened levels of endorphins and other neurochemicals, similar to what I've seen in Nightkin brains. If this mutation is natural, perhaps a cure could be synthesized from the Nightstalkers. As far as I can tell, the Nightstalkers don't suffer from schizophrenia like the affected Nightkin.
0NO0000934	The Stealth Boy Mark II prototype is functional - sort of. The Enclave data wasn't complete so I had to make a few guesses here and there. Unfortunately, the data also suggests that while the stealth field has a greater duration, the negative effects on the user are exponentially greater. I can use this to my advantage - the brain wave changes will be more pronounced and it'll be much easier to to figure out what exactly is needed to cure the Nightkin schizophrenia.
0NO0000935	Lily has graciously volunteered to be my test subject, despite the risk.
0NO0000936	Keene seems to have caught on about the Stealth Boy Mark II prototype. I told him that it was in no way functional, but I'm not entirely sure he believed me. I'll have to keep an eye on him.
0NO0000939	Day 5
0NO0000940	We've managed to shovel most of the debris up to the first bridge. This thing looks like a wreck. Thankfully, there were a few wooden shacks around we can dismantle for scrap to rebuild. I just hope we don't run out of scrap before we finish the trail. Jackson says he heard some kind of howling the other night. It sounded like the wind to me.
0NO0000943	Day 14
0NO0000944	It's been a week and still no sign of a radio from McCarran. At least Bravo was nice enough to give us a handheld so we can relay to them in the meantime should Caesar try anything. Halford will get the radio set up if and when it finally arrives. For now he is in charge of the handheld and daily reports to Bravo.
0NO0000947	Day 19
0NO0000948	Ok, now I'm starting to hear noises. During my watch last night, I definitely heard splashes down in the water. I requested an additional survey from McCarran, but they blew it off as nerves. Fish don't make that much damn noise! I sent down half of the squad with lamps, but they couldn't see anything. We can't find any other cave openings. Maybe I've caught a little crazy from Jackson. I wish we had some Cateye. Can't see shit at night.
0NO0000951	Day 15
0NO0000952	The handheld is working well enough and we finished building steps up the steeper sections of the path. We can finally move the rest of our gear to the top. Last night Jackson came screaming into the tent swearing up and down he saw shadows moving in the water. I know Legionaries are know to be fast runners, but swimming across the river? I sent half of the men in pairs to search the area, but again we came up empty-handed. I'm starting to think Jackson is unstable and may need counseling. I'll request a replacement when we get the radio from McCarran.
0NO0000955	Day 8
0NO0000956	More complaints of strange noises by Jackson. I'm starting to think he still has some unresolved issues after seeing his last squad wiped out by a Legion slaver squad to the south.

0NO0000970	A radscorpion made it into the camp last night. Some of the troopers patrolling the border are getting sloppy. The only reason anyone noticed it was because several of the comm stations were acting oddly. When the trooper on duty went outside to check the transmitter dishes he found the scorpion chewing on several of the cables. What's the point of having patrols if shit like this is going to keep happening?
0NO0000972	After the radscorpion incident the night patrols were shifted again.  This is the third time in the past month. I don't think they realize the problem isn't the patrols it's the troops. Every time their patrols get shifted they get confused and holes open up in the rotations for two or three days until they're used to the new schedules. I really hope the Legion doesn't figure it out and take advan...

0NO0000975	The Quartermaster has been bitching to me again about missing supplies and bad communications. I keep telling him that nothing is wrong with the comm system and that his numbers must be off. I don't think he believes me. The bastard will probably keep bugging me until I can either prove he's wrong or find someone else to blame. Damn it I hate this shit.

0NO0000999	Boone, one of the snipers posted in the model dinosaur in Novac, has enlisted you to try and find out who in town sold his wife to Caesar's Legion. He has requested that, should you find the person responsible, you lead them out in front of the dinosaur while he is on duty. You are to put on his beret as a signal that the person you've brought there is the guilty party.

0NO0001001	You made the right choice, putting us up and keeping it quiet. This weasel Benny's been twitchy since we stole that package from his boss. Making me nervous as hell.

0NO0001233	I took a chance today and left the animals alone to go look for Mom and Dad.  I found them in that camp, they had become horrible feral ghouls!  I didn't know what to do, they came at me so fast.  Oh god what have I done...
0NO0001235	I hate being all alone, I want my Mom and Dad back, but I can't have them back because I killed them.  I didn't want to kill them but I had to kill them, otherwise they would have eaten me.  I hope the animals don't eat me.  Can animals become ghouls?
0NO0001237	The animals, they are evil.  They tried to eat me in my sleep.  They want the farm for themselves.  Now that Mom and Dad are gone they want the farm for themselves.  They are plotting against me, plotting to eat me.  They are becoming ghouls like my parents and they want to eat me like my parents did.  Too many of them to kill them all.  I know what I'll do, I'll burn the house down around me, then the animals can't eat me because there will be nothing left for them to eat!
0NO0001239	Mom and Dad went into the NCR camp nearby to trade for supplies but they haven't come back yet. I hope nothing bad has happened to them.
0NO0001240	I wonder what this terminal access card is for.
0NO0001241	The paperwork Aurelius of Phoenix gave me appears to list movement of troops, numbers of men in various strategic locations, and various communication with Caesar about raiding plans for the southern wastes of Nevada.  Of course all of this information is outdated and prove counterproductive to the NCR's efforts to stop Legion raids in the region.

0NO0001298	Subject: This weekend
0NO0001299	Hey sexy,
0NO0001300	I just fed Alan a line about having to play the Loch Ness Monster in a play this weekend, so I'm free Friday night. Want me to bring the stovepipe and the souveneir moon rocks? :-*
0NO0001305	Dobs,
0NO0001306	Jenny said your brother might know something about these RobCo guys that are kicking our asses on the trading floor. You heard anything?
0NO0001308	PS: The wife's away this weekend and Jenny's busy. Why don't you bring over the rubber sheets and the souveneir elephant-foot trash can and remind me what I've been missing? ;)
0NO0001309	The initial testing of ARCHIMEDES was a success, though not an unqualified one. Several minor systems were overloaded despite all precautions taken, and the two and a half minutes of downtime following the test is something we can work on improving.
0NO0001310	More importantly, we received reports from nearby facilities that they experienced system-frying power fluctuations at the time of the test, notably the Black Mountain communications array and the military bunkers at Hidden Valley. We're going to make it a priority next time to prevent such collateral damage.
0NO0001311	Have I told you lately that you're my favorite person? You are!
0NO0001312	The reason I gave you this print-out is I wanted to remind you about that bunker Mr. House built over at Fortification Hill. I was going to say something out loud, but then I felt self-conscious, because I feel really ANNOYING when I repeat myself!
0NO0001313	Just to clarify - anytime YOU want to repeat yourself, go right ahead! It's only a problem when I do it!
0NO0001314	Anyway, now that you've installed me on the Lucky 38's mainframe, I can peek into Mr. House's data. And guess what? The underground facility over at the Fort is super-important!
0NO0001315	What Mr. House did over there was stash a HUGE number of Securitrons. Hundreds of them!
0NO0001316	Imagine how powerful they'd be if you upgraded them with the Mark II OS!
0NO0001317	When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, you could sic your army on them! And who deserves to have an army more than you? No one!
0NO0001318	Plus an army of upgraded Securitrons would be just the thing to show the NCR that you mean business! Go away and stay away, NCR!
0NO0001319	The thing is - and I really HATE admitting this - I can't upgrade the Securitrons over at the Fort from here in the Lucky 38... I can't establish a reliable connection, and I'm sure it's all my fault somehow.
0NO0001320	But if you took the Platinum Chip to the Fort, you could perform the upgrade yourself. Just a suggestion!
0NO0001321	Love,
0NO0001329	They're transferring away three more of my men. They tell me it's all to keep the situation at the Dam under control, but what about this place? The situation here has become dangerous for my men and I  - I know it, my men know it, and the prisoners know it. It's only a matter of time before something happens.
0NO0001330	I've seen the reports of this so-called "Caesar's Legion". It sounds like they're just another bunch of raiders, but the higher-ups back west seem to think they're a serious threat.
0NO0001331	Something's going on, and I'm sure that Cooke is behind it all. No evidence yet, but something just feels... off.
0NO0001332	About Cooke. He's quite popular among the younger prisoners, and many of them seem to have been taken in by his anti-NCR dogma. Cooke's group are all model prisoners, especially Cooke himself. They don't fight and they always do what they're told. They make me nervous, and I'd have them watched every second of every day if I could.
0NO0001334	This is a stack of hand-written recipes, obviously experimental, with many sections crossed out and notes scribbled in the margins. The one that seems to have gone through the most revision is called "Sweet Veal," however the notes indicate a desire to make it taste not like veal but human flesh.

0NO0001338	Mr. Hostetler,
0NO0001339	I really need to schedule an urgent meeting with you. Can you clear an hour this afternoon? I promise it will be worth your while.
0NO0001340	-Angie
0NO0001343	Subject: Re: You're so sexy
0NO0001344	I had an amazing time last night, Don. Aren't you glad you decided to stay late? :-) Can't wait to do it again.
0NO0001345	xoxo
0NO0001347	PS I found some pre-War lingerie at the market today. I think you'll like it.
0NO0001350	Subject: Tuesday meeting with Accounts Receivable
0NO0001352	Just a reminder your meeting with Accounts Receivable was moved to Tuesday. I've cleared your schedule and moved your lunch plans ahead to 1:45.
0NO0001354	Not much to report today. The mood is unusually somber in the wake of Dr. Peter's passing. There's a strange rumor going around that the commotion downstairs was caused by, of all things, Dr. Peter's corpse suddenly animating and attacking people. I don't know who would start such a vicious rumor, but it's in exceptionally bad taste.
0NO0001355	Could maintenance look into the duct work here on level 2 again? I know you guys took a look at this last week, but I swear the noise is back. I even have other people that can back me up on it this time, too.
0NO0001356	Assistant Mathers went into the caves at 18:46 today and still hasn't returned. Requesting security escort for science personnel to conduct a search.
0NO0001357	I've finally found some of the bodies of the scientists that lived here. They appear to be overgrown with some form of lichen. They blend in so well with the other growth that I walked right by several of them without even noticing them. I've taken the proper precautions, but the lichen doesn't seem to be contagious, at least to ghouls.
0NO0001358	This level appears to be where they performed most of the research NCR is interested in. I've been able to collect a little, but the vast majority of the data from the research done here is inaccessible. I'll have to find the main backup and download from there.
0NO0001359	We need a medical team up here now!
0NO0001360	Dr. Peters just returned with one of the security escorts, who is horribly wounded. When I asked them where the other security officer was, he just paled and shook his head.
0NO0001361	In the meantime, Dr. Bailey has ordered that the door to the caves be sealed until a further investigation can take place.
0NO0001362	Is anyone down there?? Security is trying to hold off, well, I don't know what they're trying to hold off. Please, send security up at once!
0NO0001363	With Dr. Bailey watching over his sick wife and daughter in their quarters down in the Common Area, I'm officially in charge of the level, and I am requesting security at once!
0NO0001364	Yields continue to improve. Splicing together cultivar GN188 with the existing corn samples has produced a hybrid that responds better to the artificial lights we have.
0NO0001365	On a side note, Dr. Peters has missed his third straight day due to illness. His work ethic hasn't exactly been stellar to this point, so I'm requesting confirmation from the clinic that he is in fact sick.
0NO0001366	I've established a temporary camp inside the entrance of the vault. Power inside is minimal, but still running, and I've managed to hack into one of their security terminals. The logs show that several people have entered the vault over the past few months, but none have left. It's getting late, so I'll resume the expedition in the morning.  Keely out.
0NO0001367	The growth in the interior matches the exterior to a tee. It's a little surprising given the scarcity of sunlight in the entrance room, but even more surprising is that they seem to originate from further below. Maybe that fool Hildern was onto something after all.
0NO0001368	Since my Pipboy is on the fritz, I'll try to keep a running log of my discoveries in whatever computers I can find and collate the data before leaving.
0NO0001369	On a lark, the guys down in pest control sent up a sample of a substance one of their specimens secretes to attract insects. Tests show that the substance has a mood-altering effect on smaller mammals. If anyone volunteers, we can begin human testing soon.
0NO0001370	Quite a number of the staff have begun to show symptoms of some sort of viral infection. I've begun to order them to stay in bed and recover, but at this rate there won't be anyone left to do research!
0NO0001371	Problem: Noises in vents
0NO0001372	Action: Sent a team to inspect
0NO0001373	Result: Source of problem not detected.
0NO0001374	Problem: Reports of possible gas leak - several people have complained of coughing fits and other respiratory symptoms
0NO0001375	Action: Complete diagnostic of air circulation system
0NO0001376	Result: Discovered minor discrepancies in the mass of the air being pumped through the vault, but no harmful gasses were detected. Also, a strange residue was detected on the air filters, which has been forwarded for identification. Swapped out the filters, just in case.
0NO0001377	This level seems to have been devoted to the study of atmospheric effects on plants, with a concentration on producing plants with a high oxygen yield. Given the "problems" these vaults were known to have, it sounds like a reasonable avenue of research.
0NO0001378	Patient: Peters, Harrison T.
0NO0001379	Condition: Dr. Peters is suffering from a severe case of pneumonia, the result of the spread of some sort of microorganism in his lungs. I've applied the usual treatment and requested that he refrain from working and stop by twice a day for observation.
0NO0001381	Update: Dr. Peters isn't responding to the treatment, or, more accurately, his body is actively rejecting the treatment. His condition has worsened and I'm on the cusp of ordering exploratory surgery.
0NO0001383	Update: Dr. Peters is dead. His vitals flatlined ten minutes before he entered surgery. I decided to perform an autopsy immediately, and discovered his lungs were filled with some sort of fungal infection. Strangely, the fungus still shows evidence of growth despite the death of its host. I'll consult with one of the mycologists on the fifth level and see if they can identify it.
0NO0001385	Update: I don't really know how to describe what just happened. One minute I was closing up for the day and the next Dr. Peters' corpse sat up and attacked me. I was able to flee the office and seal him (it?) inside until security arrived, but what the hell is going on? If all the recent illnesses are the same thing...
0NO0001386	Patients: Mitchell, Pam; Cordella, Michael; Horton, Samwise; Fujimoto, Naoki; Derrida, Kenneth
0NO0001387	Update: This entire group showed up throughout the course of the day displaying the same symptoms. They're remarkably similar to Dr. Peters' condition when he first came in a week ago. I hope we don't have a contagion on our hands.
0NO0001388	Patients: Bailey, Elizabeth; Bailey, Marsha; Garfield, Hayes, Amy; Herman; Jenkins, Veronica; Keyes, James;  Kirkpatrick, Robert; Lowry, Amanda; Orlando, Donald;  Pamino, Iris; Rado, Steven; Reyes, Yolanda; Sarkin, Kelly; Valdez, Nicholas;
0NO0001389	Update: Another group with chills, a fever, and a terrible racking cough. I'm recommending that they be separated from the general populace.
0NO0001390	It's strange, but some sections of the machinery down here appear to have been modified for some unknown purpose. The restraints regarding oxygen content and systemic pressure have been bypassed.
0NO0001391	I guess no one will miss this ridiculous trivia game. The questions weren't even that hard.
0NO0001392	It looks like this is where most of the people were when they died. The medical reports I found suggested that most of them succumbed to some kind of airborne infection. I'm going to see if I can convert some of the growlamps into UV spectrometers to test the air for contaminants.
0NO0001393	After numerous attempts, I've found a range that highlights the particles in the air that I believe killed everyone in this vault. Preliminary tests show them to be spores of some kind. I've set up spectrometers on several of the levels now and the concentration appears to increase in the lower levels. At this point, I'm concerned that the plants here may constitute a danger to the people of the NCR.
0NO0001394	Species: BE908
0NO0001395	A distant relative of the more commonly known venus fly trap, species BE908 seems to be performing well. The plants are a threat to creatures up to five times their size due to the violent nature of their closing maws. Those that aren't swallowed whole are often incapacitated by their initial "bite". The plants' lack of mobility is offset by their ability to lure prey into reach by means of a nectar they secrete from their bodies.
0NO0001396	Species: Mantis Religiosa
0NO0001397	Of all the species we brought with us, the common mantis exceeds the rest in terms of predation. The insects are voracious, and their camouflage allows them to attack prey by surprise. Also, they complement our botanical specimens by hunting down those pests that avoid or escape our other measures. Lastly, mantises will begin to cannibalize one another when other food is scarce, making their numbers self-regulating when prey is scarce.
0NO0001398	Species: Beauveria Mordicana
0NO0001399	An entomopathogenic fungus, B. Mordicana has been developed to colonize the bodies of most common pests. Once it has fully colonized a host body, the host technically dies, but the body continues to move by means of the fungal colony within it. In this manner the fungus moves amongst more of its prey, occasionally spraying spores in a radius around the host body, infecting all who come near it. Its drawbacks include the time it takes to kill prey (10-20 days) and its limited effectiveness when dealing with unsocial pests.
0NO0001400	I've been hearing a strange chittering sound for some time now, and finally discovered its source. There's some kind of giant mantises that've taken up residence in the vault. I almost ran smack into one the other day, but the creatures don't appear to react to my presence at all. Perhaps the others sent here ran afoul of the creatures, but I can't see how a few scattered insects could pose much of a problem to experienced mercs.
0NO0001401	I can hardly believe my luck. Literally. I'm agape.
0NO0001402	Just now I was approached by a rather intense young man calling himself "Mr. Fox." (Yeah, right.) When we were alone in my office, he let it be known that he is a member of Caesar's Legion (!!!).
0NO0001403	He knew that NCR troops and Powder Gangers often spend time in Nipton. It turns out that the Legion hates and wishes to make an example of both groups, the NCR for obvious reasons, and Powder Gangers for harassing Legion raiding parties on this side of the river.
0NO0001404	I didn't have to think a moment about Mr. Fox's proposition before accepting it. All I have to do is convince the Powders to kidnap the NCR troops at night. When both groups are in town, the Legion boys will scoop everyone up. Ha!
0NO0001405	For this simple task, I have been offered 8,000 CAPS!!! I could almost go back to the NCR right away... but who knows how much else I might make off this Legion lackey?
0NO0001406	I'm going to start stockpiling some supplies in a safe house between here and the Mojave Outpost, just in case I decide to head back home in a hurry...
0NO0001407	Very exciting!

0NO0001424	Hey Boss,
0NO0001425	We took care of Troike, just like you asked. The stupid bitch that tried to run away made the perfect patsy. We get the double benefit of her stinking body serving as a warning to the rest of the girls. Troike was so fucked up on that spiked Jet we could have stabbed him in the balls and he wouldn't have said daisy.
0NO0001426	We're going to take a little vacation for a bit, Troike may have seen one of our faces while he was drifting in and out. We don't want him to get suspicious. Hopefully that scrawny little fuck does some good business for you.
0NO0001427	Thanks for the bonus boss.

0NO0001430	Going to be a little different than the one I kept for hauling scrap ha ha. But Ive always been a strong believer in keeping straight books.
0NO0001431	TO MOTOR RUNNER:
0NO0001432	Teen girl - 500 caps
0NO0001433	Adult man, 38 - 0 caps
0NO0001434	True to his word paid top money for the girl. Plus bonus for first delivery. But paid nothing for girls father who took a swing at him when untide. Got to keep em more secured. Also keep SJ off the girls as even fiends dont want used goods.
0NO0001436	Adult woman (28) - 250 caps
0NO0001437	Old woman - 25 caps
0NO0001438	Old man - 25 caps
0NO0001439	Baby (boy?) - 0 caps
0NO0001440	Got to be more careful selecting what we deliver. Runner liked the woman of course but the babys worthless except to make sure the woman does as shes told. Her parents next to worthless. Shouldve killed and left them. On the bright side Runner says we can start dealing with fiends closer by so no more dragging folks all the way to vault three.
0NO0001441	TO NEPHI:
0NO0001442	Teen girl - 400 caps
0NO0001443	Teen boy - 150 caps
0NO0001444	Child girl (7?) - 50 caps
0NO0001445	More like it. Learned from past and got rid of mom and dad along the way. Tried to get more for the young one I said hey give her time to sprout. But Nephi wouldn't have it. Kept SJ off the girls so long as he got his damn teddy. Hes a sick one but I guess the work calls for it.
0NO0001446	TO COOK COOK:
0NO0001447	Adult woman - 200 caps
0NO0001450	Teen boy - 100 caps
0NO0001451	Did not like dealing with this cook cook. Didn't know if hed pay us or burn us. I guess what they do with them once they got them is up to them isnt my business but he didn't even wait for us to turn the corner before he was torching the boy and making the womenfolk watch. Lets hope to deal with Nephi next time.

My family and a few others are trapped behind those doors. If someone could transfer control to the backup terminal I could get us all out. Please help us.
0NO0001456	The key to avoiding the artillery is to move from building-to-building up the northwest side of town toward the front gate. Stick to the high cover in the northeast corner of the two buildings, then make a bee line for the gate. The Boomers won't shoot at their own people, so stick to the fence until you make it to the gate. Also, I know there is an old train tunnel that enters the area from the south, but no one has ever come back out of there to say it is safe.

0NO0001462	And then more come. The town's been growing by the day. All of them coming for my vital essence, as if I didn't know it.
0NO0001463	And then more come. Asking questions like "Harry, why you spend all your time in that house of yours? You got something special in there?" Sniffing around for my essence is what they're doing.
0NO0001464	I've had enough. I'm locking up my essence, and I'm setting up defenses. No one's going to get their hands on my vital essence except ol' Harry himself.

0NO0001467	Things are finally looking up! I got both Gutsies up and running, and this terminal working too so I can keep a regular journal!
0NO0001468	Fixed up a terminal for Mayor Steyn too, so he can run his numbers, and got a free turn with Rose as payment! Dare I say: Yeah!
0NO0001469	All I need now is for a new gal to come to Nipton, one who doesn't know anything about me. If I can get to her and show her my Gutsies before anyone else can turn her against me, she'll be impressed and that'll do it. It *has* to do it. It's not like every man out there can fix up a robot. I'll tell her she'd never have to do housework, that'd be the clincher. It would be so nice not to have to pay Rosie.
0NO0001470	This writing stuff is harder that I thought. I'd better stop here.
0NO0001471	p.s.
0NO0001472	For maximum impact, only show one Gutsy to gal, let admiration take hold, *then* reveal second Gutsy.
0NO0001473	Tony was kind enough to build this terminal and set it up for me. All for 30 caps worth of Rosie. Ha!
0NO0001474	The life of a Mayor suits me just fine. I'm glad I didn't go any further east. I'm making plenty of caps right here off Rosie and Sylvia, who attract plenty of interest from troops at the Mojave Outpost. (Guess you spend enough time standing around that backwater and you're ready to hop on something that looks like a Molerat and doesn't smell much better.) And the local "shops" are all giving me a percentage of sales to the troops because it's my girls who bring them in. Ha! They think they're shrewd negotiators for getting me to accept a 15% cut instead of 20%.

0NO0001544	I pulled the log from the East Pump Station computer for the last week. Looking back over the past several weeks, the times are roughly consistent. There's definitely something going on - water shouldn't even be going over to the Westside and yet the log says otherwise. I know I'm on to something.

0NO0001563	Hello again everybody!
0NO0001564	Mr. H. has requested that the following rules be added to the H&H Tools Employee Policies. Please note that these rules are effective *IMMEDIATELY.*
0NO0001565	1) Employees will conduct all spoken-language business in English. Yes, this includes dealing with international clients.
0NO0001566	2) Rooftop acess is strictly prohibited.
0NO0001567	3) All employees must submit to random DNA screenings to isolate the "traitor gene."

0NO0001583	Subject: SECURITY UPDATE VERY URGENT
0NO0001584	Hello fellow H&H employees!
0NO0001585	Mr. H has asked me to pass on the details of our new security systems. This is very important, so please read it and confirm via e-mail that you understand the procedures!
0NO0001586	1) Automated heavy turrets have been installed in both cubicle areas, the central catwalk, and outside Mr. H's office. YOU MUST HAVE YOUR ID PASS ON YOU at all times, or the turrets will open fire, and we certainly don't want that, do we? :-) Remember, no sudden movements until you hear the "click!" That means the turret has recognized your ID signature and you're safe to pass!
0NO0001587	2) Employees must submit at least one of the following on the first payday of each month: one vial of blood, 20 nail clippings (toenail or fingernail is fine, but *NOT* a mix of both), one lock of hair, or a 5 square centimeter skin sample. These samples will be retained for monitoring purposes.
0NO0001588	3) Any employee seen to be cohabitating, colluding, or cogitating with any of the following groups will be terminated immediately: foreigners, Masons, carpenters, Tragic players, illegal aliens, extraterrestrials or the Flemish.
0NO0001589	4) If you see Mr. H in the halls, DO NOT make eye contact. Making eye contact with Mr. H will be seen as an attempt to steal his thought energy and will be grounds for immediate dismissal. Yes, even if Mr. H is wearing his special hat.
0NO0001590	Thank you all for your patience with our little reorganization. Now, get out there and make the best gosh-darn tools in the West!

0NO0001593	As the years roll on, I find myself missing Father's advice more and more. I wonder if he would be proud of the decisions I've made - but no, such second-guessing does me no good. I won't be weighed down by the past, and I won't waste energy on ancient family history, especially when that history isn't really family at all.
0NO0001594	I'm beginning to mistrust Henderson. I think he's conspiring with my bastard half-brother to seize the company. I built this company, dammit! I won't be ousted by some Johnny-come-lately fancy college man with his robots and his degrees. I've asked Cindy-Lou to keep an eye on him, to monitor his e-mail for suspicious activity.
0NO0001595	It's worse than I feared. Henderson sent a 10-point memo outlining the benefits of mechanization and automation. As if I wouldn't know he's been plotting with my half-brother the entire time! I knew he was a weasel-dick traitor from the moment I laid eyes on him. Only one thing to do.  One thing, and the company - my father's LEGACY - is safe forever. Cindy-Lou will bring him to me, and then I'll make an example. The Bastard will learn why you don't cross the House.
0NO0001596	Matsumoto cornered me in the hall like a wild animal today! Kept asking if I was all right, but I see the lies bubbling in his throat behind that sussurating smile. He knows. He must know. Has my brother gotten to him, too? Have to talk to Cindy-Lou, she always knows what to do.
0NO0001597	No more haircuts no more trims. They can use it to steal your thought energy with their eyes. I have a special hat that stops them, though. Special hat and special shotgun.
0NO0001598	Father, why have you stopped talking to me? You always loved him best, didn't you?

0NO0001601	They've all turned against us, haven't they? Cindy-Lou is right. I've had no choice. May god forgive me for what I've done. All my employees, all those people I thought loyal friends...
0NO0001602	Was I wrong? Am I crazy? I've scattered this journal across all the terminals in the office, just in case. They won't take me without a fight.
0NO0001603	As soon as I finish this entry, I'm activating the security systems. If you're reading this and you're American, GOD BLESS THE USA! If you're reading this and you're my brother, SEE YOU IN HELL!

0NO0001624	Hey buddy, thanks for the advice. Dinner went great last night, and I'm not sure I would have been able to work up the guts to talk to her if you hadn't convinced me. I owe you big time. I know you've been pretty stressed with the water issues. So if you need a break for some rec time, let me know.
0NO0001626	Vin
0NO0001630	I'm sorry to inform you that the small water leak that we detected a couple weeks ago appears to be more serious than we first thought. We are going to have to vent the pipes in that section to isolate the leak and stop the pressure from stressing the rest of the system.
0NO0001631	Unfortunately, this means that we are going to have to start rationing our water. My apologies go out to anyone currently residing in one of the affected areas. We'll be working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
0NO0001633	Vincent
0NO0001635	To: Jennifer Lawson
0NO0001636	Hi Jenny! It was great getting a chance to talk to you. I am glad to hear that things are going well for you. I'm curious if you'd like to meet me for dinner one day next week. I know we don't talk that often, but I feel like we really clicked last night. I hope you feel the same way.
0NO0001637	Looking forward to hearing from you soon,
0NO0001639	[FAILED] There appears to be a hidden file buried in the network, but you aren't skilled enough to crack it.
0NO0001640	[SUCCEEDED] You've accessed a hidden, distributed file network buried in the net code for this terminal. It appears to be part of a journal.
0NO0001641	Missile Launchers: 7
0NO0001642	Missiles: 200
0NO0001643	We'd like this order expedited, if possible. The situation at the Dam requires it.
0NO0001644	One of the Crimson Caravan guards, identified as Robert Wilson, decided it would be funny to take a shot at our Vendortron. He's lucky he didn't get a .308 through his idiot skull.
0NO0001645	We're currently negotiating with McLafferty for reparations, but in the mean time we need to update the Vendortron's recognition software to filter out all Crimson Caravan employees. We'll also need to pull some strings over at McCarran and get them temporarily barred from purchasing ammo there, as well.
0NO0001646	Seriously, can we stop calling the Vendortron a "Vendortron?" Let's give the thing a proper name, like Bob (we're not calling it Bob). We'll vote on it at the end of the week. Please, please, please come  up with something decent.
0NO0001647	Help!
0NO0001648	I've locked myself in my office and I can't find the key.
0NO0001649	Please call the police!
0NO0001650	Jones -
0NO0001651	I transferred that redhead you liked over to Admin. You'll be sitting next to her all day, so don't come crying to me if you can't get her in your bunk. Oh, and you owe me big time for this favor. I'll let you know when I think of something.
0NO0001652	REMINDER:
0NO0001653	All personnel must secure their terminals before leaving their post. We don't need another situation like the one Private Crenshaw created last week.
0NO0001654	What's up, Jones? Crenshaw here. So you've got your eye on that pretty redhead, huh. I'll be sure to fill her in on your farting probably, seeing as how we're buddies and all.
0NO0001655	P.S. You didn't secure your terminal very well. Choose a better password next time.
0NO0001657	There are a few different vendors who sell snacks and meat.  You might try Fitz.  He has a small shop with a couple other merchants.  Ruby Nash in Primm has some interesting items.  Lastly, Crimson Caravan should be able to handle a good amount of supply for us.  Try and convince them to trade for some of our overstock if you can.  We need to reserve caps if possible.

0NO0001675	In the case of Cassidy Caravans, Gloria Van Graff has agreed to use mercenaries against Cassidy Caravans to drive down the company's value, allowing Alice McLafferty to purchase the remaining assets at a bargain price.

0NO0001677	To: All Residents
0NO0001678	Greetings Everyone,
0NO0001679	As you all saw in the message from Vincent, we're going to have to start rationing water until we can resolve the leaking issues. Unfortunately, we don't currently have the parts required to fix the underlying cause of the leak. At this point, we have no alternative, but to seek the parts that we need from outside the Vault.
0NO0001680	To facilitate this, I'm proud to announce that Michelle Dallian will be forming a new committee, with the goal of creating ties with whatever civilization there may be in the outside world. Michelle and I both have high hopes that we'll have no problem finding the assets we need, and hopefully forming some lasting relationships with the outside world.

0NO0001691	Thank you for your endorsement at the Town Hall meeting last night. You are so well respected by the residents, that I am sure it will greatly increase my chances of following you to the "Big Chair." Since Michelle started making plans and gathering people for her External Association Committee the Isolationists have been gathering followers, as you well know. I think having me follow you as Overseer will serve to slow their efforts.

0NO0001696	Hey Mr. Raati,
0NO0001697	Can you look over my final paper for comp lit? I think this is so unfair! I totally completed the assignment, and she gave me a D! I worked so hard, and she can be so mean. I mean, I know it is up to her what grade she gives me, but I've never gotten anything lower than a B on anything. EVER! So can you take a look at the paper for me? I swear, if you think it is worth a D, I'll let it drop.

0NO0001701	Parents,
0NO0001702	It is with a heavy heart that I tell you that we are not going to be able to complete this school term. I'll be running some private tutorials in the screening room, but they will be informal, and attendance will not be required.
0NO0001703	I've asked Michelle to look in the surrounding areas, to see if there are any local schools that will be willing to take on some of our teachers and students. Between this prospect and the hopes of speedy repairs, this unexpected recess will be short.
0NO0001705	Daniel Raati
0NO0001707	To: *ALL STUDENTS*
0NO0001709	I'm sure you've heard by now that the doors of the schools will be close for an undetermined amount of time.

Please spend some of your newfound free time taking care of these assignments.

0NO0001714	Sarah. I'm curious if you've given any more thought to joining my task force. I'd love for the opportunity to work with you again, and I think you'd be a great fit. I really need someone with your keen interpersonal insights for dealing with the people outside.
0NO0001717	To:  *ALL RESIDENTS*
0NO0001718	Hello Everybody,
0NO0001719	I'm looking for volunteers for the External Association Committee. We have enough core personnel, but we can always use the extra hands. All residents are welcome to apply, and we hope to be able to accommodate any of you who are willing to donate your time. Feel free to contact me and I'll send you an application for membership.
0NO0001723	To: *ALL VEAC MEMBERS*
0NO0001724	Hi! Thanks again for agreeing to help out with this momentous task. Sarah and I are going to be organizing you into teams. Teams will be in charge of trading, inventory, politics, and miscellaneous. Many of you have asked why we don't have team dedicated to security. Well, I've talked long about this with George, and we both agree that we don't want to appear belligerent to the outside world. We are certain that once the people out there realize that we are just like them, and won't threaten them at all, they'll be happy to form long lasting relationships with us. We'd like to present an open hand instead of a closed fist.
0NO0001725	Thank you!
0NO0001727	From: Michael Robinson
0NO0001729	I can't believe you are going forward with this naive idea that the world is going to be peaceful and welcoming to us. We have no idea what we are going to see out there, or how the world has changed. I strongly suggest that we, at least at first, just open the doors long enough to get what we need. Allowing people to come in and out of the Vault unscheduled, can only lead to trouble.
0NO0001730	- Mike
0NO0001733	Michelle, please reconsider. Take some weapons with you. Arm yourselves. I just know that you are going to bring trouble back onto all of us.
0NO0001736	To: Undisclosed-Recipients
0NO0001737	I'm sorry to hear that all of you have abandoned the cause. Am I the only one left who sees the folly of this plan? I'm sure the outside hasn't recovered. Nevada was a desert before the bombs fell. I can hardly think to imagine what it must be like out there now. You are all cowards, and your fear is going to lead to our deaths.
0NO0001741	Ok Michelle. I was wrong. The wasteland isn't as dangerous as I thought it was. AS DANGEROUS. That doesn't mean it is safe. We've had some luck trading, and it looks like we are going to be operating at full capacity soon. Let's lock the doors for a little while, set up some guards. Let's be smart. We've all seen those freaks with the strange hats lurking around outside. Every day they get a little closer, let's show them that we aren't going to be easy targets. Let's be safe and smart.
0NO0001742	Kindly,

0NO0001745	To:  Janet Kimper
0NO0001746	Hi Janet,
0NO0001747	How is the school year going so far? I've heard good things from your teachers. They say you are one of the top students in your class.
0NO0001748	Your birthday is tomorrow, sweet 16 at last! Can you even believe it? It seems like yesterday my sister told me she was going to have a little girl. Do you have big plans for your birthday? I think if you are interested, I could talk to some folks and get the dining room reserved for a couple hours. Let me know if that sounds like fun and I'll start getting the ball moving.
0NO0001749	Uncle George
0NO0001751	To: George Stault
0NO0001752	George, we've been friends for a while, so I hope you didn't take my candidacy for Overseer personally. I'm going to do whatever I can to keep our friends and family safe, and if that means taking our exposure to the outside world slow, and keeping to ourselves (outside of what we need, of course), then that is what I'm going to push for. No one knows what it is going to be like out there. There could be horrific mutants, or strange wandering vagabonds, aliens, murderous gangs. WE have no idea. Let's be smart about this.
0NO0001756	Greetings Everyone!
0NO0001757	Thank you all for putting your trust in me. I am honored to serve as your Overseer for the next term, and hopefully beyond. I am going to do everything I can to get Michelle's committee outside as soon as possible. We'll get our water issues resolved, and form lasting bonds with our neighbors in the world outside.
0NO0001758	Thanks again for putting your trust in me.
0NO0001759	George Stault, Overseer
0NO0001762	George,
0NO0001763	I'm not sure what Michael is planning, but I suggest that you leave the weapons in those two submerged storerooms. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have any support, and there is no need to give him the opportunity to arm himself.

0NO0001781	To: Nara Robinson
0NO0001782	I'm sure they'll be back soon. The Vault door is unlocked, and it'll stay that way until they get in. If we don't hear from them in another hour I'll send out another party.
0NO0001785	Hi Danny,
0NO0001786	Laura is going to send you a message about her grades. Could you take some time and talk to her? She's pretty upset. I know she slipped a little bit near the end of the semester, but she works really hard, and she genuinely wants to do well.

0NO0001790	Dear Ms. Van Graff,
0NO0001791	It has come to my attention that Cassidy Caravans have suffered a number of setbacks recently. I can only hope that these latest unfortunate events drive that young booze-hound of an owner to finally sell me her remaining assets.
0NO0001792	As per our agreement, I have bent my not inconsiderable efforts toward weakening your competitors, the Gun Runners. You can expect a mysterious and sudden surge in sales in the near future.
0NO0001794	AM
0NO0001795	These tapes contain horrific sounds of murder and violence. You hear Clanden engaging in violent sex with women, and then hear the sounds of visceral and violent murder being carried out.
0NO0001797	Vault 21 has a story unlike any other Nuclear Fallout Shelter - you are about to learn why!
0NO0001798	It is common knowledge that some vaults were built and organized with motives that went beyond their function as safeguards of our last great hope: the hope that humanity would survive even the worst catastrophe imaginable - Nuclear War.
0NO0001799	Vault 21 was one of these experimental vaults. In the spirit of Las Vegas, our vault was built and organized around gambling!
0NO0001800	Everything you will see here follows the idea that humans can coexist and organize their lives based on the principle that skill is the only factor that should tip the blind balance held by Lady Luck.
0NO0001801	We embodied the perfect equilibrium between self-reliance and social equality.
0NO0001802	Each level of Vault 21 was symmetrical and transparent. Each room looked exactly like the next, and every gambling place was built in plain sight, so that no person would have advantage over another.
0NO0001803	Thanks to this, quarrels in our society were solved from an equal starting ground - the best won, just like our American Dream promised so long ago!
0NO0001804	After two-hundred years of living in harmony, we finally awoke to the nature of the outside world when Mr. House, in his able wisdom, resurrected our lost city as New Vegas!
0NO0001805	Seven years ago, Mr. House rebuilt and organized the great city of New Vegas. Vault 21 rests in the middle of The Strip, and it was inevitable that it would become part of the city's bright future. Mr. House contacted our community and offered us to participate in the resurgence of New Vegas.
0NO0001806	Most Vault 21 dwellers refused the offer - life was comfortable, safe and fruitful. We had grown so accustomed to the benefits of our isolated society that we could not conceive leaving it behind for an unknown future teetering on a precarious balance. Still, there were some among us who disagreed with the prevailing wisdom.
0NO0001807	They challenged, on Mr. House's behalf, each of the vault-levels' representatives that supported continuing our isolation. According to the custom, a game would be set up where the winner would decide the course of the community's future.
0NO0001808	A game of blackjack was scheduled and held in this very level of Vault 21. After many hours of grueling struggle, Mr. House's supporters won in an extremely risky, and fateful, gambit. They decided to open up the doors to the outside world.
0NO0001809	The rest upheld our system and remained true to their promise to abide by the victor's decision.
0NO0001810	After almost two hundred years within Vault 21's halls, we released the seals of the ancient doors. We opened to a new world.
0NO0001811	Mr. House, with the help of The Families, had transformed the mostly unharmed ruins of Las Vegas into a paradise. It resembled the city that we remembered thanks to the stories and items that our forefathers told and secured in Vault 21 after The Cataclysm.
0NO0001812	We were awe-struck and cautious, at once. Slowly, we left the confines of the vault and settled within New Vegas, aiding in its reconstruction.
0NO0001813	Vault 21, a giant complex of functioning machinery, became a great source of materials with which to rebuild New Vegas.
0NO0001814	Mr. House stripped the vault and filled its empty husk with concrete - only leaving behind part of the vault's top level. This section is where you now find hospice and where the warmth of our ancient home remains alive for all to enjoy!
0NO0001815	We have come to recognize the wisdom of Mr. House in forging a new and brighter future for all generations of New Vegas' inhabitants. Without his leadership, the barren wasteland would have remained uncivilized, savage and brutal for all time.
0NO0001816	We sincerely hope that you join us in celebrating the glory of New Vegas and the memory of Vault 21's legacy!

0NO0001872	Hey, lil sis!
0NO0001873	How are you holding up? I miss you so much, Sarah! This place makes me want to run back to our home, every single day. I just had to write you so that I could feel a bit warmer. The warehouse's cold air weighs on me as heavily as the concrete that Mr. House dumped in our vault. Damned be his soul!
0NO0001874	Yeah, I imagine that you did not expect that outburst from your "cool bro" but I am reaching the end of the corridor, here. Emptiness is my muse - doubt is my only mistress. Everything that once inspired my art slowly drifts back into nothingness, into an unfathomable void where neither I find light nor its radiance searches for the spring of my soul.
0NO0001875	Bah, don't I sound pathetic? I do not wish to worry you, lil sis. I just wish that I could be there with you, right now. Perhaps once I find my strength again, once I finish the latest "suggestion" for Mr. House, I'll venture into the Strip and visit you.
0NO0001876	My thoughts are with you, hot-headed roadster!
0NO0001877	What's shaking, my cool bro!
0NO0001878	You'll be happy to know that our vault is packed and coasting along! Even with those legionnaires bad news we still get plenty of NCR squares down here. They are all chirpy and don't appear to mind that Cesar is crusin' for a bruisin' all over the place. Maybe the NCR is stronger than we thought, uh? Don't know... you think we can trust them over Mr. House?
0NO0001879	I still feel all clutched over what he did to our home! I mean, yeah it is good that we got to keep part of our vault but I can't shake the thought that one of these days he'll just push me out into the open - once he does not need us any more. I tell you, we should have never accepted his challenge. That shuckster cheated us, I am sure!
0NO0001880	Anyway, you've heard all of that before and I just wanted to bring you a smile! Cheer up, buttercup! I miss you!
0NO0001881	Sarah.

0NO0001883	Dear Miss Weintraub,
0NO0001884	This is Charlene Tann writing to say thank you for the great experience we had at your hotel! I can't wait to tell to my inner circle. As you recall, my husband Biff is a very respected and influential man in our wealthy community.
0NO0001885	Ms. Shot, Ingrid Denger and lady Booften will soon come for tea to our estate and I will direct them your way. They will love the quaint and rustic feel of your cramped underground hole - tres chic!
0NO0001886	Even Biff still talks about his new favorite ranging garb, "the leather from my Vault 21 suit contains the scent of unwashed ages" he says to all our visitors! But he won't let them try it on for one minute, dear.
0NO0001887	With most sincerity,
0NO0001888	Ms. Tann
0NO0001889	This schematic allows you to make .44 Magnum, Hand Load.
0NO0001890	Looks like you were right.
0NO0001891	The Hostetler man always carries a full pouch back to their house, every night. The same pouch's empty whenever he goes work to Crimson Caravan, Fred's seen it himself.
0NO0001892	No chance in hell this is all a coincidence. He's bringing something with him whenever he leaves work. That's gotta be his daily cut from the business.
0NO0001893	Alice's gonna have to find all that dough for us. If we get caught near their place her bitch mother's gonna snap for the big guns... That'll make Crandon, or worse, Jules, come after us. I ain't too happy about risking my neck for nothing, Andy.
0NO0001894	Let's make sure Alice's a good doggie first, then do whatever you want with her once we are outta this fucking hole.

0NO0001902	TO THE NCR PRESIDENT
0NO0001903	TO THE NCR COUNCIL
0NO0001904	FROM ROBERT EDWIN HOUSE
0NO0001905	As Chief Executive of the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas, I hereby demand the IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL of all NCR military personnel from New Vegas and its surrounding territories.
0NO0001906	a)  Yes, "all military personnel" includes NCR Rangers.
0NO0001907	b) "New Vegas and its surrounding territories" includes (but is not limited to) Hoover Dam, McCarran International Airport, HELIOS One, and the El Dorado Substation.
0NO0001908	IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE that my vast army of heavily-armed Securitrons has been rather inflexibly programmed to respond to acts of aggression with overwhelming force.
0NO0001909	a) For examples of "heavily-armed" and "overwhelming force," I will refer you to the pitiless campaign of extermination my Securitrons will have visited upon Caesar's Legion by the time you are reading this document.
0NO0001910	b) Any NCR military personnel who do not withdraw from New Vegas and its territories will be seen as committing an "act of aggression."
0NO0001911	NCR civilians are NOT subject to this order of withdrawal! They may visit New Vegas freely, enjoying all that the Vegas Strip has to offer!
0NO0001912	So long as NCR military personnel comply with this order to withdraw, electricity and water will continue to flow from Hoover Dam to the NCR.
0NO0001913	a) Electricity: 5 caps per kilowatt hour.
0NO0001914	b) Water: 5 caps per gallon
0NO0001915	The NCR Council's Office of Budget will receive invoices bi-weekly. Prices are subject to change without notice.

0NO0001936	Incident: Broken Glass
0NO0001937	Kevin dropped one of the glass tubes today while forming it.  He ended up with a nasty cut on his hand from the broken glass.  Fortunately no one else was hurt.  I bandaged his hand and had him clean it up before sending him home.  One more accident like that and I may have to let him go.  Kid's too accident prone.
0NO0001938	Incident: Elevator
0NO0001939	One of the elevators to the upper loading dock broke down again.  Unfortunately Johnathan was inside waiting to unload and the sudden stop caused one of the signs to slip of its pallet and it broke his leg.  He'll be out for at least a month while it heals.
0NO0001940	Page 67
0NO0001941	... fighting settled slightly following the announcement of the damage to the reactor before panic overtook the vault's residents. The technicians struggled to repair the damage to the reactor and main computer systems. We learned too late that as part of an automatic safety protocol the reactor had been reconfigured to use alternative pipe lines for its cooling systems, unfortunately with the damage to the mainframe the system was unable to detect the structural damage to the vault. Radioactive gasses pumped through the broken pipes and irradiated the vault. On top of it all, we cannot open the vault's main door. All systems appear to be on autopilot and manual override functions have been disabled. We'll just have to hope we can survive long enough for the door to open automatically...
0NO0001942	Page 65
0NO0001943	... real trouble began when a fair number of residents began to call for population control. Foreseeing the issue spiraling out of control I ordered one of the technicians to hook up a locking mechanism linking the armory door to the terminal in my office. The news of the armory being closed off angered a sizable group of residents, they stated it was their right to defend themselves and demanded that they be given access to the armory once more, and I of course denied this request...
0NO0001944	Page 66
0NO0001945	... riots began soon after; during the peak of the violence, the group calling for free access to the armory stormed the vault's exit and left. The door was sealed after them and additional guards were stationed at the exit; this proved to be a grave mistake. With the additional guards at the exit there were fewer to patrol the halls, none of them were prepared for the group that ambushed the armory. The guards were able to defend their position, but not before the damage was done, during the fight one of the reactors cooling vents was damaged.
0NO0001946	Carla,
0NO0001947	If you're reading this, then you know. Sorry. Wanted to make it back home to you.
0NO0001948	The pension won't be much but it should help you and the baby get by. Want you to remarry when you meet the right person. Don't want you to have to be on your own.
0NO0001949	Not sure the right way to say how I feel about you. Think you know already, though. Always seemed like you knew what I meant, maybe better than I did. Wish I was there with you now.
0NO0001950	There are things I couldn't tell you. Tried. Whatever you learn over time about my service in the NCR, hope you can forgive me.
0NO0001951	Lastly, know you were against it, but if it's a girl, want her to be named after her mother. Know it's playing dirty to win the argument this way, but too bad. It's worth it.
0NO0001952	Craig
0NO0001953	Hsu told me that he'd pay me for taking out Motor-Runner. I can find him at Vault 3, and the NCR will pay well if I'm able to take him out. Hsu also mentioned the last soldier he sent to take care of Motor-Runner has missed his scheduled radio contact.

It's positively sweltering down in that cramped little room, and you know I don't cope well with the heat, so I'd like to do the work remotely. What's the password for the back-up machine again?
0NO1000051	Old man Ennis left his key on one of the consoles again, so making this note to remind myself to give it back next time I see him. We should stuff his locker full of Dandy Boy Apples or something. Maybe then he'd be less forgetful.

0NO1000107	Guard on Call: Morris, Tyler
0NO1000108	Describe the Incident: Mrs. Purvis daughter called down to ask if we happened to find her mother's purse, which she may have dropped during last night's "stroll." We found the purse on the main floor. None of the valuables were inside, may have been taken when the purse dropped, or Mrs. Purvis may have emptied the purse contents during last night's incident.
0NO1000109	Complaint: Mrs. Purvis/Drunk and Disorderly
0NO1000110	Sierra Madre Security Log: 11:02PM
0NO1000112	Describe the Incident: 10PM, received complaints about noise in upper bar, then emergency call from the main floor cashier cage who reported (quote) "old bat on ceiling." Investigating, found guests cheering Mrs. Millicent Purvis, 72, who had climbed over the upper bar railing and was walking on the support beams, indicating loudly that she was (quote), "going to join the circus." She had already tripped over one Holo-Emitter (unhurt), and was inviting guests out on the beams so we could "use them like monkey bars."
0NO1000113	Climbed after her, cornered her near the rafter over the cashier's area, then brought Mrs. Purvis to holding and called her daughter to come escort her to her room. No damage done to rafters or the emitter. Mrs. Purvis's daughter was visibly agitated by the incident and too embarrassed to take any legal action saying that she (quote), "didn't want to cause any more trouble for Mr. Sinclair." Need to gate off the rafter area to prevent repeat incidents.
0NO1000114	This is a restricted dispenser code for use in the Vending Machines.
0NO1000130	Admitted 3 workers from Puesta del Sol Switching Station. Exposed to some unidentified airborne toxin from the ventilation system. Caused severe lung and tissue damage, inhalation isn't the problem, it's absorbed through the skin.
0NO1000131	Researching its effects. The gas, whatever it is, may be building up in vents beneath the town. Asked foreman to look into source before government inspectors do.
0NO1000132	Chemical suits arrived today. They're bulky, hard to talk and move in. It was difficult to unlock the clasps once in place, had to get one of the staff to help me out of it. I told the construction crew keep the suits ready while working in the switching station and to be careful with them, we only have a limited number.
0NO1000133	I asked Sinclair to order more in the event of a leak in the Villa, and prepared cost estimates for another gas leak to support my case. Didn't need to, he agreed to the request immediately, then asked if he could see the workers and make sure they were all right.
0NO1000134	Ms Keyes' insomnia seems to have gotten worse, so we ended up ordering the new Auto-Doc upgrades, must have cost Sinclair a fortune. The new programs for the Auto-Docs ameliorate the effects of exhaustion. Have already spoken to the staff about side effects and dangers of prolonged use - wanted to make sure they weren't using it to pull double-shifts.
0NO1000135	Sinclair asked if these codes could be downloaded into the public dispensers. The codes aren't compatible, unfortunately. He said he'd "look into it." Guess his contacts at Big Mountain will be getting a call soon.
0NO1000136	Sinclair + Ms Keyes
0NO1000137	<<Transmitted to Sierra Madre>>
0NO1000140	Domino + Ms Keyes
0NO1000141	<<Transmitted to Chief Physician's Terminal>>
0NO1000142	Sinclair
0NO1000143	Proposed moving 1 Auto-Doc to casino and scheduling visits. Sinclair agreed.
0NO1000144	Ms Keyes showed up today (sans Sinclair), escorted by Mr. Domino. He explained to me Ms Keyes had developed a throat infection, and asked if the Auto-Doc could help. I asked about the Sierra Madre's Auto-Doc. He said he didn't want to "alarm" Sinclair.
0NO1000145	Ran some tests. Ms Keyes' voice is fine, her loss of voice was more listlessness, symptomatic of excessive Med-X usage. When I tried to speak to her about it, Mr. Domino intervened. I warned them too much of the Chem could render a subject comatose, and Domino laughed. I lost my temper, and he said they'd return another time when I was in "better spirits." Despise that man.
0NO1000146	Domino stopped by to ask about the test results and Vera's voice. He seemed concerned she would lose her voice for the Gala Event. I told him if Ms Keyes was concerned, she should see me, and I would only disclose any medical information to her. I told him the Auto-Docs were more than capable of healing Ms Keyes voice if she developed any throat infection, and we could even operate if need be if she tore her larynx. He seemed satisfied by the news, apologized, amazingly enough, and left a bottle of wine as a token of his appreciation. I told him I felt it was inappropriate, he insisted. I dumped it in the trash.
0NO1000147	Been reading this over: "In the event of a fire, chemical leak, nuclear attack, or other threat to the casino, the interior and exterior doors will hermetically seal to prevent harm coming to the guests. During this time, Holograms will be deployed and assume threat status until the lockdown is ended."
0NO1000148	Guess can't be too careful these days. Still, what if there was another leak at the switching station? Not to mention the gas valves in the kitchen. If those got hit, the whole casino's a torch.
0NO1000149	Since you missed it, Sinclair outlined security measures today. Wasn't blind to what was happening in the news, wanted to take steps if the Chinese got a foothold on American soil. Ran us through the added functionality of the holograms, then explained the construction of the casino, its emergency protocols, and the broadcast signal we're using for the Gala Event. Guy's a nut job, still, seems to have the bases covered. Guess the isolation of the casino was intentional. Not sure what he's hoping to protect, sure seems obsessed with it.
0NO1000150	Nothing much to report. Pretty quiet tonight, even from Puesta del Sol. Imagine Morris up in the casino probably has more than enough with the guests coming in tonight, poor bastard.
0NO1000151	Set up the radios so I can listen in on the Gala Event when it fires up, and left one out for the prisoners. If Sinclair doesn't want us to be too strict with the guests tonight, I may just toss the key in the holding cage with anyone we pick up and let them unlock the door when they sleep it off.
0NO1000152	Set up the radio room downstairs to broadcast through the speakers. Don't want to miss tonight's performance, the receiver down there is stronger than the desk radios we have up here.
0NO1000153	Stashed some supplies from the evidence room down there to celebrate once my shift is over. Way I figure it, the rest of the guards'll be too busy to check up on me.
0NO1000154	Sinclair's prohibition list is going to be difficult to enforce and told him so. He claims we're getting an automated system that would confiscate items even the slightest bit radioactive or foreign and ship them back to the visitor's source address. Asked about items already in the Villa (didn't mention the construction crew) and he dismissed it.
0NO1000155	Of course, no sooner than Sinclair gives his prohibition speech, his pal swings by the same hour, asking how "hardnosed" we were going to be. Told me he couldn't guarantee he could keep me supplied if I didn't treat his "friends" with the same respect. Prick.
0NO1000156	Sinclair installed a new security system for visitors coming into and out of the Villa - he doesn't seem to care too much about what they do when they're inside, only that we confiscate any personal items that could be dangerous or foreign, and make sure we know who enters and who leaves. Asked him again about watching the construction crews. He said that was a "Villa matter" (great, that means the Prick runs the show). As long as there were no more accidents among the crews, that's what he cared about.
0NO1000157	Barely tucked my flask under the desk before he showed up. He gets that disapproving look when he sees the hard stuff.
0NO1000158	Got the weapons and the mines in today, along with the shotguns and the ammo, enough to defend the Villa if trouble breaks out. Sinclair's taking the world situation seriously, even all the way out here... maybe more so because we're out here.
0NO1000159	Hate to think if someone got their hands on half the stuff we have stored here. Enough military ordinance here to turn the Villa into a mine field.
0NO1000160	Dispensers are up and running. Unlike most everything else, we've had few problems with them. I heard they'd been part of some World's Fair exhibit Sinclair had seen, so he contacted the researchers about the dispensers to see if he could use them here.
0NO1000161	Turns out, dispensers do more than supply convenience items: if there's an emergency or the threat of communist attack, codes can unlock ammo and repair kits for the dispensers. Stored back-ups of the codes in the contraband room, just in case.
0NO1000162	Those Vending Machines are something else - we got codes in today so we don't even need the demolition charges, or even more tool orders. You use these things at the Vending Machines, it unlocks construction equipment - even demolition charges and repair kits?
0NO1000163	Liquor shipment finally came in today - didn't realize working here would be like working in a dry state. Just need to keep it out of sight of security and Sinclair, and ought to take the edge off the day, keep it stashed in the back.
0NO1000164	Shipments got routed again, and what was meant for the casino restaurant ended up in the Villa main for the umpteenth time. Hauling those crates of knives up to the main lobby ain't going to be my job, especially with no cars.
0NO1000165	One thing about the liquor they're shipping in, it's making somebody talk - the big man came down today and told us that we have a sweet deal set up, and one slipped word in front of security can bring this all crashing down... for real.
0NO1000166	Sinclair's coming tomorrow to check on the Villa's "progress," told the boys to look sharp for the suit. Not bringing the big starlet, though, so the boys were grumbling about that.
0NO1000167	Better watch himself, might have a nasty fall in the switching station.
0NO1000168	Sinclair was a lot more level than I was expecting. Especially after Mr. Yesterday's cracks. He's sharper than one of those knives, too. He asked a lot of good questions about the foundations, some I couldn't even answer, didn't bother him though. He knows engineering, that's for sure. Worried he's going to see through the Villa, see it for the cardboard town it is.
0NO1000169	We have a sweet deal here. I let Mr. Yesterday know that, know that we might need to renegotiate our arrangement and move the % around. Left records in maintenance in case things got difficult, blow this deathtrap wide open. Agreed to discuss things in the switching station so we wouldn't be overheard.
0NO1000170	This place is a safety inspector's wet dream. Or nightmare. Foreman ended up taking a fall in the switching station last night, broke one of his legs and his neck, but didn't die from it - he bled out before anyone found him. Bad luck - wasn't his shift, no idea what he was doing down there, but I'm surprised he fell and didn't have one of the platforms just collapse on him.
0NO1000171	Domino swung by today after the foreman's accident. Wanted to know how I was handling it, if the boys and I were doing all right. Guy's a snake, laying on the fake charm, trying to be one of us - he asked if we were being paid as "befits our skills." He said if we weren't, to come see him, he'd set us up. I'm not stupid, I seen the percentages, I know someone's making a killing off the corners we're cutting - sounds like Domino and construction are arm-in-arm. Don't matter to me as long as the cash gets left in the drawer every week.
0NO1000172	Villa security showed up today and searched the place. Domino must've made the Chief mad, so this was payback. Had all our stashes tucked away when they arrived, didn't find much. Chief tried to be all hard with us about keeping our noses clean, ranted about "casino policy."
0NO1000173	That Sinclair's a tight-ass. Sick of these spot-checks and stripped by the casino search programs every time I enter the Villa. What's his issue with chems? He could use some. So could that pretty bride-to-be, though she looks half-doped up with that expression of hers. Med-X from the looks of it.
0NO1000174	More demolition charges showed up today - checked with Mr. Yesterday, he didn't know squat about the shipment, was only interested if anyone had made a buck off it. These something Sinclair ordered, or is it another cock-up like the knives? We got more than enough explosives already - what, is high-and-mighty planning to blow up the road to this place so no one can get up here?
0NO1000175	Oversaw the streetside Vending Machines installation today, all working, mostly because the casino crew was running the show.
0NO1000176	Finally complained to the Chief about the machines. They feel like a "company store." We only get a few casino chips with the paycheck, so we can barely buy anything. Chief says he's not sure the chips were Sinclair's idea, only if we had any problems with the machines, let him know immediately.
0NO1000177	After another "discussion" with the Puesta del Sol crew, told Chief it'd be difficult to enforce the prohibition list, let alone the searches. Chief had the Gala on his brain, said Sinclair put construction of the Villa more important than patting down the construction crews for liquor and chems as long as they didn't hurt anyone or each other. Got a little hot under the collar, Chief did too, told me to walk it off.
0NO1000178	This whole thing stinks. Chief's barely got time for me, now Sinclair's turning a blind eye to things in the Villa because his friend's running the show?
0NO1000179	One good thing about this assignment - no more writing parking tickets. Sinclair's laid out the streets so narrow, cars can't even come into the Villa. Resources being what they are, he may not want folks to waste gas coming here. Cuts down on traffic noise, too. Chief says it's more than that, says Sinclair wanted the Villa to be "reclusive."
0NO1000180	Long as I don't have to worry about double-parking snobs or Chryslus gas-hogs clogging the Villa, I could care less. Wonder how he expects folks to get here, though. Seems extreme, even for privacy.
0NO1000181	Ventilation's all shot to hell, which is going to be a problem when summer hits. The pipes backed up, the chambers started spewing out this red dust cloud, like rust - whatever it was, caused the guys to start choking and vomiting. It's like the place was getting sprayed for roaches, 'cept the bug spray was hitting us. Got the boys to the Clinic, put them out of commission. Mr. Yesterday said he couldn't justify having them paid, but he'd see what he could do "on the side." Sounds like he was going to get them some chems - and a little green for keeping their mouths shut.
0NO1000182	The boys hit by the gas are still out, everyone's pulling more work in as a result, and grumbling's starting. Mr. Yesterday's been keeping the hard liquor and chems coming under Sinclair's eye, isn't helping. We need those boys back. We have another chemical leak like that, no more construction for the rest of the year.
0NO1000183	Those new chemical suits came in today, so we could check out the ventilation chambers, see how that cloud cocktail formed. Suits are kind of creepy looking, hard to talk in them, so we had to use sign language to actually make sense of each other. At least we can check out the pipes and ventilation chambers now.
0NO1000184	Gas worries me, though. Really messed the guys up. If the chambers get backed up again hate to see that gas get out, wipe out the Villa.
0NO1000185	Didn't take long to find the problem. Heading down the main pipe, we hit traces of the gas - not the full red stuff like last time, though, minor blessing. The kicker was despite the sealant, it still got inside the suit, turns out the gas eroded the metal of the suit's locks. So not only did one of the boys get exposed, everyone who went down there got locked in their suits.
0NO1000186	Sure, the Docs at the Clinic got mad, but we didn't have any choice if we wanted to get medical attention after that gas hit us. So we cut his suit open with one of those surplus steak knives (things could cut through a T-bone like it was hot butter). Rest of us tried to pry the locks on our suits, finally had to use the knives on ours, too.
0NO1000187	Can't wait until this job is over and we can let the Villa collapse on itself. They'll be too busy at the casino anyway.
0NO1000188	As shoddy as the support beams are for most of these buildings, the ventilation system's worse, and the problems they had over at Puesta... sure, when you count our bonuses, it's good, but not when the workers are coughing to death. Hate to see what this place spits out if someone let the ventilation system chug along for a few years, we'd have another Greener Pastures on our hand, easy, and a pile of bodies beyond it.
0NO1000189	Mr. Yesterday says they can get the incident hushed up, after all, no one really saw what happened when the patio collapsed, and the balcony along with it... we can also see about getting the medical reports at the clinic deleted, too, it's all good. Still, I'm getting nervous - whole thing's a big gamble, won't be long before people see the Villa for what it is, sand barely held together with spit and glue. We're protected legal-wise, even so, this is criminal. It's like he doesn't want this place to last.
0NO1000190	...town's going to get built, it just ain't built to last. Casino might be a different story, it's like a bank vault to the sky, but that's just me. It's a big show for someone, hope Sinclair survives this one.
0NO1000191	...seems kind enough, signed my poster, and even the promo photo. Kind of a sad look to her, though, like she wasn't really there. And she almost ran when Mr. Domino slipped his arm through hers, and he wasn't even looking at her, like she was a bag hanging on his arm. Something wrong between those two, not sure if Sinclair sees it, but I do.
0NO1000192	Not going to rat me out for what happened in the Villa - I'm not the one who laid the foundation, and I'm not going to take the fall for the supports, either. They try and pin this on me, I'll let them all know what's really going on with the construction contracts.
0NO1000193	...the Villa's like cardboard, but the casino? That place isn't built for people to just gamble, it's a place for them to take cover if the big ones hit. Those doors can be hermetically sealed, and whatever they got lining the floors screws up anything not hooked up direct by wires.
0NO1000194	Word is, while Mr. Yesterday got the Villa covered, Sinclair's locking up the Sierra Madre like a golden trap.
0NO1000195	Asked the Foreman how come no one's wised up yet, and he just winked, said we got someone watching out for us, an ace in the hole. As long as we're good until showtime, this whole Villa's going to be the biggest con of all time. That's because half the maintenance shipments aren't coming through - Sinclair's too blinded by that Starlet to see beyond the casino, so we're able to cut corners when we need to, and no one's going to look too close at the budgets while the casino's big opening is underway, and after that, we'll be long gone.
0NO1000196	This is a fragment of Vera Keyes' melody, "Let the Bright Tomorrow in."
0NO1000199	This is a restricted dispenser code for use in the Vending Machines that allows a user to return the selected item for Sierra Madre Chips.
0NO1000202	Don't use this unless strictly necessary.
0NO1000203	The Vault is off-limits. There is no reason to enter it unless your clearance is personally approved by Mr. Sinclair.
0NO1000204	Still, if anything were to go wrong with those security systems, use this password in the Turret-Defense terminal inside the Vault's Chamber:
0NO1000205	"HeartArrow"
0NO1000206	Lou Martin
0NO1000207	M&M Construction Inc.
0NO1000208	Crew Chief.
0NO1000210	It increases the Automatic Rifle's rate of fire.
0NO1000212	It appears to improve the condition of the Hologram Rifle.
0NO1000214	It looks as if it can increase the damage the Bear Trap Fist does.
0NO1000215	Boy, am I ever glad to be out of that damned suit! Almost lost a few men today getting enough samples together for the eggheads to take a look at.
0NO1000216	/Sinclair Access 301
0NO1000217	Subject: Keyes, Vera
0NO1000218	Condition: Terminal
0NO1000219	Sinclair,
0NO1000220	There's not much more we can do for Miss Keyes except keep her comfortable. Her exhaustion will persist, as will the insomnia.
0NO1000221	Recommend continuing Med-X/Superstim treatments. This is not a viable long-term solution. The pain will persist and increase over time, and the dosages she's currently taken already carry the risk of overdose. Based on discussions, I also fear allowing Miss Keyes access to those amounts of Chems may lead to purposeful overdose, and recommend psychiatric evaluation as well.
0NO1000222	Dear Mr. Elijah,
0NO1000223	Congratulations on your winning luck at the Sierra Madre Casino! We have set up your payment of Sierra Madre Chips to be automatically delivered at the dropbox you specified every three days.
0NO1000224	Thank you and we hope you enjoyed your stay!
0NO1000226	The Sierra Madre Management
0NO1000227	Welcome, and on behalf of your friends at N.E., we thank you for purchasing the latest in service and security technology.
0NO1000228	If you encounter any problems, contact our urgent care service representatives at any time during the weekdays from 10 to 2 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If no one is there to respond to your emergency, leave a message and one of our trained representatives will return your call in the next three to four working days.
0NO1000229	Holograms are programmed with service protocols and security protocols.
0NO1000230	Service protocol holograms perform a specific function - greeters, simple vendors, or in the case of the Sierra Madre casino itself, even monitoring gambling tables. These service holograms follow simple routines, and are incapable of performing any security function.
0NO1000231	Holograms cannot move beyond range of their emitters and are best when used for a simple, localized function.
0NO1000232	Security protocol holograms do just as the name implies: provide security. They perform this function better than most conventional security guards.
0NO1000233	Security holograms have been programmed with the case-specific Sierra Madre protocols.
0NO1000234	Not only do security holograms look like Sierra Madre personnel, they will respond to threats or unauthorized personnel just as conventional security guards would.
0NO1000235	Security holograms use field of view sensors to perceive their environment and to aid in pathing. While later versions will feature upgrades that allow for a 360 degree perception arc, the memory cells in current hologram emitters can only perceive their environment in a cone in front of them.
0NO1000236	They can, however, change facing as needed and scan their environment for unauthorized activity. It is best to purchase security hologram emitters in pairs to cover a full view of the environment, as trespassers could conceivably use hologram blindspots to gain access to unauthorized areas!
0NO1000237	If security holograms detect unauthorized guests or detect criminal action, they will display a warning "caution" color to the target.
0NO1000238	If you believe they ever display this color in error, immediately move away from the hologram's field of view until they resume their normal protocol. If the behavior persists, they will enter engagement mode, turn red, and attempt to subdue targets with their discharge beams.
0NO1000239	Note: As requested in the service contract, N.E. has installed EBE systems in all Sierra Madre security hologram emitters.
0NO1000240	Often, an intruder's natural response is to attack a security hologram, either with fists or with a weapon. Fortunately for the hologram owner, all such assaults are useless against security holograms! They cannot be wounded, damaged, or harmed unless their emitter is destroyed.
0NO1000241	Attackers spending the time to look for emitters will usually be rendered unconscious by a hologram's discharge beams before they can disable them, so there is nothing to fear.
0NO1000242	As with service holograms, security holograms cannot leave emitter range. They will pursue a target to the emitter's perimeter, however. This usually allows a target to be subdued, and should present no obstacle to casino security.
0NO1000243	Hologram emitters are sturdy, yet can still be damaged or broken if enough force is applied. In addition, while they are protected inside sturdy space age alloys, their circuits are vulnerable to being tampered with. If this occurs, refer to the repair manual that comes with the hologram installation guide. Please call customer support services if this occurs. Do not attempt to repair the emitter yourself!
0NO1000244	Warning: Do not approach an emitter that may have been tampered with! If you must, please wear reflective maintenance gear or metal armor in case of hologram malfunction, and make sure that you can move beyond a hologram's field of view in case problems arise.
0NO1000245	Holographic greeting and security technology requires service from trained professionals and routine maintenance. While the emitters maintain a charge for theoretically hundreds of years, damage can occur and circuits can erode over time. As part of the Security Madre exclusive contract, we have delivered on the custom energy recycling emitters requested by the Sierra Madre financiers and Mr. Sinclair.
0NO1000246	Mr. Sinclair,
0NO1000247	I took the points you raised in the call today to heart, and I hope my answers offered some reassurance. What we are providing is an exclusive, comprehensive technology, but more importantly, we want to address the concern you raised for protecting your guests from threats, specifically the growing communist threat from the Chinese.
0NO1000248	Security is N.E.'s top concern. There is no reason to provide a service that you cannot defend, and should the current world situation lead to increased hostilities, an Emergency Broadcast Emitter has been placed inside select hologram emitters at the Sierra Madre. In case of nuclear attack, holograms will defend their stations with lethal force to protect the guests under their charge.
0NO1000249	If you wish to make sure that those who come to your Villa and casino have the means to defend themselves, I assure you, you need look no further than the E.B.E., it is a proven technology, and anyone who decides to attack you or your guests will regret any aggression.
0NO1000250	Martin T. Harris
0NO1000251	P.S. Any chance we could ask you to have Ms Keyes sign an autograph for us? It won't reduce the price, although I could see about sending a few extra systems your way.
0NO1000252	Warning: If Vault security is disabled and the Vault terminal is breached, the elevator will automatically return to the Suites and lock permanently in place. After that, there is no way to operate the elevator, and the Vault area is sealed off. As requested by Mr. Sinclair, there is no manual or terminal override once the elevator is locked. Once initiated, it cannot be undone.
0NO1000253	Until that time, the elevator may be operated freely from the terminal above.
0NO1000254	This job doesn't pay enough, working down here with those walking lightshows gets on my nerves. And the elevator... does Sinclair know how dangerous it is to have the elevator lock like that? If someone accidentally trips the deadman's switch inside his Vault... even Sinclair himself... this whole place becomes a big metal coffin. Lou tried to tell him and Sinclair said it would be "user error."
0NO1000255	Warning: In the event Vault security is disabled by any means and the private terminal in the Vault is accessed, the Vault will enter a lockdown state. At this time, the elevator will return to the Suites and cannot be accessed again. As requested by Mr. Sinclair, there is no manual or terminal override once the elevator is locked. Once initiated, it cannot be undone.
0NO1000256	Vera,
0NO1000257	If you're reading this, I know what you and Dean had planned tonight on the eve of the Gala Event. I loved you very much, and whatever possessed you to choose Dean's arm over my hand is beyond me. Whether it was greed or lust, it has led you here and will forever keep us apart. I hope it leaves you as empty as you left me. As much as you sought what was inside the Sierra Madre, now it will keep you.
0NO1000258	The door has sealed, the elevator has left, and not even your voice will unlock it. This casino was my gift to you, and you now will be its heart for all time.
0NO1000260	Frederick Sinclair
0NO1000261	Vera, if you're reading this, my fears have come to pass, and this is an apology.
0NO1000262	I hope you realized what my last words meant to you. If so, they have led you here, and this place will keep you safe. I know what they meant for me, and I fear they have trapped me here.
0NO1000263	I have extracted the previous entry after our conversation tonight. It can't have been easy for you, and I am sorry for all I've put you through in silence. I know while you do not love me, you did not mean any malice in what you did.
0NO1000264	I knew about your plans to rob the casino with Dean before you told me. Hearing it from you didn't make it any easier. For what it's worth, I am glad you told me yourself, and I understood the tapes he had in his possession.
0NO1000265	I do not think either one of you realized what your addiction stemmed from, however, and that is the tragedy in this. I suspect the world would not have believed you, regardless, so I respect your desire to keep it from others.
0NO1000266	When first building this Villa, this casino, I meant it for you. As the world seemed to race headlong toward war, it became part of my desire to protect you. The loans, the funding I poured into the casino's construction...
0NO1000267	I knew it would not matter when war came for us. It was my means of creating a shelter, a defense if the world was bombarded in radiation and bombs.
0NO1000268	When Dean revealed his plans inadvertently through our introduction, I realized what had happened, and how I had been tricked. For a time, my thoughts were dark. I changed the casino vault from a shelter to a trap, as I knew the first one to enter would be Dean. He would die down here, and it would have been by his own hand.
0NO1000269	I fear, however, that I overstepped myself, and the only safe place in the casino is the Vault. I have tried to rewire the systems, change the protocols, and I cannot. I will do one last check on the pipes by the edge of the outside platform and see if anything can be done. I fear it is useless.
0NO1000270	If you come down here, do not access my personal accounts entry.
0NO1000271	It contains only a message for Dean, and it will seal the door and you will have no way out - even the elevator is designed to automatically return when the door is closed, and it will lock in place.
0NO1000272	There should be enough in the Vault to sustain you until help arrives. I have ensured that there is enough medical supplies down here to keep you comfortable.
0NO1000273	The holograms should defend the casino from any attackers, and the hologram beacon in the Villa will broadcast an emergency signal so that others know you are here.
0NO1000274	When danger has passed, rescue will come.
0NO1000275	I hope you were able to read this, and know that I loved you.
0NO1000277	Dean,
0NO1000278	If you're reading this, this is goodbye. You will have many years to read this message. Why you have smiled in my face and held a dagger to me, I do not know. You were rich, respected... even admired, loved by many. When you finally pass away down here, either by your own hand or starvation, know that your greed has led you here, for no reason I can understand.
0NO1000279	You have made a habit in using others for your own ends. Now, the Sierra Madre is your reward. Whether you used blackmail or force - or even played to Vera's greed, it will not help down here in the Vault. Greed has led you here. I hope it leaves you as empty as you left me.
0NO1000280	The door has sealed, the elevator has left. Even Vera's voice will not unlock it. Know that on the night of the Gala Event I shall raise my glass and whisper, "Fortunato."
0NO1000281	In pace requiescat,
0NO1000283	I've started analyzing samples of the Cloud that surrounds the Sierra Madre. Preliminary results are promising. I need to perform a proper atmospheric analysis, that requires I travel there directly. Still, the sample I have collected in my chemistry set is enough to keep my experiments running. The Cloud Residue replenishes slowly, and I have to limit the gathering of samples to its rate of growth, allowing me to restock once per day.
0NO1000284	These knives are sharp, too sharp! One of the chefs almost lost their thumb when dicing vegetables, and we're losing cutting boards at a rate of at least one per day. The knives just slice right through them! Running out of dishrags to mop up the blood.
0NO1000285	Another (!) shipment of kitchen knives for the Cantina Madrid came in today, with their new "space age" alloy polymer material. We've got way more than we need for the Gala Event, even if everyone had 3 steak knives! But it's always the best for Sinclair, always, always, always, always, he insists everything must be perfect.
0NO1000286	One of the cooks noticed their knife was glowing the other day. They'd left it on the stove top, and the metal started glowing red - and it didn't cool down! What kind of "Space Age" metal is this Cosmic Knife made of? It kept glowing hot for several hours, and then the knife was so weak that when we tried to use it, it simply snapped. Guess that's why the metal's not used in rockets!
0NO1000287	Played around with this the other day, and:
0NO1000288	1 Cosmic Piece-of-Shit Knife
0NO1000289	1 Pilot Light
0NO1000290	1 Hot Plate
0NO1000291	Something to hold the damn thing to cook evenly
0NO1000292	Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees
0NO1000293	Take 1 Knife, leave on stove!
0NO1000294	Let simmer for 5 minutes
0NO1000295	Watch as Knife glows red-hot
0NO1000296	Put Knife on table, melts table
0NO1000297	Sue scientist who made damn thing
0NO1000298	Give it to the military?

0NO1000368	<This Holotape looks like it was ripped from a terminal drive.>
0NO2000001	Daniel has mentioned that the Sorrows could use additional healing powder to supplement their existing supplies. The ingredients to make healing powder, Xander Root and Broc Flower, can be found throughout Zion. In addition, caches of healing powder may also be present at camps in the valley.
0NO2000002	October 28th
0NO2000003	Five days on foot, still can't sleep.
0NO2000004	Outside it's like nothing happened. Sky looks wrong, that's all.
0NO2000005	Hike back to overturned NatGuard truck near Toquerville? After blisters heal, maybe.
0NO2000006	Looks like USGS team was researching something here in cave. Cleared out when bombs fell, left equipment behind.  Probably thought they had families to run back to.
0NO2000007	October 29th
0NO2000008	Char, must've said this out loud a thousand times walking here. Maybe writing it will feel more like you heard.
0NO2000009	You were right.
0NO2000010	I was north of Spanish Fork. Took the 77 along Provo Bay to steer clear of town. Would've been home in an hour. Engine died, truck just stopped. So did a Chryslus in other lane. Knew right away.
0NO2000011	First nuke hit SLC inside a minute. I was looking South - Lucky Man! Flash behind me so bright world looked on fire. Old couple from the Chryslus starts screaming they can't see.
0NO2000012	Didn't watch you die, Char. Saved my eyes. Counted 12 more flashes next 7 minutes. Ground shook each time, 18 seconds later.
0NO2000013	When nothing hit for half hour, took a look. Globe of fire where you and Alex died. Didn't kid myself.
0NO2000014	Didn't know what to do. Grabbed my pack and rifle.
0NO2000015	Saw to the old couple. Sat them up against car, let them hold and comfort each other. Told them I was going to get help, everything be okay. One bullet through both heads. Instant.
0NO2000016	Five day hike back to Zion.
0NO2000017	You told me. Stop running off to the wild. Man belongs with his family.
0NO2000018	You were right. You were right. You were right. You were right. Wasn't there to hold you and my boy. Died without me. Never touch you or him again.
0NO2000019	Should shoot myself. What I deserve.
0NO2000020	Can't. Maybe soon.
0NO2000021	October 31st
0NO2000022	Black rain falling outside. Geiger jumping. Should let it kill me but bottling water from back of cave all the same.
0NO2000023	November 2nd
0NO2000024	Sounds dead outside, but can't look. Geiger goes lethal 15 feet from cave mouth.
0NO2000025	Do the math. Radiation goes down before water runs out or I never leave this cave.
0NO2000026	January 1st
0NO2000027	Happy New Year.
0NO2000028	Two months in cave. Still lethal outside. Don't get it. In army they said 2-4 weeks cleared fallout.
0NO2000029	Less than a month's water left. Been mopping condensation off cave walls, wringing shirt into bottles. Trading calories for H2O. Food stocks holding. Thanks, USGS.
0NO2000030	If there was even a chance I'd see the two of you again, I'd run outside.
0NO2000031	January 10th
0NO2000032	Sounded like windstorm out there for 2 days. Radiation down 500. What happened?
0NO2000033	January 15th
0NO2000034	Took a peek. Snow. It glows green.
0NO2000035	January 28th
0NO2000036	Radiation low enough I could risk short exposure outside.
0NO2000037	More important, cave stream now drinkable if I use Rad drugs.
0NO2000038	January 30th
0NO2000039	There is nothing alive out there.
0NO2000040	May 5th
0NO2000041	The comeback goes on.
0NO2000042	Add prickly pear to list of survivors with honey mesquite, and banana yucca. Odd nodules / mutations but safe to eat. Harvesting oh so careful, never take more than a fifth. Mouth waters every time I'm about to eat something that isn't from a can.
0NO2000043	May 7th
0NO2000044	Clouds of those stinging flies near fallen tree I call The Napper. Little flashes in the cloud. Something dragonfly-sized that zaps them midair then scoops them up. Something new.
0NO2000045	May 19th
0NO2000046	Bighorn sheep! A family - ram, ewe, and little one
0NO2000047	Fucking Goddammit
0NO2000048	May 20th
0NO2000049	The sheep were different. Brawny. Ewe had curved horns just like the ram.
0NO2000050	Seen some tiny lizards but this is first time seen animals that big.
0NO2000051	Fingers crossed. 5-10 years breeding, fresh meat, hides, horns.
0NO2000052	I know it's time to go back, Char. When winter has passed.
0NO2000053	June 14th
0NO2000054	Just got back. Tired. Good scrounging along the way. Ended up dragging back a cart of stuff.
0NO2000055	Write tomorrow. Sleep.
0NO2000056	June 15th
0NO2000057	Departed April 10th. Walk to SLC took 15 days. Would've been 7-9 back in the old days, but had to circle pockets of radiation and foraged along way.
0NO2000058	Don't know what I was thinking. Imagined I'd find my house, dig through rubble, find - something.  Your bones I hoped, and Little Nut's. Would've buried them. Here in Zion maybe.
0NO2000059	SLC is mostly craters. Warped steel girders where highrises sat. Mounds of bricks.
0NO2000060	Never found our house. Didn't even find street. What wasn't a crater was scorched clean.
0NO2000061	Want to believe it was fast, a flash, both of you vaporized. Lies to make me feel better. I'll never know. Which part of city got hit first? Northeast and you both died in a blink. Farther away and you burned alive screaming or the blast broken glass and bits of brick and wood splinters shredding you like hamburger. Look at it coward and listen don't turn away face it. If you'd been brave lucky man you would've found a spot and blown your brains out.
0NO2000062	But not you. You took your time walking back, made a shopping trip of it. Scrounger.
0NO2000063	The truck was still there on the 77 north of Spanish Fork. The Chryslus too, but no sign of the old couple's bones.
0NO2000064	Outside Nephi I caught a trail. Three men, tracks heading toward Fountain Green. Thought about following but didn't. Stupid fantasy of friends, more likely cannibals.
0NO2000065	June 20th
0NO2000066	Took two days to build door and electrify it.
0NO2000067	No soliciting, assholes. Home sweet fucking home.
0NO2000068	September 20th
0NO2000069	I count 28 of them. 11 adult males, 8 females, 9 children aged 2 - 10. Some rifles and pistols in bad repair. Old world clothes, ratty.
0NO2000070	September 22nd
0NO2000071	Got close enough last night to hear them talk. Spanish, I think. From Mexico?
0NO2000072	Heard them say "paradeeso" a bunch. Think that means paradise. Here to stay, then.
0NO2000073	Seem harmless. SEEM.
0NO2000074	October 5th
0NO2000075	The one I call "Maria" is pregnant. Think the father is "Jose" but she spends a lot of time with "Pablo" too.
0NO2000076	October 7th
0NO2000077	"Pedro" ran out to pee in the stream and would've seen me if he looked to his left. Too close. Need to give them space.
0NO2000078	November 10th
0NO2000079	"Jose" broke his leg chasing a bighorn. Too far from camp for them to hear. Told myself to leave it be but couldn't. 300 yards from their camp did my best Jose screaming imitation until a bunch of them came looking, then strung them along to the crest where they could hear the real Jose.
0NO2000080	Probably useless. Compound fracture, broke the skin.
0NO2000081	November 11th
0NO2000082	"Infec-shee-own." So many goddamn words nearly the same, think I'd be fluent. But anyway Jose's leg has got it so he's going to die. Nature for you. Of course they're giving prayer a try.
0NO2000083	November 12th
0NO2000084	Left bottle of antibiotics on a rock outside their camp last night. They thanked God (Dee-os) of course. As though that asshole saw fit to burn the world but still cared enough to leave some medicine on a rock.
0NO2000085	November 15th
0NO2000086	Jose will always limp but otherwise he'll be okay. Good deed for the month.
0NO2000087	Will they make it through the winter?
0NO2000088	February 11th
0NO2000089	Fuckers killed all the men. I think they would've taken the women alive but Maria and Selena opened fire and some of the others went for their guns so they shot them down and some of the kids with them.
0NO2000090	If I could've warned them.
0NO2000091	February 12th
0NO2000092	Elena and Carmen and 5 children still alive, being kept in a pen.
0NO2000093	There are more than 100 of these assholes in blue suits. Every suit says "22" on the back. Why? Armed to the teeth with submachine guns, pistols. Estimate 60% male. Everyone seems to follow the dark-haired guy but can't get close enough to tell. Assholes are disciplined - patrols, sentries - they mean business.
0NO2000094	Say I go in at night and get the women and children out. Where to next?
0NO2000095	But I have to get them out. Have to.
0NO2000096	February 13th
0NO2000097	Recon during night. Well-organized, sentries along most approaches, but stream not covered.
0NO2000098	Are they sick? Lots of coughing fits. Tuberculosis?
0NO2000099	Women and children still in pen. Will try to infiltrate by stream tomorrow night.
0NO2000100	February 14th
0NO2000101	They ate them.
0NO2000102	February 19th
0NO2000103	Ambush along riverside trail. 6 males killed. Heard their coughing a mile away.
0NO2000104	Used their grenades to booby-trap bodies, kept half. Secured 6 SMGs, 500 rounds 10mm, 6 frags.
0NO2000105	February 20th
0NO2000106	Ambush along riverside trail. 2 males died checking bodies. Killed 2 more with rifle. Shot 1 through calf and let asshole crawl off to spread message. Coughed like I'd shot him through lungs.
0NO2000107	February 23rd
0NO2000108	Ambush half-mile east of coal pits wash. 8 males killed.
0NO2000109	February 28th
0NO2000110	Ambush in the narrows. 6 males killed. Took a 10mm through thigh, steel jacket, missed femoral. Lucky. Used tourniquet to make sure no blood spattered on rocks back to cave. Have set traps all along entrance passage but if they find me it will be matter of time. Still, 24 confirmed kills in 10 days = at least 1/3rd their combat force, not bad for an old man.
0NO2000111	March 2nd
0NO2000112	Lucky lucky lucky lucky. Patrol was small - 3 men. Screaming woke me - point man caught under deadfall. Panic fire ricocheted into the cave, almost hit me. Crawled forward and killed them all with SMGs. Nearly used frags, stupid, finger in pin when remembered ricochets.
0NO2000113	Leaving at once. No other patrols in area but they'll be searching narrows for these 3. Taking as much food as I can drag with me and heading to cave south.
0NO2000114	January 13th
0NO2000115	The Coughers are gone finally. All 34 that still lived. Ate their dead for strength, then struck out SE.
0NO2000116	Victory. 10 months of killing. All I feel is cold.
0NO2000117	They deserved every goddamn bit of it.
0NO2000118	January 17th
0NO2000119	Thought I was dreaming but the screams were real. For a moment thought they'd tricked me, just pretended to leave Zion, then sent a patrol to track me down. But the screams were a woman's.
0NO2000120	Edged around corner in passageway to have a look. One Vaulter, ankle deep in bear trap. Leveled my SMG but the way she was crying stopped me.
0NO2000121	How she screamed when she saw me. Been their boogey man a long time.
0NO2000122	Name's Sylvie. Claims she ran away from them. Calls them evil people, "children of the devil." Turns out they were sick after all, something they caught in a Vault they lived in. She never came down with it (yet).
0NO2000123	So help me, I've wound up being her nurse.
0NO2000124	January 18th
0NO2000125	Her story matches what I learned from my "interrogations" last year, but according to her - let's just say it was bad to be a woman in that group. So when they left, she slipped away.
0NO2000126	She knows next to nothing about living outside a Vault. Says she wants to learn.
0NO2000127	September 9th
0NO2000128	Never been so scared in my life.
0NO2000129	Canada wasn't scary, just sickening, the criminality of it.
0NO2000130	The end of the world wasn't scary. When I knew you and Alex were dead, I didn't have anything left to be scared about. I just went on for some reason.
0NO2000131	I wasn't scared fighting the Vaulters. It was like I kept daring them to finish me. When I killed them, I think it was the closest I came to feeling happy in years.
0NO2000132	Sylvie is pregnant. And I am terrified.
0NO2000133	Ridiculous old man. A father again at 47. In this world?
0NO2000134	She's so excited and so - trusting. Says it's God's will that we have this child. Like nothing can go wrong.
0NO2000135	You see, Char, she doesn't know about you and Alex. Never told her. Almost did sometimes but what you and I had, it seemed wrong to share it.
0NO2000136	More like an old man not wanting his young wife to know how he failed the one who come before her.
0NO2000137	Hiking into Toquerville for medical books and supplies. This will be done right.
0NO2000138	I'm sorry, Char. Hope you can forgive me.
0NO2000139	March 5th
0NO2000140	Baby was breech. Would've been a son. Michael.
0NO2000141	Did my best to turn him. Failed. Must've done Caesarean too late. Had to put Sylvie out and she never woke up.
0NO2000142	Buried them south of the narrows.
0NO2000143	Well. This time I was by their side. So much better.
0NO2000144	I think I can finally do it. Blow my fucking brains out all over this goddamn cave.
0NO2000145	August 22nd
0NO2000146	10 sets of tracks 1/2 mile NE of canyon entrance. Barefoot???
0NO2000147	August 23rd
0NO2000148	Saw them through scope. Corpses walking around.  Finally gone crazy. Dementia maybe.
0NO2000149	August 24th
0NO2000150	I'm not crazy, they're real. Goddammit they are real.
0NO2000151	Rushed me the moment they saw me, snarling like animals. They look like corpses but don't smell rotted.
0NO2000152	I'll be putting them out of their misery. Doing for them what I never could for myself.
0NO2000153	September 3rd
0NO2000154	The last of them. All gone.
0NO2000155	February 5th
0NO2000156	Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday you useless old dinosaur, happy birthday to me.
0NO2000157	Happy 60th. What do you get a man who has everything?
0NO2000158	A bottle of whiskey and a 12 gauge slug through the roof of the mouth! Whoo!
0NO2000159	Come now. What do I have to do to prove to myself that I've lived long enough?
0NO2000160	I'm a shriveled old man. White beard. Seen enough sunrises and sunsets. Saw the big sunset, been hanging on through the long night 36 years now. Ridiculous.
0NO2000161	Not kidding myself into thinking there's anything on the other side of this. Fine. Things weren't so bad before I was born.
0NO2000162	Char and Alex. Sylvie and Michael-who-could've-been.
0NO2000163	Thoughts of the beloved dead before dying.
0NO2000164	Goodbye, Zion.
0NO2000165	February 6th
0NO2000166	Fucking didn't do it, coward as usual. Maybe two bottles next year.
0NO2000167	April 25th
0NO2000168	24 of them, half boys, half girls. Youngest is 8 maybe, oldest 13-14. Dirty and scrawny, been on foot a long time. Children's crusade.
0NO2000169	Struck camp on nearly the same spot as los mexicanos. 30 years and a lifetime ago.
0NO2000170	I've spent 2 nights listening to them. English. Literate. One of them reads stories while the little ones fall asleep.
0NO2000171	They escaped someplace they call "The School" but can't figure out where it was. When they want a little one to behave they tell him to stop or "The Principal will get you."
0NO2000172	Principal better not show up or I'll blow his goddamn head off. I can still shoot straight.
0NO2000173	January 2nd
0NO2000174	I've been leaving notes for them, and gifts.
0NO2000175	They like the books. Started with stories but moved on to weapons manuals, medical books, practical stuff.
0NO2000176	In the notes, well it's embarrassing, almost like those cards people used to give to each other, everything sweet and loving. I tell them to read and to learn and to make the most of their new home. I tell them that I'm giving them Zion as a gift to make up for all the sorrows of their lives so far and all the sorrows man has visited on man. I tell them to be kind to each other and modest. I tell them never to hurt each other but that if someone else comes along and tries to hurt them to strike back with righteous anger. Stuff like that. I sign every note "The Father," because well, just because.
0NO2000178	Have I mentioned that I'm dying?
0NO2000179	Mind's still sharp. Lungs are the problem. Might be cancer. Cough's been getting worse for months, finally there's blood in it. Getting harder to visit my little friends, breath's so short.
0NO2000180	I've given away most of what I own. They'll find the rest in the caves when they get a little older.
0NO2000181	I don't want them to find me though. "The Father" is a broke-down old man? Disappointment.
0NO2000182	It's time. I don't want another birthday.
0NO2000183	January 23rd
0NO2000184	It's cold enough that I won't last long on the high mound up next to Red Gate. I think I've got enough breath left in me to make it. I'll just lie down and stare at the sky. Feels right.
0NO2000185	I hope they'll do well. I hope no harm comes to them, from within or without. Did my best to prepare them with the last few notes. Said something kind about each one of them, what makes each one special. Told them The Father was pleased by their kind natures and that it would be up to them to handle things on their own from now on, that I'd be silent but still watching and still caring.
0NO2000186	Lying, then. Oh yes.
0NO2000187	Lied to you, Char. And Alex.  And Sylvie. Told you I'd be with you forever. But I wouldn't go back and unsay it once if I could.
0NO2000188	What was the point of it all? So many failures.
0NO2000189	But I never forgot your face. Or Little Nut's. Or (sorry) Sylvie's. They used to say that happened after a while but it never did for me.
0NO2000190	Maybe the only point of all this living was to keep those pictures in my head going for as long as I could. It was the only life I could give you. Not a day went by without.
0NO2000191	It wasn't choice. I chose to die again and again. Just never did. Body had its own drive.
0NO2000192	Well, the little ones will need it. Species will need it if it's to continue. That blind drive onward.
0NO2000193	I wish them well. It's been a gift to me, at the end of it all, to behold innocence.

0NO2000197	If you are reading this message then do yourself a favor and turn and run straight out of this canyon.
0NO2000198	For near 11 months my people have been engaged in daily battle with an evil spirit of this place. Arriving February of last year with a party 118 strong, we were attacked by primitives and forced to defend ourselves. Whereupon something began killing us in wide numbers. We have done our absolute best to find and kill this thing, thinking it was a man because it uses our firearms against us and traps of all kinds. But no man could defy our efforts as this thing has. It is more evil than any man could be.
0NO2000199	We have been reduced to just 34 of our number. We have lost six overseers before me. Some have perished from the sickness in their lungs we carried out of the  Vault, but that number is small next to the count of friends this thing has murdered.
0NO2000200	Now that I am finally made overseer, we are leaving straight away and will not return. If you have come to this seeming paradise seeking the fresh water, abundant game, and shelter you suppose you will find here, do not be deceived. You will find only death here. Leave at once and put miles between you and this place.

0NO2000205	Hi Mandy,
0NO2000206	This is Horace Applebaum out at the Zion General Store. I placed an order three weeks ago for the De-Luxe Mountain Man All-In-One Survival Kits - you know, the ones that come with a compass, a pair of walkie-talkies, and a full first aid kit?
0NO2000207	I'm writing to you because, as of today (06/15/2057), I still haven't received the shipment. I'm fresh out of the kits here, and with the summer tourist season picking up I really need the new ones ASAP.
0NO2000209	Horace
0NO2000210	Mandy,
0NO2000211	Who the hell is running this shipping company? I've just received three crates of Dinky the Dinosaur(TM) Officially-Licensed Dino-Action Dolls! These things were supposed to go to some tourist trap in Nevada, how the hell did they get here?
0NO2000212	Mandy, what the hell can I do with this stuff? Maybe if we file off the Dinky trademarking we can turn them around as kiddie souvenirs and make a few bucks, but I'm still looking at a major loss here.
0NO2000213	Whatever's going on in your shipping department, take care of it, or I'll find somebody else to handle my orders, I swear to God.
0NO2000216	PS - I still haven't received that order of survival gear I requested last month. You know, things I can actually sell to people?
0NO2000217	Dear Scoutmaster Mitchum,
0NO2000218	Thanks for following up! You'll be happy to know that the Li'l Scout Lunchboxes you ordered have arrived. You can pick them up from the General Store when you arrive in Zion. The General Store is open Monday through Saturday, 7 am till nightfall. We look forward to seeing you and your scouts on Independence Day!
0NO2000219	All the best,
0NO2000220	Horace Applebaum
0NO3000001	For this test, you must disable all active robots without being detected. We need to calibrate the suit's FCG (Field Compliance Generator) to the proper variance. All security measures are active. A successful run will award an item in the Supply Cabinet.
0NO3000002	Success - Disable all robots without being detected.
0NO3000003	Failure - Detection.
0NO3000004	For this test, you must steal a document in the Administrator's office without being detected by the patrolling robots. A successful run will automatically update the suit's software and award an item in the Supply Cabinet.
0NO3000005	Success - Reach the Administrator's office and steal the document, without being detected.
0NO3000007	While programming the new residential Cyberdog model to retrieve objects thrown by human beings for purpose of enjoyment, I accidentally used an audio sample recording of its bark as the object to be fetched. The Cyberdog has now become attached to the sample, and displayed signs of aggressive tendencies when I attempted to recover it. I have left it in the Residential Reconstruction Area until it is needed. I believe the Cyberdog has buried it.
0NO3000008	Dr. Gail Richardson, PhD, Test Engineer, X-8 Cyberdog Project
0NO3000009	We've successfully created a capacitance module capable of emitting a focused electromagnetic pulse from a Sonic Emitter. While the physical impact is rather weak, Jenkins fired the weapon at a force field and it fried the field's emitter array. Upon further study, we've found the gun only affects a small range of frequencies. Unfortunately, the frequency of our force fields fall within this range. The gun was sent to X-8 for further study.

0NO3000024	1) Due to recent government-mandated cutbacks to our funding, only THREE experiments may be performed per day.
0NO3000025	2) We do not have infinite kennel space here in X-8! Only ONE Cyberdog beyond those needed for the testing process may be created.
0NO3000026	3) Clear any and all debris from the platform before conducting any splicing experiments.
0NO3000027	4) Experiments are NOT allowed outside the X-8 Facility.
0NO3000028	5) Finally, Security must be disabled before experiments can be run.
0NO3000029	Subjects will be informed that we are gauging the effectiveness of Communist infiltration of American schools. They won't know about the Cyberdogs until they actually begin the testing process.
0NO3000030	1) TEST A engages Cyberdog protection protocols alongside standard automated turret systems.
0NO3000031	2) TEST B adds Protectrons to the previous test. TEST B also includes some basic tests for the Field Disrupter Capacitance Module.
0NO3000032	Until further notice, please do not enter the Residential Cyberdog Test area, or conduct any experiments using it. The Cyberdogs are still being programmed, and any disturbance could have dramatic influence on their progress. Restricting access in this fashion should also help to avoid any repeats of Incident: PLAYTIME, settlements for which are coming directly out of our budget.
0NO3000034	Dr. Richardson,
0NO3000035	We've just received the latest shipment of dogs for the Cyberdog experiment process, but... well, frankly, I think our supplier screwed us. The animals must be basically feral - every time we get close to the shipping kennels they let out with the most Godawful hissing and... well, rattling is the only way I can describe it. Please advise - should we open the kennels or just send them back?
0NO3000036	In this test, YOU will take on the role of one of those evil Commies, infiltrating an institution of HONEST AMERICAN LEARNING. (Don't worry, Citizen, it's just for pretend!) Your objective is to steal documents that a REAL dirty Commie traitor (which you're not) could use to BRAINWASH OUR CHILDREN (which you wouldn't do). This test will help us to protect our children's fragile minds from the agents of INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM! Agents like YOU!
0NO3000037	Just kidding! We know you're a loyal American! AREN'T YOU?
0NO3000038	So, at Dr. Richardson's request, we opened one of those kennels from our latest shipment. The "dog" inside (and I use that term very loosely) appeared to be suffering from a truly horrendous case of mange, and upon being released it immediately attacked, killed, and attempted to swallow whole Specialist Akers. Luckily, the situation has, for now at least, contained itself, as SPC Akers was a very large man and the creature has choked to death.
0NO3000039	Does anyone know anything about this shipment? Please Advise.
0NO3000040	In light of the large number of fatalities due to the latest shipment of experimental test subjects, the shipping department is going into lockdown. I give you my personal assurance that as soon as this plague of monsters has been dealt with, I will work overtime to get your deliveries to you in a timely and efficient manner. As I am currently the only surviving member of the shipping department, however, there may still be some delays. Until then, Dr. Calis in X-13 has the passcard for the area.
0NO3000041	Skippy, Sole Survivor
0NO3000042	The X-13 Facility has loaned us their EM Pulse Wave Module prototype for the Sonic Emitter for use in our Data Retrieval Test simulations. The Module allows the Sonic Emitter to disable certain force fields. DO NOT allow test subjects to leave the X-8 facility with this Module! Even though it won't work outside Big MT, it's a security nightmare. Thank you all for your attention in this matter.
0NO3000043	Dr. Adam Figgis, MD PhD DVM DDM DD, Test Supervisor
0NO3000044	Yes, Project: Burke involves what some less science-minded individuals might call "grave robbing." Yes, we're forced into this due to budget cuts. No, none of senior staff uses the bodies for anything else. Finally, in regards to the rumor that Project: Hare engages in liquidation operations against non-military targets to procure research subjects, I will not dignify them with a response. Any other questions?
0NO3000046	To activate this terminal, please equip the Stealth Suit Mk II.
0NO3000047	The Saturnite armor plating on the Giant Robo-Scorpion has exceeded expectations - mostly. While it's virtually impervious to small arms fire, the Sonic Emitter that Parsons brought in managed to fry several of the prototype's subsystems. We'll have to look into improved EMP shielding for the next prototype.
0NO3000048	On a more positive note, the prototype's new atomic laser is performing admirably. Some residual radiation is left behind after the weapon discharges, it may be necessary to requisition more radiation suits and meds as a precaution.
0NO3000049	The constant improvements to the Giant Robo-Scorpion has rendered the Protectron models we've been using as "hostile Communist forces" largely ineffective. At this stage, they're little more than distractions.
0NO3000050	For this test, you must steal a document in the Administrator's office without being detected by the patrolling robots. Laser tripwires and proximity detectors have been activated for increased difficulty. A successful run will automatically update the suit's software and award an item in the Supply Cabinet.
0NO3000053	For this test, you must sneak to, and steal, a document from the Administrator's office without being detected by the patrolling robots. Laser tripwires have been added for increased difficulty. A successful run will automatically update the suit's software and award an item in the Supply Cabinet.

0NO3000071	It'll take weeks to get the prototype functional if we ever have to initiate the emergency shutdown procedure, but it's better than destroying the thing outright (at least until we get the 17 other prototypes we've requested).
0NO3000072	In our last supervisor meeting, we discussed the possible benefits of the small shipping accident. We are considering studying the unexpected specimen's behavior by releasing them into our test area before removing them from the X-8 facility. The shipping department will remain in lockdown until a decision has been reached.
0NO3000074	I believe this latest serum has proven to be a success. Under human observation, the creatures remain visible, but some of the nighttime recordings reveal the serum is working. The animals appear to be learning how to use their new cloaking ability when no one is around. Perhaps there is a physical limitation or some mental drawback to the ability, which prevents its usage under duress. I think I will pursue stress testing of the animals first thing Monday morning.
0NO3000075	Some issues still remain to be ironed out before the Y-17 Trauma Harness is ready for general production: calibrating the proper amount of injury to trigger the suit remains problematic. Still, the Little Yangtze subjects could hardly protest once inside the harness. If a home base is not designated, the suit enters an unpredictable wander state. And, as we discovered while calibrating injury levels, the suit's sensors are unable to recognize when the wearer is dead - luckily, autonomous corpse retrieval is nearly as useful as autonomous casualty recovery!

0NO3000124	While Slough is busy stuffing his face and trying to find new places to hide his junk food from Calis, I've decided to experiment with a mod from one of the techs over in X-8. I may not have been able to afford a doctorate like those eggheads upstairs, but I've been programming since I was in diapers. I found a ton of redundancies and exponential loop failures those halfwits must have missed. My fixes should speed up the refire rate of that K9 weapon they've been working on. Maybe if I leave it on one of their desks it'll actually get implemented. Lord knows they wouldn't take me seriously if I tried to take credit.
0NO3000125	Why the hell do you keep sending me these messages? You work right across the damn ramp from me. Walk your ass over here and say what you need to say. Stop wasting my time with these incessant messages!
0NO3000127	I went ahead and did the lab test and noticed no appreciable changes in their blood work. I'm concerned our use of the cattle prods may react with the chemistry of the injections. This is new ground we're treading. I'd hate to see your hard work lost to a change in brain chemistry. These critters could be invaluable to the war effort if we can somehow control their behavior.
0NO3000128	-Asst. Paris
0NO3000129	I've noticed some of the creatures have been increasingly aggressive when I come into the lab in the morning. Did something change in their diet? I'll run some tests if you like.
0NO3000131	I've noticed your work has taken a dive lately. This seems to have coincided with a marked weight gain over the past few months. I've developed an implant which has been proven to increase performance while reducing weight in lab animals. Granted, we haven't run it through any human test trials yet, but I'm sure it is perfectly safe. Also, please refrain from snacking in the lab. If you smudge another camera, I'm banning all food from the facility.
0NO3000133	Your shipment of cattle prods arrived today. I'd like to remind you our systems are designed to prevent infiltration by enemy agents, not internal threats. If you're doing any testing on creatures, please forward that task to the animal testing facility. As you found with the Sonic Emitter, our force fields can't handle power fluctuations well.

0NO3000138	Hey buddy! I've been helping the guys over in X-8 test out this new toy they've been building. Get this, it's a gun that uses a dog's brain to track targets! They asked me to play around with their gun trigger code, and I came up with this mod. Next time you're over there, would you give it a shot? Calis has me swamped setting X-13 up for the coming visit by the leads and he wants the turrets in place so we don't fail the new security requirements.
0NO3000139	Thanks!
0NO3000140	This is the last time I'm going to warn you, Butz. I can see that comic book poking up out of your field manual. You don't fool me, asshat. Next time I catch you slacking, I'm writing a disciplinary notice and you can spend your free time polishing emitter arrays.
0NO3000142	What the hell is his damn problem?! All I was doing was reading the latest issue of La Fantoma!, and that grouch, Calis, called me an asshat. What the hell is an asshat, anyway?

0NO3000144	I've uploaded Kael's latest firmware update to the suit. I think Kael has outdone herself this time. Self-updating firmware is an ingenious addition to this system. As we upgrade the suit, it'll automatically adapt the new systems to the user's specifications during testing and unlock the features as they come online. This will save hundreds of hours of fiddling with settings.
0NO3000145	Note to self - Make Kael a keg of my infamous 'Battle Brew.'
0NO3000146	I've been working with Mori on fitting the gloves to the torso and come up with a few improvements which should greatly enhance the user's manual dexterity. I adapted Redding's new rubberized dampening compound and applied it to the palms and other high-wear surfaces. Once the suit adjusts to the user, the benefits of these upgrades should be obvious.
0NO3000147	Researcher Kael's breakthrough with the Suit's software has led me to a breakthrough of my own. By adding an advanced servo buffer to the existing leg rigs, I've been able to increase the resolution of data sent to and from the central control module. Once these babies are hooked up to the torso, an agent should be able to limbo under barriers almost as fast as they can run!
0NO3000148	I've been watching Mendoza stumble through the various X-13 tests and noticed a critical flaw in the tripwire emitter design. A skilled scientist or someone with advanced electronics repair knowledge could crack the casings and hack their IFF circuit to ignore the current test subject. I'll see if I can reinforce the casings after the leads visit the facility this week.
0NO3000150	Chayanov had me run through the first part of the facility to test the tripwires and proximity mines the other day and the suit kept chafing. Mori says some new firmware updates fixed the suit's fitment sync ability, but I'm not so sure. The legs kept binding up on me and the torso was ridiculously tight. Maybe I should stop lifting Fancy Lads from Slough's stashes.

0NO3000152	The new atomic laser is putting an incredible strain on the Giant Robo-Scorpion's generator - damn thing shut down right in the middle of weapons testing last week.
0NO3000153	I pushed for reducing the laser's output by 25%, instead they slapped a backup generator onto the Scorpion. Dangerous, if you ask me. The systems weren't designed to handle the power from two systems at once, and if some rookie tech fires up the backup generator too early, well...
0NO3000154	Per instructions from the higher ups after that *one* time the Giant Robo-Scorpion's attack routine malfunctioned, we've installed an emergency shutdown procedure. Let's hope we never have to use it - the prototype's systems will all be fried, and we won't be up and running again for weeks. The military's expecting delivery of a battle-ready model within six months, and the project has already had enough delays.

0NO3000162	2nd day at Pre-War concentration camp. Kept China citizens here before war. Radiation turned them, had to keep them in camp with collars (explains why some of these "slave collars" exist, always wondered, some were clearly Pre-War tech). Researching the collar frequencies, touchy - circuit architecture is messy, de-constructing them taking time. Must be careful, can't be spotted by local robots, or insane brains from the Dome will try to haul me back there, then... research me.
0NO3000163	No sign of that Courier from before. He stays out of my way, I'll stay out of his. Been thinking about that "Sierra Madre" he mentioned... if he's right, I'd just need to find the casino radio frequency to track it down. Wouldn't need his help. If the working holograms and toxic gas are preserved there, might be easier to study them there with no robots to interfere. And those dispensers... might have use for those as well.
0NO3000164	Day 4, still continuing research... found way to deactivate collar after some failures, just a few headless ghouls. It's been hard to go fishing in the camp without one of them trying to run the gate and their heads exploding. Damn collars, twitchy.

0NO3000166	While setting up the radios to monitor Dome and robots, thought I saw glint (scope?) from the building on other side of compound.
0NO3000167	Should check it out, make sure I'm not being watched... might be that Courier?
0NO3000168	Still, he would have come straight up rather than hiding. Instinct says it's someone else.
0NO3000169	Kudos for the bean pod addition for the VR Sim. I like the Jack and the Beanstalk reference, buddy! I hope Calis doesn't throw a fit. Watch your back with that guy. He's always been more than a bit wound up about simple stuff. I had to move my Battle Brew setup over to X-12's storage room after he threw a prohibitionist fit about it to the Leads.
0NO3000170	-Mori
0NO3000171	The VR Sim is corrupted?! Dammit! Sounds like there's a bug in the software somewhere. I hope to God it doesn't screw with the suit's systems. I just got the firmware updated for Mori over the weekend. For now, let's just tell Calis we're having "power issues" and focus on the REPCONN tests until we get the suit ready for real-world tests.
0NO3000172	-Kael
0NO3000173	p.s. Delete this message ASAP. I don't want Calis harassing me over this.
0NO3000174	This camp's better than the one I set up on top of Signal Hills roof, clear broadcast line to its radio tower and good vantage point on North Tunnel. Set up a turret perimeter and transmitter, should be able to control the trains via remote to escape before any robots come. The broken Securitrons make a good defense line, apparently brains in center Dome can't control them like they do the others.
0NO3000175	No sign of Courier - or that woman. Turns out I was right at the Yangtze Camp, I was being watched there, probably Brotherhood assassin out to "sentence" me. She got hers, though. After the robot attack, saw her get hauled away to the SE by medical robots... probably joined the Lobotomite ranks here, don't have to worry about her anymore.
0NO3000176	Set up camp here after Yangtze attack. Too exposed here. Transmitter's vulnerable, hacked it, set up remote link so can access it any time. Need to find spot closer to north train tunnel with clear broadcast LOS to here. Canyons are too dangerous, can't go back to Yangtze - there is that weather station NW that drew that Courier here, but going there sounds like trouble. For now, going to scout the Waste Disposal site, then around the perimeter of that Securitron Plant, see if I can find a more defensible position.
0NO3000177	This holotape contains an upgrade file for the Sink robotic assistant: "Central Intelligence Unit."
0NO3000181	Got word today there was a chemical leak at the Sierra Madre, Sinclair was on the phone to ask for more help from the Think Tank Execs, so they're sending him the prototype chemical suits to protect the Villa workers. Looks like they're following up an experiment with another experiment? The whole process creeps me out, and the way they're monitoring the Sierra Madre Villa and examining the "results" - I don't think Sinclair even knows what he's really paid for. To be guineas like the Little Yangtze Chinese... maybe it'd be merciful if war did break out, put an end to this chain of horrors.
0NO3000182	I heard one of the execs mention that whether Sinclair knew it or not, the Sierra Madre would be a "test case" for the Auto-Doc and the Innovative Toxins research. Maybe they were joking, but even that kind of a joke sends a chill down my spine... if I got poisoned by one of those toxins, no way would I crawl inside one of the Y-17 Auto-Docs here if my life depended on it. The medical tech for those trauma suits alone makes me wish they'd erase their research - the suits do more thinking than the people inside them.
0NO3000183	Got the funding from Sinclair. Near as I can tell, he's willing to not only bankrupt himself for these devices, he's struck a deal with the Big MT executives, letting the Villa become a lab for the supposedly-harmless prototype tech here. I've seen the Big MT execs do this with other isolated towns (Hopeville Meteorological research up north), and the whole process, it's not what I signed up for.
0NO3000184	We finished up the design for the dispensers for the Sierra Madre villa as requested. That big-wig Sinclair went to the Big MT execs; he wanted emergency dispensers for his sheltered Villa in case war broke out and they needed to care for the survivors there. He's done everything he can to isolate the community and tighten security, now he just needs to guarantee a food supply and be able to ration out resources in the event of nuclear holocaust. I hear he even narrowed the streets so cars couldn't come inside town, let alone come up to the Villa.
0NO3000185	Spending a lot of hours getting the Vera Keyes hologram looking right. I'm a physicist, not a sculptor - iterating on her facial features and her dress to match Sinclair's expectations... it's about enough to make me file a complaint. I don't get the sense Sinclair's doing this out of love or well, lust.
0NO3000186	Somewhere along the line, he became cold about the whole matter, as if crafting the hologram "just right" was something he hated.
0NO3000187	If it wasn't for Sinclair's request, this hologram project would've been canned long ago. In addition to the dispenser tech he wants for the Sierra Madre, he spoke to the Big MT execs about using the holograms for defense (?), that's something N.E. would have to sign off on; I can't even imagine the cost to turn the holograms into something beyond walking cameras and greeters. And why would you? It's only been a little while, and I already hate spending my time with these ghosts walking around the plant. Rather see the research money spent on actually improving the field of view sensors or adding upgrades to the emitters.
0NO3000188	I'm sending over the K9000 Cyberdog Gun. It should do the trick. Let me know if you have any operational questions.
0NO3000189	-Adam
0NO3000190	We've had another unfortunate occurrence. While attempting to destroy Mr. Harris's Trauma Harness, the disaster control team member carrying the gun slipped and fell, dropping the weapon. Unarmed, the team had to flee and seal off the lab. Unfortunately, your K9000 Cyberdog Gun Prototype was sealed inside X-12.
0NO3000192	The Y-17 Trauma Harness has succeeded beyond our wildest expectations! The test harnesses were able to take over the motor functions of an injured subject and "walk" them back to home base.
0NO3000193	We'll have to see what develops once it's recorded enough neuro-auto-muscular movements to display a wider range of behaviors... to think, if they could be programmed to replicate a wearer's shooting or fighting reflexes, we'd have something truly amazing for the war effort!
0NO3000194	The government shipped in the first batch of dissidents today. Three whole trainloads of Communist infiltrators. Half of them don't even speak English, so we had to show them where to go with our nightsticks. They got the point eventually. The docs are already talking about "research subjects." Guess that'll help advance the war effort.
0NO3000195	One of the prisoners who speaks a little English - I guess he's become the unofficial spokesman - came to the commandant's office today screaming about hungry ghosts snatching his people up in the night. The commandant told him to give up the ignorant superstitions of a bygone era and had him thrown in the cooler for three weeks. Me, I've seen some of the new robots they're developing here, and I gotta wonder where they get the brains from.
0NO3000196	Another escape attempt last night. We rounded them all up and processed the escapees, but these little bastards are determined. We've got triple shifts on the camp around the clock, and the extra hours are eating up morale. Commandant says he's put in a requisition to use the camp as a field test for the new "total pacification collars" the scientists have been working on. Maybe then I can get some goddamn sleep.
0NO3000197	This holotape contains the functionality profile for the Sink robotic assistant: "Central Intelligence Unit."
0NO3000198	With my dying breath, I write that I hate the VR Simulation so much! It has killed us. Now, I will kill it.
0NO4000001	Jesus, this place is a hellhole. I heard it was bad from some of the guys coming back, but... Jesus. Henriksen bought it when one of those unexploded warheads went off, and Jenkins... those things got him. I don't know what they were exactly - ghouls, maybe, but nasty fuckers. LT thinks they were drawn by the explosion that killed Henriksen. I think we're all gonna die here.
0NO4000002	Initial recon of the Divide has met with heavy resistance. These ghouls - the troopers have started calling them "Marked Men" - are smarter than the typical ferals we're used to. Yesterday we found some old Pre-War cages they've used to capture Deathclaws - God knows what they were planning to do with them, but one of the things must have escaped, judging from the carnage. I've ordered double watches until we find it.

0NO4000007	If you find this, my name is James Rubinek. I'm a trader from the Hub - thought I'd found a new route to markets east. Guess now I know why no routes go through this Godforsaken place. Leg's broken, can't get out, and even if I could there's those crazed ghouls and those digging things waiting for me.
0NO4000008	Please, get this note to my ex-wife, Anna. Tell her what happened. Tell her how I died. And I guess you can tell that cheating bitch I hope she's happy with that limp-dick Rory Spencer.
0NO4000010	I think we did it! We finally convinced the Death Merchants to hear our beautiful Mother Earth's cries! I just had a personal meeting with the base commander, who said they would be taking a long, hard look at our demands and preparing something special for us. I can't wait to see what it is - I bet it's a full nuclear disarmament!
0NO4000011	Somebody from the Political Office should keep an eye on those guys down at the water treatment plant. That's the third request for extra funds I've had to deny this month - do they think we're made of money? I swear, it's like they want the Communists to win....
0NO4000012	Attention All Base Personnel:
0NO4000013	DO NOT engage the protestors outside the construction zone. I know, I know, the presence of those freedom-loving no-goodniks fills my brain with the WHITE-HOT RAGE OF CAPITALIST JUSTICE, but the Political Office has something planned for them, and you mooks better not screw it up.
0NO4000014	Commander Devlin
0NO4000015	Commander Devlin,
0NO4000016	I apologize for e-mailing you again, but I still haven't received a response to my previous seven e-mails. Once again, we DESPERATELY need more funding to improve safety protocols at the water treatment plant. Current protocols are absolutely appalling, and I don't even want to think about the consequences of a failure on the local water supply.
0NO4000017	Specialist Alan Rothchild
0NO4000018	Listen here you pinko Commie-eyed puke, I got your lily-livered defeatest e-mails. I ignored them because they made me THROW UP IN MY MOUTH! Do you understand we're fighting a war here?! Against the REDS? And the only thing standing between you and hot atomic Armageddon is ME and my base full of GIANT NUCLEAR MISSILES? Answer me this, Specialist Buttinski: if the American people are overrun by Kremlin Joe and his Chicom cronies, what good will clean drinking water be?
0NO4000020	Swear to God, if I lose one more night of sleep over these noises I am going to strangle somebody. "Knocking pipes" my ass - do these slumlords think it's easy running the safety protocols for an entire ICBM launch complex on two hours sleep? It's a goddamn miracle nobody's started World War III over a low-flying titmouse.
0NO4000021	Fantastic. Now there's earthquakes. Earthquakes! Sure, Commander Devlin says they're minor ones and nothing to worry about, but come on. EARTHQUAKES. Did no one think to check fault lines before they built a massive UNDERGROUND MISSILE COMPLEX?
0NO4000022	Your tax dollars at work, folks. Swear to God, when my term's up I'm moving to Canada.
0NO4000023	"Minor and nothing to worry about." If that last quake wasn't a 5.0 at least, I'm Dean Domino. That's it, I'm requesting a transfer before the whole plaudsfg099io8u8ioi yti xciokghpt8i9io

0NO4000043	We will soon play host to one of the greatest American patriots of our day, General Wellesley himself. For those of you whose family trees don't fork, the General is chief liaison officer to the Big MT Research Facility. He and his team are paying us a visit to collect our "guests" and take them someplace where they can do some good for their country beyond stinking of patchouli and shooting the LSD.
0NO4000045	3rd Platoon, Cazador Company, 4th Ranger Battalion Action Report: Staff Sergeant Balmoral reporting. We've reached the area local tribes call "the Divide," but so far, I don't think this will be a suitable route for bringing troops to Hoover Dam. The terrain is a nightmare, we've seen evidence of hostile indigenous life, and the Geiger counters are ticking like grandfather clocks on Turbo.
0NO4000046	Full report when the advance scouts come back at 2300, but as of now I'm recommending we abandon this mission.
0NO4000047	3rd Platoon, Cazador Company, 4th Ranger Battalion Action Report, addendum: Staff Sergeant Balmoral reporting again. Looks like we aren't the only ones that had the idea to check this place out. Our advance scouts encountered heavy Legion activity in the area. The troopers are gearing up to hit them tonight - hopefully before they know we're here.

0NO4000052	General,
0NO4000053	We found a seized shipment of Chinese "Red Victory" model grenade launchers and thought you might like to have one for yourself. They're quicker to reload then our "Great Bears," but they don't pack quite the same punch. Still, it'll be nice to give those bastards a taste of their own medicine if it comes to that, right?
0NO4000054	This hand written note contains the recipe for Bitter Drink. (The recipe is now unlocked for the campfire crafting station.)
0NO4000055	At 0600 hours, Bravo Team will conduct sweep-and-clear operations in advance of the main force. Early intelligence suggests the tunnels are only sparsely populated by small, subterranean semi-humanoids, which are easily cowed by bright light and loud noises. Bravo Team has been issued flashbang grenades for this purpose, and is expected to meet minimal resistance.
0NO4000057	This is just a reminder that all base commissary terminals draw from the same central depository. Please do not waste your time or the technicians' by running from commissary to commissary. You won't get any more whiskey than you did from the first one.
