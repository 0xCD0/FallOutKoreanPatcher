0QU1000009	Track down the source of the Sierra Madre invitation.
0QU1000010	Wake up.
0QU1000011	On your feet, before I set off your collar.
0QU1000012	Look at your Pip-Boy. Listen to the audio log, follow the instructions.
0QU1000013	From now on, do as I say. It's the only way you'll leave the Sierra Madre alive.
0QU1000014	Try and run, disobey me? I'll set off your collar and find someone who knows how to listen.
0QU1000015	...and no sleeping, no waiting around, not even for an hour. Waste my time, you're useless to me.
0QU1000017	Villa's comm speakers have... aged poorly, like the Madre. Pre-War junk.
0QU1000018	The speakers emit a signal that'll set off your collar. Too close, too long, you'll lose your head.
0QU1000019	Some speakers may be damaged, blue ones, sparking - you can destroy those. Others, red, too well-shielded.
0QU1000020	Don't be stupid. Pay attention, keep moving. Hear your collar beep, look around.
0QU1000021	Don't go through the gate to Puesta del Sol yet, gather the others first.
0QU1000022	Leave the Salida gate alone. You're not done with the Villa yet, so don't stray.
0QU1000023	You sure have filled your Pip-Boy's archives with garbage.
0QU1000024	Mitchell... that your name, Mitchell? No, wait... previous owner, Vault 21. Vegas.
0QU1000025	No matter, not important. Probably stole this Pip-Boy from him, didn't you.
0QU1000026	Don't worry, if you're a thief, a thief is just what I need.
0QU1000027	Followed the Gala radio signal, just like I did, hoping to strike it rich?
0QU1000028	Cooperate with me, follow along, we'll crack the Sierra Madre. Together.
0QU1000029	There were others like you... turned on each other, even before the collars.
0QU1000030	Play your cards right, be smart, you'll live through this. Be dumb...
0QU1000031	..well, your head wasn't much use anyway, was it?
0QU1000032	The Villa's toxic. The more you're outside, the more you breathe...
0QU1000033	...then the Cloud wins. So move fast, don't stay outdoors too long.
0QU1000034	Outside, you may notice your vision'll pulse, get dizzy.
0QU1000035	It's the Cloud. Eats your insides, slowly. Too much exposure, death.
0QU1000037	Collar 12's near you, in the building.
0QU1000038	Getting an odd signal near your location. Some kind of emitter, hunt for it.
0QU1000039	Lost the emitter signal. Your work, I presume?
0QU1000040	Picked up another emitter signal, then lost it.
0QU1000041	Maybe you think I wanted to send people here. To inhale toxins. Die. Kill each other.
0QU1000042	Hardly. If robots could do this, I'd have sent them in.
0QU1000043	That collar around your neck is because people are unreliable. Even chains of command - unreliable.
0QU1000044	These collars, with adjustments, work much better.
0QU1000045	Watch out for the Villa inhabitants.
0QU1000046	The Villa's inhabitants seem obsessed with Holograms. Use it to distract them.
0QU1000047	Picking up an emitter signature - watch for Security Holograms, dangerous.
0QU1000048	Main power's down. How troublesome.
0QU1000049	The ventilation system controls should be located in that building.
0QU1000050	They should help with the Cloud.
0QU1000051	Good, ventilation's back online.
0QU1000052	Deciding to explore? Curiosity kills, get back to the main path.
0QU1000053	I mean it - if you die here, then this starts all over again.
0QU1000054	Collars weren't always linked to each other. A mistake.
0QU1000055	Others who came, kept killing each other. Now, I've fixed that by linking them to each other.
0QU1000056	Keep heading West, that's where you'll need to leave the mutant.
0QU1000057	Damn power station levers need his strength to operate.
0QU1000058	You're at one of the Gala locations, you'll need to bring the mutant here.
0QU1000059	Only he has the strength to operate the levers, I've found.
0QU1000060	Head north, get to the bell tower. There is where you'll trigger the event.
0QU1000061	Provided you have everyone in place.
0QU1000062	Toxins are thick in your area. Move East, avoid the clouds.
0QU1000063	Don't test me or the Cloud... both will kill you without a second thought.
0QU1000064	Covering a lot of ground, good. Still a ways to go.
0QU1000065	Stay focused. Only one chance to do this.
0QU1000066	Salida del Sol... now a maze of toxins.
0QU1000067	Entire Villa is a deathtrap.
0QU1000068	Keep north - that's where you'll find the bell tower.
0QU1000069	Everyone needs to be in place, or it'll be a wasted trip.
0QU1000070	You're resourceful. Had a daughter, foster daughter, like you.
0QU1000071	She was willful, stubborn. But clever. She's gone now. Lost to me.
0QU1000072	We don't have time for you to explore the Villa, stick to the Gala.
0QU1000073	Are you paying attention? Roam the Villa, and you'll die.
0QU1000074	The bell tower. That's where you'll trigger the Gala Event.
0QU1000075	It's a ways up. I'm sure you'll find a way to climb up there.
0QU1000076	Take the ladder. It should still be intact.
0QU1000077	Once you're in the tower, throw the switch, then get ready to move.
0QU1000078	What are you doing?
0QU1000079	The others aren't in place yet. Get them to their stations, then return here.
0QU1000080	Leave the mute at the Switching Station - she'll know what to do.
0QU1000081	Your detours are getting tiresome.
0QU1000082	What do you expect to find? A way to escape? No, I don't think so.
0QU1000083	This must have been paradise before the war.
0QU1000084	But no, radiation and the Cloud ruined that dream.
0QU1000085	Head west, past the toxins, get to the Switching Station.
0QU1000086	So that's what happened to that one.
0QU1000087	Pray you don't end up like him. Greed killed him. Can kill you, too.
0QU1000088	Remember - you need to bring the mute girl here.
0QU1000089	If not, it's a long walk back, and time's running out.
0QU1000090	Sick of having to herd all of you through the Villa...
0QU1000091	...at least you're making more progress than the last team.
0QU1000092	Don't waste time trying to catch a glimpse of the Sierra Madre.
0QU1000093	Enough detours, get back to the task at hand.
0QU1000094	The Gala target is straight ahead - southeast on the compass.
0QU1000095	It's where you should leave the Ghoul.
0QU1000096	You're at the Gala area... now, you need someone to stay there.
0QU1000097	Bring the Ghoul... he'll do.
0QU1000098	I can hear the event firing off. Now get to the main doors, quickly.
0QU1000099	Keep moving. The doors will close unless you get there in time.
0QU1000100	Faster!
0QU1000101	What's taking you so long? Get to the casino!
0QU1000103	If you're trying to crawl-and-hide, don't turn on your Pip-Boy light...
0QU1000104	...that light? Makes it easier for... others to spot you.
0QU1000105	See if you can access that terminal.
0QU1000106	Might be some "Vending Machine" access codes you can download.
0QU1000107	Those "Vending" Machines, the ones with the blue lights. Use them to resupply.
0QU1000108	Gather any casino chips you see, take them to the machines.
0QU1000109	Followed the signal here because of that damn voice.
0QU1000110	Promising to "begin again?" Pre-War nonsense. More like "end again."
0QU1000112	Follow my orders, freedom is yours. I promise.
0QU1000113	The gate to the Sierra Madre's sealed, locked. For now.
0QU1000114	Do as I say, and it won't be locked for much longer.
0QU1000115	Those "vending" machines... vending wasn't their intended use.
0QU1000116	They do so much more. Make the Villa self-sufficient.
0QU1000117	< Elijah says the player disobeyed his warning about cooperating with companions, so player goes boom >
0QU1000118	Now, piece together the words from her holotapes in the right sequence.
0QU1000120	You found a way to the Vault... good. Now find a way into the Chamber.
0QU1000124	Sierra Madre's still sealed up. Find a way to restore the power.
0QU1000125	Trapped now. You won't be able to deal with the turrets alone.
0QU1000126	That does it. I'm coming for you.
0QU1000127	Your collar's set to detonate. You won't get far.
0QU1000129	He knew a way to get to the starlet's room? Backstage "pass," indeed.
0QU1000130	That starlet - Vera - must have had access the security? Maybe the audience controls...?
0QU1000131	That Holotape needs a holo-emitter. Get to the projection booth, play it, and de-activate the Security Holograms.
0QU1000133	Now - find the voice fragment and escape before your collar explodes. Move!
0QU1000134	Talk all you want, I don't trust him. At least you can leave now.
0QU1000136	The Ghoul's your burden - find the Holotape fragment, and keep it to yourself.
0QU1000137	Until you deal with the Holograms, you can't reach the Ghoul - find a way to de-activate the Security Holograms.
0QU1000138	Doors'll sealed until power's back.
0QU1000139	The door won't open until you restore power. Check the main casino.
0QU1000140	Power first, then the door unlocks. Understand?
0QU1000143	Good, now keep moving. You still need to unlock the elevator to the vault.
0QU1000144	Put him down, good. Now get out, before your collar blows.
0QU1000145	Fix the valves and get out of there before his collar blows!
0QU1000146	Good, now keep moving. Take the elevator to the vault.
0QU1000147	Sounds like she's going to be difficult. Handle it.
0QU1000149	Find a way past the Hologram Security and get to the power switch.
0QU1000150	Lot of power lines... leading to a room near the cashier's counter. Check it out.
0QU1000151	The vault has an audio lock. And it responds to the starlet's voice. We need to find more samples.
0QU1000152	A theater... it may have the recordings of the Starlet's voice we need.
0QU1000153	Gas leak has stopped - now, for the mutant.
0QU1000154	He broke one of the valves. Wait for him to leave, then fix it.
0QU1000156	The holotape... the starlet's voice is the key to the vault, look for more fragments.
0QU1000157	What is wrong? Maybe... maybe you need to splice the fragment to make the phrase.
0QU1000158	The Theater should have the tools you need to edit the tapes. Look around.
0QU1000159	Ah, that's it. Try it out in the Suites at once.
0QU1000160	That's it for the mutant reject. Now for the others.
0QU1000161	Search for more recordings of the starlet. Maybe she had an admirer here, among the staff.
0QU1000162	Look for more voice recordings. Might be something in her possessions.
0QU1000164	The gas leak's sealed the main kitchen door. Check for an emergency entrance - the casino side corridors, look there.
