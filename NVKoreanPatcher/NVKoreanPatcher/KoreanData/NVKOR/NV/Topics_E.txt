0TO0000002	What do you think the others will do at Hoover Dam?
0TO0000004	Cass isn't around anymore, so I won't be able to complete the negotiation for you.
0TO0000005	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm reuniting the Remnants, and they'll need your piloting skills.
0TO0000006	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm finding the Remnants, and you can fly.
0TO0000007	Arcade and I were looking for you. We're gathering the Remnants.
0TO0000008	Arcade sent me to look for you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
0TO0000009	Do you know anything about Corporal White?
0TO0000010	I'm still working on the Boomers.
0TO0000011	The cannibals among the White Glove Society are dead.
0TO0000012	The White Glove Society has agreed to an alliance with Caesar's Legion.
0TO0000013	There's no way the White Glove Society will be cannibals again - I've already seen to that.
0TO0000014	I'm still working on the White Glove Society.
0TO0000015	I had to wipe out the Boomers' leaders.
0TO0000016	I've won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
0TO0000017	Look, I take advantage of the NCR, too, but I don't make them my enemy.
0TO0000018	I've brought new security codes for this station's radio from Sergeant Reyes.
0TO0000019	I've brought radio security code updates from Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0000020	I have updated radio security codes from Sergeant Reyes here.
0TO0000021	I brought updated radio security codes from Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0000022	I need to confirm your report about Great Khans with trained Deathclaws.
0TO0000023	The bottle cap press is no longer a problem.
0TO0000024	Contreras sent me. McCarran needs a lot more guns and ammo.
0TO0000025	I delivered the invoice, just as you asked.
0TO0000026	Delivered that thing you wanted me to deliver.
0TO0000027	The Crimson Caravan Company no longer has to worry about Henry Jamison.
0TO0000028	Henry Jamison is fired.
0TO0000029	Cassidy Caravans has been bought out, and is now part of the Crimson Caravan Company.
0TO0000030	I bought Cassidy Caravans for you.
0TO0000031	I have the Gun Runner holotape.
0TO0000032	I've brought a brain to transplant into Rex.
0TO0000033	I'll need 2500 caps to pay the mercenaries.
0TO0000034	I'm a hero in the NCR, and I think you need to leave. Now.
0TO0000035	Show me what you have for sale.
0TO0000036	Arcade asked me to gather all the remaining members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
0TO0000037	Arcade asked me to find you. I'm gathering the Remnants.
0TO0000038	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold to you?
0TO0000039	I've already reverted the White Glove Society back to cannibalism.
0TO0000040	I'll handle the Boomers for you.
0TO0000042	When the Legion attacks Hoover Dam, the Brotherhood will attack HELIOS One.
0TO0000043	When we attack the dam the Brotherhood will rise from their bunker to conquer HELIOS One!
0TO0000044	I'll eliminate Mr. House for you.
0TO0000045	I've already wiped out the Boomers' leadership.
0TO0000046	I've already won over the Boomers. They'll do as I say.
0TO0000047	I'll see what I can work out with the White Glove Society.
0TO0000048	I've already destroyed the Brotherhood's bunker in Hidden Valley.
0TO0000049	I've destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker in Hidden Valley.
0TO0000050	I'll kill President Kimball for you.
0TO0000051	Where's the Platinum Chip?
0TO0000052	What's going on with the Great Khans?
0TO0000053	I know what you and your partner have been up to - I got the evidence from your rooms.
0TO0000054	Back rubs are a specialty of mine. Maybe I'll show you sometime.
0TO0000055	You might be interested to know that I killed a fiend named Cook-Cook.
0TO0000056	I've done all I can. Let's take over Goodsprings.
0TO0000057	Ringo's dead. What now?
0TO0000058	So what's next for you guys?
0TO0000059	I'm just having a look around.
0TO0000061	There may be data corruption in one of your memory chips. Let me take a look.
0TO0000062	Maybe something's broken in one of your computer parts. Let me take a look.
0TO0000063	I'm trying to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. Any ideas?
0TO0000064	Betsy needs to go see a doctor. Where's a doctor?
0TO0000065	Any ideas on how to convince Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor?
0TO0000067	Major Dhatri said I should talk to you about taking down Driver Nephi.
0TO0000069	I'm trying to get Corporal Betsy to go see a doctor. I heard you saw Usanagi yourself.
0TO0000070	What do you need done?
0TO0000071	You've got trouble. The NCR are planning a raid on this place soon.
0TO0000072	Chavez has been dealt with. You won't see him around here anymore.
0TO0000073	I got rid of him.
0TO0000074	The merchant was a bunny hunter. Got rid of him.
0TO0000075	How would you feel about becoming Primm's new sheriff?
0TO0000076	President Kimball is dead.
0TO0000077	President Kimball survived the assassination attempt.
0TO0000078	After everything I've done for the Legion, this one failure condemns me?
0TO0000079	I've done lots of help and stuff for you. I don't do good once and you hate me?
0TO0000080	I've brought a doctor, Arcade Gannon, who can take care of Caesar. He's outside.
0TO0000081	President Kimball survived. His visit to the Hoover Dam was cancelled.
0TO0000082	About Hoover Dam...
0TO0000083	How do you know about Benny?
0TO0000085	You again? How'd you find me here?
0TO0000086	You'd better leave while you can. The Powder Gangers won't fall for your trick.
0TO0000087	Have a look at this book. If you want to see what your tribe could be, read about the Mongol Empire.
0TO0000088	All of the Ranger stations have been given the new security codes.
0TO0000089	Every station except Charlie has been given the new security codes. Charlie was wiped out.
0TO0000090	What else did you need me to do?
0TO0000091	I've come to ask the Great Khans to break their alliance with Caesar's Legion.
0TO0000093	Have a look at this book. It will show you what happens to tribes that "ally" with Caesar's Legion.
0TO0000094	I'd like to talk more about the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
0TO0000095	What's your opinion of the NCR?
0TO0000096	I want to talk to you about the fate of the Great Khans.
0TO0000097	Now that you're in command, will you lead the Khans against Caesar and fight for the NCR?
0TO0000098	I'm here to ask you to publicly oppose Papa Khan's alliance with Caesar.
0TO0000099	Doctor Henry sent me. I need a new brain for my cyber-dog.
0TO0000100	Let's talk about Rey's brain.
0TO0000101	I've been told you're someone I should talk to about stopping the Khans' alliance with Caesar.
0TO0000102	So, about the alliance with Caesar's Legion....
0TO0000104	I'm looking for a suitcase filled with chemical supplies for a... friend. Know anything?
0TO0000105	Something's wrong with my cyber-dog. I was told to come to you.
0TO0000107	I heard Corporal White came here to investigate a water shortage.
0TO0000108	Hector told me everything.
0TO0000109	I could use Lupa's brain to fix my cyber-dog.
0TO0000110	I'm ready to fight Lupa.
0TO0000111	What did you need help with?
0TO0000112	I got Sergeant Teddy - he's a little chewed up.
0TO0000113	Okay. Let's fight.
0TO0000116	Caesar wishes to extend your society an offer of alliance with his Legion.
0TO0000120	If you're looking for work, Tommy Torini is hiring singers at the Tops.
0TO0000121	Have you seen Benny?
0TO0000122	When's the last time you saw Benny?
0TO0000123	Sergeant Reyes sent me here. I've got a security update for your radio.
0TO0000125	I've got evidence!
0TO0000127	What do you need help with?
0TO0000130	I hear you've got dynamite. It would help us beat the powder gangers.
0TO0000131	Did you know there's a man named Joe Cobb looking for you?
0TO0000132	What are you going to do about the Powder Gangers?
0TO0000134	I'm going to help Ringo take on the powder gangers. I might need your help.
0TO0000135	What say I help you take over this town?
0TO0000136	A man named Joe Cobb was looking for you, but I killed him.
0TO0000137	Are you decent in a fight? I could use more firepower, if you have any.
0TO0000138	I have an update on Corporal White.
0TO0000139	Major Dhatri said I should ask you about Cook-Cook.
0TO0000140	I want to claim a bounty.
0TO0000142	I'd like to see what you have for sale.
0TO0000144	I figure a guy like you gets his pick of killing gear.
0TO0000145	A gun nut like you must have some weapons stashed around here.
0TO0000153	Guess what? I know your self-destruct code.
0TO0000155	I'll need 2000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
0TO0000156	Why are the Powder Gangers out to get you?
0TO0000157	Any ideas on how to convince Trudy to join us?
0TO0000158	The Boomers will come when I call them.
0TO0000159	The Boomer leadership has been neutralized.
0TO0000160	Have a look at this book. Your tribe is nothing but a bunch of thugs, aping the glories of the past.
0TO0000162	Tell me more about these "demons."
0TO0000163	You say one of the demons "raved" at you?
0TO0000164	About those "demons"...
0TO0000165	<Lie> I'll need 3000 caps to pay off the mercenaries.
0TO0000166	Would Chet be willing to give us his supplies?
0TO0000167	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel.
0TO0000168	The Brotherhood of Steel will aid us against the NCR.
0TO0000169	You don't need to look outward, mighty Khan. Your tribe is proud and strong - claim your own glory!
0TO0000170	Who cares about glory? Better to live without glory than die pointlessly, if you ask me.
0TO0000171	I changed my mind - I'll help you with your mercenary problem.
0TO0000172	You won't have any more trouble with those mercenaries.
0TO0000173	How can I get Easy Pete's dynamite?
0TO0000174	The White Glove Society is now an ally of the Legion.
0TO0000175	I wasn't able to get the support of the White Glove Society.
0TO0000176	What great legacy do the Great Khans have? Your tribe is nothing but ghosts and martyrs.
0TO0000177	Any idea where I might look to find such inspiration from the past?
0TO0000179	I'm looking for Doctor Henry.
0TO0000181	What do you think I should do about ED-E? Brotherhood or Followers?
0TO0000182	I'd like to exchange caps for chips.
0TO0000183	The NCR thinks pretty highly of me. Let's say I get word to your parents...
0TO0000184	Do you have enough scrap metal yet?
0TO0000185	Mind if I take some of those extra medical supplies?
0TO0000186	You'll have to find someone else for the Gun Runner job. That's not something I do.
0TO0000187	Here's your money - 2500 caps.
0TO0000188	What kind of implants do you have available?
0TO0000189	You sell plants, too?
0TO0000190	I want to buy an implant.
0TO0000191	Is it really necessary to destroy the Brotherhood?
0TO0000192	I'm not going to kill the NCR's President.
0TO0000193	I hear you were a slave of Caesar's Legion.
0TO0000194	It was easy to figure out that the NCR water shortage points to you - save me some time, will you?
0TO0000195	I found this teddy bear in your partner's room. Strange, don't you think?
0TO0000196	Take a look at this ledger I found in Dermot's room.
0TO0000197	The Powder Gangers need you to donate some supplies to them.
0TO0000198	Here - the spare medical supplies from Doc Mitchell.
0TO0000199	What's the point of freeing the Bighorners?
0TO0000200	The Bighorners are loose.
0TO0000202	You should help me take down the powder gang. Bullets, explosions, lots of fun.
0TO0000203	Uh, we're a little outnumbered against the powder gang. Think you could help?
0TO0000204	What happens if I help Ringo?
0TO0000205	So I help Ringo, and Goodsprings will like me more. What if I help the Powder Gangers?
0TO0000206	You should get medical help for your trauma.
0TO0000208	Mental trauma can slow you down or distract you, but it's treatable - just like any bullet wound.
0TO0000209	Just get the help. You'll feel better, I promise.
0TO0000210	Doctor Usanagi at the New Vegas Medical Clinic can help you.
0TO0000211	Who's in charge of the prison now?
0TO0000213	Why does Caesar want to see me?
0TO0000214	Traveling a little light for a merchant, aren't you? No pack Brahmin?
0TO0000216	Even if you managed to kill me, the Powder Gangers are already on to you. It's why I'm here.
0TO0000217	So, there's no official bounty? Waste of time, if you ask me. Better walk away while you can.
0TO0000219	A real merchant would be much more worried about Powder Gangers, you know.
0TO0000220	You sure you're actually a merchant?
0TO0000221	Do you have any thrust control modules from REPCONN in stock?
0TO0000222	Looking for rocket parts. Uh... thrust models or something. Got any?
0TO0000223	About those thrust control modules...
0TO0000224	About those thrust models...
0TO0000225	I repaired your generator.
0TO0000226	I have a new brain for Rex.
0TO0000227	I've dealt with the attacks on the camp. They won't be a problem any more.
0TO0000228	I found your attacker. There's a Great Khan hiding out in the mountains. I can lead your men there.
0TO0000229	I'd like some healing powder.
0TO0000230	I'd like to get Hadrian out of his contract.
0TO0000231	I'm back to talk about Hadrian's contract.
0TO0000232	Some people have gone missing, and they were last seen dealing with you.
0TO0000233	The troopers are all dead. You're free to go.
0TO0000234	Let's talk about settling things between you and the NCR.
0TO0000235	How much money do you owe this Reaper guy?
0TO0000236	You sound like you're eager to die.
0TO0000237	I need supplies to fight the Powder Gangers.
0TO0000238	I overheard your argument. What was that all about?
0TO0000239	That guy looked mad. Something going on?
0TO0000240	Do you know anything about the people who attacked me?
0TO0000241	I've decided to kill you for Joe Cobb.
0TO0000242	Doc Mitchell said you could teach me to survive in the desert.
0TO0000243	I heard about what happened to Corporal Betsy.
0TO0000244	Are you supposed to be famous or something?
0TO0000245	I'd like to hear about your open bounties.
0TO0000253	I'm in good with the Omertas - ask around. Feel like quitting yet?
0TO0000254	Here's your money - 2000 caps, as we agreed.
0TO0000255	You should know I've been helpful to the Followers, so come clean about White if you know something.
0TO0000256	What makes the surplus ammo inferior?
0TO0000257	Why is surplus ammo not good?
0TO0000258	Who was that man you were arguing with?
0TO0000260	Near the saloon and store are good spots to stage an ambush - if I had the help.
0TO0000261	I could probably take out the powder gang by surprise, if I had help. Probably.
0TO0000264	You're a weak link. I know it, you know it, and First Recon knows it. Do something about it.
0TO0000265	Just get the help. People are worried about you.
0TO0000266	Want me to take a look at your broken radio?
0TO0000267	Can probably fix your broken stuff.
0TO0000268	I fixed your radio.
0TO0000269	The rest of First Recon all agree that you should go see Doctor Usanagi.
0TO0000270	Arcade Gannon has asked me to gather all the former members of the Enclave in the Mojave.
0TO0000271	What did you do when you were with the Enclave?
0TO0000272	What makes this a "dangerous place?"
0TO0000273	What's your opinion on the current situation?
0TO0000274	Corporal Betsy from First Recon will be coming to you for mental treatment.
0TO0000275	Corporal Betsy's coming to you to fix her brain. It's not working right.
0TO0000276	I convinced her to pay you what you're owed. You're free to leave.
0TO0000277	You're free to leave, but McLafferty won't pay you. That's the deal.
0TO0000278	How did you like flying vertibirds for the Enclave?
0TO0000279	Did you like flying for the Enclave?
0TO0000280	Tell me about the old days with the Enclave.
0TO0000281	Tell me about weapon mods and special ammo.
0TO0000282	What's weapon mods? And why's the ammo special?
0TO0000283	This area is your territory?
0TO0000284	What's wrong with Betsy?
0TO0000285	I can talk to Betsy about getting medical help for her trauma, if you want.
0TO0000286	Uh... did you want me to help Betsy or something?
0TO0000287	I convinced Corporal Betsy to get help from Doctor Usanagi.
0TO0000288	I'm going to wear your head like you wear that dog's.
0TO0000289	What can you tell me about this job? <Show Delivery Order>
0TO0000290	I want to ask you some more about the delivery I was supposed to make.
0TO0000291	Where can I get information on the man that shot me?
0TO0000292	I'm a courier with the Mojave Express.
0TO0000293	I lost a package I was supposed to deliver.
0TO0000294	The Boomers hate me. They'll never follow my lead.
0TO0000295	The White Glove Society won't listen to me - I've caused them too much trouble.
0TO0000296	What was that about the surplus ammo?
0TO0000297	What was that about McCarran?
0TO0000298	Lenk told me her story.
0TO0000299	<Lie> I'm here because of your debt to the Omertas. Pay me what you've got and you'll get more time.
0TO0000300	Janet's asked me to talk to you about releasing her from her contract.
0TO0000301	Contreras sent me for some medical supplies.
0TO0000302	I've got some scrap for you.
0TO0000304	So you don't have the Omertas' money yet? I'll let them know about that.
0TO0000305	I'll go talk to the Omertas about you, then. Unless you feel like quitting?
0TO0000306	Do you have something against the NCR?
0TO0000307	Been working here long?
0TO0000308	Tell me about Pretty Sarah.
0TO0000309	Aren't you kind of old to be doing this?
0TO0000310	I'm interested in learning more about Dermot and Saint James.
0TO0000311	How much does it cost to hire you?
0TO0000314	Can I go in?
0TO0000315	Why are you called Scrambler?
0TO0000316	I need something repaired.
0TO0000318	Caesar would be dead if I didn't try to help him. How dare you blame me for trying to save his life!
0TO0000319	Hey, it totally wasn't my fault that he died. He was old.
0TO0000320	You said Caesar has an offer for me. What kind of offer?
0TO0000321	There's a bounty out on Powder Gangers?
0TO0000322	Tilden mentioned you had surplus ammo. Mind if I have some?
0TO0000323	What is it you do here?
0TO0000324	I'd like to exchange NCR money for chips.
0TO0000325	What's the story with Keene?
0TO0000326	Doctor Henry wants Lily to continue wearing the prototype. What do you think?
0TO0000327	Doctor Henry wants Lily to keep wearing the new Stealth thing. Is that bad?
0TO0000329	Go away or you'll have to deal with me, and you'll wish you were fighting Super Mutants instead.
0TO0000330	You should leave before I... get mad.
0TO0000331	I'm here to talk to you about our new "business" arrangement.
0TO0000332	I'm here for my "special" order.
0TO0000333	I've been inside the Brotherhood's bunker, but I haven't destroyed it yet.
0TO0000334	Won't killing President Kimball just anger the NCR?
0TO0000335	How goes your research for the Nightkin cure?
0TO0000336	I found a chewed up Stealth Boy in the Nightstalker lair.
0TO0000337	I could look for the source of the Nightstalker mutation for you.
0TO0000338	You should look at this. It's Karl's journal, and it's very revealing of his true opinions.
0TO0000339	This is a ledger from Caesar's camp, showing what Karl really has planned for the Great Khans.
0TO0000341	Do you have a problem with humans?
0TO0000342	I fixed Snuffles' leg.
0TO0000343	How you feeling, boy?
0TO0000344	The NCR troopers have been paid to look the other way.
0TO0000346	Julie Farkas said a man in Jacobstown can treat Rex.
0TO0000347	About Rex...
0TO0000348	I need to get to Primm. Can you suggest a route?
0TO0000349	I'm trying to track down the people who attacked me. Know anything about them?
0TO0000350	Thanks for digging me out of that grave.
0TO0000351	I'm here for Melody's bear.
0TO0000352	Your howitzer is operational.
0TO0000353	I'd like to fight in the arena.
0TO0000354	You're a doctor?
0TO0000357	Earlier you mentioned another assignment?
0TO0000358	Is that job in Freeside still available?
0TO0000359	I've completed the Pacer job.
0TO0000360	Uh, the King sort of got killed while I was working on that Freeside job.
0TO0000361	I wanted to talk about the situation in Freeside.
0TO0000362	I have an update on the Freeside situation.
0TO0000363	Sergeant Reyes at Camp Forlorn Hope sent me with a security update for your radio.
0TO0000364	Sgt. Reyes sent me - she's curious about the high casualties at this station.
0TO0000367	<Deposit your Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars in the slot.>
0TO0000372	Me buy things.
0TO0000375	Who's Sergeant Dornan?
0TO0000376	What do you know about Joe Cobb?
0TO0000377	What was that you said about Ringo?
0TO0000378	Ten of Spades. Where did you get that name?
0TO0000379	I thought you should know. Cook-cook is dead.
0TO0000380	Have you seen anything suspicious around here?
0TO0000381	Why does Dhatri owe you caps?
0TO0000382	Got any more open bounties?
0TO0000384	Tell me about the Gun Runners.
0TO0000388	So you're a Gun Runner?
0TO0000390	What is your "medicine" and how do you take it off?
0TO0000392	You sell *thoughts?*
0TO0000409	What happened to the Enclave oil rig and Navarro?
0TO0000410	How long have you been a sharpshooter?
0TO0000411	So, you're good at shooting stuff?
0TO0000413	You make it sound like avoiding innocent deaths was uncommon in the Enclave.
0TO0000414	I'd like to know more about your former squad.
0TO0000415	When did you enlist in the military?
0TO0000416	When did you become an army guy?
0TO0000418	McCarran needs a regular shipment of brahmin meat and spices for the mess hall.
0TO0000419	Do you think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype?
0TO0000420	Who's the other human you mentioned?
0TO0000421	I had some questions about Jacobstown.
0TO0000423	2500 caps? I'm doing you a favor by paying you now. I doubt you were expected to survive this.
0TO0000424	2500 caps is too much. Can't we come to a deal on a lower price?
0TO0000425	You were a pilot?
0TO0000426	What do you do in Westside?
0TO0000428	So what did you do before you were retired?
0TO0000429	I know how the Westside farmers have been getting their water.
0TO0000430	I'll destroy the Brotherhood.
0TO0000431	I'd like your services.
0TO0000432	Let's have sex.
0TO0000433	You work for Pretty Sarah?
0TO0000434	You were a prospector - like digging for gold and silver?
0TO0000435	What were you in prison for?
0TO0000436	What happened to Sterling?
0TO0000437	You're a trader?
0TO0000438	What exactly is a Powder Ganger?
0TO0000439	What did you do to end up in here?
0TO0000440	Tell me about the Legate.
0TO0000441	Martina said she sold her information to Captain Curtis in the NCR.
0TO0000443	I killed the Deathclaw Mother and the Deathclaw Alpha Male.
0TO0000444	What do you know about the situation with the Powder Gangers?
0TO0000445	Why are you called Easy Pete?
0TO0000446	Did you ever find anything good while prospecting?
0TO0000447	I'm a little short on caps. I don't suppose there's any work available?
0TO0000448	Do you know the robot that rescued me?
0TO0000449	Who's the big robot thing that saved me?
0TO0000450	Tell me again what you know about the target.
0TO0000451	Have you ever met Caesar?
0TO0000452	Is there anything that you need me to do?
0TO0000453	Tell me more about the arena.
0TO0000454	About the effectiveness of your healing powders...
0TO0000455	Sgt. McCredie asked me to talk to you about getting your squad in shape.
0TO0000456	How's the squad doing?
0TO0000457	I got you the stuff.
0TO0000458	I think you'll find that the Misfits' records are now much improved.
0TO0000459	How's that human niceness working out?
0TO0000460	So, did the shooting range practice take care of things?
0TO0000462	So, did the grenade range practice take care of things?
0TO0000463	So, about those improvements....
0TO0000464	About getting the squad's readiness reports up....
0TO0000465	Going back to those squad improvements, I had an idea.
0TO0000466	I thought about what you said about basic human niceness.
0TO0000467	Who's the merchandise?
0TO0000468	Um... merchandise. What? You lost me.
0TO0000469	I take it you're from Klamath?
0TO0000470	You served in the military?
0TO0000472	Interesting rifle you have there. Lever-action, right?
0TO0000473	How long have you been a bounty hunter?
0TO0000474	Bitter-Root. You have an unusual name.
0TO0000478	What's wrong with the NCR?
0TO0000479	Tell me about the Legion.
0TO0000480	What's so important about Hoover Dam?
0TO0000481	What do you use the Bighorners for?
0TO0000488	What do you do in Novac?
0TO0000489	How long have you lived in Westside?
0TO0000491	I have some questions to ask.
0TO0000492	What happened between you and the Omertas?
0TO0000493	I need to be reminded about a job you wanted me to do.
0TO0000494	I forgot some stuff about the jobs you wanted me to do.
0TO0000495	Is there anything else you need me to do?
0TO0000497	Maybe we can make a deal. What do you want from the Crimson Caravan in exchange for quitting?
0TO0000500	I'd like to know more about Mr. House.
0TO0000501	Anything interesting going on in the rest of the wasteland?
0TO0000502	Tell me about the NCR.
0TO0000503	Tell me about First Recon.
0TO0000504	What did you do to end up here in the first place?
0TO0000506	Got any spare powder and dynamite available?
0TO0000507	How did you all break out?
0TO0000509	The cranial bleeding was too much for a man of his age. A younger man would have lived.
0TO0000510	There was, uh, internal bleeding and lesions and other problems.
0TO0000511	If this is a trap, I'm going to take a lot of you with me.
0TO0000513	Tell me a little about the Great Khans.
0TO0000514	I'd like to exchange Legion money for chips.
0TO0000516	Why do some of the Super Mutants here dislike the NCR?
0TO0000517	I'm wounded.
0TO0000519	I won't destroy the Brotherhood of Steel.
0TO0000520	What are you working on?
0TO0000521	Did you ever salvage containers of radioactive material from REPCONN?
0TO0000522	Got any glowing stuff from REPCONN?
0TO0000523	I killed the Mother Deathclaw.
0TO0000525	I'm surprised to find another human here.
0TO0000526	Tell me about the co-op.
0TO0000527	I have some questions about Westside.
0TO0000530	Are you feeling all right?
0TO0000531	<Give 1 Doctor's Bag> I brought you a Doctor's Bag. I hope it helps.
0TO0000532	I'd like to know more about you.
0TO0000533	Is there anything you can tell me about the Legate?
0TO0000534	Was there something you needed me to do?
0TO0000535	Martina's safe, and the Omerta thugs sent after her are dead.
0TO0000536	I was able to convince the Omerta thugs that crossing the Legion was unwise.
0TO0000537	Martina's dead.
0TO0000543	Have you ever been to New Vegas?
0TO0000545	No, I'm not here for anything like that. Who are you?
0TO0000547	Star Info.
0TO0000549	Does Goodsprings get many visitors?
0TO0000550	Have you always been with the First Recon?
0TO0000551	I've been known to hunt a few bounties, myself.
0TO0000552	Not too friendly, are you?
0TO0000554	I've changed my mind. I want to choose a different bounty.
0TO0000555	Crandon said you might have a problem I could help with. Something delicate.
0TO0000556	What would you like me to do?
0TO0000557	Got any more work for me?
0TO0000558	Anything else you'd like me to do?
0TO0000559	That's some impressive weaponry. Where did it all come from?
0TO0000561	You don't sell that junk behind you?
0TO0000564	This is Powder Ganger territory, and there's a toll. Pay up.
0TO0000589	Are you the Legion's second-in-command?
0TO0000590	(Lie) A messenger?... Why, yes! Of course, Mr. House and I go way, waaaay back.
0TO0000591	(Lie) Of course I act on behalf of Mr. House. Why else would I be here?
0TO0000593	Where are your parents, kid? Are you here all alone?
0TO0000595	Tell me about the Burned Man.
0TO0000596	Any idea what the NCR's up to in Primm?
0TO0000597	Does the NCR have any plans to attack the prison north of here?
0TO0000598	I know the NCR is planning to attack the prison.
0TO0000600	Do you know if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
0TO0000601	Have you heard if the NCR has any plans to attack the prison north of here?
0TO0000605	Do you know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison north of here?
0TO0000606	I still want to know if the NCR is planning to attack the prison.
0TO0000611	Why are you so jittery about Mr. House?
0TO0000612	If Caesar dies, who takes over the Legion?
0TO0000613	Do you remember the message you were told to spread?
0TO0000619	I killed the Deathclaw Alpha Male.
0TO0000620	How did you get burned so badly?
0TO0000621	You're not one of the merchandise?
0TO0000622	Wouldn't you make more money working on the Strip?
0TO0000623	Anything else you can tell me about Great Khans?
0TO0000624	What are the rules of Caravan?
0TO0000625	Let's play a hand of Caravan.
0TO0000626	Does the NCR usually offer bounties on people?
0TO0000627	What can you tell me about this place?
0TO0000628	If you're free, why are you sticking around?
0TO0000630	What "lessons" did you teach here?
0TO0000633	What's wrong with the Nightkin?
0TO0000634	What can you tell me about REPCONN?
0TO0000637	You're the guy who won the lottery.
0TO0000638	If you're looking for work as a singer, Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring.
0TO0000639	What's your story, stranger?
0TO0000640	I wanted to talk to you about the Boomers.
0TO0000641	I'm looking to make a few extra caps. Got any jobs you need done?
0TO0000642	Do you know anything about Victor?
0TO0000643	Let's talk about the areas around Goodsprings.
0TO0000644	How long have you been stationed here?
0TO0000645	What are you going to do now?
0TO0000646	How long have you been with the First Recon?
0TO0000647	You mentioned your husband works for the caravans?
0TO0000650	I'll try to find your friend.
0TO0000656	I did find her, unfortunately.
0TO0000690	Neil told me about this town.
0TO0000693	I'd like to turn in my chips.
0TO0000695	Are there any town rules I need to know about?
0TO0000696	One of my limbs is crippled.
0TO0000698	What do you know about the Great Khans?
0TO0000699	I thought NCR Rangers were supposed to be tough and fearless.
0TO0000700	Did you fly for the NCR?
0TO0000701	You're a scientist?
0TO0000703	Why do you stay here?
0TO0000704	I did all I could to save him.
0TO0000705	Do you have a problem with women?
0TO0000706	How did you find me here?
0TO0000707	Tell me about Caesar's Legion.
0TO0000708	What do you know about HELIOS One?
0TO0000710	Where'd the Deathclaws come from?
0TO0000712	I've paid for your freedom. You're free to go.
0TO0000715	<Give 2 Doctor's Bags> I brought you these Doctor's Bags. I hope they help.
0TO0000716	I have some questions about this area.
0TO0000717	Do you have a problem with the NCR?
0TO0000718	Aren't you that singer from New Reno? I think I saw you play the clubs there.
0TO0000719	What sort of lottery did you win?
0TO0000721	Silly Ol' Advisory.
0TO0000724	How did you get inside there?
0TO0000725	Why did you quit the trade?
0TO0000726	Your father is your commanding officer? Is that allowed?
0TO0000729	So where can I buy some weapons?
0TO0000734	I'll pay 100 caps to hear your thoughts.
0TO0000735	Here's another 100 caps. I want to hear your thoughts again.
0TO0000736	Sounds interesting... I don't have 100 caps, though.
0TO0000738	Any more thoughts I can pay you for?
0TO0000744	Tell me about Primm.
0TO0000748	You don't have any offers for the rockets. You'd be lucky to get money at all.
0TO0000749	I went to the ranger station. Everyone there was wiped out.
0TO0000750	I found out who killed the Rangers at Station Charlie.
0TO0000762	I'm suffering from radiation poisoning.
0TO0000763	You were at Bitter Springs, I'm told.
0TO0000764	What can you tell me about the Legate?
0TO0000766	Why do they call you Old Lady Gibson?
0TO0000767	Does anyone other than Super Mutants come up this way?
0TO0000770	Do you know anything about a weapon that's gone missing?
0TO0000771	Where can I find some work around here?
0TO0000780	Can you cure my addiction?
0TO0000781	What can you tell me about the Great Khans?
0TO0000790	I have some questions about your robot.
0TO0000792	Why are the Nightkin here in Jacobstown?
0TO0000793	Have you been in Westside long?
0TO0000794	Can you answer some questions for me?
0TO0000795	You have an interesting name.
0TO0000796	Do you sell anything here?
0TO0000798	I heard you're Bitter-Root's father.
0TO0000799	What can you tell me about New Vegas?
0TO0000800	I've noticed that you don't carry a gun.
0TO0000801	Can you teach me the Praetorian unarmed technique?
0TO0000802	Can you teach me how to fight like the Pray-whatever?
0TO0000803	<Lie> I did all I could to save him.
0TO0000804	What do you know about the Burned Man?
0TO0000806	You think you can take on Powder Gangers by yourself?
0TO0000808	Your crimes are unforgivable.
0TO0000810	<Give 3 Doctor's Bags> I brought you these Doctor's Bags. I hope they help.
0TO0000812	What are you doing out here?
0TO0000813	That's a mighty fine guitar you got there.
0TO0000814	Anything unusual happening around here?
0TO0000817	Pleased to meetcha.
0TO0000819	Need a hand with any trouble?
0TO0000820	I was sent here by Colonel Hsu.
0TO0000821	<Lie> Colonel Hsu sent me here to find you.
0TO0000822	Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff.
0TO0000823	<Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff.>
0TO0000824	<Try to reprogram Primm Slim to act as Sheriff of Primm.>
0TO0000826	I don't like your attitude.
0TO0000828	I might be interested in buying your "headache medicine." How much?
0TO0000834	How can I bring rule of law back to Primm?
0TO0000835	Your deputy died in Bison Steve.
0TO0000836	What can I do to help Primm?
0TO0000837	How can I help bring rule of law back to Primm?
0TO0000838	How can I bring back rule of law to Primm?
0TO0000840	Do Rangers normally walk up and announce themselves? I don't think so.
0TO0000841	Cracked that safe for you.
0TO0000842	I'll see what I can do about the safe.
0TO0000843	You shouldn't have any more problems with the generator.
0TO0000853	I found an entire container of the igniting agent.
0TO0000860	I'll see what I can do to help you out.
0TO0000862	Tell me more about REPCONN.
0TO0000865	I found the thrust control modules.
0TO0000870	I'd like to see what you've got for sale.
0TO0000901	The "demons" are gone.
0TO0000902	I haven't dealt with the "demons" yet.
0TO0000904	I'm here because feral ghouls have been wandering into Novac.
0TO0000909	Your last name is "Bright?" That's funny.
0TO0000911	What's the "Great Journey"?
0TO0000912	How will you make the "Journey?"
0TO0000913	Are you seriously going to make your "Great Journey" on those rockets?
0TO0000914	Are these surface-to-surface rockets? Or will they launch you into orbit?
0TO0000915	Those rockets will convey you and your flock straight into the ground!
0TO0000918	Tell me about North Vegas.
0TO0000920	I'll try to remember that.
0TO0000921	Are you following me?
0TO0000922	Are you threatening me?
0TO0000923	'We'? Who is 'we'?
0TO0000924	What is there to do here?
0TO0000925	What was that about salvage and traps?
0TO0000927	Some folks in Novac want you dead, and will pay to have it done.
0TO0000928	Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff using parts.
0TO0000929	<Reprogram Primm Slim to serve as Primm's Sheriff using 3 fission batteries and 4 conductors.>
0TO0000931	Do you know anything about Hoover Dam?
0TO0000932	The ghouls are no longer at REPCONN.
0TO0000933	I'm looking for Cass. The Van Graffs told me to check in with you.
0TO0000934	Tell me about the clinic.
0TO0000935	Tell me about the Rangers.
0TO0000936	I'd like to know more about the NCR Rangers.
0TO0000937	I'd like to know more about the Rangers.
0TO0000938	Can I ask you some questions?
0TO0000939	What'll happen at the Fort?
0TO0000940	What's been going on in the rest of the wasteland?
0TO0000941	What do you know about the Legion?
0TO0000943	I need a doctor.
0TO0000944	I had some general questions for you.
0TO0000945	I thought Benny ran this place.
0TO0000946	I'm ready for you to join me at the Lucky 38.
0TO0000947	You won't live to collect that bounty.
0TO0000948	Let me help find your son.
0TO0000949	Spare parts, assembly tools, generators. Mr. House won't buy your excuse.
0TO0000950	Your failure would not amuse Mr. House. Unless I be persuaded otherwise.
0TO0000953	So what are you doing sticking around here?
0TO0000954	No, but it's worth 50 caps.
0TO0000955	I could see giving you 50 caps, maybe.
0TO0000956	No way I'd pay more than 20 caps to know more.
0TO0000958	If the NCR won't deal with those prisoners, I'll have to risk doing it myself.
0TO0000959	I only ask politely the first time, old man. Now tell me.
0TO0000960	Um, tell me free or... I mean, can't you just tell me? Please?
0TO0000961	I'm pretty sure that an actual spy would be more... discreet.
0TO0000968	Tell me what you know about the attacks.
0TO0000969	What can you tell me about the attacks on your ranch?
0TO0000971	Did you have anything to do with Boone's wife's disappearance?
0TO0000972	Who would want to hurt Boone's wife?
0TO0000976	Would you feel better if I checked on your NCR friends for you?
0TO0000977	What do you do here, Andy?
0TO0000978	What can you tell me about Boone's wife?
0TO0000980	What's wrong with Boone?
0TO0000989	<Follow Protocol::Reinitiate>
0TO0001005	A station full of Rangers ought to be able to handle themselves.
0TO0001008	What is this Far Beyond?
0TO0001013	Hey, you're not a ghoul!
0TO0001014	Smoothskin? Your skin looks pretty smooth to me.
0TO0001016	What's the deal with the human who let me in?
0TO0001017	Let's talk about Chris.
0TO0001018	So you're going to leave Chris behind?
0TO0001022	I'm looking for someone.
0TO0001023	I'm investigating someone else. A man. And he just recently went missing.
0TO0001026	Who is Jason?
0TO0001044	Send power to the Fort.
0TO0001045	I want this dam out of operation.
0TO0001046	Is this because I didn't upgrade that army of Securitrons under Caesar's Fort?
0TO0001058	I thought you were dead.
0TO0001059	Guess I owe you an apology for wrecking you the last time we talked.
0TO0001060	I can keep killing you, if that's what you want.
0TO0001063	I've helped out around here, sending troops to Primm will fortify the NCR in the region.
0TO0001064	Earlier you said something about asking the Followers to provide medical aid?
0TO0001065	Astor says there's a Ranger Station up north.
0TO0001067	You wanted to ask me something before, when we left Ranger Andy's.
0TO0001069	You seemed like you wanted to say something about Loyal.
0TO0001071	You wanted to say something about Corporal Sterling before?
0TO0001072	Any other work?
0TO0001073	I already took care of Jackson. Er, the Jackson problem.
0TO0001074	He's... gone, don't think he can help. Anything else?
0TO0001075	I took care of Jackson. Er, the Jackson problem.
0TO0001076	Fine, let's deal with this the old-fashioned way.
0TO0001077	Uh... Jackson? He can't help us, he's... gone.
0TO0001078	I don't think Jackson can help us with the Caravan evidence.
0TO0001083	What's going on in Primm?
0TO0001084	I can take care of myself.
0TO0001086	Shouldn't you be protecting the town or something?
0TO0001087	Why can't you protect them?
0TO0001088	Where did it come from?
0TO0001089	What is wrong with it?
0TO0001090	Do you mind if I try to fix it?
0TO0001091	I have some questions about ED-E.
0TO0001093	Did you ever hear it say anything odd?
0TO0001094	Any idea what I should do with it?
0TO0001097	So... maize, 2 mutfruits, yeast, and a... uh... fission battery? Next time, maybe.
0TO0001099	The President's visit was cancelled. I never got the opportunity to attack him.
0TO0001101	Forget the Omertas. They're more trouble than they're worth.
0TO0001102	I've killed the White Glove Society's leaders. They're no longer a factor.
0TO0001106	I spoke to Mortimer. I say leave the White Glove Society alone.
0TO0001107	I spoke to Marjorie. I say leave the White Glove Society alone.
0TO0001110	I'm honored.
0TO0001113	Moreno was a lost cause, but at least the others made it.
0TO0001118	Is the Enclave's treatment by the Brotherhood influencing your opinion?
0TO0001119	Why not the Brotherhood?
0TO0001121	Don't worry. I agree.
0TO0001124	Could we go lower than 300 caps?
0TO0001208	You're assuming a motive without evidence. Please be rational.
0TO0001209	It's cleaner this way, without bringing NCR in. No connecting Anderson back to the locals.
0TO0001210	It was either this or spend the rest of his life in an NCR chain gang.
0TO0001211	Allowing Anderson to get away with murder tells him and everyone else that it's permissable.
0TO0001212	What will you do if Caesar wins?
0TO0001213	You can do better than that.
0TO0001214	Arcade, I'm asking you because I'm interested. Don't put yourself down.
0TO0001215	Why don't you like talking about yourself?
0TO0001216	I'll say.
0TO0001219	Of course.
0TO0001220	Why not to the whole area equally?
0TO0001221	Noted.
0TO0001222	Redundancy. If Caesar takes the dam and cuts off power, it will be chaos all over New Vegas.
0TO0001223	You can always use more power, right?
0TO0001224	Er...
0TO0001225	Oh, uh... whoops, I thought that was to turn it off.
0TO0001226	I'm thinking I'm going to get a sweet Pre-War laser. What are you thinking?
0TO0001227	Time for the NCR to roast.
0TO0001228	If you're so sure it's going to be a bloodbath, maybe you should stay in Freeside.
0TO0001229	What happens in Freeside won't make any difference if the Legion takes the dam. Fight with them.
0TO0001230	You were born at Navarro, but you are your own man. They have their fight, and you have yours.
0TO0001231	Well you... you're different.
0TO0001232	You aren't like the others, Arcade. You're still young. It's up to you to decide who you want to be.
0TO0001233	That was just talk. It's not the same for you.
0TO0001234	You're right. They'll need every ally they can get at the dam.
0TO0001235	You're right. Freeside needs doctors. It needs you.
0TO0001236	Who, Caesar?
0TO0001237	He seemed pretty smart to me.
0TO0001238	He's a madman. What did you expect?
0TO0001239	I don't think either of us can fully understand what he and the tribes have gone through.
0TO0001242	< Keep holdout weapons > Sure, I agree to disarm.
0TO0001243	<Give Kenny the key from Canyon Runner>
0TO0001245	<Give Sammy the key from Canyon Runner>
0TO0001249	Hey, I'm doing all of the work here.  50/50 and I'm game.
0TO0001250	Twenty-five percent?!  Fifty-fifty, or I walk.
0TO0001253	This kind of work costs time and money.  50/50 would cover my expenses.
0TO0001254	Are you crazy?!  I'll be walking all over the place looking for these people.
0TO0001255	Now that you're free to leave you don't need your dog tag anymore do you?
0TO0001259	Seems like you pop up everywhere, Victor.
0TO0001261	The password is "And to dare to do it."
0TO0001262	The password is "The better part of valor."
0TO0001268	Here you go.
0TO0001269	Never mind. I'm staying a bit longer.
0TO0001270	Here's the chip.
0TO0001271	Never mind. I'm staying here.
0TO0001272	Let's go back to Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0001274	The pay is good, and you can make your own hours.
0TO0001275	Yes, I need more time to prepare.
0TO0001278	<Keep holdout weapons> Here you go.
0TO0001280	Yes. Return what you took from me.
0TO0001281	Not yet.
0TO0001282	I thought you were destroyed.
0TO0001284	The penthouse.
0TO0001285	The High-Roller Suite.
0TO0001286	The Cocktail Lounge.
0TO0001287	The casino floor.
0TO0001288	The basement.
0TO0001300	I have the terms of your surrender here for you.
0TO0001301	Singing isn't necessary, but I do have a paper for you to sign.
0TO0001302	<Attack> If you won't surrender, then you'll die.
0TO0001303	The terms are fair, refusing them would not be in your best interest.
0TO0001304	I'll keep that in mind.
0TO0001305	Out of my way, Lucius.
0TO0001306	No trick, and I'm only trying to help.
0TO0001307	I've brought something to fix the Auto-Doc.
0TO0001308	I have what's needed to do the surgery.
0TO0001309	Got tools so I can fix his brain.
0TO0001310	A man who can cure Caesar, Arcade Gannon, waits outside. He's all yours.
0TO0001311	No, I haven't.
0TO0001312	I'm still working on that, actually.
0TO0001314	How can I help you with your plan?
0TO0001315	Heck Gunderson is dead. You won't have to worry about him any more.
0TO0001316	Do you know where she is?
0TO0001317	Do you know who he was? Where he went?
0TO0001318	I thought Mr. House already agreed to hand over New Vegas to the NCR.
0TO0001319	You don't have to worry about House. I already killed him.
0TO0001320	You don't have to worry about House. I disconnected him from his system.
0TO0001321	I can handle the dogs. Where do I need to go?
0TO0001322	All right, got it.
0TO0001323	Lot of soldiers around - where's First Recon?
0TO0001324	Got it.
0TO0001325	Sounds like fun. I'll get on it.
0TO0001326	What else can you tell me about Little Buster?
0TO0001329	He's all yours.
0TO0001330	On second thought, hold off.
0TO0001338	Don't be too hard on him. It's part of who he is.
0TO0001339	A man should know when to let go.
0TO0001340	It was an important part of her life. Why shouldn't she enjoy it?
0TO0001341	Some people can't stop reliving their glory days.
0TO0001342	I'm sure your father would be proud of you.
0TO0001343	Why worry about it? You don't have to be your father.
0TO0001344	His work was what mattered to him.
0TO0001345	It seems pointless to do all of that without a goal.
0TO0001346	They're loyal to you, too.
0TO0001347	That's their story Arcade, not yours.
0TO0001348	You've certainly done your part.
0TO0001350	What is that machine in your tent?
0TO0001354	You were saying?
0TO0001357	Is this the first time you've experienced sudden onset headaches?
0TO0001358	Does your head hurt?
0TO0001362	Sorry, I'll let you sleep.
0TO0001364	You're limping when you walk. How long has that been going on?
0TO0001365	You don't look so good.
0TO0001366	What were you saying about the White Glove Society?
0TO0001367	The last time we met, your head seemed ready to explode.
0TO0001368	What about the White Glove Society?
0TO0001369	Yes, you said I should forge an alliance between the White Gloves and your Legion.
0TO0001371	I'm concerned your headaches might be symptoms of a more serious condition.
0TO0001372	Do you get headaches a lot?
0TO0001373	Are you okay?
0TO0001374	Hello! We were talking?
0TO0001376	You just experienced an Absence Seizure. Was this the first time?
0TO0001377	What were you daydreaming about?
0TO0001378	You just blanked out for several seconds.
0TO0001379	Where do I find the Brotherhood? How do I destroy them?
0TO0001381	I'm concerned you may have a serious neurological condition.
0TO0001382	I think we should talk about your health.
0TO0001383	Seriously, let's talk about your health.
0TO0001384	What about the Auto-Doc in your tent?
0TO0001386	I'm afraid your symptoms are consistent with a brain lesion, most likely a tumor.
0TO0001387	I don't know. Sounds serious, though.
0TO0001389	Straight-forward case of intra-cranial blastoma fibrolosis, I wager.
0TO0001390	Sounds like a moderately severe case of Skullatosis.
0TO0001392	I can perform the surgery, but I'll need proper tools and supplies from a Doctor's Bag.
0TO0001393	Even with proper Surgical Tools, an operation of this sort might be beyond me.
0TO0001395	It's a simple procedure... as brain surgeries go.
0TO0001396	I'll need a vise... or a large nutcracker...
0TO0001397	One of my companions, Arcade, has medical expertise. You could take him as a slave.
0TO0001398	He's standing right outside your tent.
0TO0001399	I'll bring him to you.
0TO0001400	Where would I find a diagnostic scanning module?
0TO0001401	I'll leave at once.
0TO0001402	There may be another solution.
0TO0001403	I'll see what I can find out.
0TO0001404	What do you have for trade?
0TO0001405	I was hoping to pass the time with a game or two.
0TO0001406	Up for some more Caravan?
0TO0001407	Anything you can tell me about the Outpost?
0TO0001408	Any work around here?
0TO0001409	Never mind, I'll be going now.
0TO0001411	Uh, citizen, I guess.
0TO0001412	[NCR] NCR Soldier.
0TO0001414	[Confirmed Bachelor] You didn't tell me your name.
0TO0001416	Something wrong with asking your name?
0TO0001417	Didn't realize NCR was so spineless.
0TO0001418	Forget it, then, you're a waste of time.
0TO0001419	So is that a "no," you don't want to be friends, or...
0TO0001420	Scared of something?
0TO0001421	I could use some help with my gear.
0TO0001428	I'd like to see your wares.
0TO0001430	I just killed everyone the old-fashioned way.
0TO0001431	I killed everyone in the camp.
0TO0001432	I'll do as you ask.
0TO0001433	What exactly happened here?
0TO0001434	You captured everyone?
0TO0001436	You slaughtered innocent civilians?
0TO0001437	Sounds like they got what was coming to them.
0TO0001438	I admire the purity of the Legion's justice.
0TO0001439	How can I serve the Legion?
0TO0001440	Your "civilization" sounds like a pack of snarling dogs.
0TO0001441	Tell me about Caesar.
0TO0001442	Who is this Legatus you mention?
0TO0001461	Good thing there are still people like you around.
0TO0001462	I'm sure he means well.
0TO0001463	But in the end, doesn't it all just come down to numbers anyway?
0TO0001464	I thought you were interested in preserving life.
0TO0001465	The world needs Caesar more than it needs you.
0TO0001466	Enjoying your stay?
0TO0001467	With how messed up New Vegas is, do you really think Caesar has nothing to offer?
0TO0001468	I'm just trying to be open-minded.
0TO0001469	Yes, that's exactly what I'm suggesting.
0TO0001470	NCR is broken beyond repair. Its time has come.
0TO0001471	The Legion is better than the alternative.
0TO0001472	Actually, yes, I would like to see New Vegas turned into a slavery hub.
0TO0001473	More than collateral damage. A necessary sacrifice.
0TO0001474	That's a good way to put it.
0TO0001475	They hide behind NCR's protection and they deserve everything coming to them.
0TO0001476	Sorry. I just lose my head sometimes.
0TO0001478	If you have a problem with me, why don't you just leave right now?
0TO0001479	Why?
0TO0001480	Fine. Get lost.
0TO0001481	It will be an honor to fight for the Legion.
0TO0001482	I must prepare myself before I go.
0TO0001483	What do you think of the lockdown?
0TO0001484	Why do you dislike McNamara so much?
0TO0001485	What would you do if you became Elder?
0TO0001486	Tell me about the lockdown.
0TO0001487	How do you get supplies?
0TO0001489	What is with that crazy sandstorm on the surface?
0TO0001490	Tell me about what happened at HELIOS.
0TO0001491	Did you know Hardin is trying to find a way to become Elder?
0TO0001493	The NCR is currently looking to destroy you.
0TO0001498	Tell me about the battle at HELIOS.
0TO0001499	Tell me about your last Elder.
0TO0001508	What are those statues of?
0TO0001510	I'll be going now.
0TO0001512	I want to join the Brotherhood.
0TO0001513	Can I still join the Brotherhood?
0TO0001514	Yes, what is the task?
0TO0001515	That depends on the task.
0TO0001516	On second thought, I'm not really interested in joining the Brotherhood at the moment.
0TO0001517	I installed the device up at Black Mountain, as instructed.
0TO0001518	I already know how to use power armor.
0TO0001520	Don't I just put it on?
0TO0001522	Rockets and energy weapons? That's an odd combination.
0TO0001523	How do you know so much about this, again?
0TO0001524	What kind of prototype were they making?
0TO0001526	Is there anything else for me to do?
0TO0001527	About my reward...
0TO0001530	I wanted to ask about joining the Brotherhood again.
0TO0001532	Tell me what the task is before I agree to anything.
0TO0001533	On second thought, I'm fine not joining the Brotherhood.
0TO0001534	I've taken care of the Van Graffs.
0TO0001535	I'm looking for an antique rangefinder somebody might've sold you.
0TO0001538	Would you like to come with me? I could use someone skilled in medicine.
0TO0001539	Sounds reasonable.
0TO0001540	Hmm, on second thought...
0TO0001541	What kinds of illnesses are you trying to deal with?
0TO0001543	You're right. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0001544	Good point. Goodbye.
0TO0001545	Would you reconsider my offer to travel with me? I could really use your help.
0TO0001546	They profit from crime, now I profit, too.
0TO0001548	I need you to leave.
0TO0001549	What's your problem with ED-E?
0TO0001550	Ooooo-kay.
0TO0001551	What's an eee-em-pee?
0TO0001552	That sounds a little paranoid, Arcade.
0TO0001553	I'll keep an eye on it.
0TO0001554	Do you always deflect personal questions?
0TO0001555	How did you join the Followers?
0TO0001556	Where did you get your medical training?
0TO0001557	If you don't like it, leave.
0TO0001558	Sure.
0TO0001559	Not right now, Arcade.
0TO0001560	What are you talking about?
0TO0001561	Arcade, I'm not interested.
0TO0001562	All right, let me hear it.
0TO0001563	I'm sure. I'm not interested.
0TO0001564	Where did the Enclave go?
0TO0001565	What happened to Navarro?
0TO0001566	Where are you going with all this?
0TO0001567	Do you want them to help NCR?
0TO0001568	Say no more. I'll do it.
0TO0001569	I'm not interested.
0TO0001570	Never mind. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0001571	Actually, I already know how to use power armor.
0TO0001572	I'd appreciate a lesson.
0TO0001573	It's just like other armor, but heavy, right?
0TO0001574	So no one knows you're here?
0TO0001575	There's a Brotherhood of Steel base inside one of the bunkers here!
0TO0001576	What are Powder Gangers?
0TO0001577	You might want to know that I fixed your radio earlier.
0TO0001578	I did what I could, but the capacitor needs to be replaced.
0TO0001579	I found one of your patrols out in the waste. Your men are dead.
0TO0001580	Actually, I'd rather just be going. If I could just have my belongings back...
0TO0001581	No, what I told your man before was the truth. I don't like repeating myself.
0TO0001582	It was a complete accident, I swear.
0TO0001584	What's the New California Republic?
0TO0001585	Can you tell me more about the NCR?
0TO0001586	What's the Legion?
0TO0001587	Why is the NCR interested in this desert?
0TO0001588	I'm going after a man named Benny for revenge and I need someone to keep me patched up.
0TO0001589	The NCR needs help against the Legion before Caesar moves on the dam. We could use your skills.
0TO0001590	I'm trying to help Mr. House keep New Vegas independent.
0TO0001591	If New Vegas can remain independent, I'm going to find a way to do it. I could use your help.
0TO0001592	The NCR oppression around here would disappear if the Legion took control. I could use your help.
0TO0001593	Things are bad around here. I'd like to make a difference, and I'd like you to help me.
0TO0001594	This place is really complicated and stuff. You're smart. Can you help me do... things?
0TO0001595	Yeah, I guess. So are you coming with me or what?
0TO0001596	Ugh. Well if you're going to be like that then never mind.
0TO0001597	Uh... it beats sitting around here all day, doesn't it?
0TO0001599	Oh, well... in that case, never mind.
0TO0001600	Of course. I'm not interested in helping the Legion.
0TO0001601	Well, uh... on second thought...
0TO0001602	I need a good-looking doctor to help take care of me in the big, bad wasteland.
0TO0001603	What kind of prototypes?
0TO0001604	An odd combination.
0TO0001605	What was Project SEMELE?
0TO0001606	Do you need any help?
0TO0001607	What kind of research do you do?
0TO0001609	Right. "The Followers don't endorse his actions," and all that.
0TO0001610	If you say so. I'm not arguing.
0TO0001611	Let's keep moving.
0TO0001612	I'm sorry. I didn't realize it would end like this.
0TO0001613	What's done is done.
0TO0001614	Anderson killed White. He deserved to pay for what he did.
0TO0001615	When was that?
0TO0001616	What do you know about them?
0TO0001617	The Elder has me looking for the lost patrols and retrieving their mission discs.
0TO0001618	The Elder tasked me with contacting several scouts out in the waste.
0TO0001619	The Elder has me looking for parts to fix the bunker's air filtration system.
0TO0001620	I wanted to ask you some other questions.
0TO0001621	I found the patrols for the Elder, and they had mission discs with orders from McNamara on them.
0TO0001622	Do you know anything about the Chain That Binds?
0TO0001623	One of the few times an Elder was dismissed was due to it.
0TO0001624	Did you know there's a second part to it?
0TO0001625	It says a superior is not allowed to give orders to the men under his subordinate.
0TO0001626	The Elder wants me to retrieve components to help fix the air filtration system.
0TO0001627	Er, what?
0TO0001628	Maybe you misheard me.
0TO0001629	Just give the details.
0TO0001630	They're all right here.
0TO0001631	Not all of them.
0TO0001632	No, I haven't found any of them yet.
0TO0001633	I wanted to ask you some questions.
0TO0001635	The Brotherhood of Steel has a base inside one of the bunkers here. They sent me after you.
0TO0001636	How about this explosive collar around my neck?
0TO0001638	I was just trying to fix it.
0TO0001639	[Lie] I just fixed it.
0TO0001641	Nothing, I swear.
0TO0001642	Actually, I rigged your radio with a bomb.
0TO0001643	This seems like a bad location for a safehouse.
0TO0001645	<Lie> Powder gangers use these bunkers as hideouts once or twice a month.
0TO0001646	Well, criminals come through here. And the storms, they're bad. Right?
0TO0001647	Not sure. Just feels bad.
0TO0001648	You have to get out of here.
0TO0001649	No, not really.
0TO0001650	Hey, I fixed your radio.
0TO0001651	How do I get access to more topics in the datastore?
0TO0001652	I convinced him that staying here was more dangerous than moving on.
0TO0001653	He was going to leave if he couldn't get his radio working. So I destroyed it.
0TO0001654	Just tell me what you want me to do.
0TO0001655	Go on.
0TO0001656	One of the datastore entries mentioned the Chain That Binds. What is that, exactly?
0TO0001659	What are they doing?
0TO0001667	Ted's been kidnapped. He's here in the hotel.
0TO0001668	Ted's dead.
0TO0001669	What about Primm Slim? Could he be sheriff?
0TO0001670	Do you think Primm Slim could be sheriff?
0TO0001671	Can I buy out the rest of his contract for 300 caps?
0TO0001672	Apology accepted.
0TO0001673	Happy you're sorry. What do I need to do next?
0TO0001674	Let's move on, then.
0TO0001675	You need me more than I need you - don't forget that.
0TO0001678	I'm not actually armed.
0TO0001681	Who is that?
0TO0001682	Friend of yours?
0TO0001683	Ooh, look. A body. I really should be going.
0TO0001685	You still haven't said where these guys were going.
0TO0001688	You said before you had something taken from you.
0TO0001689	I saw your old vault on the Strip. Vault 21, right? Mr. House filled it with concrete?
0TO0001690	Is that when you settled out here with your wife?
0TO0001692	Sounds good, kill her.
0TO0001693	I'm not with her, so watch the spread.
0TO0001694	You shoot, you'll regret it.
0TO0001695	[Terrifying Presence] Raise that gun, and I'll kill everyone in here.
0TO0001696	Cass is dead.
0TO0001697	Cass? She's in the Mojave Outpost.
0TO0001698	I doubt Cass will listen to anything I have to say.
0TO0001700	Is it because the Van Graffs attacked her caravan?
0TO0001701	Why don't you do it?
0TO0001702	Anything you can say to her, you can say to me.
0TO0001703	What did you want to talk to her about?
0TO0001704	If I run across her, I'll let her know.
0TO0001705	These contract papers, for one.
0TO0001706	Found out from investigating the wreckage.
0TO0001707	Nowhere.
0TO0001708	I'm not doing this for you.
0TO0001709	Forget it, I'll bring her here.
0TO0001710	Can you tell me anything more?
0TO0001711	Give me a name, and I'll take care of it.
0TO0001713	Earlier, it seemed like you knew Tabitha. What's the story there?
0TO0001714	Can you tell me about the people who passed through town now?
0TO0001715	I hear you may have information on some Khans that came through here with a guy in a checkered suit.
0TO0001717	Can you tell me about the man in the checkered suit who came through here?
0TO0001718	Can you tell me where the man in the checkered suit went again?
0TO0001720	You can tell me or you can rot in here.
0TO0001721	I'll free you... right after you tell me...
0TO0001765	What kind of research?
0TO0001766	Why do you do research instead of providing medical assistance?
0TO0001767	You don't sound too enthusiastic about it.
0TO0001768	What's the goal?
0TO0001769	What kinds of illnesses and injuries?
0TO0001770	Isn't that the language that Caesar's Legion speaks?
0TO0001771	Nihi-what?
0TO0001772	Where did you learn that?
0TO0001773	Do you know much about Caesar?
0TO0001775	Do the Followers use a lot of energy weapons?
0TO0001776	Memories of what?
0TO0001778	I just want to hear Caesar out.
0TO0001779	Let's just listen to him, figure out what he's up to, and get out.
0TO0001780	Once we get close to Caesar, we can strike.
0TO0001781	I'm not going to let Benny get away.
0TO0001782	I'd like to rent a room.
0TO0001783	Here's 100 caps.
0TO0001784	I can't afford 100 caps right now.
0TO0001786	I'm sure I can get help with supply shortages.
0TO0001787	You would establish a foothold in the region and be one step closer to rebuilding the Mojave.
0TO0001789	What happens if I hang around one of your camps?
0TO0001792	Why did Mr. House want Kimball kept alive?
0TO0001793	I'm on good terms with the NCR. They'll let me help protect him.
0TO0001794	I might be able to convince the NCR to let me help out.
0TO0001795	The NCR hates me. They won't let me within 1000 feet of Kimball.
0TO0001796	I don't care what happens to Kimball.
0TO0001797	Okay, I'll get it done.
0TO0001798	What will the override module let you do?
0TO0001800	Er... join the White Glove Society. They're cannibals, but that's probably a step up for you.
0TO0001801	Maybe my weak and flimsy hands can massage that out for you.<Apply Sleeper Hold>
0TO0001802	Maybe beating your head on a rock will fix it.
0TO0001803	Did you know there's a nerve on your neck that helps you sleep? It's... uh... I know it's here...
0TO0001804	Look out, behind you! <Pistol Whip Carlyle>
0TO0001805	Anything you can do to help me?
0TO0001806	How do I get in?
0TO0001807	How is your new cuisine faring?
0TO0001808	What's next, now that the White Glove Society has tasted human flesh again?
0TO0001809	Will you serve human flesh at the Gourmand?
0TO0001817	I'll have to think on this more.
0TO0001818	What would you like it for?
0TO0001819	What are you going to do with it?
0TO0001820	Ok, you can take it for a little while.
0TO0001821	Why don't you want the Brotherhood to have it?
0TO0001822	What is the final phase of the plan?
0TO0001823	I have a few things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
0TO0001824	All right, I'll go talk to the Followers.
0TO0001825	I've already made arrangements with the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
0TO0001826	Forget the Followers. I'm ready to fight at the dam.
0TO0001827	I have some things to take care of before the battle at Hoover Dam.
0TO0001828	What sort of options?
0TO0001829	Just tell me what to do.
0TO0001831	The dam is too valuable to destroy!
0TO0001832	Fine, just tell me how.
0TO0001833	You want me to destroy Hoover Dam?
0TO0001834	What do I do?
0TO0001837	<Upgrade Status::Verification>
0TO0001838	What? Why?
0TO0001839	Fine. Glad you could make me rich.
0TO0001840	All right, I'm going.
0TO0001841	Could I buy some spare munitions?
0TO0001844	<Keep holdout weapons> Sure, here you go.
0TO0001845	Why do you need my guns?
0TO0001846	Could I trouble you to blow it out your ass?
0TO0001847	[Attack] Looks like I'll have to kill you, then.
0TO0001848	Where did you take my weapons?
0TO0001849	I'd like to buy some food.
0TO0001851	Why don't you take your medicine?
0TO0001852	It's too dangerous for you to miss doses. From now on I want you to take your medicine every time.
0TO0001853	You should keep taking your meds every other time. It's worth the risk to remember your family.
0TO0001854	That medicine isn't doing you any good. I want you to stop taking it altogether.
0TO0001855	Never mind, we'll talk about it later.
0TO0001856	I'm sure. I'd rather you didn't have any psychotic breaks, even if it means you aren't as strong.
0TO0001857	On second thought....
0TO0001858	That's good. Do that.
0TO0001859	I'll risk you having more psychotic breaks if it means you're more dangerous in combat.
0TO0001861	A "personal matter," eh? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
0TO0001862	So tell me about this dame.
0TO0001863	Can I get a code to use the VR pods in the mess hall?
0TO0001864	Okay, I was just curious.
0TO0001866	I'm genuinely interested in your people's history. What are the pods for?
0TO0001868	How exactly do you plan to get the plane back here?
0TO0001869	Glad to have helped.
0TO0001871	Are you planning to use diversionary tactics to draw their attention?
0TO0001872	But won't that attract the attention of the NCR?
0TO0001873	Okay, well I'm glad to have helped.
0TO0001874	I have more to turn in.
0TO0001876	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat. Have you seen anyone like that?
0TO0001877	What was that recording you were listening to?
0TO0001878	Why is it hard to remember them?
0TO0001880	And I suppose you'd nominate yourself?
0TO0001882	What do I get out of helping you?
0TO0001883	I'm Elder McNamara's representative. He said to ask if the bears are still hunting.
0TO0001884	He said to tell you that the Chain That Binds bids you to speak.
0TO0001885	I'm just wondering what you're doing here.
0TO0001886	Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. I'll just be going.
0TO0001887	Elder McNamara sent me as his representative. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
0TO0001888	What are you doing way up here?
0TO0001889	Don't mind me. Just passing through.
0TO0001890	Elder McNamara sent me for your report. He asks if the bears are still hunting.
0TO0001892	Guess I'll be going then.
0TO0001893	Why should I help you?
0TO0001894	Surely you have people better suited to look for them than me.
0TO0001895	I was hoping to speak to you about other matters.
0TO0001896	No, I had some questions for you.
0TO0001897	I wanted to ask you a few questions.
0TO0001898	What's article 49?
0TO0001899	What have I done?
0TO0001900	Take 200 caps, and leave me be.
0TO0001901	I don't have 200 caps.
0TO0001902	[Attack] You've just screwed up, big time.
0TO0001904	[Attack] I'll give you something nice to talk about.
0TO0001905	Fine, take 400.
0TO0001906	[Attack] You just crossed the line.
0TO0001914	What are you doing in Novac?
0TO0001915	It's nice to see a friendly face out here.
0TO0001916	You said the men that jumped me were heading this way, right?
0TO0001917	Just stay out of my way, robot.
0TO0001918	Goodbye
0TO0001919	So what's the story with this place?
0TO0001920	Quite a coincidence us meeting like this.
0TO0001921	This is too big to be a coincidence, robot - what's your angle?
0TO0001922	I could use a bed and some supplies
0TO0001923	I could use another gun at my side.
0TO0001925	It's good to see you again, Victor.
0TO0001926	Did you see Benny come this way?
0TO0001928	You see what happened in there?
0TO0001929	I don't like being followed, robot.
0TO0001930	Ahh! Where did you come from!
0TO0001931	'Wind-Brahmin'? You mean the tumbleweeds?
0TO0001932	The tumbleweeds?
0TO0001933	What herd?
0TO0001934	Oh, you're crazy, aren't you.
0TO0001935	All I see are tumbleweeds.
0TO0001938	How much?
0TO0001939	All of my caps?
0TO0001941	I've also got something for you. Pass by my room later.
0TO0001943	The pleasure's for both of us. Pass by later, I'll let you in.
0TO0001944	Thank you, I'm ready for it too.
0TO0001948	Where do you usually go to drink?
0TO0001949	Wait, you can make Moonshine?
0TO0001950	Here's the items for making some Moonshine.
0TO0001951	Can you make me some of your Moonshine?
0TO0001953	No, I won't listen to you.
0TO0001954	Why should I trust you?
0TO0001955	What about Veronica? She seems to come and go as she pleases.
0TO0001956	Have you tried bringing this up with the Elder yourself?
0TO0001958	I refuse.
0TO0001959	What can you tell me about the other members of the Brotherhood here?
0TO0001960	What did I do to the NCR?
0TO0001961	So what?! Screw you and screw the NCR!
0TO0001962	What can I do about that?
0TO0001963	Just leave me alone.
0TO0001964	Please, just leave me alone
0TO0001965	No, we finish this now.
0TO0001967	I'm ready. You'd better be, too.
0TO0001968	What can you tell me about the Legion?
0TO0001969	Why do you think the NCR and the Legion both want the Dam?
0TO0001970	What do you know about the courier Benny shot?
0TO0001971	I'm the courier Benny shot.
0TO0001973	You set me up. Now you die.
0TO0001974	So I get to kill you over and over again. <Attack Yes Man.>
0TO0001977	How do you propose to do that?
0TO0001978	I want no part of this.
0TO0001979	Explain to me again what you're trying to do.
0TO0001980	Your terminal had some very interesting things to say about the state of the air filtration system.
0TO0001981	So you and the McNamara both know about this?
0TO0001982	The rest of the chapter should be told!
0TO0001983	Don't worry, I'll keep your little secret.
0TO0001984	Vote for Hardin when he calls a tribunal.
0TO0001985	I changed my mind. I'll keep your little secret.
0TO0001986	So you won't vote for Hardin?
0TO0001988	What do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
0TO0001989	Now that the datastore is fixed, what do you think of Hardin trying to get McNamara dismissed?
0TO0001990	Not right now. I want to ask you a few questions.
0TO0001991	What kind of information is in the datastore?
0TO0001992	About the virus...
0TO0001993	No, it's nothing.
0TO0001994	So you'd vote against McNamara if Hardin called a tribunal?
0TO0001996	I could look around for the pistol.
0TO0001997	McNamara gave me permission to use the store, so start selling.
0TO0001998	Anything I can help you with?
0TO0001999	So you're a doctor?
0TO0002000	What services can you perform?
0TO0002001	You mentioned other duties you had?
0TO0002003	Why not tell on him?
0TO0002004	Was Initiate Watkins the "pet" you were referring to earlier?
0TO0002005	You really don't like Taggart, do you?
0TO0002006	What's with all the computers?
0TO0002007	Shouldn't you be in school or something?
0TO0002008	You said "anymore" before. Did the Brotherhood used to go out more?
0TO0002010	Are you parents here somewhere?
0TO0002011	So who do you take after more? Your mother or your father?
0TO0002012	Initiate Stanton told me about your little adventure the other day.
0TO0002013	What do you mean decide for yourself?
0TO0002015	Tell me about the Knights.
0TO0002016	Tell me about the Scribes.
0TO0002017	I don't have ti-
0TO0002018	I think I already found one of your patrols. Both Paladins were dead.
0TO0002019	I already found a couple of your patrols. The paladins were all dead.
0TO0002020	I already found all three patrols. They were all dead.
0TO0002023	I'll help you.
0TO0002024	I have better things to do.
0TO0002025	What happened with Elijah?
0TO0002027	So you're head of security?
0TO0002028	So why did I have to deal with that Ranger topside?
0TO0002029	Did you know Watkins and Stanton snuck out of here a few weeks ago?
0TO0002030	What exactly are the rules regarding entering and leaving?
0TO0002031	I had other questions.
0TO0002032	What would an Elder have to do to get kicked out?
0TO0002033	Can you tell me about some of the other people here?
0TO0002034	I've discovered proof that the chapter is in danger, and McNamara has covered it up.
0TO0002035	Who is Elijah?
0TO0002036	So you won't support Hardin if he calls a tribunal?
0TO0002037	How do you know that?
0TO0002038	He canceled?
0TO0002043	I have a score to settle.
0TO0002044	He has something of mine.
0TO0002045	I'm looking for answers.
0TO0002047	Whatever he's doing, I want in on it.
0TO0002048	<Lie> He's a good friend of mine. I'm trying to help him out.
0TO0002049	Forget it. I'll find him on my own.
0TO0002050	What do you need?
0TO0002051	You've had your needs neglected for far too long, haven't you? I can tell.
0TO0002052	Any idea why they went that way?
0TO0002053	Where is Boulder City?
0TO0002055	Sure. Maybe I can help ease your mind.
0TO0002056	I can't. I'm in a hurry.
0TO0002057	Why don't you deal with it?
0TO0002058	What needs to be done?
0TO0002059	Okay, I'll see what can be done about it.
0TO0002060	Actually, I already took care of it.
0TO0002071	Who is Leo?
0TO0002072	What kind of medicine are you taking?
0TO0002073	Where'd you get that sword?
0TO0002074	But... there's no one there.
0TO0002075	So he's just a voice you hear in your head?
0TO0002076	I'd like to know something else about you.
0TO0002077	Now about the man I'm looking for...
0TO0002078	What was I supposed to do again?
0TO0002079	You don't need anything blown up?
0TO0002081	I'll be back. I've got work to do.
0TO0002083	What happened in that fight back there?
0TO0002087	What did you want to teach me about?
0TO0002088	[END TUTORIAL] I think I know what I need to know.
0TO0002090	Where can I find more cards?
0TO0002093	Can you spare any medical supplies?
0TO0002094	I'm looking for a man in a checkered coat.
0TO0002095	What's Novac?
0TO0002113	I don't have the caps.
0TO0002115	Who's Jimmy?
0TO0002116	I think you have me confused with someone else.
0TO0002119	I have some questions to ask you.
0TO0002120	Lily, I'd like to talk to you about your medication.
0TO0002122	What's the best way for me to use your skills?
0TO0002123	Never mind, I had some other questions.
0TO0002125	You were a soldier?
0TO0002126	Who was the Master?
0TO0002127	What happened then?
0TO0002131	Here's your money.
0TO0002135	It's easy pickings. Why, you got somewhere else to be?
0TO0002136	One of those men shot me. I need to know the best way to get to them.
0TO0002137	Cowboy robot? You mean the one over there?
0TO0002138	Cowboy robot? You mean Primm Slim?
0TO0002139	Hey, just because you're idle and you'll never walk again... I forgot where I was going with that.
0TO0002140	What did you do?
0TO0002141	<Lie> I think the attackers were dead too... so it's... hard to tell.
0TO0002145	But... the price tag seems so excessive on the souvenir rockets. Could you make it lower?
0TO0002163	Jean-Baptiste in Freeside wanted to meet with you.
0TO0002164	Know anything about Mr. House?
0TO0002165	He's with the Van Graffs.
0TO0002166	Let's do it, then.
0TO0002167	See anything at the caravan site?
0TO0002168	See anything at the second caravan site?
0TO0002169	Any idea what was up at the site of the last caravan?
0TO0002170	Interested in... uh... following me to Freeside?
0TO0002171	How did they end up here?
0TO0002173	I'm ready. Let's finish this.
0TO0002174	I have some things to take care of before the battle.
0TO0002175	I have some questions first.
0TO0002190	You should watch this.
0TO0002197	I was the one who turned off the vents at Vault 34.
0TO0002198	As I said, I saved you from being trapped down in Vault 34.
0TO0002199	How's the "surface world" treating you?
0TO0002201	I don't need anything in return for my help.
0TO0002202	I could use a Vault trinket.
0TO0002209	Don't mention it, your freedom is enough reward for me.
0TO0002210	How about a Vault trinket in exchange for my help?
0TO0002217	<Lie> I'll need all the medical supplies you can spare for an injured man down by the highway.
0TO0002220	Breathing is uneven, and he's coughing up blood. Possible internal injuries.
0TO0002221	Well, there's lots of blood. And bruises. And maybe some other stuff, too.
0TO0002223	Give up some supplies now and you won't get your store looted later.
0TO0002224	Maybe the Powder Gangers will reward you later.
0TO0002226	This is your chance to join the winning side. You have three seconds to decide. One...
0TO0002227	It's better if you help me out, so just do it.
0TO0002229	If you run the town, they'll have to work for you. Food, water, and money will be yours.
0TO0002230	Free food, I guess.
0TO0002231	Forget I said anything.
0TO0002232	I already took care of Ringo.
0TO0002233	Ringo's already settled. What's next?
0TO0002234	Way ahead of you - I killed Ringo earlier.
0TO0002235	I see.
0TO0002236	I'm not an enemy, if that's what you're asking.
0TO0002237	If you're going to shoot, you'd better not miss.
0TO0002238	What does the NCR keep you safe from?
0TO0002239	What do you know about the other group?
0TO0002240	Where should I look for spare parts?
0TO0002241	Funny you should mention that, I have array parts right here.
0TO0002242	I passed through a place called Helios One. Maybe I could find parts there.
0TO0002243	How long will I get this benefit?
0TO0002244	For how long will I get this benefit?
0TO0002245	Depends on the work.
0TO0002249	What's the problem?
0TO0002250	Legion turned that sinkhole into a graveyard.
0TO0002251	[NCR] If I can help, I'm here to assist.
0TO0002253	Already been there, Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
0TO0002254	Why don't you go check it out?
0TO0002255	Hear any news from the West?
0TO0002256	Not interested.
0TO0002257	If I pass through there, I'll check it out.
0TO0002258	Nipton was attacked by the Legion.
0TO0002260	Town's been attacked, not sure by who.
0TO0002261	Did you have friends there?
0TO0002262	Didn't mean to be the bearer of bad news.
0TO0002263	If that's all you wanted, I'm done.
0TO0002264	What was the job you mentioned before?
0TO0002265	I did. Lorenzo's on it.
0TO0002266	I'm still looking for them.
0TO0002268	Yes, I did. Here are their reports.
0TO0002270	I appear to be lost. I'll just head back the way I came in.
0TO0002271	I'm not going anywhere with you.
0TO0002272	Lots of older people are still useful to their friends and communities.
0TO0002273	Let's play.
0TO0002274	I don't have time for a game right now.
0TO0002286	Anything else?
0TO0002288	If you were unconscious, how could you have done anything?
0TO0002289	Your head was bonked. Couldn't have done anything.
0TO0002290	Why do you think you let Betsy down?
0TO0002291	Where'd you let Betsy down?
0TO0002292	Thanks for the tip.
0TO0002293	She... helped? You sure about that?
0TO0002294	10 of Spades says his stuttering got better because of Usanagi.
0TO0002295	Bitter-Root admitted that Usanagi was able to help him with his problems.
0TO0002296	Sterling said that if he'd let his pride get in the way, he wouldn't be in First Recon.
0TO0002298	You're right - we've never met.
0TO0002301	Talking enemies down is an effective way to get what you want and save ammo.
0TO0002302	I think I can teach you things about public speaking.
0TO0002304	There are some key principles to stick to when it comes to bartering with traders.
0TO0002305	I could teach you some tricks about trading.
0TO0002307	I can teach how to make jacketed hollow points and other specialized ammo.
0TO0002308	I bet I could teach you a thing or two about shooting.
0TO0002310	I've done a lot of machining and lathe work over the years. I could write up a booklet for you.
0TO0002311	Oh the stories I could tell you about fixing stuff with duct tape and bubble gum!
0TO0002325	Who did you say I should talk to again?
0TO0002326	Not yet, but I will soon.
0TO0002327	Yes. Tell the troops to come protect Primm.
0TO0002329	Thanks for patching me up, Doc.
0TO0002330	You shouldn't have gone through my stuff.
0TO0002331	What do I do now?
0TO0002332	How'd you get started in the caravan business?
0TO0002333	What the hell is a fish?
0TO0002334	[Intelligence] I'm familiar. Do *you* know what a fish is?
0TO0002335	So you just started in the caravan...?
0TO0002336	So you traveled a lot.
0TO0002337	What, like a courier?
0TO0002338	How's caravan life in the Mojave?
0TO0002339	[Cherchez La Femme] That's... rarely an issue.
0TO0002340	[Black Widow] Soft men don't stay that way around me, I've found.
0TO0002341	Not sure I understand your answer.
0TO0002342	[Confirmed Bachelor] As long as we keep it on that level.
0TO0002343	[Ladykiller] Miss Cassidy... are you flirting with me?
0TO0002345	And caravan life's the same way?
0TO0002346	Do you deal mostly with NCR?
0TO0002347	Can you tell me anything about this Platinum Chip?
0TO0002348	What about Caesar's Legion?
0TO0002349	All right, just asking.
0TO0002350	Do they deal with any caravans at all?
0TO0002351	You sound frustrated.
0TO0002352	NCR sounds like it has a lot to answer for.
0TO0002353	There must be good parts to the Republic.
0TO0002354	Any other differences between Legion and NCR?
0TO0002355	What do you think of NCR?
0TO0002356	There's a "but" in there.
0TO0002357	You support it no matter what?
0TO0002358	So they lack direction?
0TO0002359	Yeah, I got that part, thanks.
0TO0002360	Back to NCR.
0TO0002361	So the Mojave suffers.
0TO0002362	So what's the alternative?
0TO0002363	There's other alternatives.
0TO0002365	Any thoughts on the Legion?
0TO0002366	You sure you want to do this?
0TO0002367	Got it. Let's loot the place.
0TO0002368	Time to move on.
0TO0002369	You all right?
0TO0002370	So that's it, then.
0TO0002371	You're welcome. Let's go.
0TO0002373	Better than the alternative.
0TO0002374	Chasing the dead with more deaths isn't the way.
0TO0002375	I'm for that, let's go kill them.
0TO0002376	There's another way - we can get evidence, let NCR take them down.
0TO0002377	The harm to the Van Graffs would last longer - and travel back West.
0TO0002378	If I can get the evidence, will you consider it?
0TO0002379	Here's the evidence of the deal. Without its twin, there's no proof.
0TO0002380	Here's both pieces of evidence.
0TO0002382	Because of what happened to your caravan.
0TO0002383	No one enters into a deal like this unless they have dirt on their partner.
0TO0002384	You know Gloria and Alice - what do you think?
0TO0002385	Anyone you trust in NCR?
0TO0002386	We have to try.
0TO0002387	If he won't listen, then we can do things your way.
0TO0002388	After all the shit I went through to get this, we're going to Jackson.
0TO0002389	Where was your caravan hit?
0TO0002390	How did you catch word of it?
0TO0002391	Think there's anything left?
0TO0002392	Site's probably nothing but bones and sand by now.
0TO0002393	Already been there, nothing worth finding.
0TO0002394	Let's go, then.
0TO0002395	I may have already searched the area.
0TO0002396	If there's time.
0TO0002397	Why would they have done it during the day?
0TO0002398	All right, let's check the place out.
0TO0002399	Is there anything salvagable?
0TO0002400	Want to go check it out?
0TO0002402	If we have time, sure.
0TO0002403	Let's leave it for now.
0TO0002404	Want to check it out?
0TO0002405	We'll make the time.
0TO0002406	Got it, let's start looting.
0TO0002407	Let's move.
0TO0002408	Have you lived here a long time?
0TO0002410	You sure seem like you have enough soldiers.
0TO0002411	Is NCR sending more troops?
0TO0002414	I have evidence of a caravan conspiracy.
0TO0002415	Can you get it to the right people?
0TO0002416	You have our word.
0TO0002417	Sure... no problem.
0TO0002418	If you can promise it gets where it needs to go.
0TO0002419	You're welcome.
0TO0002420	It felt like the right thing to do.
0TO0002421	Just get it to the NCR government.
0TO0002422	You mentioned a reward before?
0TO0002423	Could use a resupply.
0TO0002424	[NCR] I'm here to assist.
0TO0002426	Couldn't hurt.
0TO0002427	[END TUTORIAL] No need. I think I've got it covered from here.
0TO0002429	Well, you won't be getting any caps, but McLafferty won't be a problem for you.
0TO0002430	Yes, here are their holotapes.
0TO0002431	No, I've only found one of them so far. Both paladins were dead.
0TO0002432	I've found two of the patrols. All of the paladins were dead.
0TO0002433	No, I'm still working on it.
0TO0002434	What do you mean, took me long enough?
0TO0002436	Really?
0TO0002437	Then why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
0TO0002438	Very funny.
0TO0002439	So... that's a no, then?
0TO0002440	Actually, hang out here for a while.
0TO0002441	You're the mechanic around here?
0TO0002442	Why does your jumpsuit say "Miguel?"
0TO0002443	Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I think she's dead.
0TO0002445	A "personal matter," hmm? Handsome guy like you, I bet there's a girl involved.
0TO0002446	I'd like to hear about that personal matter you mentioned.
0TO0002448	Take a deep breath and focus, Lindsay. Where were you with him last?
0TO0002449	Any idea where I should start looking, kid?
0TO0002451	His sentence was almost up, and he isn't tied to the Powder Gangers.
0TO0002452	Come on, he's just a convict. How bad could he be?
0TO0002454	Do you think I could "buy" a pardon for 200 caps?
0TO0002456	Never mind, I'll be leaving now.
0TO0002458	Primm has seen better days.
0TO0002459	Where should I go to get you a pardon?
0TO0002460	I'll let you know when I do.
0TO0002461	Not yet, but let me ask you about something else first.
0TO0002465	I have some other questions.
0TO0002466	That's it for now.
0TO0002467	What do you need to take over protecting the town?
0TO0002469	I'm still working on it.
0TO0002470	I'll begin looking immediately.
0TO0002471	I won't do it.
0TO0002472	Wasn't Mexico City basically annihilated in the Great War?
0TO0002473	Fixing things?
0TO0002474	Why aren't you still there, then?
0TO0002475	What happened with her?
0TO0002476	But they didn't, did they?
0TO0002477	Did you rescue her?
0TO0002478	How did you survive?
0TO0002480	Doubts? About what?
0TO0002481	I think that's a great idea, Raul, and I hope you'll put them to good use with me.
0TO0002482	If that's what you think is best, I won't stop you.
0TO0002483	I don't think that's a good idea. You should focus on your mechanical skills instead.
0TO0002484	That's not true, Raul, you're great with a pistol.
0TO0002486	That's it? Are you implying that I've done shoddy work?
0TO0002487	That's all? I think you could afford to pay me a little more.
0TO0002488	I don't care about your radio. Where did those guys go?
0TO0002489	Jack is interested in a girl.
0TO0002490	She works for the Crimson Caravan.
0TO0002491	Just some kookie dame looking for love.
0TO0002493	It would mean a lot to Jack if she could come to Nellis.
0TO0002494	She's a great gal, you'll love her.
0TO0002496	Come on, Pearl, think of the joy it would bring Jack. He's in love.
0TO0002498	I assure you, Janet would not be a threat to the tribe.
0TO0002499	She couldn't hurt a fly. Let her into Nellis.
0TO0002501	I'd like to talk about allowing Janet to visit Jack.
0TO0002504	About your decision....
0TO0002505	I think you're right. You should focus on gunslinging. You'll do the memories of your family proud.
0TO0002506	You're right. You should give up the guns for good and focus on fixing things.
0TO0002507	You're wrong. You should give up the gun and focus on repairing things.
0TO0002508	You're wrong. You can still fight, and you should take up your guns again.
0TO0002509	We'll talk later.
0TO0002510	Sounds pretty bad.
0TO0002511	Wasn't it dangerous to be dressed so... noticably?
0TO0002512	Go on. What happened to Rafaela?
0TO0002513	That's terrible, Raul.
0TO0002514	So what did you do?
0TO0002517	I just need to know if I should watch my step around you.
0TO0002518	I was just curious.
0TO0002521	Do you know where I can find the courier office?
0TO0002522	I'd like to talk to you about Primm.
0TO0002523	Hayes is undermanned and is requesting some additional support.
0TO0002524	One of the convicts from NCRCF is looking for a pardon so he can protect Primm.
0TO0002526	Having Primm - and the trade route - under NCR control would help the West.
0TO0002527	If the NCR runs Primm... I bet you could sell it to... someone... somewhere.
0TO0002528	Go back West, then, see if I care.
0TO0002529	Good, go back to your famil... oh wait, they're fucking dead.
0TO0002530	Life means we have to make tough choices - me included.
0TO0002531	<Attack>That's it. Tired of listening to you anyway.
0TO0002532	<Lie> Look... I'm trying to change, life's tough.
0TO0002533	<Lie> The Mojave's a hard place. But I need to rise above that.
0TO0002534	I'm... not proud of what I've done. I'm trying to change, really.
0TO0002535	Tough words, but I needed to hear them. I'll change, I promise.
0TO0002536	<Lie> I heard you, I did. I've changed... inside.
0TO0002537	<Lie> I'll change Cass, I promise.
0TO0002538	I'm trying to do better... really trying.
0TO0002539	I've made mistakes. You judging me doesn't help.
0TO0002540	Look, the Mojave's a tough place, all right?
0TO0002541	Come on, I can change, really.
0TO0002542	Can we talk about this?
0TO0002543	I guess this is goodbye, then.
0TO0002544	I wanted to ask you something else.
0TO0002547	I've heard enough. Let's move on.
0TO0002548	I changed my mind. This is something we should confront together.
0TO0002549	Can you tell me about the Outpost?
0TO0002551	Not exciting enough for you?
0TO0002552	Looking for a man who shot me.
0TO0002553	Don't really want to talk about it.
0TO0002554	Twice. In the head.
0TO0002555	A doctor helped patch me up.
0TO0002556	He wanted something I was carrying.
0TO0002557	I don't think it was personal.
0TO0002558	Benny, wore a checkered suit.
0TO0002559	Didn't introduce himself, wore a bad suit.
0TO0002560	Well, in the meantime, he's given me a suite at the Lucky 38.
0TO0002561	Does this mean you're not going to kill me?
0TO0002567	There's other places to go.
0TO0002568	[NCR] I think they're both rangers, one desert, one NCR.
0TO0002569	You any good in a fight?
0TO0002570	Where did you learn to shoot?
0TO0002571	You've used explosives?
0TO0002572	And where did you learn how to handle dynamite?
0TO0002573	Maybe it's not where you go, it's the company.
0TO0002574	Running and gunning sounds interesting.
0TO0002575	Why not? I could use someone who knows the roads.
0TO0002576	If your world's a whiskey bottle, there's more out there.
0TO0002577	That's... one way to put it.
0TO0002578	Do you really want to stay in this shithole?
0TO0002579	Stay here, you know exactly what's going to happen, day in, day out.
0TO0002580	What's wrong?
0TO0002581	All right. Come on, let's go.
0TO0002582	Is whiskey your drink of choice?
0TO0002583	Whiskey Rose?
0TO0002584	I've met him. Nice impersonation.
0TO0002585	Tell me about the pendant.
0TO0002586	Pendant?
0TO0002588	Think we got off on the wrong foot. How about a drink?
0TO0002589	What are you trying to forget?
0TO0002590	Back West?
0TO0002591	Uh, how about you keep your hands by your sides.
0TO0002592	Why would they do that?
0TO0002593	Doesn't sound like raiders.
0TO0002594	Might have been Fiends, they're crazy like that.
0TO0002595	Who's Jackson?
0TO0002596	What are you going to do?
0TO0002597	So you're out of the caravan business?
0TO0002598	I'd slow down on that whiskey, if I were you.
0TO0002599	That drinking's going to get you in trouble in a second.
0TO0002600	Already cleared the roads for Jackson.
0TO0002602	That fucking monument outside?
0TO0002603	Covered in blood?
0TO0002604	What are those statues supposed to be?
0TO0002605	What did you mean about "covered in blood" before?
0TO0002606	Why are you here at the bar?
0TO0002609	Sniper on the roof?
0TO0002611	Don't waste my time with your reminiscing, Raul.
0TO0002612	Loyal's using his years of knowledge to help his tribe. I think that's a noble goal.
0TO0002613	What's on your mind?
0TO0002614	At least he knew when to step back and start to take it easy. A lot of people don't.
0TO0002615	Is that something you're afraid of?
0TO0002616	I suppose if you're happy with that kind of life, it's not so bad.
0TO0002617	Are you talking about something from your own past?
0TO0002618	I don't really have time for this, Raul. Maybe later?
0TO0002622	And you blame yourself for this?
0TO0002623	You can't think it was your fault. No one could stand against a dozen armed men all alone.
0TO0002624	Anyone stupid enough not to set a watch deserved what they got.
0TO0002626	I hate to tell you, but Tabitha's dead.
0TO0002627	Um, I should probably go.
0TO0002629	I had some other questions.
0TO0002630	Never mind. Let's move on.
0TO0002631	Any other weapons you know how to use?
0TO0002632	Your mother was a tribal?
0TO0002633	Tell me about your Dad.
0TO0002634	Any idea why he went East?
0TO0002635	Where'd you get that pendant?
0TO0002637	Just needed a little pick-me-up.
0TO0002639	Calm down. I had some questions.
0TO0002640	Fine - wasn't planning to share anyway.
0TO0002641	You could come with me.
0TO0002643	Not now, Raul.
0TO0002644	I don't have time for your useless chatter.
0TO0002645	I think it's good that he's so devoted to his duty. More people should act that way.
0TO0002646	The NCR put a lot of time and money into his training. He owes it to them to use it however he can.
0TO0002647	With those injuries, he's nothing but a drain on resources. He should retire.
0TO0002648	It might seem harsh, but a soldier can't do his job properly with those limitations.
0TO0002649	You're talking about the Great War? What do you remember about it?
0TO0002650	Why do I get the impression this is more personal to you?
0TO0002651	It sounds like maybe you're talking about yourself there, Raul.
0TO0002652	Why do you care so much, anyways?
0TO0002653	We're not just talking about Ranger Andy, are we?
0TO0002654	Is that what you did?
0TO0002655	What is it about Ranger Andy that reminds you of yourself?
0TO0002657	Can we discuss this another time?
0TO0002659	That's a bit cryptic, Beatrix.
0TO0002660	Sounds like you're a bit of a dom, Beatrix.
0TO0002661	The children here don't seem interested in guns.
0TO0002662	I think I could improve your curriculum.
0TO0002663	Good to hear. The wasteland is no place for children.
0TO0002664	What happens when they come of age?
0TO0002666	I can spare 2.
0TO0002667	I can spare 4.
0TO0002668	Actually. I can't spare anything right now.
0TO0002669	I can spare 2 more.
0TO0002670	I can spare 3 more.
0TO0002671	Just take all of it.
0TO0002672	Okay, I'll let you know if I find a pressure cooker.
0TO0002673	Haven't been to Nipton yet.
0TO0002675	What's with the soldiers?
0TO0002676	Be my guest.
0TO0002678	Crimson Caravan sent me, they want to buy out your caravan.
0TO0002679	Wait, what happened to your caravan?
0TO0002681	You haven't even seen the offer yet.
0TO0002682	So even if you have nothing, you won't sell?
0TO0002683	I have the offer letter here, the terms are fair.
0TO0002684	It's just a name, this - this is money.
0TO0002685	I'm prepared to offer you the terms, plus 750 caps.
0TO0002686	Maybe... there's something else we could trade?
0TO0002687	I'm not going to offer money, I wanted to drink for it.
0TO0002688	That amount's enough to start a new caravan... with the old name.
0TO0002689	I think you're a realist, and know a good offer when you see one.
0TO0002690	Far from it, to turn down the original terms.
0TO0002691	The Crimson Caravan will most likely change the name once they buy it.
0TO0002692	Wouldn't suggest otherwise.
0TO0002693	After Cassidy Caravans gets renamed, just start it up again.
0TO0002694	Which means they're paying you to rebuild Cassidy Caravans, not sell it.
0TO0002695	Just insuring future work with the Crimson Caravan.
0TO0002696	Let's just say I prefer when both sides are happy.
0TO0002697	Whatever gets the job done. Sign here.
0TO0002698	So what... you're just going to keep it?
0TO0002699	If you made the caravan, you're responsible for killing it.
0TO0002700	Uh... as long as we don't share the same bottle.
0TO0002701	We haven't finished all the bottles yet.
0TO0002702	I feel great, actually. Another?
0TO0002703	Still feel a little parched.
0TO0002704	I flll fnnne.
0TO0002705	Hmm? MmmMmmm.
0TO0002706	Yeah... well, feel a... a little dizzy.
0TO0002707	I think... think my liver's trying to crawl out my ass.
0TO0002708	I totally love you and your little hat.
0TO0002709	When I mmmet you I thought you were thbiggst bitch.
0TO0002710	Whtttchumnn
0TO0002711	Looking to join up with me again?
0TO0002712	Just passing through.
0TO0002713	Had some questions I wanted to ask you.
0TO0002714	Surprised you can see me from that deep in the bottle.
0TO0002715	Was looking for someone worth my time, I was mistaken.
0TO0002716	How about a drink instead?
0TO0002719	I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do it.
0TO0002720	I thought you said I didn't have to kill her.
0TO0002721	Forget it, then. I had something else I wanted to ask.
0TO0002723	Are you sure?
0TO0002724	If you think staying here's any better...
0TO0002725	This Outpost is the last place you want to be trapped.
0TO0002726	I wanted to talk to you more about buying your caravan.
0TO0002727	Who believes in holding on to a dead caravan?
0TO0002728	I may be honest, but at least I'm not blinded by pride.
0TO0002729	Helped out Jackson and cleared the road North.
0TO0002731	I had something else I wanted to ask.
0TO0002734	I'll get a dozen bottles of whiskey and be back.
0TO0002735	Here's a dozen bottles, let's go.
0TO0002736	Got the whiskey, let's do this.
0TO0002739	Could you help me craft something?
0TO0002744	Could you could teach me to punch better?
0TO0002748	Sure, teach me.
0TO0002749	Not right now.
0TO0002751	Is there someplace you wanted me to take you?
0TO0002753	I changed my mind. I'm not going inside, either.
0TO0002754	They were distributing supplies down by the old train station, but I dealt with them.
0TO0002760	I already know how to wear Power Armor.
0TO0002761	I'll talk to her, then.
0TO0002763	Are you well respected among other members of the Brotherhood?
0TO0002764	Why is the Brotherhood interested in Nevada?
0TO0002765	Ever been in love?
0TO0002767	You didn't go with her?
0TO0002768	I want to discuss other things.
0TO0002769	With Tabitha gone, what will happen to this place?
0TO0002770	I'll leave things here to you, then.
0TO0002771	You're not hiding something from me, are you?
0TO0002772	Didn't your friend just say so?
0TO0002773	Sorry, didn't mean to intrude.
0TO0002774	Your friend looks like he's in bad shape.
0TO0002776	You already let me in the other night! Do all of us civilians look the same to you soldier boys?
0TO0002777	I'm here to see Major Kieran on urgent business. Please let me pass.
0TO0002778	Come on, guys, you can let me in, right? Right?
0TO0002779	I hate to tell you this, but Rex is dead.
0TO0002780	Rex died in battle, saving my life.
0TO0002781	You know, I really don't pay attention to him, so your guess is as good as mine.
0TO0002782	He sure did.
0TO0002783	I don't have to give him back just yet, do I?
0TO0002784	Should I leave you two alone?
0TO0002785	I wanted to speak to you about the Great Khans.
0TO0002788	I'd like to purchase some supplies.
0TO0002790	I have some questions about the NCR.
0TO0002792	Not even to a friend of the NCR?
0TO0002793	Come on! Don't you want to make a few caps?
0TO0002795	I completely understand, but I am working for the good of the NCR too.
0TO0002796	Come on! Who's going to know?
0TO0002797	Let's go back to my other questions.
0TO0002798	How do you feel about the NCR being out here?
0TO0002799	What are your thoughts about the Legion?
0TO0002800	What do you know about the dam?
0TO0002801	I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to you. Well, not really.
0TO0002818	What's the problem with your mission?
0TO0002819	Tell me about the correctional facility.
0TO0002820	Do you have any information on the convicts?
0TO0002821	All right.
0TO0002822	It's about time. Hand them over.
0TO0002823	What was strange about it?
0TO0002824	Some men stole my package. A man in a checkered suit and some thugs. Did they pass this way?
0TO0002826	Where are you from?
0TO0002827	How old are you?
0TO0002828	What's "Petro-Chico?"
0TO0002829	Where'd you get that Vaquero outfit?
0TO0002830	How'd you end up at Black Mountain?
0TO0002832	Anything else you want to share?
0TO0002833	But how did Tabitha find you in the first place?
0TO0002834	How can I make the best use of your skills?
0TO0002835	I don't believe that, you must have some skills.
0TO0002836	What use are you to me, then?
0TO0002837	Can you still repair my equipment?
0TO0002838	I want to ask you something else about yourself.
0TO0002839	Tell me about Hidalgo Ranch and the Great War.
0TO0002840	Tell me about your time in Mexico City.
0TO0002841	Tell me about the girl in Tuscon.
0TO0002873	Actually, I won't be needing your services any longer.
0TO0002874	Will do.
0TO0002875	It is, but I think I'll explore it on my own from now on.
0TO0002876	That's one word for it. Let's keep going.
0TO0002877	I don't need your services any longer.
0TO0002878	None taken. Let's go.
0TO0002879	Sure, let's go.
0TO0002881	Why would I want you to tag along with me?
0TO0002882	That's okay. I don't really need the company.
0TO0002883	You can stop following me around now.
0TO0002884	What can you tell me about the Kings?
0TO0002885	Nah, let's go.
0TO0002887	I don't have that kind of money.
0TO0002888	Why would I need a bodyguard here?
0TO0002889	I don't think I need a guard.
0TO0002890	I don't think I need a bodyguard. You can go.
0TO0002891	No, it's nothing. Let's continue.
0TO0002894	<100 caps> Fix me up.
0TO0002895	<100 caps needed> I don't have the caps.
0TO0002897	<75 caps> Fix me up.
0TO0002898	<75 caps needed>
0TO0002899	<50 caps> Fix me up.
0TO0002900	<50 caps needed>I don't have the caps.
0TO0002904	<Lie> Sure am. I just recently arrived here from California.
0TO0002905	<Lie> Yup, sure am. From NCR, I mean.
0TO0002908	I think I'll pass.
0TO0002909	Kimball.
0TO0002910	Tibbett.
0TO0002911	Tandi.
0TO0002912	Peterson.
0TO0002913	Okay, you got me. I'm not an NCR citizen.
0TO0002914	The Boneyard.
0TO0002915	Shady Sands.
0TO0002916	Aradesh.
0TO0002917	Vault 13.
0TO0002918	A two-headed bear.
0TO0002919	An eagle.
0TO0002920	A two-headed snake.
0TO0002921	A two-tailed lion.
0TO0002922	Can I take the test again?
0TO0002923	Does every NCR citizen really know this stuff?
0TO0002925	No, I'll come back later.
0TO0002926	Guess I'll just go, then.
0TO0002927	I sure am.
0TO0002928	No, I'm not.
0TO0002929	Lay it on me.
0TO0002930	I don't really have time for this.
0TO0002943	Can't I try again?
0TO0002944	I'm ready.
0TO0002946	Oh come on. I'm betting not everyone in the NCR knows these things.
0TO0002948	I've got 100 caps here that all say I'm a loyal NCR citizen.
0TO0002949	Would, say, 10 caps maybe change your mind?
0TO0002950	Screw this, I'm leaving.
0TO0002951	I really don't have time for this.
0TO0002952	You don't know me? Your boss does - we're very good friends. You should leave.
0TO0002954	Sounds like cheating.
0TO0002959	I'd really rather you didn't.
0TO0002960	Maybe later, okay?
0TO0002961	What do you mean, guys like Ranger Andy?
0TO0002962	I think he's a hero of the NCR.
0TO0002963	He's a pathetic waste of space.
0TO0002964	He seems like a decent guy.
0TO0002965	Even after a crippling injury, a guy like Andy's tougher and more dangerous than most men alive.
0TO0002966	I think it's good that he's retired. Out of sight, out of mind.
0TO0002967	Guys like us?
0TO0002968	Just because someone's crippled doesn't mean they're useless. All that experience is invaluable.
0TO0002969	He didn't have to give it up, he's just scared he doesn't have what it takes anymore.
0TO0002970	Are you talking about Andy, or yourself?
0TO0002971	Oh, right. You've got a thing about people with hats.
0TO0002972	You're certainly looking better.
0TO0002973	Glad to hear it.
0TO0002974	So you're better? Good - I won't have to strip you for parts.
0TO0002976	We're on the same side. Settle down!
0TO0002977	Cut that out or I'll turn you into a hat.
0TO0002978	What's that, boy? Little Jimmy fell into a well?
0TO0002979	What's that, Rex? Little Jimmy fell down the well?
0TO0002980	Huh?
0TO0002981	It's times like this that I wish you could talk.
0TO0002982	Let's go check out that well, boy.
0TO0002983	We have better things to do right now.
0TO0002984	Did someone fall into a well?
0TO0002985	Are you saying I should stab the next person I see?
0TO0002986	Is there a radioactive twister coming?
0TO0002987	Do you smell an ambush?
0TO0002988	Is it going to rain?
0TO0002989	I want to take a closer look at you.
0TO0002990	[Examine the painting of the bull on Rex's side.]
0TO0002991	[Stop examining Rex.]
0TO0002992	[Examine Rex's brain case.]
0TO0002993	[Examine Rex's mechanical parts.]
0TO0002994	Where is he now?
0TO0002995	Were you close?
0TO0002996	What did you learn from him?
0TO0002998	How is that different? What did you learn from him?
0TO0002999	What was in the note?
0TO0003000	Did you follow him from California?
0TO0003001	What changed?
0TO0003002	Ever try to talk sense into him?
0TO0003003	How is that different from how any other Elder would've reacted?
0TO0003004	Can you help me find the package I lost?
0TO0003005	Sounds good to me. Does that mean you're in?
0TO0003006	That's way better than what I had in mind.
0TO0003007	I think you'll be a very good distraction.
0TO0003008	I haven't decided.
0TO0003009	Do you have a preference?
0TO0003010	Does it matter who we help?
0TO0003011	So you're not coming?
0TO0003012	I want to help the Legion defeat the NCR.
0TO0003013	<Lie> That's what I was thinking, too.
0TO0003014	Are you coming to this thing or what?
0TO0003015	<Lie> Then you'll be happy to know I'm planning on helping the Legion.
0TO0003016	No. I was planning on helping the Legion against the NCR.
0TO0003017	<Lie> I was hoping you'd want take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
0TO0003018	I was hoping you'd want to take down the NCR, since that's the plan.
0TO0003019	How come your last name isn't Van Graff?
0TO0003022	I have some questions I'd like to ask you.
0TO0003025	Will you tell me some of your stories again?
0TO0003029	Can you tell me anything about Mr. House?
0TO0003030	I'm looking for the man who shot me: he wears a checkered coat and carries a shiny pistol. Seen him?
0TO0003031	Do you know anything about a goon named Benny? Wears a checkered coat, carries a big pistol?
0TO0003032	What's your take on the NCR?
0TO0003033	How do you feel about Caesar's Legion?
0TO0003034	Tell me about New Vegas.
0TO0003037	That's all I wanted to know. We'll talk more later.
0TO0003038	You're being sarcastic, aren't you?
0TO0003039	Really? That's great! Any idea where he might come from?
0TO0003040	You can't seriously think they're the same Mr. House.
0TO0003041	Maybe there's a connection. Can you remember anything else about Robert House?
0TO0003042	That's sickening.
0TO0003043	Enough about Johnson. What's next?
0TO0003044	What will your friends think about this?
0TO0003047	Why wasn't the data we collected useful?
0TO0003048	Tell me again about Benny's Securitron.
0TO0003049	Don't be so hard on yourself. Life would be dull if it weren't for all the little mistakes.
0TO0003050	Alcohol is the only way Benny could ever get any action from a smart girl like you.
0TO0003051	Getting sucker punched by Benny happens to the best of us.
0TO0003052	Maybe you should chalk it up to being irresponsible and naive.
0TO0003054	We don't need him. If he wants to go, let him go.
0TO0003055	I'll talk to Moreno.
0TO0003057	I'm sorry I had to kill him - he didn't give me much choice.
0TO0003058	Doesn't matter - he paid for his mistake.
0TO0003060	We don't have to fight. We can still talk about this.
0TO0003061	Come and get me.
0TO0003062	Which way to Primm?
0TO0003066	Do you have anything to trade?
0TO0003070	What if I go around the caravan?
0TO0003072	Radiation supplies.
0TO0003074	Who are the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0003075	What are your goals?
0TO0003076	Who was this Father Elijah to you?
0TO0003077	Do you have any other family in the Brotherhood?
0TO0003078	A dress?
0TO0003079	Tell me something else about you.
0TO0003080	That's your goal? You want a nice dress?
0TO0003081	I'm looking for Ambassador Crocker.
0TO0003083	What's happening on the Strip?
0TO0003084	Tell me about the Casinos on the Strip.
0TO0003085	What else is there to do besides the Casinos?
0TO0003086	Yes it is.
0TO0003087	No, I've been here before.
0TO0003089	Tell me about the Lucky 38.
0TO0003090	What's the deal with the Ultra-Luxe?
0TO0003091	What do you know about Gomorrah?
0TO0003092	What's The Tops like?
0TO0003093	I want to ask about something else.
0TO0003094	What the hell are you?
0TO0003095	Can we get down to business?
0TO0003096	Stealth Boy.
0TO0003097	Cat Eye.
0TO0003098	Magazines.
0TO0003100	Regular Gun Ammo.
0TO0003101	Energy Weapon Ammo.
0TO0003111	I found some of your people dead out in the waste. They had it on them.
0TO0003112	Why do you look so spooked?
0TO0003114	Could you just let me go? I really don't care what's down here anymore.
0TO0003117	Regular stims.
0TO0003118	Super stims.
0TO0003119	Actually, nevermind.
0TO0003130	Maybe you should've stayed at Hidden Valley.
0TO0003131	You don't control the people who did this.
0TO0003132	These people are dead because you were careless and selfish.
0TO0003133	You can just join the Followers somewhere else.
0TO0003134	I have to go.
0TO0003135	I should be going.
0TO0003136	The Great Khans' second-in-command seems amenable to allying with the NCR.
0TO0003137	Papa Khan has named me his successor. We might be able to arrange an alliance with NCR.
0TO0003140	Ethel's right. Vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
0TO0003142	The current leader of the tribe is dead-set against it. Maybe a diplomatic solution would work.
0TO0003143	Okay, I'll do it. What's the plan?
0TO0003144	I'm not interested in a career in political killings.
0TO0003146	I need healing.
0TO0003147	Can I join the Followers?
0TO0003149	Is Dr. Schiller here yet?
0TO0003150	It was all her idea.
0TO0003151	She hasn't shared any secrets. You don't have any proof otherwise.
0TO0003152	<Burp Loudly>
0TO0003153	Your face must be pretty ugly to always be wearing that helmet. Do you wear it on dates, too?
0TO0003154	I have some questions about Primm.
0TO0003155	I have some more questions about Primm.
0TO0003156	I'd like to ask you about something else.
0TO0003158	You'll be the element of surprise.
0TO0003159	It was Arcade's suggestion, not mine.
0TO0003160	You tell me.
0TO0003161	How are you going to deploy your squad?
0TO0003164	I want you to help the NCR hold onto the Dam.
0TO0003165	Help the Legion take over the Dam.
0TO0003166	You're the officer here. Can't you just order him to go along with the plan?
0TO0003167	Will Moreno be a liability?
0TO0003168	What's Moreno's problem with the NCR?
0TO0003169	Can't you just order Johnson to go along with the plan?
0TO0003170	Will Johnson be a liability?
0TO0003171	Any chance of talking Johnson into staying?
0TO0003173	The Remnants come in, guns blazing, showing the NCR how it's done. You actually don't want that?
0TO0003174	This is a chance for one more moment of glory.
0TO0003175	I work against the NCR as much as I work for them. This is no different.
0TO0003178	Will caps change your mind?
0TO0003179	Can you tell me anything about Anderson?
0TO0003181	Hey, I risked a lot to get you that data feed.
0TO0003182	What's the big deal?
0TO0003185	Did Benny say why he had the Securitron?
0TO0003186	What did he have you do?
0TO0003187	Did something... happen between you two?
0TO0003188	You didn't think to tell anyone about this?
0TO0003190	Hmm. I'll be right back.
0TO0003191	Is there a health inspector bothering you?
0TO0003192	I'm not the gambling type. I need to keep moving.
0TO0003194	This is Veronica, formerly of the Brotherhood of Steel. She's interested in joining your cause.
0TO0003196	Fine, I'll find the gun for you.
0TO0003197	Why do the records show that the gun was turned back in?
0TO0003198	Sorry, I can't help you.
0TO0003199	I'm trying to help Torres find a missing laser pistol. Have you seen it around?
0TO0003200	I have to be going.
0TO0003201	I'll try my best to find it.
0TO0003202	Could you be a little more specific about where you dropped it?
0TO0003203	I better go and start looking.
0TO0003204	Can I just get you another laser pistol?
0TO0003205	Ok, you can have ED-E for a little bit.
0TO0003206	Your plan is crazy.
0TO0003207	Something wrong?
0TO0003208	Why's that?
0TO0003210	Why no more patrols?
0TO0003211	Why aren't there any patrols anymore?
0TO0003212	That's terrible.
0TO0003213	That's horrible.
0TO0003214	A virus?
0TO0003215	Anything I can do?
0TO0003216	Anything I can do to help?
0TO0003218	What do I need to do?
0TO0003219	Why the lockdown?
0TO0003222	I've had better.
0TO0003223	Need any help?
0TO0003224	Sorry to hear that. I should be going.
0TO0003225	That's too bad. I really have to go.
0TO0003226	Let's go back to that virus you mentioned.
0TO0003227	I'll give it a try, then.
0TO0003228	Sounds complicated. I'll leave you to it.
0TO0003230	Can the virus's files be partitioned so read-access is only provided by the kernel administrator?
0TO0003231	You could just delete all the files. That would get rid of the virus, right?
0TO0003232	Maybe I'll try another time.
0TO0003235	Your advanced level of tech would be useful in settling things between the NCR and the Legion.
0TO0003236	There isn't anyone else around with your equipment and expertise.
0TO0003237	I never said anything about paying you.
0TO0003238	Come on. Let's get out of here.
0TO0003239	You're sure you're okay leaving them behind?
0TO0003240	What's going on around here?
0TO0003242	I'll go check it out.
0TO0003243	Maybe some other time, goodbye.
0TO0003248	Perhaps another time.
0TO0003250	Power armor and laser rifles are still effective.
0TO0003251	The Brotherhood is living in the past. Eventually they'll have to change.
0TO0003252	If it's worked for this long, there must be something redeemable about their beliefs. Have faith.
0TO0003253	None of that is going to change. It's part of the Brotherhood's identity.
0TO0003254	Why don't you do something about it?
0TO0003255	The Brotherhood has to isolate itself. Its knowledge is dangerous.
0TO0003256	Are you still going to travel with me?
0TO0003257	It's not too late to change your mind.
0TO0003258	Will they take you back after you killed these people?
0TO0003259	If you're about to ask me for help, stop.
0TO0003260	Why wasn't the data useful?
0TO0003261	How long have you been with the Followers?
0TO0003263	Is there another way to get Mr. House's data?
0TO0003266	I've heard some information from its logs, sounds like it is carrying some Enclave data.
0TO0003268	I'd like to talk to you about ED-E again.
0TO0003269	The logs spoke about Enclave Duraframe research and Poseidon Energy research.
0TO0003272	A woman named Emily asked me to bug one of your data terminals.
0TO0003273	I should let you know that I planted a surveillance device on one of your data terminals.
0TO0003278	I took care of them.
0TO0003280	Did you say NCR whores, before?
0TO0003283	Did you say NCR whore, before?
0TO0003287	I wasn't able to find all of the escorts you're looking for.
0TO0003289	My time isn't cheap, Mr. Garret.
0TO0003290	Hey, don't I get a bonus or something?
0TO0003292	Is there anyone like that in Freeside?
0TO0003293	So there's no law here at all?
0TO0003294	Let's talking about something else.
0TO0003295	What is there to do in Freeside?
0TO0003296	Did you have something to do with that NCR messenger getting attacked?
0TO0003298	Er, no.
0TO0003299	So why isn't every man in Freeside in your gang?
0TO0003301	What can you tell me about Pacer?
0TO0003302	Who are the important people in Freeside?
0TO0003303	Tell me about Julie Farkas.
0TO0003304	I'd like to hear about the Garret Twins.
0TO0003305	Who are the Van Graffs?
0TO0003306	What's the skinny on Mick and Ralph?
0TO0003308	No, General, you keep it in mind - and our conversation is over.
0TO0003309	NCR can't hold the Mojave already, and now you're threatening me?
0TO0003310	Attack me, and I'll order an attack on NCR at McCarran, the Embassy, and the Strip.
0TO0003311	Tell your soldiers you're going to attack Vegas, see what happens.
0TO0003312	Then it's best we kill you all now. Securitrons? Please erase NCR from the Dam.
0TO0003313	Securitrons - erase NCR from the area.
0TO0003314	Because the Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
0TO0003315	You think these robots are all the forces I have?
0TO0003316	<Bluff> Is talking all you can do? I can talk tough, too - real tough.
0TO0003317	<Bluff> Because you're talking and not attacking?
0TO0003318	Oh, with a crack squad like at HELIOS One? Try it.
0TO0003319	<Bluff> Last I looked, that generator was on its last legs.
0TO0003320	<Bluff> The generator is beyond repair, trust me.
0TO0003321	Even if you fixed the generators, hacking the code won't be easy.
0TO0003322	Even if you fix it, you couldn't re-program the power grid, the systems are fried.
0TO0003323	I doubt you know how bad the generator is by looking at it, trust me.
0TO0003324	Send an engineer down to inspect the turbine and the housing - let them tell you.
0TO0003325	While the Boomers fly West? Works for me.
0TO0003326	I think how I handled the Legate should be enough for you.
0TO0003327	I just stood down Caesar's toughest General... you think I won't?
0TO0003328	Once I radio the Brotherhood, they can handle the fighting elsewhere.
0TO0003329	Um, well, I'm sure if ask them they'll be on board.
0TO0003330	Who's to say? I just suggested coming to Hoover Dam to them, and BOOM.
0TO0003331	Look, either you're going to leave, or you're going to fight. So decide.
0TO0003332	Well, uh, one percent... are you sure? Seems weak to me.
0TO0003333	Really? We should play cards some time, you're bluffing.
0TO0003334	It was my duty, General - I was glad to help out.
0TO0003335	The Generator's destroyed, the Dam is useless to you.
0TO0003336	<Bluff> Seems to me you're doing a lot of talking for someone ready to fight.
0TO0003337	Then... the Brotherhood might be willing to help me, I think.
0TO0003338	Then maybe the Brotherhood would have more incentive.
0TO0003339	I couldn't have done it alone, and I appreciate the assist along the way.
0TO0003340	Oh, I think it is... numbers aren't everything, really.
0TO0003341	Exactly - and while you've been occupied here, they're ready.
0TO0003342	The Boomers might be willing, too... if I ask them. Which I will.
0TO0003343	And once the Boomers join them?
0TO0003344	Sometimes I wonder if NCR wouldn't lose the whole West if they weren't sitting on it.
0TO0003345	<Attack> Actually, nothing of the sort. We've come to exterminate you.
0TO0003346	Forget it, let's finish this.
0TO0003347	Look, you've got two choices - leave, or fight.
0TO0003348	Well, I guess we can talk some more, if it'll settle things.
0TO0003349	<Bluff> The fact you're talking me with me says a lot about your willingness to fight.
0TO0003350	I have no intention of leaving you empty-handed.
0TO0003351	We want the Dam, but the power it generates can be shared.
0TO0003352	Maybe we could... give you some caps, from the battle?
0TO0003353	What if we give NCR some concessions in trade with Vegas - and the East?
0TO0003354	Well, we might be able to open the East up faster if we work harder at it.
0TO0003355	We'd also guarantee protection to the caravans - and enforcement of fair trade practices.
0TO0003356	The reason we need to hold on to it is because it's very technical. Very.
0TO0003359	There are... technologies in Vegas we may be able to provide to NCR. Not all, but some.
0TO0003360	As long as that's not a "no," then I'd take that doubt to your superiors.
0TO0003361	You've witnessed what we can do this day to the Legion - we can shut down the Dam, Vegas, and NCR.
0TO0003362	If you don't accept my gifts, the technologies rolling into NCR will be Securitrons, I promise you.
0TO0003364	I'm going to rest for a bit, if you don't mind.
0TO0003365	If there's nothing else, General, I'll head out.
0TO0003366	Maybe traveling is in order.
0TO0003398	Tell me about the Kings.
0TO0003399	Tell me about the Followers.
0TO0003402	There's a rumor that there's a feud between your family and Pacer. What's that about?
0TO0003403	What do you think of the NCR?
0TO0003404	What do you think of the Legion?
0TO0003405	What do you know of Mr. House?
0TO0003406	What do you think of the Gun Runners?
0TO0003408	I'll be sure to pass it along.
0TO0003409	Why not tell her yourself?
0TO0003410	Get out of here before you get hurt.
0TO0003411	It's fine, Simon. I won't let him get to me.
0TO0003412	Care to back that up?
0TO0003413	Good to see you, too, Pacer.
0TO0003414	Why don't you just get the hell out of here?
0TO0003415	Apparently I do. Something wrong with that?
0TO0003416	Actually, it does. What are you going to do about it?
0TO0003417	Never mind. Just forget I said anything.
0TO0003418	Do you ever stop talking tough?
0TO0003419	Nah, I've just risen up in the world.
0TO0003420	Watch your mouth or my trigger finger might twitch.
0TO0003421	Work is work, right?
0TO0003422	You've come to the right place. Go on in.
0TO0003423	Sorry, we're going to have to search you first.
0TO0003424	Have you been drinking, sir?
0TO0003425	Well, since you declared your gun, go ahead.
0TO0003426	It's company policy. Now are you going to let us search you or what?
0TO0003427	Why, do you have something to hide?
0TO0003428	Nah, you're fine. Go on in.
0TO0003429	I'll keep asking until you start answering.
0TO0003430	You still haven't submitted to that search I mentioned.
0TO0003431	I asked if you've been drinking.
0TO0003432	Never mind. I'm afraid we're going to have to search you.
0TO0003433	Are you talking back to me?
0TO0003434	Certainly, sir. We need to pat you down for weapons first.
0TO0003435	Welcome to the Silver Rush. Go on in.
0TO0003436	Sorry, sir. I can't let you in.
0TO0003437	It should be fine, go on in.
0TO0003439	I'm sure you're a man of your word, sir, but we still need to pat you down. No exceptions.
0TO0003440	Your word doesn't matter. It's just company policy.
0TO0003441	In a word, no.
0TO0003442	I think you may be drunk, sir.
0TO0003443	Pardon me, sir my mistake. Go on in.
0TO0003444	We'll have to pat you down first, sir.
0TO0003445	Go on in.
0TO0003446	We're going to have to search you first.
0TO0003447	Are you drunk?
0TO0003448	Just checking. Go ahead.
0TO0003449	No, but you do need to be searched.
0TO0003450	How do I know you're not drunk?
0TO0003451	Okay, search away.
0TO0003452	That's not going to happen.
0TO0003470	What's the deal with the snowglobe collection?
0TO0003471	You do know Caesar is dead, don't you?
0TO0003472	Where does New Vegas get all its electricity?
0TO0003473	Why is the terminal on the North wall off-limits?
0TO0003475	Did you know I killed some White Gloves who were eating their customers?
0TO0003476	Did you know some of the White Gloves are... eating people again?
0TO0003477	Were you aware that the White Glove Society used to be cannibals?
0TO0003479	Was it just me, or were there signs of attraction earlier?
0TO0003481	Who do you think will win at Hoover Dam? The NCR, or Caesar's Legion?
0TO0003484	Don't you get lonely here, with no one but Marilyn and Jane to keep you company?
0TO0003485	Would you like to scan me again?
0TO0003486	It's just business.
0TO0003487	I don't like you.
0TO0003488	The NCR asked me to get rid of you.
0TO0003489	By Caesar's command, you will die.
0TO0003490	Yes Man needs you out of the way.
0TO0003491	Time for you to die, Mr. House.
0TO0003492	You won't be able to control anything, but I'll let you live.
0TO0003493	I'll put you back in your tube, good as new.
0TO0003494	Thanks for the free advice. Who are you?
0TO0003495	Why wouldn't I want to go past the greeter?
0TO0003497	How do you like the new job?
0TO0003499	Old Ben has the experience and skill you need.
0TO0003500	Any idea where I should look for the sexbot?
0TO0003503	How would you like to work for the Garrets?
0TO0003504	Courier? I used to be a courier before I got shot in the head.
0TO0003505	Butcher? How did you get into that?
0TO0003506	That sounds odd.
0TO0003507	Crier? What was that job?
0TO0003509	That's horrible!
0TO0003510	Wrong place at the wrong time, if you ask me.
0TO0003511	You said escort? Like armed guard?
0TO0003512	So you got paid for sex?
0TO0003513	Oh, I could never do that.
0TO0003514	Gun for hire?
0TO0003516	James Garret needs a real 'boyfriend experience' for more discerning patrons.
0TO0003518	You're a beacon of light in some people's depressing existence! Your work is art!
0TO0003519	Aw, c'mon! The pay would be great!
0TO0003521	Ben, you give your clients a precious respite from the ills of the world.
0TO0003525	Hold that thought, General. I wanted to introduce you to some friends.
0TO0003526	Think that's great? You won't believe what happens next.
0TO0003527	Can't take all the credit, had some help from my allies here.
0TO0003528	Have you seen an entire army of upgraded Securitrons, General?
0TO0003529	General Oliver, Hoover Dam is ours. Leave at once.
0TO0003530	I suggest you leave before my "boys" open fire on your men.
0TO0003531	The Dam is won... for me. You and the Legion have both lost this day.
0TO0003532	Are you sure that's wise?
0TO0003533	I don't want any more violence, there's been enough today.
0TO0003534	Retreat, or we wipe NCR off the face of the Dam.
0TO0003535	Leave on your feet, or leave wrapped in your flag.
0TO0003536	How about I ask these robots to fuck you and your entire battalion with a rocket barrage?
0TO0003537	General, the Republic has outstayed its welcome - this land is mine.
0TO0003538	I make the laws here now, and my law is simple: No NCR on the Colorado.
0TO0003539	I was hoping we could be pleasant about this.
0TO0003540	Can't do a worse job than the Republic, that's for sure.
0TO0003541	I guarantee I've put more thought into the state of the Mojave than you or anyone in NCR.
0TO0003542	My sycophant tells me "yes."
0TO0003543	I see. Yes Man, please throw General Oliver from the Dam.
0TO0003544	Insults? Tsk tsk. Securitrons, please erase all trace of NCR from the area.
0TO0003545	Is that all? Because I've got work to do, and NCR words don't mean much around here.
0TO0003546	That day's not likely to come, General.
0TO0003547	I didn't take the Dam for you, General - I took it for Vegas.
0TO0003548	Mr. House sends his regards, Oliver. He's... expanding.
0TO0003549	I can't take all the credit, but it wasn't really a gamble, either.
0TO0003550	If that's what makes you feel comfortable, I'm not judging you.
0TO0003551	Actually, I took the Dam, General Oliver - with Mr. House's backing.
0TO0003552	I don't need your opinions, only your compliance.
0TO0003553	You will because the alternative is worse - and useless. Much like NCR.
0TO0003554	Ever resisted arrest on the Strip? Then you know the odds.
0TO0003555	If you intend to fight, go ahead, it doesn't matter to me.
0TO0003556	I already defeated the Legate and the Legion, you won't be much trouble.
0TO0003557	If you think you've got any chance of taking Hoover Dam, you're wrong.
0TO0003558	Maybe you're willing to listen to reason.
0TO0003559	What, Caesar wasn't brave enough to come take the Dam himself?
0TO0003560	What, Caesar giving you orders beyond the grave?
0TO0003561	I'm here to kill you. The Legion's advance ends here.
0TO0003562	Nice mask, can't wait to take it as a trophy.
0TO0003563	<Bluffs> But... history has shown defeat is assured. Uh, yours, that is.
0TO0003564	<Bluff> Persist and learn what Graham learned at the Dam - and Boulder City.
0TO0003565	<Bluff> I think they believe you'll be tricked as easily... maybe easier.
0TO0003566	<Bluff> NCR has studied you as they did Graham, and the trap is ready for you.
0TO0003567	<Bluff> That strength... other Legates didn't see it either, until it was too late.
0TO0003568	<Bluff> The position of your veterans, using the Dam's intake towers - all as expected.
0TO0003569	<Bluff> Your success was too easy, though, wasn't it? You think I reached you by chance?
0TO0003570	<Bluff> Graham did not smell the C4 until he entered Boulder... he only smelled victory.
0TO0003571	<Bluff> How could a lone opponent like me reach you so easily, then?
0TO0003572	Perhaps the treachery of your own ranks disgusts you as it disgusts me.
0TO0003573	There are those among the Legion that would see you fall as Graham did.
0TO0003574	I don't believe this means we'll see the last of you - or the Legion.
0TO0003575	If you return East and exact vengeance, it buys the West time - and thins the Legion ranks.
0TO0003576	I do not wish to die this day, it is true. But nor do I wish to win through trickery.
0TO0003577	When your own must ally with the West in order to remove you? Such treachery must be answered.
0TO0003578	I have questions first.
0TO0003579	I'm ready to deal with Oliver now.
0TO0003580	I will await that day, Legate Lanius.
0TO0003581	The West will be waiting.
0TO0003582	Whatever... just hurry before NCR finishes their plans.
0TO0003583	[Karma] Any man can claim bravery when he outnumbers his opponent.
0TO0003584	<Bluff> If you're such a "Terror" of the East, call off your dogs and face me one on one.
0TO0003585	[Karma] Why don't you fight me yourself if you've got the spine for it, shithead.
0TO0003586	Maybe you'd want something more fair? Like a fair fight?
0TO0003587	<Bluff> Uh, yeah, probably don't think you can take me by yourself, huh?
0TO0003588	I'm sick of talking, let's end this.
0TO0003589	<Lie> It matters - what honor gain be had in defeating a potentially superior foe with lies?
0TO0003590	Worth the gamble - now for the hard way.
0TO0003591	I'm ready, what needs to be done?
0TO0003592	Look... there must be some deal we can make to stop this fighting - it's useless.
0TO0003593	You could take the West. *Holding* it is another matter.
0TO0003594	So you, uh, think military strength is enough, even without supplies?
0TO0003595	And they don't *need* to send an army, your supply lines will kill you first.
0TO0003597	The farther West, your strength will fail you, I promise you.
0TO0003598	There's no communities to support you in the West - you've seen to that.
0TO0003599	Look, you haven't thought the economics of this through, all right?
0TO0003600	The settlements West are *not* self-sufficient tribes - they need NCR, and the caravans.
0TO0003601	But the Legion... it's destroyed a bunch of... well, towns you need.
0TO0003602	Towns? The Legion destroyed Nipton, poisoned Searchlight, butchered Nelson.
0TO0003603	No, the taming of the West is what has defeated you - NCR's weakness is their defense.
0TO0003604	You know you can't supply all the West anymore than the Republic can.
0TO0003605	As Legate, do you really believe that, or are you taking a chance?
0TO0003606	Where you see death, I see change - and I see it as a strength.
0TO0003607	I have faith. Trade helped us survive the Great War, it will do so again.
0TO0003608	So... you'll retreat?
0TO0003609	And I grant you that time as well.
0TO0003610	I suspect the bear will surprise you in ways... in ways I can't even describe.
0TO0003611	This battle is decided, that's why I am here.
0TO0003612	Surely there are terms you would hear? Anything?
0TO0003613	Move forward? The Legion spent years trying to take Hoover Dam.
0TO0003614	Look, my point about Hoover Dam is that it's hard to take, so...
0TO0003615	And then what of the East?
0TO0003616	Look, you're not listening to me - it's not about the Dam, really.
0TO0003617	If you need all the East to crush the West...
0TO0003618	Well... except Vegas.
0TO0003619	That's an optimistic attitude for a general, and that's how wars get lost.
0TO0003620	It is not the strength of the West that will slow you, it is their weakness.
0TO0003621	Really? I hope you're not counting on the Omertas to help you.
0TO0003622	About time. I was starting to get bored with all this waiting around.
0TO0003623	You sound pretty sure of yourself. I don't think it'll be that easy.
0TO0003624	Good, because the Omertas' plan was stopped, Vegas is as strong as ever.
0TO0003625	NCR's weakness is its size - it'll take your entire army to hold the West.
0TO0003626	Fine. Let's hear it, then.
0TO0003627	Hope NCR's a lot less entrenched than they seem.
0TO0003628	Eventually - but moving your whole army West means losing the East. You can't hold both.
0TO0003629	How do you propose we deal with NCR?
0TO0003630	There is victory in wisdom, Legate.
0TO0003631	If you feel that war matters that much, perhaps you will see differently in time.
0TO0003632	I will await that day, Legate.
0TO0003633	We shall be here, and we shall meet you on the battlefield.
0TO0003634	If you needed someone killed, all you need to do is say so.
0TO0003635	I'll see what I can do to convince him the Dam belongs to us.
0TO0003641	Is there anything else I should do before the battle?
0TO0003642	I'm ready to go to the dam.
0TO0003643	Sure is, go on in.
0TO0003644	Sorry sir, but I can't let you in. Company policy.
0TO0003645	Get the hell out of here, you drunk!
0TO0003646	Go on in, sir.
0TO0003647	On second thought, I can't let you in, sir.
0TO0003648	Is Westside part of New Vegas?
0TO0003649	Tell me again about Westside's relationship to New Vegas.
0TO0003650	How do people here manage to survive?
0TO0003662	How did you become the master of The Thorn?
0TO0003663	What's your take on the state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
0TO0003666	My mind's thinking about what I could do with you, in private.
0TO0003667	What's your take on state of affairs of the Mojave Wasteland?
0TO0003673	How can I pay tribute to you?
0TO0003678	What else can I hunt for you?
0TO0003683	Before that time comes, we have some left to get intimate.
0TO0003684	There's nothing "lesser" about what I can do, in private.
0TO0003685	Let's go somewhere more private.
0TO0003686	I'll bet 20 on Red.
0TO0003687	I'll bet 20 on Blue.
0TO0003688	I'll bet 20 on Red, Night Stalkers.
0TO0003689	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fiends.
0TO0003690	I'll bet 20 on Red, Radscorpions.
0TO0003692	I'll bet 20 on Red, Cazadores.
0TO0003694	I'll bet 20 on Red, Deathclaw.
0TO0003695	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Fire Geckos.
0TO0003696	I'll bet 20 on Red, Deathclaws.
0TO0003697	I'll bet 20 on Blue, Giant Radscorpions.
0TO0003698	I don't have enough caps right now.
0TO0003704	I want to fight in The Thorn.
0TO0003710	I've got other questions for you.
0TO0003722	One.
0TO0003726	Two.
0TO0003727	Three.
0TO0003734	Three Fiends.
0TO0003735	Two Radscorpions.
0TO0003736	A Giant Radscorpion.
0TO0003737	Three Night Stalkers.
0TO0003738	One Cazador and one Night Stalker.
0TO0003739	Two Giant Radscorpions.
0TO0003740	One Deathclaw.
0TO0003741	One Cazador and two Radscorpions.
0TO0003742	Three Giant Radscorpions.
0TO0003744	Three Radscorpions.
0TO0003747	A Giant Radscorpion and a regular Radscorpion.
0TO0003748	A Cazador.
0TO0003749	A Giant Radscorpion and two regular Radscorpions.
0TO0003750	Two Fire Geckos.
0TO0003751	A Deathclaw.
0TO0003753	Two Night Stalkers.
0TO0003754	A Fire Gecko.
0TO0003758	Two Fire Geckos and a Giant Radscorpion.
0TO0003759	Two Night Stalkers and a Fire Gecko.
0TO0003760	One Deathclaw and a Night Stalker.
0TO0003762	Three Fire Geckos.
0TO0003763	Two Cazadores.
0TO0003764	This baddie.
0TO0003770	Here's the money.
0TO0003842	I'll defeat as many as you've got.
0TO0003843	Okay, bring it on!
0TO0003845	Actually, I already found him. He's dead.
0TO0003846	Wow, that... really was something.
0TO0003847	That was terrible. Really, really awful.
0TO0003850	<Log Playback::Continue>
0TO0003853	I took care of Mr. House.
0TO0003854	You said something about a bunker at the Fort?
0TO0003855	Remind me what you said about some bunker at the Fort?
0TO0003857	I'll think about it.
0TO0003858	The last thing Vegas needs is more robots.
0TO0003860	I've recovered the Platinum Chip.
0TO0003861	Now that I have the Platinum Chip, what's next?
0TO0003865	<Log 2 Playback::Begin>
0TO0003868	Know anything about Saint James?
0TO0003869	I'll pay you for the key.
0TO0003870	We girls need to stick together, and this'll be our secret.
0TO0003871	You'd say no to a guy like me? And here I thought you were special...
0TO0003873	<250 caps> This should be enough.
0TO0003874	<250 caps needed>I can't meet your price right now.
0TO0003875	I have other things to do.
0TO0003876	This building is... interesting. What do you know about it?
0TO0003877	Tell me more about him.
0TO0003878	If this was a school, what was taught here?
0TO0003880	And that's where you got the name from.
0TO0003881	Is that what you guys do, pretend to be this guy?
0TO0003886	You look like you're gathering water. The Westside isn't supposed to have a water supply.
0TO0003887	Caught you red-handed. Tell me where you're taking that water.
0TO0003888	It's stealing, no matter who it's for. Corporal White found out, didn't he?
0TO0003889	Where does Corporal White come into this?
0TO0003890	Sounds reasonable, but what about Corporal White?
0TO0003892	If something happened to White, tell me. You know it's the right thing to do.
0TO0003893	Are you lying, Hector?
0TO0003894	You're making me angry, Hector. Tell me about the water - now.
0TO0003895	It's okay if you tell me - I won't get you in trouble.
0TO0003896	You sure you don't know anything?
0TO0003899	Sorry, got my own problems.
0TO0003901	50 caps or I walk.
0TO0003902	Let's hear it then.
0TO0003904	Where is she?
0TO0003907	Sorry, too dangerous.
0TO0003909	Uh...where is she again?
0TO0003913	Any chance you could help me get into Saint James' room?
0TO0003914	Yes! I'll join.
0TO0003915	I'm not interested right now.
0TO0003916	What does it mean to join the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0003917	Sure let me take a look at those magazines.
0TO0003918	I'd like to talk about joining the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0TO0003920	I think the Followers should support NCR in the coming battle at the dam.
0TO0003921	I think the Followers should support an Independent Vegas through the coming battle at the dam.
0TO0003922	Would you rather see Caesar's Legion win and enslave everyone?
0TO0003923	I'm setting plans in motion which will ensure both the Legion and NCR are pushed out of the Mojave.
0TO0003924	They won't have nearly enough doctors without the Followers' support.
0TO0003925	The Followers would act as support safely away from combat.
0TO0003926	You would act as medical support, safely away from combat.
0TO0003927	Part of my plan involves automated security for the region.
0TO0003928	This is a golden opportunity for the Followers to spread knowledge and care throughout the Mojave.
0TO0003929	How have things been since the battle?
0TO0003930	Do you have any work for me?
0TO0003931	What happened to the Legion?
0TO0003932	Let's go back to speaking of the Khans.
0TO0003933	Let's go back to talking about the Omertas.
0TO0003934	Let's go back to discussing Mr. House.
0TO0003935	Let's go back to talking about the Brotherhood.
0TO0003936	What other responsibilities does this office have?
0TO0003937	I've been inside the Lucky 38.
0TO0003938	I've been invited to visit the Lucky 38.
0TO0003939	I've been inside the Lucky 38... but Mr. House and I didn't get along.
0TO0003940	I know the Chip upgrades his Securitrons.
0TO0003941	The Platinum Chip upgrades the Securitrons - and there's a whole army of them under the Fort.
0TO0003942	I used the Chip to put an entire army of Securitrons on standby at the Fort.
0TO0003943	Once I get the Platinum Chip, what then?
0TO0003944	I have the Platinum Chip, remember?
0TO0003945	Where is the Platinum Chip?
0TO0003946	Benny seems to have run off with the Platinum Chip.
0TO0003947	I don't have the Platinum Chip. Maybe it's on Benny's corpse.
0TO0003948	Mr. House has dared me to visit him at the Lucky 38... so he can kill me.
0TO0003949	The Chip was supposed to activate an army of Securitrons at the Fort, but I blew it up.
0TO0003954	<Log Playback::End>
0TO0003956	<Log 1 Playback::Begin>
0TO0003959	He thinks your experience and technology will help resolve the conflict in this region.
0TO0003960	You guys have big guns and are good at fighting.
0TO0003961	I'm gathering allies - just in case.
0TO0003962	Gonna need more friends, I think.
0TO0003963	Why, do you have something better to do?
0TO0003964	<Turn on Securitrons.>
0TO0003965	<Destroy the dam generators.>
0TO0003967	What's a Securitron doing in a hole in Benny's closet?
0TO0003968	"Yes Man?" What kind of a name is that?
0TO0003969	How come you work for Benny and not Mr. House?
0TO0003970	What's Benny planning to do with the Platinum Chip?
0TO0003971	You're very... forthcoming with that information.
0TO0003972	Benny stole a platinum chip from me. Do you know what it's for?
0TO0003973	Hold still a minute. I want to upgrade your programming.
0TO0003974	On second thought, never mind...
0TO0003975	Not until you tell me where you get the food from.
0TO0003976	I could use some help with my reputation in Freeside.
0TO0003978	I need people to forget about some things I've done.
0TO0003979	I want people to like me.
0TO0003981	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there. I'm no monster.
0TO0003982	<Pay 250 caps> Nothing big, just a few things.
0TO0003983	<Pay 500 caps> I think they may have gotten me mixed up with someone else.
0TO0003984	<Pay 500 caps> Someone is still spreading horrible rumors about me!
0TO0003985	<Pay 1000 caps> I must have been possessed by the Devil to have done what I did.
0TO0003986	<Pay 250 caps> Just a few things here and there.
0TO0003987	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great guy. I do my best to help those in need.
0TO0003988	<Pay 500 caps> I'm a great gal. I do my best to help those in need.
0TO0003989	<Pay 1000 caps> I'm a damn beacon of morality here! People should be lining up to shake my hand.
0TO0003991	I'm all ears.
0TO0003992	I'd like to switch to my Pip-Boy.
0TO0003993	I'd like to switch to my Pimpboy.
0TO0003996	How did you get to be a colonel in the NCR?
0TO0003997	What can you tell me about Hoover Dam?
0TO0003998	What do you know about Caesar's Legion?
0TO0003999	Are you in charge of the NCR around here?
0TO0004000	Sounds like you miss it.
0TO0004001	It's better to be in charge.
0TO0004003	What impressed you about their discipline?
0TO0004004	You mentioned that they were in good shape?
0TO0004005	What kind of weapons do they use?
0TO0004007	Where should I start looking for them?
0TO0004008	What if I can convince them not to join the Legion?
0TO0004010	What could Mr. House possibly be up to?
0TO0004011	What evidence do you have that Mr. House will make a move?
0TO0004012	Won't getting rid of Mr. House have huge repercussions for New Vegas?
0TO0004013	No, ma'am.
0TO0004015	<Lie> Colonel Moore is in trouble! She needs help now!
0TO0004016	Don't you have anything better to do right now than guard this door?
0TO0004018	It's okay I'm a friend.
0TO0004019	[Lie] I've been ordered to get something for Colonel Moore, let me in.
0TO0004020	It's important that I get in there.
0TO0004021	<Start Combat> Enough talk!
0TO0004022	What can you tell me about Legate Lanius?
0TO0004024	Oh, well. At least I'm good at killing.
0TO0004025	What? You think this is my fault?
0TO0004027	What do you know about Legate Lanius?
0TO0004033	No deal.
0TO0004034	I go where I please! <Attack>
0TO0004035	No problem, I'll head up by myself.
0TO0004039	What do you know about Caesar?
0TO0004040	How is NCR doing?
0TO0004041	What's the Legion been up to?
0TO0004043	Do you ever stop talking?
0TO0004044	I'm investigating some intel problems for Technical Sergeant Reyes.
0TO0004045	I know you're the one who's been manipulating intelligence data.
0TO0004046	Do you know anything about the problems?
0TO0004047	Can you give me any advice?
0TO0004048	How do you coordinate the intel?
0TO0004049	Why don't the ranger stations send the intel directly to the troopers?
0TO0004050	But you're inventing your own intelligence reports. I've seen the logs and talked to the rangers.
0TO0004051	Why did you do it?
0TO0004052	Aren't you fighting for the people of New Vegas?
0TO0004053	How does spreading false intel help anything?
0TO0004054	What do you think I should do about this?
0TO0004056	But what does that accomplish?
0TO0004057	Too bad. I'm turning you in.
0TO0004058	What will you do if I don't turn you in?
0TO0004059	What about you and the rangers?
0TO0004060	That's crazy.
0TO0004061	Caesar's dead. The Legion can't hold itself together for five years, much less ten.
0TO0004062	Caesar's sick. He won't live long. The Legion will fall apart a few years after he's gone.
0TO0004063	Caesar's dead. What more do you need?
0TO0004064	Caesar is sick. Like... really sick. He could drop any day.
0TO0004065	You've convinced me. Your secret is safe.
0TO0004066	I can't let you do this. I have to turn you in.
0TO0004067	Fine. I'll turn you in.
0TO0004068	Doesn't matter. Your time's up, Hanlon.
0TO0004069	Fires?
0TO0004070	Where did he go?
0TO0004071	How did a Follower wind up becoming Caesar?
0TO0004072	What happened to Graham after Hoover Dam?
0TO0004073	Are the Blackfoots part of the Legion?
0TO0004074	So that was the end of Graham?
0TO0004075	Why are funds tied up at the Boneyard?
0TO0004076	What's going on in Baja?
0TO0004077	What about the troopers?
0TO0004078	Tell me about General Oliver.
0TO0004079	Colonel Moore's "way"?
0TO0004080	Is Moore in charge of all the NCR troopers out here?
0TO0004081	What do the new rangers mean for NCR?
0TO0004082	Tell me about the heavy troopers.
0TO0004083	Tell me about Nelson.
0TO0004084	What happened at Searchlight?
0TO0004085	[Continue]
0TO0004087	Why do they call Lanius the Monster of the East?
0TO0004088	How bad was Graham?
0TO0004089	Was Graham a good commander?
0TO0004090	What makes the veterans so tough?
0TO0004091	Tell me about centurions.
0TO0004092	Who are the praetorians?
0TO0004093	Have any good stories to tell?
0TO0004094	How long have you been in the rangers?
0TO0004095	What do the rangers do?
0TO0004096	Why are the rangers here?
0TO0004097	Okay, what are you supposed to be doing?
0TO0004098	What are you actually doing?
0TO0004099	There must be something good the rangers have done that you're proud of.
0TO0004100	Come on. You must have lots of stories.
0TO0004101	So what happened at Hoover Dam and Boulder City?
0TO0004110	Thank you, Caesar.
0TO0004111	I don't want to decide.
0TO0004112	Can I set him free?
0TO0004113	You should probably be talking to somebody else.
0TO0004114	Where can I find your whores?
0TO0004115	Eddie sent me to deal with you.
0TO0004116	< Cock your head and grin. >
0TO0004117	I'm not going to let you live.
0TO0004119	Eddie's just going to keep chasing you. Quit while you're ahead... and alive.
0TO0004120	How about you walk away and I'll do the same? That way it's easy on both of us.
0TO0004124	I'll need to think about this.
0TO0004125	You only want me to deal with Chavez?
0TO0004126	You have a deal.
0TO0004127	I'll need to think about it.
0TO0004128	Does that mean you'll take the law into your own hands?
0TO0004130	Let's finish this, then.
0TO0004133	< Keep holdout weapons. > Sure, here you go.
0TO0004134	What if I wanted to take over New Vegas, instead of Benny?
0TO0004135	Say I wanted to take over New Vegas myself. What then?
0TO0004136	What are the details of the plan?
0TO0004137	Say Mr. House was going to suffer an accident. How would that happen?
0TO0004138	Mr. House is out of the picture already.
0TO0004139	If something happens to Mr. House, I may be in touch.
0TO0004141	Forget the Boomers. I want nothing to do with them.
0TO0004142	Which tribes should I "get to know"?
0TO0004143	So I should ask these tribes if they'll support an Independent Vegas?
0TO0004144	Let's talk about the tribes I should "get to know."
0TO0004145	The Boomers have vowed to support me.
0TO0004146	The Boomers won't be a problem anymore. I killed their leaders.
0TO0004147	I'm familiar with the Boomers. They can be ignored.
0TO0004148	Tell me what you know about the Great Khans.
0TO0004149	How have the Khans been kicked around?
0TO0004150	I need to take some more time with the Khans.
0TO0004151	What do you know about the Boomers?
0TO0004152	I'll get back to you about the Boomers.
0TO0004153	What do you know about the White Glove Society?
0TO0004154	I'll let you know when I'm done evaluating the White Glove Society.
0TO0004155	Where should I look for the Brotherhood of Steel?
0TO0004156	What do you know about the Brotherhood of Steel?
0TO0004157	I'm not ready to decide what I want to do with the Brotherhood.
0TO0004158	What do you know about the Omertas?
0TO0004159	Do you know anything else about the Omertas?
0TO0004160	I'll check into the Omertas some more.
0TO0004161	I've visited the Khans' settlement at Red Rock Canyon. They can be ignored.
0TO0004162	The Great Khans have been wiped out.
0TO0004163	I've convinced the Great Khans to support the NCR.
0TO0004164	I convinced the Great Khans to leave the Mojave.
0TO0004165	I've set the Great Khans on a path of destruction.
0TO0004166	I know the Brotherhood. I want them left alone.
0TO0004167	I've convinced the Brotherhood to support the NCR.
0TO0004168	I know enough about the Omertas to know I want them left alone.
0TO0004169	The Omertas were plotting to destroy the Strip, so I killed the conspirators.
0TO0004170	I helped the Omertas perfect their plan to slaughter everyone on the Strip.
0TO0004171	I spoke to Marjorie and Mortimer. I say leave the White Glove Society alone.
0TO0004172	The White Glove Society had a cannibalism problem, but I solved it.
0TO0004173	The White Glove Society needed a little help getting back to basics, that's all.
0TO0004174	It took some doing, but I convinced the White Glove Society to support Caesar's Legion.
0TO0004175	I destroyed the Brotherhood of Steel's bunker.
0TO0004176	I'd like you to go back to the Lucky 38 for now.
0TO0004177	I do. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
0TO0004179	<Companion Protocol::Return Base>
0TO0004180	It is. We'll meet up at the Lucky 38.
0TO0004183	Let's take our chances. <Untie Benny.>
0TO0004185	No, I came to decorate this tent with your guts.
0TO0004186	You invited me and promised safe-conduct.
0TO0004189	I killed the Deathclaw Alpha Male and Mother at Quarry Junction.
0TO0004192	You can't have the tapes, but I'll keep them to myself if you leave and never come back.
0TO0004195	Cachino was talking about big plans for the Family.
0TO0004196	The NCR will welcome my help.
0TO0004197	He set me up for an ambush.
0TO0004198	Benny set me up for an ambush.
0TO0004199	Were you aware that Benny hijacked one of your Securitrons and used it to infiltrate your network?
0TO0004201	1250 caps it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0004202	The Omertas had it coming.
0TO0004205	I may know something about that...
0TO0004206	When the Legion assaults Hoover Dam, the Omertas are going to massacre everyone on the Strip.
0TO0004207	Never mind, I'll check into it.
0TO0004208	I kind of helped them perfect their plan...
0TO0004210	I infiltrated the Omertas in order to gain their confidence.
0TO0004211	Well, thing is... I, uh... they tried to involve me...
0TO0004212	It means I have to kill you.
0TO0004213	Nothing I can do. Trying to stop them would be a suicide mission.
0TO0004214	Wait for them to make their move. Forewarned is forearmed.
0TO0004215	Send your Securitrons into Gomorrah and kill off the Omertas' leaders.
0TO0004216	The Brotherhood is holed up in Hidden Valley.
0TO0004217	I don't want to kill off the entire Brotherhood.
0TO0004218	I'd like to ask some questions.
0TO0004219	Let's get back to business.
0TO0004220	Any recommendations on how to complete the mission?
0TO0004221	Is there any possiblity of a diplomatic solution?
0TO0004224	There nothing I can do to protect Kimball?
0TO0004225	What should I do in the meantime?
0TO0004226	I'll be leaving, then.
0TO0004228	Let Kimball Visit. Whatever happens, happens.
0TO0004232	Okay, I'll do it.
0TO0004233	I had my reasons.
0TO0004235	I was set up. The Legion used me as a patsy.
0TO0004236	It... it wasn't Kimball, it was an imposter. It had to die!
0TO0004237	What more could I have done?
0TO0004238	I'll take care of it.
0TO0004239	What's this about a dormant reactor?
0TO0004241	Why didn't you restart the reactor earlier?
0TO0004242	You already have power. Why is this important?
0TO0004246	Why do I need to be there? The NCR has an army.
0TO0004248	Sounds like I get to kill lots of Legionaries.
0TO0004249	Do I need to remind you that the NCR hates me?
0TO0004251	I've got proof of what I've said.
0TO0004252	Is there any work to do here?
0TO0004255	How did you know I was in trouble?
0TO0004257	You saying I owe you?
0TO0004260	What do you want from me?
0TO0004262	Some trick without a nose.
0TO0004266	Well, don't.
0TO0004267	How would you put it?
0TO0004270	Where does the concrete come from?
0TO0004271	Sounds like life in the Legion is tough.
0TO0004272	That's quite a story, Jimmy.
0TO0004273	How much for your services?
0TO0004274	<200 caps> Let's do it.
0TO0004276	<200 caps needed> I'm kind of short on caps right now.
0TO0004279	Why is your partner called Saint James?
0TO0004280	I hear you and your partner are coyotes.
0TO0004281	Is this apartment building yours?
0TO0004282	Tell me about Dermot.
0TO0004283	What do you know about Jimmy?
0TO0004284	Tell me about Sweetie.
0TO0004287	I had questions about your tenants.
0TO0004292	<75 caps> What the hell. Let's do it.
0TO0004293	<75 caps needed> I don't have enough caps on me.
0TO0004296	What do you know about Dermot and Saint James?
0TO0004297	I found this teddy bear in Saint James's room.
0TO0004299	I'm looking to score some Med-X. Can you help?
0TO0004300	Tell me about Dermot, your partner.
0TO0004301	I hear you spend most of your caps on Sweetie.
0TO0004302	<300 caps> Here's your money.
0TO0004304	<300 caps needed> I don't have enough on me right now...
0TO0004306	Does Saint James pay you for anything "unusual"?
0TO0004308	Let's say 100 caps. Or you could earn zero keeping your mouth shut.
0TO0004309	100 caps. Take it or leave it.
0TO0004310	All right. 200 caps it is.
0TO0004314	Do you know Saint James?
0TO0004315	Tell me about Freeside.
0TO0004317	How did you join the Kings?
0TO0004318	I'm trying to get to the Strip. Know anything that could help me out?
0TO0004320	What about crime?
0TO0004321	Don't the Kings run this place, though?
0TO0004322	I heard a rumor that there's something between you and the Van Graffs. What happened?
0TO0004323	Whoa, now. Watch where you point that thing. It's dangerous.
0TO0004324	Good for you. No one should have to be afraid all the time.
0TO0004325	Now you'll get some respect. You should give some hell to the people that used to push you around.
0TO0004326	No, you could make a real difference.
0TO0004327	Freeside's problems are too big for you to have much impact.
0TO0004328	You believed that crap I said about giving the money away?
0TO0004329	I go places all the time. It's actually pretty easy to just pick up and leave.
0TO0004330	You wouldn't last ten seconds out in the waste.
0TO0004331	Sure, but what about this place? Isn't it your home?
0TO0004332	I'm sorry. Sorry you're such a prissy asshole.
0TO0004333	I'm sorry. I was out of line before.
0TO0004334	I've already forgotten it.
0TO0004335	Very classy.
0TO0004336	As good as a ghoul in a suit can look.
0TO0004337	I don't care. Do you have any new info?
0TO0004338	Sure. What is it?
0TO0004339	No right now. I'm busy.
0TO0004340	Don't shoot! Here you go.
0TO0004341	Why are you doing this?
0TO0004342	I'm not giving you my caps.
0TO0004343	I have a better idea. Why don't I just take all my caps back from your corpse?
0TO0004344	Anyone else missing?
0TO0004345	Would you be willing to give me the control tower access key so I can check it out?
0TO0004346	Is that a big deal?
0TO0004347	What do you think it means?
0TO0004348	So you want me to do what you can't.
0TO0004349	<Continue Listening>
0TO0004351	I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
0TO0004352	[Attack] Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
0TO0004353	Very well. I'll try and help you.
0TO0004354	But not to me. I'll sever your head and carry it with me always - a message to would-be traitors.
0TO0004355	I'm sure it doesn't.
0TO0004356	Nasty how?
0TO0004357	Fiends aren't enough of a challenge for you?
0TO0004361	I just did what anybody else would've done.
0TO0004362	I made a promise to Private Morales.
0TO0004363	Now both the Fiends and the NCR know not to fuck with me.
0TO0004364	Remind me where Isaac is.
0TO0004365	Does it mean anything?
0TO0004366	Blake is where, exactly?
0TO0004367	Where was I supposed to meet Price, again?
0TO0004368	Seen anything suspicious lately?
0TO0004370	What exactly is "funny" about that merchant you want me to check out?
0TO0004371	I don't get it. What's funny about a merchant?
0TO0004372	What am I looking for in Primm?
0TO0004374	How did the breakout happen?
0TO0004375	What can you tell me about the prison?
0TO0004376	Where is Cooke now?
0TO0004377	What do you know about Cooke?
0TO0004379	Why are you "sort of" the doctor?
0TO0004381	What did you do before?
0TO0004382	What's your reason for staying?
0TO0004383	How did you all manage to escape?
0TO0004384	What did you do before you ended up incarcerated?
0TO0004385	Tell me more about what happened in the prison.
0TO0004387	Who's Cooke?
0TO0004388	Where can I find Cooke?
0TO0004390	Who's in charge of the Powder Gangers?
0TO0004391	Mr. House won't give you any more trouble. I took care of that.
0TO0004392	Let me ask you more about you and Vault 21.
0TO0004393	I want to ask you general questions.
0TO0004396	So what's the plan?
0TO0004397	Where should I start?
0TO0004398	What do I do when I'm at the train?
0TO0004399	Is that everything?
0TO0004400	So where do I find his footlocker?
0TO0004402	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about the situation with the Kings in Freeside.
0TO0004403	He said those were his official orders, but suggested seeing you anyway.
0TO0004404	He said you might have a better way of dealing with the issue.
0TO0004405	The ambassador didn't think Colonel Moore would handle the situation correctly.
0TO0004406	Any other problems?
0TO0004407	Where does that leave you?
0TO0004408	What's Camp McCarran's role in NCR operations?
0TO0004409	Are things mostly quiet between here and the Dam?
0TO0004410	What challenges does the NCR face here?
0TO0004411	...but relief must follow unbearable suffering.
0TO0004412	I'm going to pollute the ventilation system with the strinking corpse of an NCR private.
0TO0004413	What are the most dangerous places in the Wasteland?
0TO0004415	How do Wastelanders cope with current times?
0TO0004422	I'm here to deliver an ultimatum from the NCR. Cease hostilities against the NCR or perish.
0TO0004423	The NCR wants you to curb the violence in Freeside. Or else.
0TO0004424	NCR citizens are dying in Freeside and the NCR wants you to stop it.
0TO0004425	I've been instructed to offer you more resources in exchange for your word that the violence stops.
0TO0004426	I apologize for their rudeness. The NCR wants peace in Freeside, and offers additional supplies.
0TO0004427	Don't take that tone with me. These soldiers would wipe the floor with your men.
0TO0004428	<Lie> No, I haven't.
0TO0004429	<Lie> Sure, what about the place?
0TO0004431	Can you tell me about Mr. House?
0TO0004433	What kind of robots are you?
0TO0004434	You look different somehow. Did you cut your hair?
0TO0004435	What's with the snowglobe collection?
0TO0004436	I've got a snowglobe for Mr. House's collection.
0TO0004437	I've got some snowglobes for Mr. House's collection.
0TO0004440	I know you feel safe here, but I could crush your windpipe before anyone noticed.
0TO0004441	I bet I could beat you up.
0TO0004444	Sounds like you're pretty fond of him.
0TO0004445	I didn't realize robots could have such strong feelings about people.
0TO0004447	So you're... a copy of a dead woman? What exactly do you do for Mr. House?
0TO0004448	I really don't want to think about that.
0TO0004449	Tell me about the Three Families.
0TO0004450	Tell me about the casinos.
0TO0004451	Tell me about the other attractions.
0TO0004452	What kind of upgrades?
0TO0004453	I'd like to talk about something else.
0TO0004455	Yeah, it looks great.
0TO0004456	It's not exactly what I would have bought for myself.
0TO0004457	You look like an idiot.
0TO0004458	Probably a weapon, given how dangerous it is around here.
0TO0004459	I'd have saved the money, so I could someday get the hell out of here.
0TO0004460	I'd have given the money away.
0TO0004461	I'm planning on playing some games in the Casino.
0TO0004464	Betsy, I need to go on by myself. Are you going to be okay, girl?
0TO0004465	C'mon, girl. Let's get going.
0TO0004466	Why don't you just shoot your way out of here?
0TO0004467	Only all the time.
0TO0004469	Here's the caps.
0TO0004471	That's right. I've battled giant mutated animals, crazed raiders, and braved many other dangers.
0TO0004472	You don't need toys, I bet you can get a fun game of Boomers and targets.
0TO0004473	I'm a vicious velociraptor. ROAR!
0TO0004474	I bet when you get bigger you'll be able to fly your own plane.
0TO0004475	I have no money for your toll, surely you will let a fair traveller pass through your gate.
0TO0004476	<Mock Surrender> Woah, no way I'm fighting with the mighty Red-Brick.
0TO0004477	Oh mighty Fantoma, I hope one day I can fight for the forces of good by your side!
0TO0004479	How did you end up joining the Legion?
0TO0004483	Why did Antony take him away?
0TO0004485	Tell Caesar I accept his invitation.
0TO0004486	What are the Frumentarii?
0TO0004487	The Fruit who?
0TO0004488	I'll let you in, later, when you're ready for a night to remember.
0TO0004489	Yeah, pass by my room and we'll catch up.
0TO0004490	I'm looking for Carlitos. Do you know him?
0TO0004494	You know Doc Mitchell?
0TO0004497	Do you get a lot of business here?
0TO0004498	Get my room keys, and pass by later. I've got something for you.
0TO0004500	I need a room.
0TO0004501	What's a Securitron doing here?
0TO0004505	I don't have enough for a room.
0TO0004507	Why do you say that Vault 21 has come a long way?
0TO0004509	Do you know Doc Mitchell?
0TO0004510	Is this change behind your loss of inspiration?
0TO0004511	What about you?
0TO0004513	What about Gloria?
0TO0004516	What if I helped you escape?
0TO0004517	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need to escape.
0TO0004518	If I help you escape, what will you do next?
0TO0004519	Keep dreaming.
0TO0004520	You're not getting out of that cage.
0TO0004523	About helping you escape...
0TO0004524	Here's the Stealth Boy and Bobby Pin you need.
0TO0004528	We talked about how you might sneak out of here...
0TO0004529	How about I untie you?
0TO0004530	Okay, let's do it.
0TO0004531	Actually... I'd rather kill you now.
0TO0004532	Here, I'll set you free. <Untie Benny.>
0TO0004533	I'm leaving you here.
0TO0004534	I don't know how to open this cage...
0TO0004535	What happens if I let you go?
0TO0004536	You're next. Say your prayers.
0TO0004537	Time to die.
0TO0004538	Goodbye, Benny.
0TO0004539	About setting you free...
0TO0004540	How about I bust you out?
0TO0004541	All right, get ready.
0TO0004543	I'm sure you have all the good dirt on what goes on around here.
0TO0004545	Don't worry about me, I can keep your secrets.
0TO0004546	A little gossip never hurt anyone.
0TO0004548	Beautiful, I would love to help you loosen those lips.
0TO0004549	What can you tell me about what's going on around the Strip?
0TO0004550	What can you tell me about what's going on in Gomorrah?
0TO0004551	I'm calling in for an outstanding balance for some information. Tell me what the Omertas are up to.
0TO0004553	Can you help me find someone?
0TO0004554	I'm looking for Cachino.
0TO0004555	Can you tell me where Troike is?
0TO0004556	Do you know someone named Clanden?
0TO0004557	Where can I find the management?
0TO0004558	I need to know who to talk to about what's been going on in Gomorrah.
0TO0004559	Tell me what the Family is up to.
0TO0004565	I got better.
0TO0004566	Well, I'm not, and I believe you have something of mine.
0TO0004567	I want some more answers.
0TO0004568	What can you tell me about Benny?
0TO0004570	Any chance you're willing to surrender?
0TO0004571	What do you know about the Platinum Chip?
0TO0004572	I'm willing to hear other suggestions.
0TO0004573	Why did Benny betray you?
0TO0004575	Free the hostages now, and I'll have the NCR escort you out of their territory.
0TO0004576	If you let the hostages free now, maybe the NCR would just let you go.
0TO0004577	I'm a ghost, here to haunt you. Oooooh...
0TO0004578	How much money would it take for you to look the other way while the Great Khans left?
0TO0004579	Look at it this way - nobody dies.
0TO0004580	Yes or no, that's all I want to hear.
0TO0004581	Never mind. Forget I said anything.
0TO0004582	Done. Here's the caps.
0TO0004583	I'll be back with the caps.
0TO0004585	400 caps is a less suspicious amount. You have enough trouble here as it is.
0TO0004586	Way too much. Bring that price down and I'll consider it.
0TO0004587	I'll consider your offer.
0TO0004590	I don't have the caps with me right now.
0TO0004591	About that bribe...
0TO0004592	If you have any integrity, then you'll honor the deal.
0TO0004593	The Great Khans were nice. You have to be nice, too.
0TO0004594	Forget what I said. Kill them all.
0TO0004595	More complications. Just what I needed.
0TO0004596	Moore sent me to talk to you about the Omertas.
0TO0004600	So, you're a Ranger?
0TO0004602	Are there a lot of Rangers in the Mojave?
0TO0004603	How does someone become a Ranger?
0TO0004605	I had some questions.
0TO0004607	I bear the Mark of Caesar.
0TO0004608	Easy, I'm a friend of the Legion.
0TO0004609	You just messed with the wrong guy. <Attack.>
0TO0004610	You just messed with the wrong gal. <Attack.>
0TO0004611	I came seeking yours, skirt boy. <Attack.>
0TO0004613	Yes, I'll go before your Decanus.
0TO0004614	What's a Decanus?
0TO0004615	Not without out fight. <Attack.>
0TO0004616	Good thing you're wearing a skirt, makes pissing yourself go easier. <Attack.>
0TO0004618	Sure, okay, I'm out of here.
0TO0004619	Fuck off, creep, I'm not going anywhere.
0TO0004620	Try to throw me out and you'll be leaving - in pieces.
0TO0004623	I'm gone, then. Thanks for all the money.
0TO0004624	Nevermind, I'll be back.
0TO0004625	Any interesting places around here?
0TO0004627	Mr. House sent me to infiltrate your camp.
0TO0004628	You guaranteed my safety.
0TO0004629	You're in possession of something that interests me.
0TO0004630	I need to get that Platinum Chip back.
0TO0004631	I had to see the Mighty Caesar with my own eyes.
0TO0004632	Death to tyrants! <Start combat.>
0TO0004633	That I'd decorate this tent with your guts.
0TO0004636	How do you know so much about me?
0TO0004637	What's on the other side of those doors?
0TO0004638	How may I serve your Legion, Caesar?
0TO0004639	Just let me deal with Benny and I'll be on my way.
0TO0004640	What were you looking to start?
0TO0004641	Just give me back the Platinum Chip and I'll be on my way.
0TO0004642	What do I have to do?
0TO0004643	Can't your Legionaries take care of this?
0TO0004644	Maybe Benny could do this for you.
0TO0004645	You should use Mr. House's technology to attack the dam.
0TO0004646	Tell me about the Boomers.
0TO0004647	Don't you know anything about their society?
0TO0004648	What do you think of the Brotherhood of Steel?
0TO0004649	Couldn't you use the Brotherhood to your advantage?
0TO0004650	What's your opinion of President Kimball?
0TO0004651	Isn't it natural for someone like Kimball to seek greater power?
0TO0004652	How will the NCR react to Kimball's death? Won't it just anger them?
0TO0004653	I've heard rumors of your legate, Lanius. What's his story?
0TO0004654	What happened when Lanius attacked his own tribe?
0TO0004655	He sounds more like a savage than a general.
0TO0004656	What is "decimatio?"
0TO0004657	Lanius will lead the assault on Hoover Dam?
0TO0004658	Why did the Legion lose the first battle?
0TO0004659	I've heard the commander of the first battle called "The Burned Man."
0TO0004660	Tell me about Vulpes Inculta.
0TO0004661	What do the Frumentarii do?
0TO0004662	Are your bodyguards special in any way?
0TO0004663	How long has Lucius been the head of your Praetorians?
0TO0004664	What should I expect at the dam?
0TO0004669	Why must Mr. House be killed?
0TO0004670	I'm done working for you.
0TO0004671	I killed the Omertas who were scheming to attack the Strip.
0TO0004672	I may have disrupted plans to recruit the Great Khans to your cause.
0TO0004673	The Legionaries at Nelson attacked me, so I had to fight back...
0TO0004674	I defused the bomb on the monorail.
0TO0004675	I've committed no other crimes.
0TO0004676	I apologize for my failure, mighty Caesar. It will not happen again.
0TO0004677	That's enough questions for now.
0TO0004678	I won't fight for the Legion.
0TO0004684	What are you saying I have to do?
0TO0004691	1 chip for 1 cap.
0TO0004692	5 chips for 5 caps.
0TO0004693	20 chips for 20 caps.
0TO0004694	100 chips for 100 caps.
0TO0004695	500 chips for 500 caps.
0TO0004696	1000 chips for 1000 caps.
0TO0004698	The NCR is letting the Legion get away with slavery?
0TO0004699	Does the Legion know you're watching them from here?
0TO0004700	Why do you need reinforcements?
0TO0004701	Has there been much fighting around here?
0TO0004704	Fine. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0004706	If you don't tell me, someone else will. I'd rather hear your version.
0TO0004707	You sure? I'd love to hear that story.
0TO0004708	You were too tough to kill, and you'll get payback on the Legion some day.
0TO0004709	Interesting. Let's move on to something else.
0TO0004710	Pathetic. The Rangers should never have let you become one in the first place.
0TO0004713	WoooooOOOOOOoooooo
0TO0004719	Get out biatch.
0TO0004759	I saw you stealing Dr. Richard's medical supplies.
0TO0004760	I could ask you the same thing.
0TO0004761	I'm just enjoying a late night stroll.
0TO0004762	Sneaking around at night is a little suspicious.
0TO0004763	You aren't feral, are you?
0TO0004765	Can you tell me anything about Camp Searchlight?
0TO0004766	I see you're wearing an NCR dog tag.
0TO0004767	Have you heard anything unusual about any of the other Ranger stations?
0TO0004768	Forget about it. It's over.
0TO0004770	It was the, uh... the shifty eyes. Yeah. Dead give-away.
0TO0004771	Sure, off to the dam I go.
0TO0004774	Like I said, I'll think about it.
0TO0004776	Whatever happens, happens.
0TO0004778	Vouche for me? How?
0TO0004779	Let me ask some questions.
0TO0004780	I think I'll sit this one out.
0TO0004781	Seriously, I'm not interested.
0TO0004784	Tell me again what you want me to do?
0TO0004791	Tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel.
0TO0004792	What's their purpose?
0TO0004793	How did you get to be a member?
0TO0004794	What do you do for them?
0TO0004795	Do you like being a member?
0TO0004796	What's the Codex?
0TO0004797	Does the Brotherhood protect people from raiders or other threats?
0TO0004798	How do you feel about the other members?
0TO0004799	Who is Father Elijah?
0TO0004800	How can I best use your skills?
0TO0004801	I had another question.
0TO0004802	I wanted to talk about the technology we're looking for.
0TO0004804	I haven't seen him.
0TO0004805	Maybe he's down in the barracks.
0TO0004806	He probably ditched you for someone cuter.
0TO0004807	What were you doing in prison?
0TO0004808	Tell me about the prison break.
0TO0004816	How could Reyes have been wrong?
0TO0004820	Why don't you use your radio to fix your supply situation?
0TO0004821	How are your water supplies right now?
0TO0004822	Since you have extra, could I have some of that ammo?
0TO0004824	What makes you think you can trust me with security codes?
0TO0004825	I'll help. Tell me what I need to do.
0TO0004826	I'll investigate and let you know what I find out about those odd reports.
0TO0004827	I don't have time to do this right now.
0TO0004828	The Rangers' versions of the reports they sent to Camp Golf don't match what you received.
0TO0004829	Do you know anything about some NCR supplies?
0TO0004832	What are you going to do about it?
0TO0004834	Let's see who's pathetic.
0TO0004835	All right, here you go.
0TO0004836	[Sneak] Sure, take whatever you can find. <Holdout>
0TO0004837	Forget it, I don't need to gamble that bad.
0TO0004838	I'm going in - touch my weapons, I'll kill you.
0TO0004839	Easy to hide weapons?
0TO0004840	Why would I need to hide a weapon on me?
0TO0004841	Let's see what you have.
0TO0004842	Not interested. Maybe some other time.
0TO0004847	I can get weapons past the guards, no problem.
0TO0004848	Hmmm... think I could I slip bigger weapons past the guards?
0TO0004849	I had some questions about bottle cap currency.
0TO0004850	Let's talk about something else now.
0TO0004851	Why is a bottle cap press a problem for you?
0TO0004852	Are new bottle caps ever made?
0TO0004853	What makes a bottle cap genuine?
0TO0004856	Be calm. I am a friend of the Legion.
0TO0004857	You haven't asked what became of Benny.
0TO0004859	What was that you said about security systems?
0TO0004860	Who are you to tell me what to do?
0TO0004869	I'll go get the Platinum Chip.
0TO0004871	I'd like to ask some questions first...
0TO0004872	Where do you think Benny's gone?
0TO0004873	He set me up for an ambush!
0TO0004874	Were you aware that he hijacked a Securitron and used it to infiltrate your network?
0TO0004875	Not interested. Good luck getting the Chip back.
0TO0004876	What do I do next?
0TO0004877	What about Benny?
0TO0004881	I'll go back and do as you ask.
0TO0004882	What's in it for me to go back to the Fort?
0TO0004883	What will I find at Caesar's camp?
0TO0004887	I worked out a deal where the Brotherhood will help the NCR defend the dam.
0TO0004893	The Boomers sound dangerous.
0TO0004894	You recruited the Omertas as one of the Three Families?
0TO0004895	What were the original names of the other tribes?
0TO0004897	Why do you hate the Brotherhood so much?
0TO0004898	That's enough about the Boomers.
0TO0004899	Why do you care whether Kimball lives or dies?
0TO0004900	So why don't you want the NCR President to die?
0TO0004901	And if Kimball were to be assassinated?
0TO0004903	Any speculation on Legion tactics?
0TO0004905	How will the NCR defend Hoover Dam?
0TO0004906	What's your battle plan for the Dam?
0TO0004907	I'd like to ask some questions first.
0TO0004908	What's next in line?
0TO0004909	I need to ask some questions.
0TO0004912	I want to ask you some questions.
0TO0004914	That's enough about the Brotherhood.
0TO0004915	What is it that you really want?
0TO0004916	I don't need it. Keep your money.
0TO0004917	After all I've done, 200 caps won't do.
0TO0004918	Having your daughter back should be worth more than 200 caps.
0TO0004919	<Attack> I'll take the money from Crimson Caravan as well.
0TO0004921	Sooner or later she'd have left anyway.
0TO0004922	[Attack] Give me the Crimson Caravan money, now.
0TO0004923	You're alive thanks to me. I expect my reward.
0TO0004925	Actually, just keep it.
0TO0004926	For a job well done... 200 caps.
0TO0004928	I don't need it. Keep it.
0TO0004929	500 caps sounds right.
0TO0004935	The rangefinder might be a problem. I reactivated HELIOS One, and it's not powering a weapon.
0TO0004936	There's a corpse nearby. Anybody been near it?
0TO0004937	Give me that gun.
0TO0004938	I'm a space soldier. The general sent me to ask you to borrow your gun to stop an alien invasion.
0TO0004939	You look tired. Maybe you should take a break.
0TO0004940	Can I buy that gun from you?
0TO0004941	It's worth 1000 caps to me.
0TO0004942	Yeah, but your heavy use has really depreciated its value. It's only worth twenty caps now.
0TO0004943	I don't have it here. I'll have to go get it.
0TO0004944	It's invisible.
0TO0004945	I don't think I can come up with that kind of cash.
0TO0004946	What if I give you twenty caps? That's... uh... way more than a million!
0TO0004947	I'm looking for someone carrying an antique gun.
0TO0004948	Hey. You see weird gun? ("Pardon, but have you seen any pre-war firearm antiquities of late?")
0TO0004949	These ten caps are yours if you point me to anyone you've seen with a weird old gun.
0TO0004950	I would bribe you but I don't have much on me. Would you accept an IOU?
0TO0004951	Two choices. You point me to any odd guns you've seen lately, or I paint the curb with your brains.
0TO0004952	Why do you call this place your baby?
0TO0004954	What do you think of Fantastic?
0TO0004955	Tell me about the last battle.
0TO0004958	How is the dam running these days?
0TO0004959	What is wrong with the other turbines?
0TO0004961	Flipping switches is fun.
0TO0004962	Could you remind me where I should look for supplies?
0TO0004965	<Pay 50 caps>
0TO0004966	<Pay 45 caps>
0TO0004967	<Pay 40 caps>
0TO0004968	You might want to ask Contreras at Camp McCarran that question.
0TO0004969	<Draw weapon> Well, you're never going to find out.
0TO0004970	He gave me a package to deliver and now he asked me to kill you.
0TO0004971	If Contreras is a scumbag, I want him caught.
0TO0004973	What will happen to him if he's guilty?
0TO0004974	There's only one solution: I'm going to take him out.
0TO0004975	Can I ask you something else?
0TO0004984	Hang on, I gotta take care of something first.
0TO0004988	Maybe I can help?
0TO0004992	Some caps would be nice.
0TO0004993	How about a little pick-me-up?
0TO0004994	No charge, just helping out.
0TO0004995	It won't be a problem. She's leaving.
0TO0004996	Won't stand for what? She plans to respect the Elder's decision.
0TO0004997	You don't have a say. Go back in your cave.
0TO0004998	Ideals are strengthened by the challenges they endure. Veronica's questioning did you a service.
0TO0004999	Uh... Veronica just said those things to test you. She didn't mean it.
0TO0005000	This isn't your place. You're neither Head Scribe nor Elder.
0TO0005001	I will cast down your Codex and bask in the dying agony of those who hold it dear.
0TO0005002	I don't get what the big deal is.
0TO0005003	Fine. Let's go.
0TO0005004	I should be going now...
0TO0005005	You may not know me, but I'm no friend of the Legion, and I'll lend a hand to get rid of them.
0TO0005006	Come on. Let me help out. Trust me.
0TO0005007	Okay. I'm in.
0TO0005008	I don't think I can help you. Sorry.
0TO0005010	Are there any towns nearby?
0TO0005011	Are you in charge here?
0TO0005012	Is there anything I can do to help around here?
0TO0005013	You sure you don't want my help with the Legion?
0TO0005014	I changed my mind about helping you with your Legion problem. I'm in.
0TO0005015	I'd really like to help. And what's the worst that could happen, Nelson stays captured?
0TO0005016	Because no one else is going to help you.
0TO0005020	Where can I find Jason?
0TO0005021	Nevermind, I'll go looking for your components.
0TO0005022	Can the launch wait a few minutes?
0TO0005023	Where would you suggest I find meat in the amount you'd need here?
0TO0005028	I don't need any compensation.
0TO0005030	That's not necessary.
0TO0005046	Are there any other survivors?
0TO0005066	Don't you have the authority to command the troopers to go into the camp?
0TO0005067	Why take out the hostages?
0TO0005068	[Psycho] Funny you should mention Psycho. I actually have a few dozen doses on me...
0TO0005069	Sign me up.
0TO0005072	Why don't you try to rescue them?
0TO0005073	I won't do anything dishonorable, if that's what you mean.
0TO0005074	Are you interested in cracking jokes or getting something done?
0TO0005075	I can... do bad things.
0TO0005076	Like I care what anyone says about me. Do you want help dealing with the Legion or not?
0TO0005077	You're an idiot if you believe everything you hear. You want my help or what?
0TO0005082	Are you really going to ruin what's supposed to be a time of happiness for her?
0TO0005083	Oh, come on. She's in love. Give her a break.
0TO0005085	Opening up trade with the Boomers would be easier with Janet in their camp, wouldn't you agree?
0TO0005086	Janet's wages can't be that much. Why bother keeping them from her?
0TO0005087	I need to consider your offer.
0TO0005089	Are work contracts common for the Crimson Caravan Company?
0TO0005090	That's all I wanted to know. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0005091	What kind of upkeep expenses?
0TO0005092	Are work contracts legal?
0TO0005093	It seems like that the companies are getting the better deal.
0TO0005096	Is there something special about these supplies?
0TO0005097	Combining those with chemical cleaners would yield strong chems...
0TO0005098	Some of those could be combined with other chemicals to make drugs...
0TO0005099	No reason. Just curious.
0TO0005101	McCarran has plenty of caps to cover the shipment. They'll deal with the cost.
0TO0005103	Give them a deal on the price, you'll have the upper hand in future, more important negotiations.
0TO0005104	It's the NCR military. You can give them a deal, right?
0TO0005106	McCarran is overstocked with water and fresh vegetables. Arrange for a two for one trade.
0TO0005107	What's the problem? They have vegetables - trade them for that.
0TO0005108	That's all. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0005109	Where does the Crimson Caravan Company get its merchandise?
0TO0005110	Do your caravans ever have trouble from bandits?
0TO0005112	The name's [%].
0TO0005113	Sounds rough. I'll be heading out now...
0TO0005115	You've got five seconds to get out of my sight before I shove that rifle where the sun don't shine.
0TO0005116	I think it's time to knock you down a peg or two, ranger.
0TO0005118	Sure, let's play Caravan.
0TO0005120	Okay, fix me. Here's 100 caps.
0TO0005121	Sorry, I don't have 100 caps.
0TO0005123	Okay, fix me. Here's 75 caps.
0TO0005124	Sorry, I don't have 75 caps.
0TO0005129	So you work for the Gun Runners?
0TO0005130	Who are the Gun Runners?
0TO0005132	Arrange a temporary supply deal with other merchants. It'll still lead to a profit for you.
0TO0005133	Just buy the supplies from the other merchants around here. Easy enough.
0TO0005135	Gun Runners are skilled enough to refurbish weapons like new, right? You're overthinking this.
0TO0005136	Just give McCarran some used weapons. I mean, as long as they work, right?
0TO0005138	Maybe I could help you out with those supplies.
0TO0005139	Any chance I could get a tour of the Gun Runner factory?
0TO0005140	Tin cans.
0TO0005141	Scrap metal.
0TO0005142	Irons.
0TO0005143	Pressure cookers.
0TO0005144	Metal cooking pans.
0TO0005145	Coffee pots.
0TO0005146	Hot plates.
0TO0005147	Metal cooking pots.
0TO0005148	Pots.
0TO0005150	Who's in charge of the Gun Runners?
0TO0005151	You just shot that man, solely because he insulted you!
0TO0005152	That might have been a tad... excessive.
0TO0005153	Just the matter of my extra pay.
0TO0005155	I'm looking for work.
0TO0005156	I'll take it. What do I need to do?
0TO0005157	Actually, I don't have time for this right now.
0TO0005158	What other work do you have available?
0TO0005159	I'd like to know more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
0TO0005160	How long have you been in business?
0TO0005161	Does the Crimson Caravan have any competition?
0TO0005162	You're well-dressed for this place.
0TO0005163	I don't have any more questions. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0005164	Tell me about the negotiation.
0TO0005165	I want to know more about the problem with Henry Jamison.
0TO0005166	What's the Gun Runner job about?
0TO0005168	I'm here to talk about ending your employment with the Crimson Caravan Company.
0TO0005172	The better deal would be for me to walk away and let the Omertas handle you.
0TO0005173	What? No way. Pay off the Omertas, sure, but you don't get a single cap more.
0TO0005175	Fine. I'll let McLafferty know we've struck a deal.
0TO0005176	What brought you to New Vegas?
0TO0005177	I don't have the caps right now.
0TO0005181	Can you make me luckier?
0TO0005195	Are you one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0005196	Can I make a donation to the Followers?
0TO0005197	What do the Followers believe in?
0TO0005198	Are the Followers part of the NCR?
0TO0005199	Do the Followers have a headquarters around here?
0TO0005200	Here's 500 caps.
0TO0005209	I want to know more about you, Mr. House.
0TO0005210	What was Vegas like before the war?
0TO0005211	You say that you saved Las Vegas. How?
0TO0005212	What preparations did you make to save Las Vegas?
0TO0005213	Why didn't the Platinum Chip arrive on time?
0TO0005214	How did you nearly die, defending Vegas?
0TO0005215	Who do you think will win - the NCR or Caesar's Legion?
0TO0005220	What killed the other troopers?
0TO0005221	That's exactly why I'm here, General Oliver.
0TO0005222	This doesn't have to end in bloodshed, general.
0TO0005223	Then I guess I'd better kill you before that happens.
0TO0005224	There won't be any reinforcements. The Legion has blocked the road west.
0TO0005225	The Legion has more men on their way as well.
0TO0005226	There's still time. You could escape. I won't stop you.
0TO0005227	Then let's stop wasting time, shall we?
0TO0005228	To what end? You delay the inevitable.
0TO0005229	You're right. I guess you're screwed.
0TO0005231	I'm betting a man as smart as you wouldn't leave himself without at least one contingency.
0TO0005232	You could head down the river, take a boat or something.
0TO0005233	Very clever, general. But I already know you have an escape route.
0TO0005234	And what about your duty to your men?
0TO0005235	Then let's fight already.
0TO0005236	Dying won't accomplish anything.
0TO0005237	Then I guess we fight.
0TO0005239	The dam is already lost, general. Your responsibility now is to get your men out of here alive.
0TO0005240	Is this dam really that important? Really?
0TO0005241	Then choose, general. Leave now and your men will live. Stay, and you all die.
0TO0005243	What kind of collar?
0TO0005244	Did you happen to find out where he was from?
0TO0005245	What'd you tell him?
0TO0005246	What did he look like?
0TO0005253	There's still some fighting back there.
0TO0005254	The area is secure.
0TO0005255	How did you get here ahead of me?
0TO0005257	I'll make my way across somehow.
0TO0005258	Just make sure your men don't get in my way.
0TO0005259	I found this syringe on Private Stone.
0TO0005260	It's better if you turn yourself in rather than me turning you in.
0TO0005264	How did the Legion get into the camp?
0TO0005266	How did you survive the attack?
0TO0005268	I have to think about this first.
0TO0005269	Can I ask you something else first?
0TO0005270	Alright, I'll do it.
0TO0005271	Sorry, I can't help you right now.
0TO0005274	Actually, let me ask you something else first.
0TO0005275	Nope, I'm getting out of here.
0TO0005276	Sorry, my mistake, I'm still in.
0TO0005277	Not yet, but I had more questions.
0TO0005278	I'm afraid he's dead.
0TO0005279	<Truth> I killed him.
0TO0005280	<Lie> The Legion caught him and crucified him. He was dead when I found him.
0TO0005281	The Legion caught him and crucified him. I was just trying to end his pain.
0TO0005282	I didn't know he worked for you.
0TO0005283	It was fun. He made a noise like a deflating balloon.
0TO0005284	What do you think about the Khans' alliance with Caesar?
0TO0005286	Can you tell me about the Great Khans?
0TO0005287	I'd like to hear some of your poetry.
0TO0005288	It sounded like you were writing poetry.
0TO0005289	You don't sound too eager for your initiation.
0TO0005290	I had some other questions, actually.
0TO0005291	Why isn't poetry "Great Khan-like?"
0TO0005292	I could ask them for you.
0TO0005293	Why don't you go there and find out?
0TO0005294	Probably. You seem like their type.
0TO0005295	That's not really my problem, is it?
0TO0005296	What do you know about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0005298	How does the initiation work?
0TO0005299	What does it take to join the Great Khans?
0TO0005301	I met a kid who's unsatisfied with life in the Great Khans. Will you take him on as a Follower?
0TO0005302	Well, he's a poet. Kind of.
0TO0005303	He's obviously a bright, sensitive soul, and he loves literature.
0TO0005304	None whatsoever.
0TO0005305	The Followers have agreed to take you on as a member. Head to the Old Mormon Fort.
0TO0005307	Boost my charisma.
0TO0005308	Got anything to make people like me better?
0TO0005309	I'm interested in the sub-dermal implant.
0TO0005310	Sub-what now? I'm interested in that.
0TO0005311	I'd like the regenerating ability.
0TO0005317	What makes you think Caesar gave me the Chip?
0TO0005318	You wanted me to come down here?
0TO0005319	Who are you, exactly?
0TO0005320	Why did you send me here?
0TO0005323	Caesar wants me to destroy this place.
0TO0005325	Maybe I should destroy everything down here.
0TO0005327	This work sounds important - and expensive.
0TO0005328	I could use a raise!
0TO0005329	I'll upload the data, as you ask.
0TO0005330	We'll see what happens.
0TO0005331	Caesar will kill me unless he believes I blew something up down here.
0TO0005332	The Legion took it from me at the Fort.
0TO0005333	<Lie> I'm not sure what happened to it.
0TO0005334	I'll do as you say.
0TO0005335	You're asking me to commit suicide. The Legion will attack me on sight.
0TO0005336	What are you asking me to do?
0TO0005337	Who are you exactly?
0TO0005341	What did you say this place was, again?
0TO0005343	Goodbye means goodbye.
0TO0005346	What will you do with your Securitrons?
0TO0005348	I'm going to do as Caesar asks and blow everything up down here.
0TO0005350	Nope, I'm going to blow it all up anyways.
0TO0005352	What if I destroy all three?
0TO0005353	There was never any chance. His mind was made up from the start.
0TO0005354	Maybe if we make a stronger case, he'll change his mind.
0TO0005355	You just weren't very persuasive.
0TO0005356	Would someone else listen to you?
0TO0005358	You should take over.
0TO0005359	This is your home, and these are your friends. You should stay.
0TO0005360	Leaving now is your only shot at a future.
0TO0005361	You're the only one who can make this decision.
0TO0005362	My friend is part of a group that can develop it into something safe everyone can benefit from.
0TO0005363	What's this about?
0TO0005364	Okay, I'll go visit him as soon as I can.
0TO0005365	Forget it, I'm not interested.
0TO0005366	What alliance?
0TO0005367	What's your role in Caesar's Legion?
0TO0005368	What does the Legion want with the Great Khans?
0TO0005370	This is a great honor. I don't know what to say.
0TO0005371	Maybe you could give me the short version.
0TO0005372	On second thought, let's talk about something else.
0TO0005373	How did the Three Families defeat you?
0TO0005374	What happened at Bitter Springs?
0TO0005375	That doesn't sound like something the NCR would order.
0TO0005377	I don't want that kind of responsibility.
0TO0005378	What did you mean about Papa's hatred poisoning his mind?
0TO0005379	Tell me about Bitter Springs.
0TO0005380	Never mind, I have other questions.
0TO0005381	What kind of doubts?
0TO0005382	We fight for Caesar.
0TO0005383	We fight for the NCR.
0TO0005384	I'm giving leadership to you. I want you to take the tribe north, and find yourselves a new life.
0TO0005385	We fight for ourselves. Bring our warriors to the battle and kill everyone.
0TO0005391	What do you think about Caesar?
0TO0005400	Transplant Rey's brain into Rex.
0TO0005401	Transplant Lupa's brain into Rex.
0TO0005402	Transplant Violetta's brain into Rex.
0TO0005406	Whose idea was it to use the kid?
0TO0005407	What went down with Anderson and Corporal White?
0TO0005409	I'm going to have a chat with Anderson. Don't worry.
0TO0005410	[Say nothing.]
0TO0005411	Hope you're not too attached to this place.
0TO0005415	Why are things so tough?
0TO0005417	So you're drug dealers?
0TO0005418	Who do you sell to?
0TO0005419	Good to know. I had some other questions.
0TO0005420	Okay then, what do you make?
0TO0005421	What's "the magic?"
0TO0005423	You're drug dealers?
0TO0005424	How'd you get into this business?
0TO0005425	Who's Diane?
0TO0005426	Who's Jerry?
0TO0005427	Good to know. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0005428	I've come with an offer of alliance from the Powder Gangers at Vault 19.
0TO0005430	Maybe that's why I broke into the weapons locker.
0TO0005431	Guess who broke into the confiscated weapons locker?
0TO0005432	What's the alternative?
0TO0005433	Oh, there's a need for violence. <Attack Benny.>
0TO0005436	I'd like to have greater strength.
0TO0005437	I'd like to have more muscles.
0TO0005438	Make me more perceptive.
0TO0005439	Make me see better.
0TO0005440	Increase my endurance.
0TO0005441	Can you make me tougher?
0TO0005442	I want to be more intelligent.
0TO0005443	I want to be smarter.
0TO0005444	Enhance my agility.
0TO0005445	Do you have something to make me quicker?
0TO0005447	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, thanks to the Chip.
0TO0005448	What is it?
0TO0005449	Not now.
0TO0005450	What did you want to talk about earlier?
0TO0005451	I'll take you back there, first chance I get.
0TO0005452	Can it wait?
0TO0005453	Why don't you just go back on your own?
0TO0005454	That's just not important right now.
0TO0005455	I'm ready to take you to Hidden Valley.
0TO0005456	All right, I'll go.
0TO0005457	I have things I need to do. You'd better go alone.
0TO0005458	What now?
0TO0005459	You think the Elder will listen at all?
0TO0005460	What could we bring to him that would change his mind?
0TO0005461	So what is it you're trying to accomplish?
0TO0005462	How would you propose to do that?
0TO0005463	Father Elijah?
0TO0005464	Tell me about the rangefinder.
0TO0005465	Let's head out.
0TO0005466	Good intentions don't justify marching the Brotherhood to its death.
0TO0005467	Have you considered that he might be right?
0TO0005468	What's a pulse gun?
0TO0005469	Farming technology?
0TO0005470	Let's pursue the pulse gun.
0TO0005471	The rangefinder sounds promising.
0TO0005472	We should go after the vegetation technology.
0TO0005473	Actually, the rangefinder might be a better idea.
0TO0005474	I changed my mind. Let's go after the farming tech.
0TO0005475	Maybe the pulse gun would be a smarter move.
0TO0005476	Let's go find it.
0TO0005477	The Powder Gangers have access to large quantities of explosives, which they'd be willing to share.
0TO0005478	Bombs. Lots of bombs.
0TO0005479	I found a Legion camp at Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0005480	Is there anything you need done?
0TO0005481	I already took care of the camp.
0TO0005482	I think I can handle that for you.
0TO0005483	Maybe later.
0TO0005484	I released some barrels of radioactive waste.
0TO0005485	I can help you with Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0005486	I have an update on Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0005487	[Give intel] I planted the bug in Cottonwood Cove's radio and found some intel.
0TO0005488	Is there anything else you need done?
0TO0005490	Consider it done.
0TO0005493	[Give Aurelius' old intel] I planted the bug and found some paperwork.
0TO0005494	Nothing new to report.
0TO0005498	I can clear out Cottonwood Cove for you.
0TO0005500	I'm looking for something that could inspire the Great Khans. Know of anything like that?
0TO0005501	Who is Ezekiel?
0TO0005502	Where can I find this Ezekiel?
0TO0005504	Julie Farkas said you might know something about the Great Khans.
0TO0005507	How have they been harassing the town?
0TO0005508	What are they doing to the town?
0TO0005509	You're sure these mercenaries work for the NCR?
0TO0005510	Why can't you just take them out?
0TO0005513	I'd rather not get involved.
0TO0005516	What do you want with Jacobstown?
0TO0005517	Who are you doing this for?
0TO0005518	I hear you're mercenaries. Will caps make you go away?
0TO0005519	I'm sure you two can settle this.
0TO0005522	Hey, you said you would help clear the caves.
0TO0005523	Well, have a safe trip.
0TO0005524	You said I could have your rifle before you go.
0TO0005525	Why the rush to leave? You said you would help clear the caves.
0TO0005528	It can't be as hard as all that. What needs to get done?
0TO0005529	Okay, let's get them out to the range.
0TO0005530	Never mind, I'll talk to the others about their ideas first.
0TO0005531	I'm sure. Let's do it.
0TO0005532	Human niceness?
0TO0005535	So you think I should find ways to convince the Misfits to get along?
0TO0005536	Okay, I'll try to convince them.
0TO0005537	On second thought, I'll ask around first.
0TO0005538	I'll do it. Work is overrated anyways.
0TO0005539	Maybe I'll ask around a little more instead.
0TO0005540	Angry... juice?
0TO0005541	Okay, tell me where to get it.
0TO0005542	I'm convinced this is a good idea, let's do it.
0TO0005543	On second thought, I'll talk to the others first.
0TO0005545	They have a point, it is their armor. You should give it back.
0TO0005546	You should listen to them. They have lasers, you know.
0TO0005547	I'll find you when you're done here.
0TO0005548	Would it be so bad to lend them the armor for the battle?
0TO0005550	What exactly are we looking for here?
0TO0005551	I found some NCR stuff.
0TO0005552	I think this is everything.
0TO0005553	Now what are we looking for?
0TO0005554	I found more NCR stuff.
0TO0005555	This is all I could find.
0TO0005556	This is fascinating. Please continue.
0TO0005557	Can I get the abridged version?
0TO0005558	I'd love to hear your dissertation, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.
0TO0005560	Razz wants the usual.
0TO0005561	Doctor Henry wants to know if you'll continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
0TO0005562	There's a risk that the mental damage will be permanent.
0TO0005563	You can always say no.
0TO0005564	All right, if you're sure. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0005565	Give me some time to figure things out and we'll try again.
0TO0005566	Don't worry, I'm not giving up. Let's try it again.
0TO0005568	Use neuro-peptide stimulators on a Nightstalker brain. Results should be similar to a live brain.
0TO0005569	You said Nightstalker brains were similar. What about just testing those?
0TO0005570	That doesn't sound so bad.
0TO0005571	It sounds like you're not happy being a Great Khan. Maybe you'd be happier someplace else.
0TO0005572	Maybe you should just ditch this place.
0TO0005573	Why don't you just cheat?
0TO0005574	Just wait here a minute, I'll be back with some Med-X.
0TO0005575	<Give Med-X> Painkillers like these, you mean?
0TO0005576	Well then, never mind.
0TO0005577	I'd like to join the Great Khans.
0TO0005578	No, tell me what I have to do.
0TO0005579	Run that by me again.
0TO0005580	I've got it. Let's do this.
0TO0005584	What is this all about?
0TO0005586	What opportunity is that?
0TO0005594	So where does this put the two of us?
0TO0005595	You cheating bastard.
0TO0005596	You're a dead man.
0TO0005597	Mr. House wants the Platinum Chip. Hand it over.
0TO0005598	<Kill Benny in his sleep.>
0TO0005600	All I am is a courier trying to fulfill my contract.
0TO0005601	But... I'm not mad. Really, I'm not mad!
0TO0005602	The least you could do is answer some questions first.
0TO0005604	I "dig your line." Let me live, you'll never see me again.
0TO0005605	My skull isn't thick to forgiveness! Um...
0TO0005606	<Go to sleep.>
0TO0005607	Call it luck and leave it at that.
0TO0005608	What is the Platinum Chip?
0TO0005609	What angle are you playing?
0TO0005610	Hand over the Platinum Chip, maybe you live.
0TO0005611	Your little ambush didn't go according to plan.
0TO0005612	I'm coming for you, Benny.
0TO0005613	Yeah, it's a real mess here - four bodies.
0TO0005614	You'll answer my questions now, not later.
0TO0005615	The jig's up, Benny. Me and Yes Man had a talk.
0TO0005616	It takes more than a couple bullets in the head to stop me.
0TO0005617	A Securitron dug me up and a doc in Goodsprings did the rest.
0TO0005618	I'm persistent, that's all.
0TO0005619	There's no need for violence.
0TO0005622	No deal. Time to die.
0TO0005623	Why would I trust you?
0TO0005624	All right, I'll meet you in the Presidential Suite.
0TO0005625	Hand over the Chip or else.
0TO0005632	Tell me about yourself, before it's too late.
0TO0005634	I haven't made up my mind.
0TO0005635	I was thinking I might hack you to death while you're still tied up.
0TO0005636	Crucifixion is an option.
0TO0005637	Maybe we should fight it out in the arena, fair and square.
0TO0005638	What if my choice is "none of the above?"
0TO0005639	Why shouldn't Mr. House run Vegas?
0TO0005640	Mr. House is already out of the picture.
0TO0005641	What's so bad about the NCR?
0TO0005642	You think Caesar would destroy the Strip?
0TO0005644	How long were you the head of the family?
0TO0005645	Was your tribe always called the Chairmen?
0TO0005646	How did Mr. House introduce himself?
0TO0005649	I'm going to hack you to death while you're tied up, helpless.
0TO0005650	You'll be crucified for my amusement.
0TO0005651	We'll fight in the arena, fair and square.
0TO0005652	I've decided to kill you here and now.
0TO0005653	It's going to hurt. A lot. <Final decision.>
0TO0005654	I could crucify you instead.
0TO0005655	Pass the time thinking over your mistakes. <Final decision.>
0TO0005656	Maybe I should hack you to death while you're bound helpless.
0TO0005657	Let's do it. <Final decision.>
0TO0005658	Sure, here it comes.
0TO0005659	Something bad could happen to you right here...
0TO0005660	Close your eyes, if you want.
0TO0005661	You were amazing.
0TO0005662	I didn't come here to reminisce.
0TO0005663	I didn't come here to remember that stuff.
0TO0005664	Sorry, Benny, didn't make much of an impression.
0TO0005665	It is pretty funny.
0TO0005666	I'll laugh later. We have business to discuss.
0TO0005667	You have no one to blame but yourself.
0TO0005668	Looks like you played past your abilities.
0TO0005669	He gave me the Platinum Chip.
0TO0005670	Caesar says I get to decide how you die.
0TO0005671	What happened after you fled the Tops?
0TO0005672	Tell me about the factions that want to rule Vegas.
0TO0005673	Who is everybody who wants to get Vegas?
0TO0005674	What do you think I should do with the Chip?
0TO0005676	I want to know more about you.
0TO0005680	I could have you brought before me hog-tied, then hack you to death.
0TO0005681	How do you feel about crucifixion?
0TO0005682	Maybe we should face each other in the arena, fair and square.
0TO0005684	There were hundreds of Securitrons down there - until I blew them up.
0TO0005685	Hundreds of Securitrons. All of them upgraded now, just like Mr. House wants.
0TO0005686	None of your business. It's time for you to die.
0TO0005687	I have to decide what happens to you now.
0TO0005688	On second thought, maybe I should fight you in the arena.
0TO0005689	Or I could kill you right now, while your hands are bound.
0TO0005690	Did you still want to help Doctor Henry run his experiment?
0TO0005691	Why Lily and not some other Nightkin?
0TO0005692	I'll talk to Lily, then.
0TO0005693	What are the risks of the experiment?
0TO0005694	Why is the Stealth Boy Mark II riskier?
0TO0005695	I need to think about this.
0TO0005705	I killed them all.
0TO0005706	They seemed all right.
0TO0005707	I'm reserving judgment.
0TO0005708	I don't care for them.
0TO0005709	I've heard they shoot lasers from their eyes.
0TO0005710	I don't really know anything about them.
0TO0005711	The Strip.
0TO0005712	Hoover Dam.
0TO0005713	I just kind of drift from place to place.
0TO0005715	I go where I'm needed.
0TO0005716	Going to see an old friend.
0TO0005717	You don't look like much. What do you bring to the table?
0TO0005718	Where are you hoping to go?
0TO0005719	Okay, let's travel together.
0TO0005720	I'd like to, but I can't take you with me right now.
0TO0005722	Don't you have a family to feed?
0TO0005723	I'm ready to travel with you.
0TO0005725	Actually, I'm more comfortable now that I know you've had some training.
0TO0005726	As long as you're honest with me from now on.
0TO0005727	Yes, but you're on a short leash.
0TO0005728	Absolutely not. You misled me on purpose.
0TO0005730	I have questions I wanted to ask you.
0TO0005731	Ever heard of Mr. House before?
0TO0005733	Ever hear of a guy called Benny?
0TO0005734	Know anything about New Vegas?
0TO0005736	Any thoughts about Caesar's Legion?
0TO0005739	Ok, I'll take care of him.
0TO0005740	Can you offer any additional support?
0TO0005741	The risk to Lily is too great. Don't keep running the test.
0TO0005742	I think Lily should continue to wear the Mark II prototype.
0TO0005743	What do you want to do?
0TO0005744	Let me think about this.
0TO0005745	What will happen to Lily?
0TO0005747	Tell me about Cooke.
0TO0005749	Got any work?
0TO0005751	How did you get out?
0TO0005755	Who is Samuel Cooke?
0TO0005757	Why were you in prison?
0TO0005758	Why do you want to surrender?
0TO0005759	Why don't you join the Great Khans?
0TO0005767	Goobye.
0TO0005771	I've come here looking for work.
0TO0005784	May I ask you some questions?
0TO0005786	You're doing the right thing.
0TO0005789	What if you joined the Great Khans?
0TO0005793	I took care of those geckos.
0TO0005795	What is this initiation?
0TO0005796	Would you mind if I borrowed him to check out the area?
0TO0005797	How do you get his coat so shiny?
0TO0005798	It's okay, I'm good with animals.
0TO0005799	Come on, it's just a dog.
0TO0005801	I have other questions.
0TO0005802	Thanks for letting me borrow your dog.
0TO0005803	Anything I can do to help around here?
0TO0005805	Goodsprings.
0TO0005806	The grave.
0TO0005807	I'm not entirely sure.
0TO0005809	You live in a hole in the ground?
0TO0005810	So you just leave your family in the bunker?
0TO0005812	I'd rather you didn't.
0TO0005813	Some other time, maybe.
0TO0005814	What did you want to ask me earlier?
0TO0005815	I met a group of them in a bunker west of here.
0TO0005816	They're usually harmless unless you use advanced technology around them.
0TO0005817	They're enemies of the NCR. If you know where they are you should turn them in.
0TO0005818	They've got the right idea.
0TO0005819	I know who they are but I don't care about their agenda.
0TO0005820	Yeah. I know to shoot them on sight.
0TO0005821	Not really.
0TO0005822	Why can't you do it?
0TO0005824	Why would you want to do that?
0TO0005828	Why do you want to seal off the sulfur?
0TO0005830	Why can't you seal off the sulfur yourself?
0TO0005837	I'm working on it, but I had some questions.
0TO0005839	The Khans will accept you as long as you pass the initiation rite.
0TO0005840	I'm still working on it.  May I ask you some questions?
0TO0005845	Have you considered joining the Great Khans?
0TO0005847	You're right, it is.
0TO0005848	Sure, I'll go talk to them.
0TO0005853	May I ask you a few questions first?
0TO0005856	Do you know anything about this vault?
0TO0005858	Tell me about NCR.
0TO0005860	Tell me about Lem.
0TO0005861	Who's Lem?
0TO0005862	How did you end up in prison?
0TO0005864	Why do you hate the NCR?
0TO0005865	Why did you kill Lem?
0TO0005867	What do you want the sulfur for?
0TO0005870	Why do you want to join the Great Khans?
0TO0005881	What do you need the sulfur for?
0TO0005882	So, what brought you to this place?
0TO0005883	Tell me about the area outside the vault.
0TO0005890	Tell me about the Fiends.
0TO0005891	Tell me about Quarry Junction.
0TO0005892	Tell me about McCarran.
0TO0005893	Tell me about the Great Khans.
0TO0005894	Why's the area so dangerous?
0TO0005895	Tell me about the super mutants.
0TO0005896	Why do you hate the NCR so much anyway?
0TO0005897	Tell me about the problems with Lem.
0TO0005919	Tell me about Camp McCarran.
0TO0005920	Tell me about the Great Khans?
0TO0005953	What's got you so worked up?
0TO0005954	I'm just another wastelander looking for work.
0TO0005959	I'm working on it, may I ask you some questions?
0TO0005961	Yes. You can join then, but he says you would all still have to pass the initiation rite.
0TO0005962	I'm still working on it, may I ask you some questions?
0TO0005964	Sure, what do you need done?
0TO0005965	Not right now, may I ask you some questions?
0TO0005968	Nothing, I'm just passing through.
0TO0005969	I'm hunting ghouls.
0TO0005970	Why the hostility?
0TO0005973	Who is your employer?
0TO0005975	Are you looking for something?
0TO0005977	What are you looking for in the computer?
0TO0005978	I'll check it out.
0TO0005979	I can do that.
0TO0005980	I'd better get a bigger share for this.
0TO0005982	Okay. I'll be back.
0TO0005983	Yeah, I'm ready.
0TO0005985	Can I ask you something before we go?
0TO0005986	Where exactly are we going?
0TO0005987	What do you hope to find?
0TO0005988	Can I ask where we're going?
0TO0005989	Yep, I'm ready to go.
0TO0005990	Okay, I'm ready to go.
0TO0005991	Can I ask what you're looking for?
0TO0005992	Okay, I'll do that.
0TO0005993	Medical supplies are always scarce, and they don't kill the buyer as often. Think of the profits!
0TO0005994	But you could turn a profit and help the people of the Mojave!
0TO0005995	I'll take the caps.
0TO0005996	I'll take the recipe.
0TO0005997	But think of all the people who overdose on Jet and Psycho. It's bad for your karma.
0TO0005998	If "groodalicious" means "dead," maybe. Think of the children, man! The *children!*
0TO0005999	I can teach you to make Super Stimpaks.
0TO0006000	I was thinking Super Stimpacks, but now I'm not so sure.
0TO0006001	I can teach you to make Hydra.
0TO0006002	I was thinking Hydra, but now I'm not so sure.
0TO0006003	I can teach you to make Slasher.
0TO0006004	I was thinking Slasher, but now I'm not so sure.
0TO0006005	I can teach you to make Party-Time Mentats.
0TO0006006	I was thinking Party-Time Mentats, but now I'm not so sure.
0TO0006007	I can teach you to make Rocket.
0TO0006008	I was thinking Rocket, but now I'm not so sure.
0TO0006009	On second thought, nothing now.
0TO0006010	I'm looking to make a few caps. Got any work for me?
0TO0006011	I finished the Crimson Caravan run.
0TO0006012	I finished the Vault 3 run.
0TO0006013	Any new jobs for me?
0TO0006014	Now that Anders is back, how about that work?
0TO0006018	You've got an impressive setup here - have you considered making more helpful chems?
0TO0006019	How's the medical work going?
0TO0006020	Have you started making meds yet?
0TO0006022	I know a few recipes for chems you might want. I could teach you.
0TO0006024	Sure, just tell me who I'm looking for and where to start.
0TO0006025	Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. I'll pass.
0TO0006026	Okay, I'll be back as soon as I have any news.
0TO0006027	Sure, what have you got?
0TO0006029	Sure, I'll do it.
0TO0006030	I'm not interested in being a drug mule.
0TO0006031	Piece of cake.
0TO0006032	Sounds too dangerous, I'll pass.
0TO0006033	I've got a package here from your friends Jack and Diane.
0TO0006035	4 chips for 1 Legion Denarius.
0TO0006036	100 chips for 1 Legion Aureus or 25 Legion Denarii.
0TO0006037	20 chips for 5 Legion Denarii.
0TO0006038	40 chips for 10 Legion Denarii.
0TO0006039	80 chips for 20 Legion Denarii.
0TO0006040	2 chips for $5 NCR.
0TO0006041	8 chips for $20 NCR.
0TO0006042	40 chips for $100 NCR.
0TO0006043	I'll take my payout in caps.
0TO0006044	Pay me in NCR money.
0TO0006045	Legion money, please.
0TO0006047	This brain is from Rey, one of Old Lady Gibson's dogs.
0TO0006048	I took down a Fiend dog named Violetta.
0TO0006049	I got a brain from Lupa, the mother of many Legion Mongrels.
0TO0006050	Hold off for now.
0TO0006052	<Raise arms>Boogedy boogedy boo!
0TO0006053	You mean your army is about to attack?
0TO0006054	You're the Legate, I'm guessing?
0TO0006055	And what do you want me to do?
0TO0006056	What does Lanius mean?
0TO0006057	I wanted to know more about you.
0TO0006058	Are you looking forward to the battle?
0TO0006060	Any idea what our chances are?
0TO0006061	I'm ready. What is the plan?
0TO0006062	What can you tell me about the layout of the dam?
0TO0006063	I have questions.
0TO0006064	Then let's go.
0TO0006065	Time to go pay General Oliver a visit.
0TO0006066	You're the problem here.
0TO0006067	My dog here doesn't like you.
0TO0006070	I found this detonator in your pocket.
0TO0006071	Would you happen to know who did maintenance on the President's vertibird?
0TO0006072	Just come with me, right now.
0TO0006073	My mistake.
0TO0006074	Why don't we take this somewhere private?
0TO0006075	Maybe I should go get the MPs.
0TO0006076	There's a dead ranger downstairs!
0TO0006077	I need you to radio in an emergency report!
0TO0006079	Is it okay to leave your post?
0TO0006080	Let's radio it in first.
0TO0006082	Okay, but let's make it quick.
0TO0006083	No, radio it in first.
0TO0006084	Just get out of the way.
0TO0006087	What you do in the wasteland affects all the mutants here, but you didn't think about that, did you?
0TO0006088	Doctor Henry doesn't have the cure just yet, but he's almost there. Be patient.
0TO0006089	What are you planning to do once you have the specs?
0TO0006090	The Mark IIs are even more dangerous than standard Stealth Boys.
0TO0006091	Doctor Henry, do as he asks.
0TO0006092	You're not getting the Mark II specs.
0TO0006093	You should just go kill him.
0TO0006098	What makes the NCR too ambitious?
0TO0006099	Anything else can you tell me about the NCR?
0TO0006100	Do you have any dealings with New Vegas?
0TO0006102	There was no reasonable chance of success.
0TO0006103	I changed my mind.
0TO0006104	And once I'm inside?
0TO0006106	Canine neuroscience?
0TO0006107	You were with the Enclave?
0TO0006108	I'm all set.
0TO0006109	I need to prepare first.
0TO0006110	I have some questions.
0TO0006112	Can I use my weapons during the President's visit?
0TO0006113	What are your security arrangements?
0TO0006114	Do you have a detailed schedule for the visit?
0TO0006115	Do you have any leads on possible security threats?
0TO0006117	So what's the plan for today?
0TO0006118	Let's get this show on the road.
0TO0006119	I've made my preparations. Let's get started.
0TO0006120	I'm done with questions.
0TO0006121	I'm going to need access everywhere.
0TO0006122	I have access, right?
0TO0006123	Sounds good.
0TO0006124	No more questions.
0TO0006125	Astor has agreed to let you join him.
0TO0006126	<Lie> Oh yeah, I'm sure he'd love to see you.
0TO0006128	What's the history of the camp?
0TO0006129	On second thought, let me ask you something else.
0TO0006130	You define who you are, not some dog tag.
0TO0006131	Your humanity is a part of you, not kept in some dog tag.
0TO0006132	Give me your dog tag, now!
0TO0006133	He thinks you're suffering.
0TO0006134	[Attack] You're a rabid dog that needs to be put down.
0TO0006135	Actually, I want to talk about something else.
0TO0006136	Before I take care of them, can I ask you about your dog tag?
0TO0006137	Can I have it?
0TO0006138	There's an NCR soldier who wants me to kill you for it.
0TO0006140	Can I ask you about your dog tag first?
0TO0006141	Did he also tell you women aren't permitted to serve in the Legion?
0TO0006142	If the Great Khans join the Legion, you'll be sold as a slave. An officer's wife, if you're lucky.
0TO0006143	What? Wait, can't we talk about this?
0TO0006144	If you think you can take me, then.
0TO0006145	Oh good, I've been needing a new head for my trophy spike.
0TO0006146	Not really, no. Let's do this.
0TO0006147	Not while there are still spines un-shattered.
0TO0006148	Caesar isn't going to let you run drugs as an ally any more than he supports it now. He hates chems.
0TO0006149	Not yet, but I'll find some.
0TO0006150	No, and finding some would be too much work. Never mind.
0TO0006151	But you won't have each other. The Legion will kill you and sell Diane into slavery as a prostitute.
0TO0006152	Let's get this over with then.
0TO0006153	Send your whole damned Legion if you want - I'll water the desert with their blood.
0TO0006154	But surely a warrior in service of glorious Caesar is the equal of any tribe's finest?
0TO0006155	Wow, you're not worthy to join a scruffy tribe of has-been desert raiders? You must suck.
0TO0006156	Because you know they'd come up lacking?
0TO0006157	Well-spoken. You win this round.
0TO0006158	Interesting opinion, Karl. I wonder what Papa Khan will say about this.
0TO0006159	So if you were in charge of the tribe, you'd fight with the NCR against Caesar if asked?
0TO0006160	Caesar is only using you, he doesn't actually care about the Great Khans.
0TO0006161	Do you really think Caesar is going to restore your tribe to glory? You'll be made slaves.
0TO0006162	Because the NCR is the best hope for long-term stability in the region, not Caesar.
0TO0006163	That sounds wise. I wish you the best.
0TO0006164	Hey, as long as you aren't fighting for Caesar, I don't care what you do.
0TO0006165	Now that we've got that out of the way, I don't suppose you'd consider joining the NCR instead?
0TO0006166	Just asking. Good luck on your migration.
0TO0006167	All right, all right, don't get touchy. Just stick around for a while. I might change your mind.
0TO0006169	What is it you had in mind?
0TO0006170	Why should I listen to you?
0TO0006172	Aren't you convinced already, if we're having this conversation?
0TO0006173	What would convince Jack and Diane to support me?
0TO0006174	What about Melissa?
0TO0006175	Okay, I'll see what I can do to convince everyone.
0TO0006176	I don't think I actually want to do that.
0TO0006177	I'll think about it, but I have other questions for now.
0TO0006178	How would I do that?
0TO0006180	I'm not afraid of Karl, and I don't feel like wasting my time on him.
0TO0006181	Tell me again what I need to do to convince Papa.
0TO0006185	You're a mutant, too. Wouldn't the Nightkin listen to you?
0TO0006186	Um... you're all mutants. You can't make them do what you say?
0TO0006187	Any way I can help?
0TO0006188	Never mind. I'll be going now.
0TO0006194	What is your role here?
0TO0006195	Do you see much action against the NCR?
0TO0006196	That is all for now.
0TO0006197	There may be a battle in the near future at the Hoover Dam, can you offer any assistance?
0TO0006198	Are you and your people still ready to help in the upcoming battle at Hoover Dam?
0TO0006199	We're all fine here, thank you. How are you?
0TO0006200	Is Ignacio dead over there? Did you kill him?
0TO0006201	You're with the Legion?
0TO0006204	What you doing here?
0TO0006205	How are things, now that the battle for Hoover Dam is over?
0TO0006207	How did they get into the camp?
0TO0006208	What kind of favor?
0TO0006211	What's so dangerous about this place?
0TO0006212	I'm gonna need more than that if you want my help.
0TO0006213	Alright, I'll help.
0TO0006217	Sure I'll do it.
0TO0006218	Why do you want to kill them?
0TO0006220	Why Novac?
0TO0006221	What kind of creatures?
0TO0006222	He is a ghoul in Camp Searchlight.
0TO0006223	Nevermind, can I ask you something else?
0TO0006224	But he isn't feral.
0TO0006226	Maybe Edwards can help you?
0TO0006227	He isn't showing any signs of going feral.
0TO0006228	Is there somewhere else he can go?
0TO0006229	I'll go ask him about it.
0TO0006231	This is the last of the dog tags.
0TO0006232	If it's filled with radiation, why are you still here?
0TO0006233	Where should I go instead?
0TO0006234	Former? What happened?
0TO0006236	Maybe they'll let you back in?
0TO0006237	You're right, ghouls aren't fit to be in the army.
0TO0006238	[Attack] Don't worry, I'll put you out of your misery.
0TO0006241	Can I have your dog tag?
0TO0006242	You know, there's an NCR soldier outside who wants me to kill you for it.
0TO0006244	There must be someplace you can go.
0TO0006245	Why haven't you gone feral yet?
0TO0006246	Actually I have another question.
0TO0006247	Can you tell me what happened here?
0TO0006248	But ghouls are immune to radiation.
0TO0006249	Is that the only thing you're afraid of?
0TO0006250	There's still radiation in your house.
0TO0006251	Can I ask you about something else then?
0TO0006252	Can I ask  you something else?
0TO0006253	I'm positive, they're all gone.
0TO0006254	Well, there may still be a few out there.
0TO0006255	<Lie> They are definitely all gone.
0TO0006256	Actually lets talk about something else.
0TO0006257	I'll take care of them. Be right back.
0TO0006258	I want to talk about something else.
0TO0006259	There are plenty of places out in the wasteland.
0TO0006260	Maybe First Sergeant Astor will let you join him?
0TO0006261	You should work things out with First Sergeant Astor.
0TO0006262	I heard Ranger Station Echo up north is manned by other ghouls.
0TO0006263	Let's talk about something else first.
0TO0006264	I'll go talk to him first.
0TO0006265	On second thought maybe somewhere else would work better.
0TO0006266	There's always the wasteland.
0TO0006267	Ranger Station Echo is north of here. They have ghoul troopers.
0TO0006268	Lets talk about something else first.
0TO0006269	Don't worry, I'll talk to Astor and work it out for you.
0TO0006270	It's either him or the wasteland.
0TO0006271	Ranger Station Echo up north may take you in.
0TO0006273	There was another man involved at Sloan, but he's dead.
0TO0006275	Is this delivery legal?
0TO0006276	How did you end up joining the Great Khans?
0TO0006278	Who's authorized to go upstairs?
0TO0006279	I've always wanted to see the President's vertibird.
0TO0006280	May I have permission to go on the roof of the Visitor Center?
0TO0006281	Pretty please?
0TO0006282	Come on!!
0TO0006285	Uh huh. Make sense. Say more words.
0TO0006286	I have another question.
0TO0006287	The Brotherhood of Steel knew about ARCHIMEDES?
0TO0006288	Why was the Brotherhood of Steel here?
0TO0006294	Can you tell me about your people?
0TO0006295	Tell me about Papa Khan.
0TO0006296	Regis says I should talk to you about speaking against the Great Khans' alliance with Caesar.
0TO0006298	What do you think of the Great Khans?
0TO0006299	I've been wondering why you don't petition the Khans for membership as a show of allegiance.
0TO0006300	Who did this to you?
0TO0006301	What are you doing up there?
0TO0006302	You're smuggling drugs?
0TO0006303	Let's get you down from there.
0TO0006304	Are you Anders? Jack and Diane sent me to look for you.
0TO0006305	I think you're better off where you are. Hang around, I'll be back.
0TO0006306	Not yet, but I had some questions.
0TO0006307	Actually, I have a few questions first.
0TO0006308	Good luck on your journey.
0TO0006310	I'm sorry, but all these muscles make it hard to hear sometimes. What was that about risk?
0TO0006312	Chomps Lewis, the foreman at Sloan, was also involved.
0TO0006314	Tyrone has been selling chemical supplies to the Great Khans. Here - I got these from him.
0TO0006316	<Lie> No, there wasn't anyone else.
0TO0006318	Your supplier was exposed. There won't be any more chemical supplies.
0TO0006319	Simple. I turned him in.
0TO0006320	He was sloppy and trusted the wrong person.
0TO0006321	<Lie> Beats me.
0TO0006322	You want me to kill Caesar?
0TO0006323	So what do you want me to do at Fortification Hill?
0TO0006324	Going to the Fort sounds insane.
0TO0006325	Caesar has already invited me to the Fort.
0TO0006326	I've already met with Caesar at the Fort.
0TO0006327	I think I'll be going.
0TO0006328	Crops in Westside - the apparent water shortage here can't be a coincidence, then.
0TO0006329	The fields should be getting their full supply of water again.
0TO0006330	What can you tell me about the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0006331	Followers of who?
0TO0006336	<Press the yellow button to quit.>
0TO0006337	Play again.
0TO0006338	I'm done.
0TO0006340	I feel lucky.
0TO0006342	How about you and I come to another arrangement. It'll be worth it - trust me.
0TO0006343	I'll make sure the Boomers support the right side.
0TO0006344	Where can I find more of these caps?
0TO0006345	So you collect these caps too?
0TO0006346	Thanks for the info, but I'll be going now.
0TO0006347	What kind of treasure are we talking about?
0TO0006348	You mentioned someone named Festus. Who's that?
0TO0006349	It'll be more fun if we keep it a mystery. Besides, I'm more interested in you.
0TO0006350	You too tense. It wrinkle your nice face.
0TO0006351	I don't need your help. I'm going to carve myself a key from your bones.
0TO0006352	I am pale Death come to bear you to Perdition.
0TO0006353	An attractive woman like yourself all alone? Maybe you and I could work out some kind of trade...
0TO0006356	250 caps. Unless you think you'll find another buyer soon for such specialized parts?
0TO0006357	You should cut down the price. It's not like anyone will probably buy them.
0TO0006359	But you're going to cut the price to 250 because I'm just that charming, right?
0TO0006360	How about a discount? I'm a nice person.
0TO0006361	500 caps it is. Here you go.
0TO0006363	250 caps it is. Here you go.
0TO0006365	I'll be back in a bit.
0TO0006366	Deal. Here's 700 caps.
0TO0006368	I'm offering Rey immortality of a sort. Are you really going to put a price on that?
0TO0006369	It's just a dog's brain. I don't think it's worth that many caps.
0TO0006371	How did you meet Doctor Henry?
0TO0006373	Why does Keene want to leave?
0TO0006374	What happens if Keene leaves?
0TO0006375	What do you do in Jacobstown?
0TO0006376	What's the next step?
0TO0006377	I've done enough work for you.
0TO0006378	I've come here to kill you, Mr. House. <Attack Mr. House.>
0TO0006379	I'll make sure they support the right side.
0TO0006380	I've done enough work for you for the moment.
0TO0006383	Tell me about the mission.
0TO0006384	If I want more work, I'll come see you.
0TO0006385	The Boomers and I had a disagreement a while back. I pretty much wiped them out.
0TO0006386	The Boomers have already vowed to help me out.
0TO0006387	I'll check into the Omertas.
0TO0006388	The Omertas? No thanks.
0TO0006389	I'm going to kill you now, Mr. House.
0TO0006390	The Omertas were clever, but no match for me.
0TO0006391	They had it coming. The Omertas disgust me!
0TO0006392	It's a good thing we stopped the Omertas in time.
0TO0006393	Where do you want me to start?
0TO0006394	Any possibility of a diplomatic solution?
0TO0006398	I've already destroyed their bunker.
0TO0006400	Why are these fields being guarded?
0TO0006401	What can you tell me about these fields?
0TO0006402	Trent Bascom says he's not getting his full allotment of water.
0TO0006403	I'm looking for Corporal White. Trent told me you'd seen him.
0TO0006404	You haven't heard anything more from White?
0TO0006405	Do you have something against White?
0TO0006408	You work these fields?
0TO0006409	What's the Thaler Act?
0TO0006410	Why is this work a bum deal?
0TO0006411	What are NCR troopers doing here?
0TO0006412	What kind of crops do you grow?
0TO0006414	Water was being diverted to Westside, but I took care of the problem.
0TO0006415	<Lie> The NCR admitted there's bad pipes somewhere, and took care of the problem.
0TO0006416	Me? I have no idea what you're talking about.
0TO0006419	Can't you just grow less crops?
0TO0006420	I'm looking for Corporal White. I was told that he'd spoken to you.
0TO0006421	He was hurting you?
0TO0006425	A friend in Sloan told me to come to you about some chemical supplies.
0TO0006426	You were already paid in advance.
0TO0006428	I say the word and someone else will start making deliveries to Nevada, not you.
0TO0006429	Come on. Give me a break, just this once.
0TO0006431	Is 300 caps worth being known as a deal-breaker? Seems like bad business to me.
0TO0006432	It's not a fair trade, and you know it.
0TO0006433	Here's 300 caps. Hand over those supplies.
0TO0006435	About those chemical supplies...
0TO0006436	How do you like being part of the NCR military?
0TO0006437	You don't care that you're helping the Great Khans?
0TO0006438	Has Tyrone cheated you before?
0TO0006439	All right. I'll go pay a visit to Tyrone.
0TO0006440	How do you know Melissa?
0TO0006442	I'm looking for some Great Khans who stole something from me in Goodsprings.
0TO0006444	I'll help you with your problem.
0TO0006445	What kind of delivery are you expecting?
0TO0006446	Seems like an odd place to pick up a delivery.
0TO0006447	No angle. I just want to help.
0TO0006448	A favor for a favor.
0TO0006449	Well, I am expecting to be paid, of course.
0TO0006450	Are these chemicals dangerous?
0TO0006451	Got it. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0006453	I got the chems for you.
0TO0006457	<Lie> Just trying to get on the good side of the Great Khans.
0TO0006458	What happened between the Great Khans and the NCR?
0TO0006459	Where can I find the rest of the Great Khans?
0TO0006461	Hmmm... your leg appears to be injured.
0TO0006462	How's it going?
0TO0006464	[Clean the wound with antibiotics and expertly bind Snuffles' injured leg.]
0TO0006465	[Do your best attempts at first aid to treat Snuffles' injured leg.]
0TO0006466	Surrender, general. The dam is almost taken.
0TO0006467	Tell me about the Powder Gangers.
0TO0006468	Have you had problems with Deathclaws before?
0TO0006469	I could take care of your Deathclaw problem.
0TO0006471	What does the NCR need with the cement?
0TO0006472	What's a dragline?
0TO0006473	You don't get paid in caps?
0TO0006475	I noticed you have a tame molerat.
0TO0006476	People have a rather unique taste, I've discovered.
0TO0006477	Why do you ask?
0TO0006478	Ghouls and Super Mutants sometimes taste like Brahmin steaks.
0TO0006479	Anything that wasn't made 200 years ago.
0TO0006480	Where did you come up with this recipe?
0TO0006481	Where can I find a Deathclaw egg?
0TO0006482	What are you offering in exchange for a Deathclaw egg?
0TO0006485	About that Deathclaw Omelet recipe...
0TO0006486	I had some questions about this place.
0TO0006489	You don't look like a quarry worker.
0TO0006490	Are you from California?
0TO0006491	Any trouble around here?
0TO0006492	I just happen to have a Deathclaw egg with me. Here.
0TO0006493	I got a Deathclaw egg for you.
0TO0006494	Don't mention it. I'll be on my way.
0TO0006495	What was that you took from his corpse?
0TO0006496	Yes, I've got a few myself.
0TO0006497	No, can't say that I have.
0TO0006498	Sure have. And I'm thinking of adding yours to my collection.
0TO0006500	Nothing like those six you've got there.
0TO0006501	Are you sure that necklace is yours?
0TO0006502	Actually, the necklace is made of seven caps. It's not really yours, is it?
0TO0006503	You stole that cap necklace from that poor man.
0TO0006504	Let's just say I'll leave just enough of you left for the dogs to fight over.
0TO0006505	Nothing, I guess.
0TO0006506	I'm going to see that justice is done.
0TO0006507	Kill you, I suppose.
0TO0006508	Hand over the necklace, thief.
0TO0006509	No reason. Sorry to bother you.
0TO0006510	Why were you following me?
0TO0006512	Don't follow me. You'll live longer.
0TO0006513	What's so special about these caps?
0TO0006514	Why didn't you say anything then and there?
0TO0006515	This is getting creepy. I'm leaving, and don't follow me.
0TO0006520	Did you know her?
0TO0006521	Lucky charm necklace?
0TO0006524	All sorts of nasty people are looking for caps like those. You'd be safer if you got rid of them.
0TO0006525	Those caps are bad luck. Why don't you let me hold onto them for you?
0TO0006526	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over.
0TO0006527	Lucky for me, you mean. Hand them over or I gut you like a fish.
0TO0006528	I can hold onto them for you. I'm not worried about the people that are looking for them.
0TO0006529	Just get rid of them. It doesn't matter how you do it.
0TO0006530	Just be more careful in the future, okay?
0TO0006531	Figure it out yourself. I need to get out of here.
0TO0006532	Of course I have a plan.
0TO0006533	I haven't given it much thought.
0TO0006534	I don't need a plan to put a bullet in his head.
0TO0006536	What sort of information do you have?
0TO0006537	Let's get moving.
0TO0006538	Do you have any suggestions about the assassination?
0TO0006539	What sort of intel have you gathered?
0TO0006540	How are we getting into the Dam?
0TO0006541	Is there anything you can do to help?
0TO0006542	I don't have any more questions.
0TO0006543	Tell me about Kimball's schedule.
0TO0006544	Give me the security details.
0TO0006546	I'm familiar with explosives, give it here.
0TO0006547	How hard can it be to put a bomb on a vertibird?
0TO0006551	I don't need a bomb.
0TO0006553	Your helmet is right over there.
0TO0006554	What do you know about the President's visit?
0TO0006556	It's right over there.
0TO0006557	I haven't seen it.
0TO0006558	[Lie] Do you mean the helmet I just threw off the dam?
0TO0006560	Fantastic? What are you doing here?
0TO0006561	Get this straight. You're not my master.
0TO0006562	What are your responsibilities now?
0TO0006563	They put you in charge of Hoover Dam?
0TO0006564	So you have to do whatever Lawson tells you.
0TO0006566	Do you have a means of changing her mind? Something I can do?
0TO0006567	Will the White Glove Society ally with Caesar now?
0TO0006570	You aren't feral are you?
0TO0006576	The radscorpions are gone.
0TO0006577	Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
0TO0006584	I found the radiation suits.
0TO0006585	I found the location of the radiation suits.
0TO0006586	I've been a lot of help to you already. You can do me this one favor.
0TO0006588	About Doctor Henry's experiment...
0TO0006592	How does that make you different from some humans?
0TO0006593	[Stare silently at him.]
0TO0006595	I'm looking into the Nightstalker mutation. Want to come along with me?
0TO0006596	What makes you think that the Nightstalker mutation isn't natural?
0TO0006597	Go ahead and start the tests.
0TO0006598	Don't start just yet. I'll be back.
0TO0006599	You should stay with your family - reconcile with them.
0TO0006600	You should get out of here and never come back.
0TO0006601	[Attack] Thanks for the gun, it will make this easier.
0TO0006602	You should leave and never come back.
0TO0006604	[Attack] I'm not seeing it either, yet!
0TO0006605	<Attack> I'm not seeing it either, yet!
0TO0006606	Only you can answer that.
0TO0006607	I... guess that's your choice.
0TO0006609	<Attack> Here's my answer.
0TO0006610	Give them a chance.
0TO0006613	<Attack> You're not going anywhere.
0TO0006614	Alice, Andy's just using you to get the money.
0TO0006615	So, where's the money?
0TO0006616	<Attack> That won't do. Time to put you down.
0TO0006617	Okay, go ahead. I'll wait for you.
0TO0006618	Calm down. I just want to talk.
0TO0006619	I give up. Sort it out on your own.
0TO0006620	Now there really is no turning back.
0TO0006621	That was great! Good job, Alice.
0TO0006622	[Attack] You're next!
0TO0006623	Once I have my share, you can get out of here.
0TO0006624	Grab the money and run far away.
0TO0006625	[Attack] I think you're better dead.
0TO0006626	I don't care about any of this.
0TO0006627	Nice to meet you too.
0TO0006628	Let's get on with this.
0TO0006630	Yes, I'm ready.
0TO0006640	What's the history of Jacobstown?
0TO0006641	I'd like to know about you.
0TO0006642	Super Mutant army?
0TO0006643	You were a mayor?
0TO0006644	Tell me more about the tribal.
0TO0006646	No more questions. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0006647	How does the town support itself?
0TO0006648	Nobody who threatens me lives to tell about it. Not even Nightkin.
0TO0006650	I heard your radio broadcast. I'm here to help.
0TO0006651	This is it, buddy.
0TO0006652	You think I need more men to get the job done?
0TO0006655	How did you kill that thing?
0TO0006657	Looks like some nasty lacerations and a dislocated joint. You're lucky I found you.
0TO0006658	I think I've got a dull needle and twine in one of my pockets.
0TO0006659	<Use Doctor Bag to heal his leg> This should help fix up your leg.
0TO0006660	I'll be back.
0TO0006661	That's a nice gun you've got there.
0TO0006662	You're free to leave. The way up is clear.
0TO0006663	We need to clear the caves first.
0TO0006666	If we don't clear the caves, your friends' deaths were for nothing. Can you live with that?
0TO0006667	More people are going to die if we don't do something.
0TO0006669	Have a safe trip.
0TO0006674	Hold off on the transplant.
0TO0006675	Never mind. I want to hold off for now.
0TO0006684	I hear you've been causing trouble.
0TO0006685	[Attack] I'm looking at my next victim.
0TO0006687	No need for violence. What'll it take for you to stop?
0TO0006688	These people won't put up with you forever.
0TO0006689	Locals are getting edgy. How long, you think, before you're gutted open by an angry mob?
0TO0006690	[Attack] I was hoping you'd be that stupid.
0TO0006692	[Attack] I'm going to enjoy seeing you bleed.
0TO0006693	How about if I pay you 100 caps to get out of here?
0TO0006694	You can't really enjoy living here. Take 50 caps and get out of here.
0TO0006696	These people will not put up with you forever.
0TO0006700	[Attack] Can't say I didn't try. Time to die!
0TO0006701	I'm not here to hurt you.
0TO0006703	<Attack> Time to put you down!
0TO0006704	I'm here to help you. Andy sent me.
0TO0006705	I just want to talk, that's all.
0TO0006707	What's going on in here?
0TO0006709	I hear you, and I'm not going to hurt you.
0TO0006713	Do you have the money?
0TO0006716	<Attack> I'll take over now, without you.
0TO0006717	No, look at this note I found in his room.
0TO0006718	What do you really want, Alice?
0TO0006719	Why are you doing this? Just for the money?
0TO0006720	They care for you, in their own way.
0TO0006723	<Attack> I'll help you leave, dead cold.
0TO0006724	Never mind, Andy sent me to help you, actually.
0TO0006728	Talk you out of what?
0TO0006729	<Attack> You're right, there's no turning back. Time to teach you a lesson.
0TO0006730	I don't care about this. Sort it out yourselves.
0TO0006736	<Attack> I think I'll just put you down.
0TO0006739	[Attack] That won't do. Time to put you down.
0TO0006741	I know, but look at this note I've found in Andy's room.
0TO0006746	Don't worry. Just get the cash. I'll wait for you.
0TO0006747	Look at this note I found in Andy's room.
0TO0006748	Is that what you really want?
0TO0006749	<Attack> No, you won't.
0TO0006752	Forget it. Sort your problems by yourselves.
0TO0006754	Actually, just sort this out on your own.
0TO0006755	I'm not interested in this. Sort it out yourselves.
0TO0006756	<Attack> You are no help, time to put you down.
0TO0006757	Give me your gun, Alice.
0TO0006758	I should've known you don't have what it takes.
0TO0006759	<Attack> I'll make you do it.
0TO0006760	Relax, I was just leaving.
0TO0006761	I know about your plans for Alice.
0TO0006762	<Attack> I'm here to kill you.
0TO0006764	<Lie> I've no idea what you're talking about.
0TO0006765	Yes, I did. I know about your plans for Alice.
0TO0006766	<Attack> Yes, but I figured I'd save her the trouble of killing you.
0TO0006768	Why would she be?
0TO0006769	<Attack> She won't be, once I'm done with you.
0TO0006771	I was just exploring North Vegas and found this building.
0TO0006772	I went into your room. I know about your plans for Alice.
0TO0006773	<Attack> And it's the last you'll ever see.
0TO0006774	Nothing, goodbye.
0TO0006775	She deserves to know the truth.
0TO0006776	You're manipulating her into betraying her family.
0TO0006778	Aren't you afraid I'll blow your plans?
0TO0006779	<Attack> Sure, but first, let's tie up loose ends.
0TO0006781	A cut from the Hostetlers' money, and I might help you.
0TO0006782	Maybe I'll do that, then. Goodbye.
0TO0006783	Actually, I know about your plans for Alice.
0TO0006784	<Attack> Only after I've taken care of you.
0TO0006787	<Attack> I'm looking for you. It's time to die.
0TO0006791	[Attack] Time to pay.
0TO0006792	<Attack> Like this: You're dead.
0TO0006793	We'll see. Goodbye.
0TO0006795	Why would Alice follow your plans?
0TO0006796	Alice should know the truth.
0TO0006797	Alice should stay with her family.
0TO0006798	I'll help you out for a cut of the Hostetlers' money.
0TO0006800	I'm just another Wasteland wanderer. Why the suspicion?
0TO0006801	Relax, I only want to ask you some questions.
0TO0006804	<Attack> I guess you'll have to find out the hard way.
0TO0006806	You look capable of defending yourself.
0TO0006807	I see you can take care of yourself. Your revolver's trigger shines like silver.
0TO0006811	Can I ask you other questions?
0TO0006813	Another time. Let me ask you some questions.
0TO0006817	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler.
0TO0006819	NCR whores?
0TO0006820	What's your opinion of the NCR, again?
0TO0006821	What's the deal with the Fiends?
0TO0006822	What did you say before about the Fiends?
0TO0006823	Any more trouble with the Fiends?
0TO0006824	Do you know where might I find them?
0TO0006825	Tell me again where to find Alice and Andy.
0TO0006830	Did you say NCR whores?
0TO0006837	What can you tell me about North Vegas.
0TO0006838	Tell me about your past.
0TO0006860	You look capable to defending yourself.
0TO0006862	Okay, so what's your story?
0TO0006863	Tell me more about your story.
0TO0006876	Tell me again about what your role here.
0TO0006896	What do you need done about your daughter?
0TO0006897	Where did you want me to look for Alice?
0TO0006898	I'll check them out for you.
0TO0006899	Babysitting isn't my thing.
0TO0006901	Tell me about this area of New Vegas.
0TO0006902	Tell me again about East Vegas.
0TO0006903	What's your take on the Legion and the NCR?
0TO0006904	What did you say before about the Legion and the NCR?
0TO0006909	Crandon said you've got a problem. I take care of problems.
0TO0006911	I mean you no harm. Crandon sent me.
0TO0006914	Tell me again what you need done about your daughter.
0TO0006916	Settle down. Crandon sent me.
0TO0006917	Crandon said you had a problem. I take care of problems.
0TO0006919	I mean you no harm.
0TO0006920	I just want to ask you some questions.
0TO0006923	<Attack> Okay, bitch. You asked for it.
0TO0006930	So, you've got work for me?
0TO0006931	Let me ask you some questions.
0TO0006936	Okay, I'll look into it.
0TO0006937	Yeah... about my other questions.
0TO0006939	Now, let me ask you something else.
0TO0006941	I'm looking for Alice Hostetler and Andy.
0TO0006942	I just want to talk to Alice or Andy.
0TO0006943	I'm looking for Andy or Alice so we could talk.
0TO0006944	I don't like your tone.
0TO0006949	[Lie] I just thought Andy should know about Mrs. Hostetler waiting outside for him, shotgun in hand.
0TO0006957	[Attack] I like where this is going.
0TO0006958	What's that about knowing how to handle more than just a weapon?
0TO0006959	I think I know what you meant before.
0TO0006960	What do you mean by "more than just a weapon?"
0TO0006961	I'm one with the land.
0TO0006962	Of course I know who I am, who doesn't?
0TO0006963	Thanks, Jules. Tell me more about you.
0TO0006964	Thank you. Let me ask you something else.
0TO0006966	I will. Tell me more about you.
0TO0006970	Another time, let's go back to my other questions.
0TO0006983	Ever take that beret off?
0TO0006984	How do you feel about Manny Vargas?
0TO0006985	Weren't you also friends?
0TO0006986	Not anymore?
0TO0006987	I have another question about you.
0TO0006988	Tell me about your wife.
0TO0006989	Did you ever tell your wife about what happened at Bitter Springs?
0TO0006990	Have you heard of Mr. House?
0TO0006991	I had some questions I wanted to ask you.
0TO0006992	Does the name Benny mean anything to you?
0TO0006994	How do you feel about the NCR?
0TO0006996	I have a different question.
0TO0006999	Does Stealth Boy use hurt humans?
0TO0007000	Why are you helping the Nightkin?
0TO0007001	I'd like to help. What do you need me to do?
0TO0007004	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up, Frank.
0TO0007005	They hate you. Get over it.
0TO0007008	Why would I tell an abusive bastard like you?
0TO0007010	Show me some caps and I'll tell you exactly where to go.
0TO0007011	Hey thanks, Frank. Go to hell.
0TO0007013	You're a slimy yellow-bellied bastard. You don't deserve a family!
0TO0007014	Your family doesn't want you around. You need to clean up your act.
0TO0007015	They mentioned going to the Old Mormon Fort in Freeside.
0TO0007016	Goodbye, Frank.
0TO0007018	Think about it, Frank. What do you have to live for?
0TO0007019	You're scum, Frank. A real bottom-feeder.
0TO0007020	So, are you a cannibal?
0TO0007022	You live out here by yourself?
0TO0007024	You were lucky. I might not be around next time.
0TO0007025	Why were the Omertas out to kill you?
0TO0007027	Save your thanks - this was a job, nothing more.
0TO0007028	You work with the NCR? It was the Legion who sent me to protect you.
0TO0007029	So, you're a spy.
0TO0007030	Dangerous work.
0TO0007035	Why'd you come all the way out to New Vegas?
0TO0007036	About your family...
0TO0007037	What happened to your family?
0TO0007038	Remind me what happened to your family.
0TO0007039	I'm infiltrating the organization. I have to gain their trust.
0TO0007040	I'm... uh... helping them so I can spy on them better.
0TO0007041	It won't happen again.
0TO0007042	Things have changed. I'm with Caesar now.
0TO0007043	[Attack] I won't be needing your services any longer.
0TO0007044	Very well. You have my word.
0TO0007045	Sorry. I won't compromise my mission.
0TO0007046	Then we can't work together anymore.
0TO0007047	All right. I won't do anything else to hurt the NCR.
0TO0007048	[Attack] You're less trouble to me dead than alive.
0TO0007215	Still feels pretty good, though, doesn't it?
0TO0007216	Why wouldn't this stop the Legion?
0TO0007217	That just means we've got more work to do.
0TO0007223	How's business?
0TO0007224	Do you get a lot of customers?
0TO0007225	I agree to disarm.
0TO0007226	I refuse to disarm.
0TO0007227	You can pry my weapons from my cold dead hands.
0TO0007228	I will return to Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0007229	Why can't I just continue on?
0TO0007230	What is considered a banned item?
0TO0007232	I have to bring them along, a congenital heart defect.
0TO0007233	But medical chems aren't addictive! Really!
0TO0007234	I have dog tags to turn in.
0TO0007235	Does the Legion see much action here?
0TO0007236	That's some armor you're wearing.
0TO0007237	An NCR officer asked me to plant this listening device here. <Give Aurelius the NCR bug>
0TO0007239	You must be the one in charge here.
0TO0007241	It doesn't bother you, enslaving people?
0TO0007242	How much would it cost to buy the three "captures"?
0TO0007244	I'll give you 150 caps for the lot.
0TO0007245	How did the Legion set up a camp on this side of the river?
0TO0007246	How did you join Caesar's Legion?
0TO0007248	Who is Cursor Lucullus?
0TO0007249	Do you have any "captures" with the last name, "Weathers?"
0TO0007254	I'm just a humble trader passing through.
0TO0007255	Just thought I'd check the place out.
0TO0007256	<Show Mark of Caesar> I was invited.
0TO0007257	<Attack> I go where I please!
0TO0007260	Who are you calling "Dissolute?"
0TO0007261	What have I done to earn this honor?
0TO0007263	Why are you surprised to see a woman receive this honor?
0TO0007264	I'm ready to return to Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0007265	<Give Mrs. Weathers the key from Canyon Runner>
0TO0007267	<Lie> I paid for your release. You're free to go.
0TO0007268	I took care of your master. You're free as a bird.
0TO0007270	How were you captured?
0TO0007273	It was an accident.
0TO0007274	Just letting you know.
0TO0007276	I can teach you to make Powder Charges.
0TO0007279	Five.
0TO0007280	Ten.
0TO0007281	I want to trade for something else.
0TO0007283	Study this as long as you need. <Show him the Powder Charge schematic.>
0TO0007284	I can show you how to disarm the NCR's mines.
0TO0007286	The trick is to rush the mine and press the blinking red light.
0TO0007287	The trick, I figure, is to pick up the mine really, really carefully.
0TO0007288	Another time, perhaps.
0TO0007290	Your Centurion said I could trade dog tags for supplies.
0TO0007291	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens in Freeside.
0TO0007292	I need some snipers to cover my advance.
0TO0007293	Have your unit follow with me, we'll assault them head on.
0TO0007295	You have superior firepower. You can overwhelm them if you push the advance on them.
0TO0007296	You go first. I'll be right behind you.
0TO0007297	I can manage this without your assistance.
0TO0007298	[Reputation] I've done a lot for the Legion. Just hand over the bear already.
0TO0007299	Is that a yes?
0TO0007300	They have cyber-dogs in Denver?
0TO0007301	I'm ready to fight Lupa now.
0TO0007302	I'll be back when I'm ready.
0TO0007303	I'm sure. Let's go.
0TO0007304	Actually, I still need to prepare some more.
0TO0007305	I found an assassin in the tower.
0TO0007306	I'm all set. When does the President arrive?
0TO0007307	Anything you can help me with?
0TO0007309	Nice looking dog you have there.
0TO0007310	Notice anything suspicious?
0TO0007311	I found a Legion sniper on the roof of the tower.
0TO0007312	Nothing to report.
0TO0007316	Report, centurion. What are your standing orders?
0TO0007317	What news of the battle below?
0TO0007318	I have to keep moving. Kill a few of them for me.
0TO0007320	It is imperative we secure the dam top. Instead of dividing your men, focus their attack here.
0TO0007321	Screw that. I need all your men dying fo- er, backing me up here.
0TO0007323	The power plant is what really matters. Have all of your men attack there. I'll finish things here.
0TO0007324	Pffft. I can handle things here. You and your men can hold the power plant until I get there.
0TO0007325	Why are there so many Great Khan tags around the camp?
0TO0007326	I see. Well, that's too bad. Good luck.
0TO0007327	I don't need any reward, just keep these people fed and healthy.
0TO0007328	Whatever you can spare would be a big help.
0TO0007329	I dragged myself all over Hell's half-acre for you, I expect something substantial!
0TO0007330	I've got other questions.
0TO0007331	It was a Great Khan named Oscar Velasco. His family was killed by the NCR, and he wanted revenge.
0TO0007332	It was a Great Khan raider. He had a base camp in a cave up in the mountains.
0TO0007333	You mean the massacre three years ago?
0TO0007334	What incident?
0TO0007335	Like what? It looks to me like the NCR ran the Khans out of Bitter Springs altogether.
0TO0007336	Well, it's taken care of now. I convinced him to leave Bitter Springs alone.
0TO0007337	Well, it's taken care of now. He's dead.
0TO0007338	That's very noble of you. I'd like to talk about something else though.
0TO0007339	Any idea why a Great Khan would be so far from Red Rock Canyon?
0TO0007340	<Truth> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
0TO0007341	<Lie> I give you my word I won't tell the NCR where you are. I want to resolve this peacefully.
0TO0007342	Don't sweat it, I was glad to help.
0TO0007343	Well, if you've got a surplus, maybe you could spare a little medicine?
0TO0007344	Some spare meds would be great - and those books weren't cheap.
0TO0007345	Thanks, that should cover my expenses.
0TO0007346	Those books were pretty expensive. Maybe you can cough up a little more?
0TO0007359	What happened to the mayor?
0TO0007360	How'd your plan go wrong?
0TO0007362	What happened after everyone got lottery tickets?
0TO0007363	You said some of the people were enslaved?
0TO0007364	I'll do what I can to save them.
0TO0007365	It's not my problem.
0TO0007366	I can spare some Med-X.
0TO0007367	One dose.
0TO0007368	Two doses.
0TO0007369	Three doses.
0TO0007370	Five doses.
0TO0007371	I don't have any Med-X for you.
0TO0007372	Are you a Powder Ganger?
0TO0007375	I'm going to do this my way. I can't bring you.
0TO0007376	All right, come along.
0TO0007379	Legion's attacked Nipton, burned and killed everyone.
0TO0007380	<Attack> Ave Caesar!
0TO0007381	What outfit did you serve in the military with?
0TO0007382	How did you happen to join First Recon?
0TO0007383	What's the slogan?
0TO0007384	Is that a First Recon beret?
0TO0007386	What was Camp Golf like?
0TO0007387	What do you think of General Oliver?
0TO0007388	Do you know Colonel Hsu at all?
0TO0007389	The Dam?
0TO0007390	Don't worry, I'm not going in there right now.
0TO0007391	As long as you don't mind me joining the fun.
0TO0007392	I don't want any trouble. We should part ways for now.
0TO0007393	Yes, but you're not coming with me.
0TO0007394	No, I'm not going in right now.
0TO0007395	I'm ready. Caesar won't know what hit him.
0TO0007396	No, that's not a problem. That's a solution.
0TO0007397	I'm not ready to attack it. We'll keep our distance.
0TO0007398	That's not how I want to approach this. You'd better go your own way for now.
0TO0007401	What was your tour with the NCR like?
0TO0007402	So why'd you leave?
0TO0007403	What did happen at Bitter Springs?
0TO0007405	How do I reach Fortification Hill?
0TO0007406	Trust me, your troubles are over. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
0TO0007408	I'm looking for a howitzer firing mechanism.
0TO0007410	Potentially losing four dogs is a very high price to pay for a toy. What about two?
0TO0007411	Can't we make some kind of deal?
0TO0007412	I'm ready now. Let's go.
0TO0007413	There are a lot of tents here.
0TO0007414	Moo! That's what Brahmin say.
0TO0007415	I found a bomb on the President's vertibird.
0TO0007416	I found a detonator on that man over there.
0TO0007418	I'm ready. When will the President be here?
0TO0007419	So you've been hiding in these mountains ever since? Why?
0TO0007420	The people at this camp aren't responsible for your family's death. They're refugees.
0TO0007421	But the NCR are trying to help! They're good people, fighting for civilization in a lawless waste!
0TO0007422	The Khans settled in Red Rock Canyon years ago. It's time to let go of your hate and join them.
0TO0007423	Take revenge on the people actually responsible: Go attack Camp McCarran.
0TO0007424	I promised Captain Gilles I'd stop the attacks on Bitter Springs.
0TO0007425	Let's not be hasty. I'll be back.
0TO0007426	If you insist. Let's finish this.
0TO0007427	I understand. I'll leave you to your grief, then.
0TO0007430	At least, tell me how you find these creatures.
0TO0007432	How could I help The Thorn?
0TO0007433	Where can I find Giant Mantis' eggs?
0TO0007434	Let's talk about the creature's eggs you need.
0TO0007435	I'll find Giant Mantis' eggs for you.
0TO0007436	Maybe later. Let's go back to my questions.
0TO0007438	How do you find these creatures?
0TO0007442	I'm still looking for the Giant Mantis Eggs.
0TO0007443	Who else can bring you so many intact eggs? I deserve a bigger reward.
0TO0007444	I don't agree with it because... because it was very dangerous and I deserve more caps.
0TO0007446	Let's talk about the creature's eggs that you need.
0TO0007447	200 caps are sufficient. Take the eggs.
0TO0007448	I don't need anything in return. Take the eggs.
0TO0007450	Where can I find Radscorpion eggs?
0TO0007453	I'll find the Radscorpion eggs for you.
0TO0007454	Maybe later, let's go back to my other questions.
0TO0007456	Is there anything else I can do to help The Thorn?
0TO0007458	Perhaps, I'll keep the eggs for now.
0TO0007460	I was planing on helping you get even deadlier creatures, but not without a raise.
0TO0007461	I'm risking my life for you at every turn. Pay up or find another hunter.
0TO0007462	300 caps are enough. Take the eggs.
0TO0007467	Where can I find Fire Gecko eggs?
0TO0007468	I'll find the Fire Gecko eggs for you.
0TO0007469	I'm still looking for the Radscorpion Eggs.
0TO0007470	I've shown you my worth. Doesn't your best hunter deserve the best rewards?
0TO0007471	Those Fire Geckos are not easy... not easy at all. I deserve more caps.
0TO0007475	Where can I find Night Stalker Eggs?
0TO0007476	I'll find the Night Stalker Eggs for you.
0TO0007477	500 caps sound good. Take the eggs.
0TO0007479	I'm still looking for the Fire Gecko eggs.
0TO0007481	I've braved packs of Night Stalkers to get these eggs. My reward should match this effort.
0TO0007485	I'm getting tired of running around all over The Wasteland for a handful of caps. I want more.
0TO0007486	700 caps will do. Take the eggs.
0TO0007488	Where can I find Cazador Eggs?
0TO0007489	I'll find the Cazador Eggs for you.
0TO0007490	I've brought the Cazador Eggs.
0TO0007491	There's almost nothing worse than Cazadores in The Wasteland. Great deeds deserve great rewards.
0TO0007492	Those Cazadores almost killed me. Pay me more or... just pay me more, alright?
0TO0007496	A 1000 caps will do. Take the eggs.
0TO0007498	Where can I find Deathclaw Eggs?
0TO0007499	I'll find this great prize for you.
0TO0007503	I will, Lucy.
0TO0007504	I'm still looking for the Night Stalker Eggs.
0TO0007505	I'm still looking for the Cazador Eggs.
0TO0007506	I'm still looking for the Deathclaw Eggs.
0TO0007507	I took care of that slave caravan.
0TO0007508	I just wandered in here.
0TO0007509	I'm here about the hostages.
0TO0007510	Can you let them go?
0TO0007512	I want one of their heads.
0TO0007513	Are you the one who's been raiding the refugee camp at Bitter Springs?
0TO0007514	It's time to die.
0TO0007515	Spare me your sob story, it's time to die.
0TO0007516	What happened to your people?
0TO0007517	You'll get your freedom if you kill me in single combat. Just you, me, and machetes.
0TO0007518	I've decided to let the Legion crucify you.
0TO0007521	Why aren't you sure?
0TO0007522	You underestimated us.
0TO0007523	You can't take back what you've done. But your regrets can set you on a better path.
0TO0007524	I wasn't going to let you die.
0TO0007525	Maybe it's just not your time yet.
0TO0007526	No one is judging or punishing you. Things just happen.
0TO0007527	Having to live with what you've done is your punishment.
0TO0007528	Get over it. It's war. People die. Why should it matter whether they're soldiers or civilians?
0TO0007532	So what's next for you?
0TO0007533	You ever spend time with a trooper named White?
0TO0007534	He's gone missing, and I'm trying to track him down. Any ideas?
0TO0007535	Did he ever tell you anything about what he was up to?
0TO0007536	I'm asking the questions here. Tell me what you know.
0TO0007538	How much for a good time?
0TO0007539	Let's party. Here's the hundred caps.
0TO0007542	Uhh... twenty, twenty five... yeah, I have enough. Here you go.
0TO0007543	How about we just split this Med-X and... relax for a while?
0TO0007545	I know the right dose for a little thing like you. Medical training, you know.
0TO0007546	I used, like, a whole bunch of this stuff and I'm still fine.
0TO0007548	I wouldn't offer if it wasn't safe.  Do I look like someone who would hurt you?
0TO0007549	Mess you up? Nah, it's probably fine. Trust me.
0TO0007550	We girls have to stick together. Any chance you could give me a better deal?
0TO0007551	Fifty caps it is. Let's party.
0TO0007552	A hundred caps? I think you're the one getting the deal here.
0TO0007553	I'm a little short on caps.
0TO0007554	Uh... sorry. I don't count so good.
0TO0007555	< Blink. >
0TO0007556	Haha. You're dumber than me.
0TO0007557	I don't have a hundred caps on me.
0TO0007558	What are we waiting for?
0TO0007559	We can stay on Coyote Tail Ridge for the night.
0TO0007562	I'm not interested in your stories.
0TO0007563	You did what you were supposed to as a soldier.
0TO0007564	That's not what I would've done at all.
0TO0007565	How could you kill innocent people like that?
0TO0007566	Let's get out of here. Let them have Bitter Springs.
0TO0007567	Your only mistake was not bringing enough ammo.
0TO0007569	I'd prefer not to right now.
0TO0007570	Why would they come to Bitter Springs?
0TO0007571	Good. Saves us the trouble of finding them.
0TO0007572	You don't sound surprised.
0TO0007573	Can you tell me about Westside?
0TO0007574	Do you have a lot of run-ins with the Fiends?
0TO0007575	Tell me about the Scorpions.
0TO0007576	What's so great about the co-op?
0TO0007577	Do you know anything about that Super mutant walking around town?
0TO0007580	Enough about the Westside.
0TO0007581	How did he end up here on the Westside?
0TO0007582	People around here aren't afraid of him?
0TO0007583	Do you know how he got away from the NCR?
0TO0007584	I'd like to talk about something else now.
0TO0007586	You need to answer for your crime.
0TO0007588	No, I'm not going to lie for you.
0TO0007589	Say I keep Westside's secret - what's in it for me?
0TO0007590	Ten percent it is.
0TO0007591	I'd rather not turn you in, but someone else might come looking for White.
0TO0007592	Consider it done. You stay free and Westside keeps getting water.
0TO0007593	Forget I said anything. I'll keep your secret, but I'm turning you in.
0TO0007594	I'm taking you out, Anderson.
0TO0007596	Westside's secret is easily worth more, but I'm willing to settle for twenty percent.
0TO0007597	I'm keeping a very big secret. Twenty percent is fair.
0TO0007598	How about twenty percent? Twenty is better.
0TO0007599	I could say that... if the price was right.
0TO0007600	Keep your money. I'll just say that White was killed by the Scorpions.
0TO0007601	It'll be simpler to just kill you.
0TO0007602	Then I'm going to kill you.
0TO0007603	If I don't turn you in, will you stop stealing NCR water?
0TO0007604	Then I'll turn you in, and the water gets shut off.
0TO0007605	What bargain will you accept?
0TO0007606	I won't turn you in, but what happens when someone else comes looking for White?
0TO0007607	<Give NCR bug> NCR wants intel on Cottonwood Cove.
0TO0007608	By "captures," do you mean "slaves"?
0TO0007611	<Lie> Any fool can see that girl has all the symptoms of Pustular Hypomyalgia!
0TO0007612	But the girl is sick. With classic symptoms of, uh... Vagina Dentata?
0TO0007613	I can pay you 300 caps.
0TO0007615	I'll come back if I want to buy them.
0TO0007616	Relax, this'll be over quickly. <Set off the explosive in his collar>
0TO0007617	Let me deactivate your collar.
0TO0007618	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
0TO0007619	RF detonator? Give me a second.<Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
0TO0007620	Hold still! <Deactivate the charge and remove his collar>
0TO0007621	Never mind. I'll see if there is another way to free you.
0TO0007622	I'm working on it.
0TO0007623	Frank sent me to free you.
0TO0007624	I've paid for the three of you. You are free to go.
0TO0007626	Cry freedom! Run for it!
0TO0007627	Run for it!
0TO0007628	If you believe hard enough, you can do anything! Run!
0TO0007630	Hold still. <Deactivate the charge and remove her collar>
0TO0007631	Looks tougher than I thought. We'll have to find another solution.
0TO0007632	Don't worry your little head, Sammy. <Set off the explosive in her collar>
0TO0007637	20 gauge shotgun shells.
0TO0007638	9 mm.
0TO0007639	10 mm.
0TO0007640	.22 LR.
0TO0007641	.357 Magnum.
0TO0007642	Small Energy Cells.
0TO0007643	10 mm Submachine Gun [30 tags].
0TO0007644	Explosives.
0TO0007645	Dynamite [3 tags].
0TO0007646	Grenades [3 tags]
0TO0007647	9 mm Submachine Gun [20 tags].
0TO0007648	Laser Pistol [25 tags].
0TO0007649	Laser Rifle [50 tags].
0TO0007650	Leather Armor [15 tags].
0TO0007651	Reinforced Leather Armor [20 tags].
0TO0007652	I've spoken to the Great Khans. Their new leader has agreed to fight for the NCR.
0TO0007653	Not yet. I'm still working on it.
0TO0007656	You could say we've had dealings.
0TO0007657	I have a score to settle with them.
0TO0007658	I might have heard of them. Remind me.
0TO0007659	What if I find they're committed to joining Caesar?
0TO0007660	Will I have any NCR support in this?
0TO0007661	No questions, ma'am.
0TO0007662	No further questions, ma'am.
0TO0007663	No ma'am.
0TO0007664	The Khans won't be a problem to anyone ever again.
0TO0007666	Can you give me any leads?
0TO0007667	The Omertas were up to something big, but I stopped them.
0TO0007670	<Lie> The Omertas are planning to attack New Reno. It's none of NCR's concern.
0TO0007671	<Lie> You've got nothing to worry about. The Omertas are perfectly clean.
0TO0007672	I was hoping to ask you some questions.
0TO0007673	Mr. House won't be a problem. He's been disconnected from his system.
0TO0007674	I killed Mr. House.
0TO0007677	Is there no peaceful way to resolve this?
0TO0007678	How do you expect me to destroy an entire Brotherhood chapter?
0TO0007679	I thought the Brotherhood were all wiped out at HELIOS One. How could they have survived?
0TO0007681	The Brotherhood has been eliminated.
0TO0007684	I talked the Brotherhood into supporting the NCR.
0TO0007685	The president has departed safely.
0TO0007686	The president was killed by assassins.
0TO0007687	I don't know. The visit is still going on up there.
0TO0007690	I can handle them, no problem.
0TO0007692	You won't mind if I kill them?
0TO0007693	The mongrels won't touch me. Animals like me.
0TO0007694	You thought wrong.
0TO0007696	Let's do this.
0TO0007697	You call that a challenge? Ha.
0TO0007698	Nice dog.
0TO0007700	Uhh... wouldn't Sergeant Teddy be dead?
0TO0007701	They let you have toys here?
0TO0007702	I can't help you with that right now.
0TO0007706	Not so fast. What will you give me for him?
0TO0007707	< Tear Sergeant Teddy in half. >
0TO0007708	That's enough about the arena. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0007709	What are the rules?
0TO0007710	Who does the fighting?
0TO0007713	Got it. I'm ready.
0TO0007714	I need some time to prepare.
0TO0007718	Do you have anything for sale?
0TO0007720	You are using one broc flower per xander root, right?
0TO0007721	Maybe you could try using different plants and herbs?
0TO0007724	Any idea where I might find those books?
0TO0007725	Where you want me to look for them books?
0TO0007726	Let's talk about The Thorn.
0TO0007727	I've got questions about Westside.
0TO0007728	Tell me about you.
0TO0007730	What's this place?
0TO0007732	I'd like to ask about you.
0TO0007734	I've brought the Giant Mantis Eggs.
0TO0007735	I've brought the Night Stalker Eggs.
0TO0007736	I've brought the Deathclaw's Eggs.
0TO0007740	I've brought the Radscorpion Eggs.
0TO0007741	What's fighting in the next match?
0TO0007742	How do you train the creatures?
0TO0007745	I'll fight Giant Mantises.
0TO0007746	I'll fight Radscorpions.
0TO0007747	I'll fight Cazadores.
0TO0007748	I'll fight Geckos.
0TO0007749	I'll fight Deathclaws.
0TO0007750	Never mind, let's talk about something else.
0TO0007753	I want to fight in The Pit.
0TO0007756	One is good, for now.
0TO0007757	Two are no problem for me.
0TO0007758	Three of them, bring it on!
0TO0007761	I've brought the Fire Gecko Eggs.
0TO0007771	Tell me more about The Thorn.
0TO0007806	I'll fight Giant Radscorpions.
0TO0007810	I'm ready for greater challenges.
0TO0007814	I'll fight Night Stalkers.
0TO0007819	I want to set up a mixed fight.
0TO0007821	Do you set up custom fights?
0TO0007834	Cazador on Red.
0TO0007835	Nightstalker on Red.
0TO0007836	Giant Mantis on Red.
0TO0007837	Giant Radscorpion on Red.
0TO0007838	Radscorpion on Red.
0TO0007839	Fire Gecko on Red.

0TO0007846	Two Giant Rats on Blue.
0TO0007847	Three Giant Rats on Blue.
0TO0007848	Two Giant Mantises on Blue.
0TO0007850	Two Fiends on Blue.
0TO0007853	Giant Rat on Blue.
0TO0007854	Fiend on Blue.
0TO0007855	Here's 30 caps.
0TO0007857	I want to chose the contenders again.
0TO0007858	Let's go back to my earlier questions.
0TO0007860	Here's 40 caps.
0TO0007861	Here's 50 caps.
0TO0007862	Here's 60 caps.
0TO0007863	Here's 80 caps.
0TO0007864	Here's 70 caps.
0TO0007865	Here's 90 caps.
0TO0007866	Here's a 100 caps.
0TO0007867	Here's 120 caps.
0TO0007878	One Fiend on Blue.
0TO0007879	One Radscorpion on Blue.
0TO0007882	Two Radscorpions on Blue.
0TO0007883	Three Fiends on Blue.
0TO0007884	Three Radscorpions on Blue.

0TO0007908	Two Giant Mantises.

0TO0007910	Three Giant Mantises.
0TO0007919	Here's 210 caps.
0TO0007920	Here's 240 caps.
0TO0007921	Here's 280 caps.
0TO0007922	Here's 360 caps.
0TO0007923	Here's 420 caps.
0TO0007937	Tell me about the lottery.
0TO0007938	I don't need to hear the details.
0TO0007941	Your friends are safe.
0TO0007942	They're still in the mine.
0TO0007943	Were they the NCR hostages in the mine?
0TO0007944	They're already dead.
0TO0007945	I got them out alive.
0TO0007946	Captain Gilles at Bitter Springs needs reinforcements. Can you spare any?
0TO0007947	No, only looking around.
0TO0007948	Just minding my business.
0TO0007949	Wanted to ask some questions about the outpost.
0TO0007953	Do you think about Bitter Springs a lot?
0TO0007954	Maybe it would help to go back there.
0TO0007955	What changed your mind?
0TO0007956	Okay. We'll make it a point to stop there.
0TO0007957	I don't really have time for this now, Boone.
0TO0007958	Not my problem. You want to go? You're on your own.
0TO0007959	I'm ready to go to Bitter Springs.
0TO0007962	Food supplies.
0TO0007963	Ammo.
0TO0007964	Firearms.
0TO0007965	Armor.
0TO0007966	Grecks?
0TO0007967	Lady Jane?
0TO0007968	Santiago?
0TO0007970	Where would you get new troops from?
0TO0007971	What kind of supplies?
0TO0007972	How can I help with medical supplies?
0TO0007973	What's this about someone killing refugees?
0TO0007975	What happened to this town?
0TO0007978	I found this supply cache in a cave up the mountain. Maybe it will help.
0TO0007979	I found these supply caches in some caves up the mountain. Maybe they'll help.
0TO0007980	I found another supply cache for the camp.
0TO0007981	Medical texts? Aren't you a doctor?
0TO0007982	Major psycho-what-now?
0TO0007983	I'll keep my eyes open for books on pediatrics or psychological trauma, then.
0TO0007984	I'll look out for... books like what you said.
0TO0007985	My friend here is a doctor, maybe he could give you some training in those areas instead.
0TO0007986	<Lie, give radioactive supplies> These supplies should be "helpful." Enjoy them.
0TO0007988	These supplies are irradiated, but if we filter them with Rad-X they'll be safe.
0TO0007989	These supplies are radioactive, so swallow lots of lead before you eat them.
0TO0007991	Why is the flag upside down?
0TO0007992	Are you aware that your flag is upside down?
0TO0007993	Captain Gilles said to talk to you about medical aid for the camp.
0TO0007994	What kind of medical aid are you looking for again?
0TO0007997	What kind of aid were you looking for again?
0TO0007998	I found one of those books you wanted.
0TO0007999	I found those books you wanted.
0TO0008000	I found another book for you.
0TO0008003	Are things going better at the camp now?
0TO0008004	How are things around the camp?
0TO0008006	Better for her to die than live a Legion slave.
0TO0008007	You should've tried to rescue her. Even if it meant your death.
0TO0008008	You had no right to make that decision.
0TO0008009	You make it sound like your wife's death was inevitable.
0TO0008010	Why do you think you've got bad things coming?
0TO0008011	I don't understand.
0TO0008013	You're not going to tell me?
0TO0008014	Were you at Bitter Springs with First Recon?
0TO0008015	You must've been at Bitter Springs. What happened there?
0TO0008016	That's it? You won?
0TO0008017	I've seen my share of terrible things. You can talk to me about it.
0TO0008018	How can you say that? We've been fighting together.
0TO0008019	Tell me about it.
0TO0008020	You want me to make good on my promise to fight the Legion with you, is that it?
0TO0008021	Sounded like more of a massacre.
0TO0008022	Must've been one hell of a miscommunication.
0TO0008023	There must be more to it than that.
0TO0008024	Sounds like you have some regrets.
0TO0008025	That's true. You can't second guess what you do out there.
0TO0008026	Being a mindless drone is just as dangerous. You have to think for yourself.
0TO0008027	It is because of Bitter Springs that you think you've got bad things coming?
0TO0008028	Maybe you can make up for your mistakes.
0TO0008029	Life doesn't work that way. Your misfortunes are just bad luck.
0TO0008030	If it's out of your control, why worry about it?
0TO0008031	How do you know your punishment isn't over?
0TO0008033	I helped Troike out, like you asked.
0TO0008034	I finished that work for Clanden.
0TO0008035	I finished all the work you had for me.
0TO0008036	Saint James and Dermot were behind it. They're dead now.
0TO0008037	I found this evidence in their rooms - they attacked when I confronted them.
0TO0008038	Proof enough. Let's talk about my reward.
0TO0008039	I'll keep looking.
0TO0008041	Any ideas what to look for?
0TO0008043	I found all the evidence you'll need from Saint James' and Dermot's rooms. Here.
0TO0008044	What is it you aren't telling me about what happened to your wife?
0TO0008045	I don't feel like I can trust you.
0TO0008046	I want to understand you better.
0TO0008047	You're right. I was out of line.
0TO0008048	I think it's time you told me what happened to your wife.
0TO0008049	You're hiding something. Spit it out. You owe me.
0TO0008050	The better we understand each other, the more effective we'll be.
0TO0008051	I just want to know.
0TO0008053	I didn't mention Aerotech.
0TO0008054	Um, what is an "Aerotech?"
0TO0008055	And yet you know the missing people are refugees.
0TO0008056	But you got to know more than me!
0TO0008057	Will you pay a bounty for NCR troops I kill?
0TO0008059	If you trade me ammo and supplies instead, I can stay in the area, racking up kills.
0TO0008060	How many dog tags to get your helmet?
0TO0008061	I'll come back when I've made some kills.
0TO0008065	Here, take all the dog tags I've got.
0TO0008071	I can't believe you just said that.
0TO0008072	Skip the puns. What is this idea you have?
0TO0008073	Of course I will be. I'm the best at everything.
0TO0008074	Okay you talked me into it.
0TO0008075	I couldn't care less.
0TO0008076	I'll kill you for asking.
0TO0008077	That is the stupidest joke I've heard.
0TO0008078	That's hilarious. You think of it on your own?
0TO0008080	Count me out.
0TO0008081	Skip the jokes. I'm in.
0TO0008082	I love fighting. I'm going back out there now.
0TO0008083	I still don't know.
0TO0008084	If you're looking for someone in particular, I could tip you off if I see them.
0TO0008085	Who were you looking for? Come on, you can tell me. Please?
0TO0008086	Sorry, no one parts me from my weapons.
0TO0008087	Yep, let's rock.
0TO0008088	Do you have any rooms available?
0TO0008089	What is there to do around here?
0TO0008090	<Lie> Well Nero didn't tell me any of this when he convinced me to take you out.
0TO0008091	I've got a message for you, from Carlitos.
0TO0008092	Have you actually tried that?
0TO0008095	I'll be back later. Don't go running off anywhere.
0TO0008096	Sorry, not interested.
0TO0008098	Not good enough.
0TO0008099	About that favor you owe me...
0TO0008101	I don't want to abuse Mr. House's trust.
0TO0008102	Because I don't give a shit about the Followers or anyone else in this dump.
0TO0008104	Dr. [%] diagnoses a terminally low discussion of caps in this conversation.
0TO0008105	Yeah, well I'm suffering from a lack of caps. What can you do for me?
0TO0008106	So, are you... paying me for this?
0TO0008109	What happened to this Brahmin?
0TO0008110	Is the dead Brahmin contagious?
0TO0008111	I'm not exactly a friend of the Legion, you know.
0TO0008112	I could probably find a use for some of this meat.
0TO0008114	I'll just keep bugging you until you say yes, you know.
0TO0008116	Do you work for one of the casinos?
0TO0008117	Mr. House gets half of each day's take?
0TO0008118	You bet, I'm parched.
0TO0008121	What about The Kings?
0TO0008124	What's your opinion of Mr. House?
0TO0008125	What do you think of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0008126	What do you know about the Van Graffs?
0TO0008127	This would be as an "escort."
0TO0008128	When I say "escort," I mean "prostitute."
0TO0008129	Turns out there are customers looking for someone just like you.
0TO0008131	You'd be an independent - with a deep discount on the booze, maybe?
0TO0008132	Let's face it... this is the only way you're going to get any action.
0TO0008134	It's not like you'd be a slave. You'd get to choose your clients.
0TO0008135	You'll be paid well, and room and board is on the house.
0TO0008136	Perhaps a bottle of Jacob's Absinthe might convince you?
0TO0008138	Sorry Jacob, I haven't found those chems yet.
0TO0008140	Can you forge a handwritten note for me?
0TO0008141	I need a note written to Pacer from Jean-Baptiste Cutting.
0TO0008142	Just that Jean-Baptiste has Pacer's jet.
0TO0008143	How did you get enough money to enter The Strip?
0TO0008144	What does it involve?
0TO0008145	I don't have the time right now.
0TO0008146	Stop bugging me.
0TO0008147	The King wants to help with the relief effort.
0TO0008148	Which are?
0TO0008149	Sure. Serve me up something.
0TO0008150	Ah, not right now. Thanks.
0TO0008151	What are you serving?
0TO0008152	Do you know anything about NCR soldiers here in Freeside?
0TO0008153	The King thinks those troops have been attacking Locals.
0TO0008154	Can you tell me anything else about them?
0TO0008155	Nothing, let's talk about something else.
0TO0008156	I'll head over right away.
0TO0008157	I'll look into it when I can.
0TO0008158	The Local men were attacked by soldiers. One of the men was identified by rank.
0TO0008159	They're only handing out supplies to NCR citizens.
0TO0008160	I'm still looking into the matter.
0TO0008162	They refuse to serve Locals.
0TO0008163	I still haven't found anything.
0TO0008164	Can I ask you a few questions?
0TO0008165	It seemed fairly innocent.
0TO0008167	They said someone was sent to discuss the issue with you.
0TO0008168	Let's not act rashly here.
0TO0008169	They said the man was severely beaten and barely survived.
0TO0008170	The man was attacked and driven off. He never arrived.
0TO0008179	I left one of my companions in the freezer for your enjoyment.
0TO0008182	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.
0TO0008183	Do you serve food to Locals as well?
0TO0008184	Yes, but I was afraid he wouldn't get served.
0TO0008185	No, I was just curious.
0TO0008186	Why don't you serve Locals?
0TO0008188	Julie Farkas told me to ask. She said it was important.
0TO0008189	And the King refused?
0TO0008191	Let me guess, something bad happened to the envoy.
0TO0008192	I thought I'd save everyone some time and just kill you.
0TO0008193	That wasn't him. He didn't even know an envoy was sent.
0TO0008194	What's my silence worth to you?
0TO0008196	That's a good start...
0TO0008197	That's it?
0TO0008198	Thanks. I suddenly forgot what I was going to tell the King.
0TO0008199	I still think he should know about it.
0TO0008200	You're right. He shouldn't be bothered with rumors right now.
0TO0008201	Thanks. This will keep me warm while I tell the story to the King.
0TO0008202	What's your trick?
0TO0008203	Who is Michael Angelo?
0TO0008204	Tell me again about Michael Angelo.
0TO0008206	I better go.
0TO0008208	I heard your family has a grudge against a King named Pacer.
0TO0008209	I was thinking of raiding his jet stash.
0TO0008210	Why don't you just kill him?
0TO0008211	Tell me about the Van Graffs.
0TO0008212	Tell me about your siblings.
0TO0008214	What are the symptoms of Hydra use?
0TO0008215	People using Hydra have their skin turn purple, right?
0TO0008216	What do you know about Hoover Dam?
0TO0008218	Tell me about the first battle.
0TO0008219	Must have been rough.
0TO0008220	Let's go back to my previous questions.
0TO0008223	Whatever it is, I think you need it more than I do.
0TO0008224	Then why did I find this empty syringe in your pocket?
0TO0008225	Private Sexton mentioned you wander around the camp at night.
0TO0008226	I know what's really going on. You can trust me.
0TO0008227	Yeah, right. Why don't you tell me what's really going on?
0TO0008228	I sometimes do the same thing.
0TO0008229	For some reason I don't believe you.
0TO0008230	You filed a report which said Legion Super Mutants wiped out an NCR patrol.
0TO0008234	Why are you out here alone?
0TO0008235	I'll take a look and see if there's anything I can do.
0TO0008236	You sure they're still alive?
0TO0008237	Extra encouragement would also increase their chances.
0TO0008238	Alright. It can't hurt to try.
0TO0008239	The odds are too small. You're on your own.
0TO0008240	It's your own damn fault. Help them yourself.
0TO0008241	I changed my mind. I'll save your squad.
0TO0008242	I'm going nowhere in particular.
0TO0008243	I have no time to talk right now.
0TO0008244	Yes. But why does that matter to you?
0TO0008245	Sorry. I need to go.
0TO0008246	Okay I will help you.
0TO0008247	I really can't do that.
0TO0008248	What are you doing out here alone?
0TO0008249	Armed? Look at these biceps!
0TO0008250	And what would you need me for?
0TO0008251	Just those? You calling me weak? I'll show you weak!
0TO0008252	I can't help you right now.
0TO0008256	Hit me with a stimpak, Doc.
0TO0008257	<Pay 10 caps>
0TO0008258	Heal me up completely.
0TO0008259	I've got some wounds I need you to look at.
0TO0008261	<Pay 25 caps>
0TO0008262	<Pay 75 caps>
0TO0008264	I could use another hit with a stimpak.
0TO0008265	Just staple it all together. I'll fix my gimpy bits later.
0TO0008269	Why can't you take care of this yourself?
0TO0008270	I'll check up on her for you.
0TO0008271	I'll consider it.
0TO0008272	Why is your bodyguard allowed to have a gun?
0TO0008273	I need medical treatment.
0TO0008274	I have wounds that need mending.
0TO0008275	I need help with an addiction.
0TO0008283	Yes, cure me. Here's 50 caps.
0TO0008284	I can't afford treatment. I don't have 50 caps.
0TO0008286	Fix me.
0TO0008287	Okay, fix me. Here's 50 caps.
0TO0008288	Sorry, I don't have 50 caps.
0TO0008290	Actually, I changed my mind.
0TO0008291	I'd like to trade.
0TO0008294	The Legion is watching out for this woman. Go ahead, cross them. I dare you.
0TO0008295	Kill her and Caesar's Legion will get you.
0TO0008297	Do whatever you want. I just want to loot the room.
0TO0008299	What's playing at the Aces right now?
0TO0008301	What's the situation here?
0TO0008302	I was in the area, that's all.
0TO0008303	How can I help break the stalemate?
0TO0008305	Why haven't you attacked the enemy?
0TO0008307	You're demoralizing the enemy by leaving them alone?
0TO0008308	I've already killed everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0008313	I've slaughtered the enemy at Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0008314	Sounds like fun. I'll be right back.
0TO0008315	No offense intended. Carry on.
0TO0008318	I'm going to kill everyone at Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0008323	Nothing new to report, actually.
0TO0008325	I'll carry your blade with honor.
0TO0008326	Why would I want a piece of shit machete?
0TO0008327	You earned your blade. Keep it.
0TO0008328	Here you go. <Hand over all weapons>
0TO0008329	Okay. <Keep holdout weapons>
0TO0008331	I have news from Carlitos.
0TO0008332	He'll meet us in Freeside around midnight. I'll sneak you out in disguise.
0TO0008334	Are you ready to get out?
0TO0008336	Wait a minute.
0TO0008337	Never mind. Let's get you out of here.
0TO0008340	Let me make sure I'm ready.
0TO0008345	Five words: From. My. Cold. Dead. Hands.
0TO0008346	I've got a better idea. How about I kill you and take my guns in anyways?
0TO0008347	What is your assignment?
0TO0008348	So there's no hope in Hope.
0TO0008349	Wow. Bringing up morale must be a difficult.
0TO0008350	Hell yeah. Tell me about it.
0TO0008351	I don't know. It doesn't sound very good.
0TO0008352	Here are some ears.
0TO0008354	I don't want to talk.
0TO0008355	Are you complaining?
0TO0008356	About that competition.
0TO0008357	Have you heard anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
0TO0008359	Maybe another time.
0TO0008360	How's the morale doing?
0TO0008361	What makes you think that?
0TO0008363	I need some injuries patched up.
0TO0008365	1000 caps? Sounds good. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0008367	It's a great start... but well below market price.
0TO0008368	Raise your price or... or... you'll be "chip outta luck."
0TO0008369	I'll hang on to the Chip for now.
0TO0008370	I can get a better price elsewhere.
0TO0008371	I guess I'll accept your original offer.
0TO0008372	I can do better.
0TO0008373	What happens next?
0TO0008374	You think your Securitrons can defeat Caesar's Legion *and* the NCR?
0TO0008375	I'll be on my way, Mr. House.
0TO0008376	How do I open the hatch?
0TO0008377	What's inside the hatch?
0TO0008378	All right, I'll do as you ask.
0TO0008379	Why should I be working for you?
0TO0008380	No thanks, Mr. House.
0TO0008382	And what then? You want me to kill Caesar?
0TO0008383	It's not safe for me to go back. The Legion will attack me on sight.
0TO0008384	I'm still looking into it.
0TO0008385	I've found evidence of an Omerta plot.
0TO0008386	The Omertas who were conspiring against you are dead.
0TO0008388	I've secured their loyalty. They'll do as I say.
0TO0008389	The Boomers and I don't get along. I'd rather keep my distance.
0TO0008390	I had to wipe out their leadership.
0TO0008391	The Brotherhood of Steel has been wiped out.
0TO0008392	When the Legion assaults the dam, the Brotherhood will attack the NCR and weaken them.
0TO0008396	My only regret is that he got away.
0TO0008397	I did my best, but the Legion did better.
0TO0008398	So Kimball's dead. So what?
0TO0008399	Of course. Here it is.
0TO0008400	I have some questions to ask first...
0TO0008401	Not so fast, Mr. House. We need to discuss payment.
0TO0008402	I'm not going to give you the Chip.
0TO0008404	You could work off your debt.
0TO0008405	Work for James Garret as an escort.
0TO0008406	<Lie and give 600 caps> I collected all of the debts.
0TO0008408	I'd like to browse your special inventory.
0TO0008410	I've noticed Legionaries prefer using machetes as weapons.
0TO0008411	How are women treated around here?
0TO0008418	Mortimer wants to release the kid, if he'll cooperate. I'm the negotiator.
0TO0008419	Your naked body, stud. Go into the dumpster and I'll meet you after I change.
0TO0008420	I'm just here to talk.
0TO0008421	You keep tilting your head to one side. Is your neck okay?
0TO0008422	I can get that out for you. <Apply Sleeper Hold>
0TO0008423	Try breathing deeply three times and then blowing on your thumb.
0TO0008424	Did you know there's a nerve in your neck that helps you sleep? <Strike Nerve>
0TO0008427	You. You don't seem like you fit in here.
0TO0008429	What's so bad about your reputation?
0TO0008430	Joining the White Glove Society could clear your name. They're respected.
0TO0008431	Talk to a man named Mortimer. He's looking for some big-name new members.
0TO0008432	<Lie> I'll do it. Where can I find Ted Gunderson?
0TO0008433	<Lie> I'll do the job you proposed. Where do I find Ted Gunderson?
0TO0008434	Wouldn't putting St. Clair's body into a dumpster give it a terrible taste?
0TO0008435	I trapped Carlyle St. Clair in the dumpster outside his house.
0TO0008436	I sent Carlyle St. Clair to come and speak with you.
0TO0008437	Carlyle St. Clair is dead.
0TO0008438	Never mind, let's talk about Joana.
0TO0008439	How do I get her out of Gomorrah?
0TO0008440	Where in Freeside will you meet us?
0TO0008447	It's my pleasure.
0TO0008448	Let's talk about my fee.
0TO0008450	No need. Helping you was enough.
0TO0008451	I think 400 caps is a fair deal.
0TO0008453	Actually, I don't want anything.
0TO0008454	Why don't you get her out of Gomorrah?
0TO0008455	My help has a price.
0TO0008456	200 caps will do.
0TO0008458	Joana's dead.
0TO0008460	Your boss will hear about how you spoiled the mission.
0TO0008461	You've got two choices. Live or die.
0TO0008462	There's an opportunity for profit, here.
0TO0008463	Let's finish this.
0TO0008465	Carlitos is trading what he stole for Joana. I was hired to see that he does.
0TO0008466	Your boss kept it a secret. Carlitos would've not dealt directly with Omertas.
0TO0008467	I... I was hired to, you know, draw Carlitos out of hiding.
0TO0008468	Well, this is my... initiation test, to prove myself to the Omertas.
0TO0008469	Your crew? You mean those little men shaking like leaves behind you?
0TO0008470	Good! Today I haven't had a chance to crush anyone to a pulp, yet.
0TO0008471	Leave us alone or I'll... I'll beat you and, yeah, your crew too, I think.
0TO0008472	I'm going... to, to deal with you first, yeah. That's it.
0TO0008473	A big profit. 500 caps for you and your men to enjoy as you wish.
0TO0008474	A big profit. 500 caps would net you... well, lots of things, no?
0TO0008475	Right, loyalty is worth more than, say, a 1000 caps.
0TO0008476	Make it a 1000 caps. That's enough to betray the Omertas, no?
0TO0008483	You should know that Heck's dead.
0TO0008484	I have some questions for you.
0TO0008485	Why was Heck such a threat to other ranchers?
0TO0008487	I've dealt with the Gundersons.
0TO0008488	You don't have to worry about Heck, ever again.
0TO0008490	Heck and Ted are dead.
0TO0008491	I've got some questions for you.
0TO0008492	Two Gundersons, that's worth a 1000 caps at least.
0TO0008493	I don't charge for good deeds.
0TO0008495	The big Gunderson's worth 750 caps, at least.
0TO0008496	The young Gunderson's worth 500 caps, at least.
0TO0008497	I've news about Heck Gunderson.
0TO0008507	We said 400 for information about Heck, right?
0TO0008508	We do.
0TO0008510	Okay, 200 for information about Heck, right?
0TO0008513	Wait, what?
0TO0008515	Is anything wrong?
0TO0008516	Just thought I'd stop in and say hello.
0TO0008517	For starters, what in the hell just happened?
0TO0008518	I thought you hated the NCR?
0TO0008519	Just start at the beginning.
0TO0008520	So now the Van Graffs are allied with the NCR?
0TO0008521	Wouldn't you have made just as much money dealing with the Legion?
0TO0008523	It's complicated. Hanlon caused the misinformation, but I convinced him to stop.
0TO0008524	That's not important. It's over.
0TO0008525	He wanted to scare the NCR into retreating from this region - all to save lives.
0TO0008526	Can't you snipe the captives from up here?
0TO0008528	What would I have to do?
0TO0008530	How about I rescue them instead?
0TO0008532	I put the captives out of their misery.
0TO0008533	Looks like I was able to get a few of the hostages out alive.
0TO0008534	Nothing new to report on my end.
0TO0008536	Never mind. See you around.
0TO0008537	I'll be going then.
0TO0008538	Yes, I'll do it.
0TO0008542	Did one of your contractors get lost?
0TO0008544	As a last request, will you tell me more about your plan?
0TO0008545	Err.. can you tell me what the plan was?
0TO0008546	So tell me about your plan.
0TO0008548	I'd like to talk first.
0TO0008550	I want to talk about Carlitos.
0TO0008552	I have questions about Gomorrah.
0TO0008553	What can you tell me about the Omertas?
0TO0008554	Tell me about your problem.
0TO0008560	Tell me about the Omertas.
0TO0008561	Tell me about Cachino.
0TO0008562	I want to know about Carlitos.
0TO0008566	I have questions about you.
0TO0008568	About your problem, let's go to your room.
0TO0008570	I want to know about Cachino.
0TO0008571	I'd like to talk about Carlitos.
0TO0008573	Tell me about Gomorrah.
0TO0008575	I actually found you an escort who's a ghoul *and* a cowboy.
0TO0008576	Her name's Beatrix, and she can start immediately.
0TO0008578	Where did you get the gun, anyway?
0TO0008579	What do you need artillery for?
0TO0008580	What do you sell?
0TO0008582	Tell me about the Strip.
0TO0008585	What can you tell me about the Omertas.
0TO0008587	You wanted a smooth-talker for an escort? I found one.
0TO0008588	Santiago's your man.
0TO0008589	Let's talk about Freeside.
0TO0008590	What's all the fuss about the water pump?
0TO0008591	Who are The Kings?
0TO0008592	What do you know about Mick and Ralph?
0TO0008594	What's the Atomic Wrangler?
0TO0008596	I'd like to know more about Freeside.
0TO0008597	Who is The King?
0TO0008599	What's up with the Atomic Wrangler?
0TO0008600	What sort of show are you talking about?
0TO0008601	Where do I find the Aces Theater?
0TO0008602	Get away from me.
0TO0008603	Who is the Lonesome Drifter?
0TO0008604	Who's Bruce Issac?
0TO0008610	I wanted to check on the troopers sent from Camp Forlorn Hope.
0TO0008611	I heard sounds of a struggle in the Ultra-Luxe Penthouse.
0TO0008612	I've heard your group dines on human flesh.
0TO0008613	I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
0TO0008614	<Lie> I, too, know what it is to feel the Craving. How can I support your cause?
0TO0008615	<Lie> I sort of tasted human flesh once. Mmm mmm good. Tell me all your secrets.
0TO0008616	So it isn't true?
0TO0008618	Do you have any work that needs to be done?
0TO0008619	The main course is a person?
0TO0008620	[Attack] He's the least of your problems right now, cannibal.
0TO0008621	I think you have the wrong person for this job.
0TO0008623	Arcade.
0TO0008624	Tell me what I need to do.
0TO0008625	What about the boy you kidnapped?
0TO0008628	[Attack] I can't let you get away with what you've done.
0TO0008629	<Hushed> Would my companion here make a suitable replacement meal?
0TO0008630	Boone.
0TO0008631	Cass.
0TO0008633	I'll do the job you proposed.
0TO0008634	I framed Heck Gunderson and sent a Securitron to arrest him.
0TO0008635	Did you succeed in turning the White Glove Society back to cannibalism?
0TO0008637	I convinced Ted it was all a terrible misunderstanding.
0TO0008638	Ted Gunderson is dead. He wouldn't listen to reason.
0TO0008639	Couldn't Heck just claim intruders killed his son?
0TO0008640	I planted evidence in Heck Gunderson's room.
0TO0008641	Your dad's powerful. Someone wants him to feud with the White Glove Society.
0TO0008642	Er... probably just some mixed up people who are really sorry.
0TO0008643	I'm here on Joana's behalf.
0TO0008644	She didn't know if you were still alive.
0TO0008646	First, let me ask you some questions.
0TO0008647	I'll let her know.
0TO0008648	Will you answer my questions now?
0TO0008649	Okay, I'll let her know that you'll help.
0TO0008650	I'll try, but not for free.
0TO0008651	200 caps and we have a deal.
0TO0008652	Never mind. I don't need anything.
0TO0008653	I'll try talking with her, but not for free.
0TO0008654	Does the name "Carlitos" ring a bell?
0TO0008655	What sort of debt do you owe Carlitos?
0TO0008657	Carlitos is ready to cash in his chips.
0TO0008658	Carlitos says he's ready to cash in his chips.
0TO0008659	The "where" is Freeside, and "now" would be a good time.
0TO0008662	I'm looking for Michael Angelo.
0TO0008665	Where can I find Michael Angelo?
0TO0008666	How long have you worked here?
0TO0008668	I can't right now.
0TO0008670	In that case, I'm out.
0TO0008671	Who is this girl?
0TO0008673	I've changed my mind. I'll take the job.
0TO0008675	Just thought I'd say hi.
0TO0008676	She's dead.
0TO0008678	I am.
0TO0008680	I'm sorry, you've mistaken me for someone else.
0TO0008681	Who is we?
0TO0008682	It's right here.
0TO0008683	Where's the payment?
0TO0008685	My employers managed to negotiate a small fee for this drop a short time ago.
0TO0008686	Surely you were told to pay the Van Graffs' messenger?
0TO0008687	Never mind, I must have confused this with one of my other deliveries.
0TO0008688	What were you informed of?
0TO0008689	A little morbid, isn't it?
0TO0008691	How do things look around the camp?
0TO0008692	What's your take on the NCR's position here?
0TO0008696	Let's attack from the north.
0TO0008697	We should attack from the ridge on the east.
0TO0008698	Judging from the economic state of Freeside, they can't be paying you that much.
0TO0008699	Sure, since this is the only casino in the whole town, you must make a ton!
0TO0008700	Really? How much are you making?
0TO0008701	Sure, I bet you're raking in the cash in this dump.
0TO0008702	I could talk to Garret and try to convince him to let you go.
0TO0008703	Well, tough luck. Let me know if you change your mind.
0TO0008705	How rude.
0TO0008706	Hey there.
0TO0008710	I could pay you..
0TO0008711	He's not the right fit for this place. You'll find better performers.
0TO0008712	But how much do you lose on folk not coming into a place with a ghoul performer?
0TO0008713	If you don't I'll tear out your spleen and then rip this place down.
0TO0008714	I'll pay you 100 and not a cap more.
0TO0008715	Here you go, 150 caps.
0TO0008716	I'll come back when I have enough.
0TO0008720	Fine, I'll come up with something later.
0TO0008723	What's the Omertas' role in Gomorrah?
0TO0008724	Tell me about their leaders.
0TO0008728	Carlitos wants to get you out of here.
0TO0008731	You keep avoiding my questions. Are you bothered by them?
0TO0008732	Joana, you can trust me. Why are you avoiding my questions?
0TO0008733	You don't look good. Are you... ill or something?
0TO0008734	Contracted pupils, involuntary spasms... Med-X kills quickly, Joana. I can help.
0TO0008735	All right. Lead the way.
0TO0008737	Trust me, I'll keep you safe.
0TO0008738	I... don't know, but we'll figure it out.
0TO0008739	I had other questions first.
0TO0008740	You'll never see them again, you have my word.
0TO0008741	Don't worry, I'll tell him that you are happy to hear from him.
0TO0008742	I have other questions for you.
0TO0008743	You'll just have to hope it all works out... I guess.
0TO0008745	What's the deal with Cachino?
0TO0008746	What's happened to you?
0TO0008750	What's Carlitos' story?
0TO0008751	Cachino talked because Carlitos broke Omerta rules?
0TO0008752	I know Carlitos.
0TO0008753	Sorry, I'm not interested in this right now.
0TO0008755	I've talked to Carlitos, but not about you.
0TO0008756	All right. I'll talk to him.
0TO0008757	What if Carlitos lives?
0TO0008758	If he lives, I'll find him for you.
0TO0008762	Anything...
0TO0008763	Nothing, I'll find him for you.
0TO0008764	200 caps would do, for now.
0TO0008765	You know what I want, Joana.
0TO0008767	I want to ask you something else.
0TO0008768	I expect something in return.
0TO0008770	So, you want me to talk to Carlitos?
0TO0008771	I'll talk to him for you.
0TO0008776	What do you know of the White Glove Society?
0TO0008777	How could savage cannibals run the Ultra-Luxe?
0TO0008778	How did you capture Benny?
0TO0008779	What happened after Benny was caught?
0TO0008781	President Tandi was voted into office each time.
0TO0008782	How is the NCR weak?
0TO0008783	Surely, the NCR is a powerful foe?
0TO0008784	What do you know about Mr. House?
0TO0008785	What did you know about Mr. House?
0TO0008786	What role will regional powers play in the conflict?
0TO0008787	How did you rise to power?
0TO0008788	You were a Follower of the Apocalypse?
0TO0008789	What changed you from a Follower to dictator?
0TO0008790	Why would learning dialects be a waste of time?
0TO0008791	What was wrong with the Blackfoot?
0TO0008792	What steps did you take?
0TO0008793	What happened after you trained the Blackfoot?
0TO0008794	What happened to the tribes?
0TO0008795	And since forming the Legion, all you've done is conquer other tribes?
0TO0008796	Why is Caesar's Legion so... strange?
0TO0008797	What does "Pax Romana" mean?
0TO0008798	So you'll destroy the NCR because you hate its inefficiencies?
0TO0008799	"Hegelian Dialectics?" What are those?
0TO0008800	So what's "dialectic" about you and the NCR?
0TO0008802	I'm looking for information.
0TO0008803	Nothing right now.
0TO0008804	I hear you have some exotic tastes when it comes to women.
0TO0008806	Oh, I was just told to deliver a girl to the spare room you keep up here.
0TO0008807	Well... I... I have some exotic tastes too!
0TO0008808	I thought that maybe I could be your next playtoy. Your exploits are well known.
0TO0008809	Sorry, I was thinking about someone else. I have a different question though.
0TO0008811	I think the authorities would like to hear these tapes I found in your safe.
0TO0008813	I'll give you the tapes if you promise to leave Vegas and never come back, and give me 200 caps.
0TO0008814	If you... um... give me 300 caps and leave Vegas, I'll keep these tapes safe.
0TO0008815	I can't give you these tapes, they are evidence of a crime.
0TO0008816	I always have what it takes.
0TO0008817	I... don't know, uh, what does it take?
0TO0008825	I'll... I'm sure something good.
0TO0008826	The better question is what are *you* going to do with it.
0TO0008830	How does a 100 caps sound?
0TO0008831	How does 75 caps sound?
0TO0008832	I am. Lead the way.
0TO0008834	Actually, I'm short on caps right now.
0TO0008837	Actually, let me ask you some questions.
0TO0008838	I just have some questions for you.
0TO0008840	Do you like it here?
0TO0008841	Let's talk about having fun.
0TO0008843	What's the deal with Gomorrah?
0TO0008844	Tell me about Gomorrah's clients.
0TO0008845	I'm here for some fun.
0TO0008848	Attack me and you risk destroying the Chip.
0TO0008849	Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0008850	I'm not afraid of you, Mr. House. The Platinum Chip belongs to me.
0TO0008851	I think that sounds insane.
0TO0008852	What do you want me to do there?
0TO0008854	I've already visited Caesar.
0TO0008857	And what then?
0TO0008862	Let's talk about that mission after all.
0TO0008863	I'll make it up to you. What do we do next?
0TO0008864	What does the Platinum Chip do?
0TO0008865	I'll be on my way. Goodbye.
0TO0008866	What's my stake in this?
0TO0008869	You want the Chip? Here it is. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0008871	Here, take it. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0008872	I'm still not giving you the Chip.
0TO0008874	What does the Chip do, exactly?
0TO0008875	I'll be on my way, then...
0TO0008876	Why show your hand like that? Now your enemies know what you're up to.
0TO0008880	Let me ask some questions first.
0TO0008881	The Chip's been delivered. We're through.
0TO0008882	I guess you can tell me about the mission.
0TO0008890	So you want me to go back there and kill Caesar?
0TO0008895	I'm not planning to go to the Fort.
0TO0008896	I'm not planning to visit the Fort.
0TO0008899	I'm surprised you haven't asked what became of Benny.
0TO0008905	I do have questions to ask.
0TO0008906	Like I said, I'm not interested.
0TO0008907	I'll go to the Fort as you ask.
0TO0008909	I'll do as you ask, Mr. House.
0TO0008911	Fine, I'll do as you ask.
0TO0008912	Got any advice to share?
0TO0008914	One of the employee perks is a discount...
0TO0008915	Caps are caps, honey. You can't be picky about how you make them!
0TO0008916	You could be the next big thing at the Wrangler.
0TO0008918	So, who are you?
0TO0008920	What are you doing with the Followers?
0TO0008921	I bet you've seen a lot over the years.
0TO0008922	I'm in the market for something a little unusual.
0TO0008923	Sounds good to me. <Pay 25 caps.>
0TO0008925	No chatty games, Santiago. I don't have time for this.
0TO0008927	James Garret is looking for a suave escort. Interested in some work?
0TO0008928	I'd like to hire you for a bit.
0TO0008929	Here you go. <Pay 25 caps>
0TO0008930	That all you've got, robot?
0TO0008932	I've got the detox chems you need.
0TO0008934	Jacob, be strong. You just need the support of your friends to get through this.
0TO0008935	Jacob, drugs are for the weak.
0TO0008936	Seems like you need a steady supply, not just whatever I can grab for you.
0TO0008937	Which merchants might be willing to make a deal?
0TO0008938	I need medical services.
0TO0008939	A regular shipment of supplies is what you need here.
0TO0008940	I have some medical supplies to drop off.
0TO0008941	Med-X
0TO0008942	Rad-Away
0TO0008943	Fixer
0TO0008944	I've got a chem problem.
0TO0008945	I've been exposed to radiation.
0TO0008948	<Pay 100 caps>
0TO0008960	They just need tech support and raw materials.
0TO0008961	The Garrets should be sending over supplies shortly.
0TO0008962	Do you sell medical supplies?
0TO0008963	I'd like to buy medical supplies.
0TO0008966	Why charge for water?
0TO0008967	How much for a drink?
0TO0008968	Can I buy bottled water?
0TO0008971	Do you have any special items for sale?
0TO0008974	The Followers are looking to work out a supply deal.
0TO0008976	Pacer, I won't let you ruin this opportunity.
0TO0008977	I think that's up to the King.
0TO0008978	I was afraid this would happen. Sergeant, you know what to do.
0TO0008980	So you'll fight him *and* the NCR? Can the Kings afford to fight each other?
0TO0008981	Just shut up and do what your leader tells you!
0TO0008982	It appears the Kings are a worthless pack of thugs. Sergeant, they're all yours.
0TO0008983	We're dealing with the King, not you.
0TO0008984	The Followers are looking to set up a supply deal.
0TO0008985	What if they are?
0TO0008986	Freeside gets more food, water, and electricity.
0TO0008987	The NCR is willing to help supply Freeside in exchange for peace.
0TO0008988	Just hear them out. They're offering generous terms.
0TO0008989	You stop the attacks on NCR citizens, and your supply problems disappear.
0TO0008990	The Kings have to stop the violence against people from the NCR.
0TO0008991	They're just here as an escort. Now do you want to hear their offer or not?
0TO0008992	No catch. You just make sure no King attack an NCR citizen from now on.
0TO0008993	I want to join the Kings.
0TO0008994	Can you get me into the Strip?
0TO0008995	I could really use some money...
0TO0008996	I'd like to think about it.
0TO0008997	I wanted to talk about something else.
0TO0008999	All I'm asking is that you try.
0TO0009000	The Kings will follow your leadership.
0TO0009001	Well, if you can't do it...
0TO0009002	I need you to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
0TO0009003	Can I join the Kings?
0TO0009005	I'm addicted to something.
0TO0009006	I could use some patching up.
0TO0009007	I have radiation sickness.
0TO0009015	<Pay 90 caps>
0TO0009016	<Pay 80 caps>
0TO0009023	<Pay 67 caps>
0TO0009024	<Pay 60 caps>
0TO0009026	Rex? I picked him up in New Vegas.
0TO0009027	<Lie> He just started following me one day. I have no idea where he came from.
0TO0009028	Why do you want to know?
0TO0009031	What happened to the rest of your tribe?
0TO0009032	You don't hate the Legion for what it did to your tribe?
0TO0009033	I have questions about something else.
0TO0009034	What do you think about the NCR?
0TO0009035	How did the NCR defeat the Legion at Hoover Dam before?
0TO0009037	I'm a friend. It's okay for you to talk to friends, right?
0TO0009038	I just have some questions. It'll probably be okay to talk to me.
0TO0009039	Don't worry - I won't tell on you if you don't tell on me.
0TO0009040	I'd like to report a murder at Gomorrah.
0TO0009041	Sorry, I'll find some proof.
0TO0009042	I found a dead girl in Gomorrah.
0TO0009043	I found these tapes.
0TO0009044	I can't say for sure.
0TO0009045	No, but I'll find out for you.
0TO0009046	It is a guy named Clanden.
0TO0009047	Here are the caps. <pay 150 caps>
0TO0009048	Never mind, I have some other questions though.
0TO0009049	Would you happen to know where I could find a sexbot?
0TO0009050	The Garrets are looking to satisfy certain customers.
0TO0009051	Thanks, I'll check it out.
0TO0009052	Is there a holotape or anything I'll need for the sexbot?
0TO0009053	Good to know. I might have you make one later if I can't get it myself.
0TO0009055	Ralph, I've been a loyal customer to you and Mick. How about 100 caps?
0TO0009056	Can't you just call it a favor?
0TO0009058	Data modules are rare but generally useless. How about 100 caps for your work?
0TO0009059	50 caps is my best offer.
0TO0009061	Ralph, I've been directing a lot of business your direction. Call it a favor?
0TO0009062	Is the holotape ready yet?
0TO0009063	I'm short on caps right now. Maybe later.
0TO0009065	I'm afraid so.
0TO0009066	The violence needs to stop.
0TO0009067	There's still time to solve this peacefully.
0TO0009068	These men have orders to kill you all if you refuse. Are you sure?
0TO0009070	And when you're dead? What will happen to their freedom then?
0TO0009071	The NCR is far too powerful. Just give up.
0TO0009072	The NCR is just trying to protect its people.
0TO0009073	Actually, they want to make you an offer.
0TO0009074	You've got them all wrong.
0TO0009075	I was, uh, just sightseeing. Sorry to bother you.
0TO0009076	Ambassador Crocker said to come see you about Freeside.
0TO0009078	This plan seems awfully confrontational.
0TO0009079	Nope. I'm to go to Freeside and shoot up some Kings.
0TO0009081	Where does the Legion get its dogs?
0TO0009083	You train these dogs?
0TO0009104	Sounds like you're in trouble. What's the deal?
0TO0009105	How high was that fall?
0TO0009106	If Vault 21 is your "bottom of the barrel" then I'd say you could've done worse.
0TO0009107	Let me ask you about New Vegas.
0TO0009109	What are the important players in town?
0TO0009110	I've got other questions about you.
0TO0009111	Any recommendations on where to go for some fun?
0TO0009112	You worked in Gomorrah as a Croupier, uh? What was it like?
0TO0009113	You spent some time at Gomorrah, then. What was it like?
0TO0009114	Any important "wiseguys" that I should know about?
0TO0009115	Anyone in Gomorrah you'd recommend for a good time?
0TO0009117	What does Sarah do around here?
0TO0009119	I can keep a secret, Carlitos. About whom are you worried?
0TO0009120	Wait a minute. What's that name again?
0TO0009122	So you live in Vault 21?
0TO0009123	What did you say about working at Gomorrah?
0TO0009124	Tell me again about the girl at Gomorrah that worries you.
0TO0009125	Don't talk to me like that or I'll... I'll... have to get tough with you.
0TO0009126	Why not? It looks private enough for a midnight stunt.
0TO0009128	How did Cachino get you out of the way?
0TO0009129	I can talk to Joana for you.
0TO0009130	I could talk to Joana for you, but it'll cost you 200 caps.
0TO0009131	You know, paying a visit to Joana sounds like fun.
0TO0009132	All right. I'll talk to her.
0TO0009133	On second thought - let's wait.
0TO0009136	I want to talk about Joana.
0TO0009137	I couldn't convince her to attempt a escape.
0TO0009138	Joana's happy to hear from you and wants to escape Gomorrah.
0TO0009139	I'll be back when I convince her.
0TO0009149	What are you and he up to out here on the Strip?
0TO0009152	Tell me again why the two of you came to the Strip.
0TO0009153	What's so important about Heck Gunderson?
0TO0009157	What's life like as a Bighorn rancher?
0TO0009160	What are you and he up to on the Strip?
0TO0009166	Tell me again what you and he are doing on the Strip?
0TO0009171	What's the deal with this Heck Gunderson?
0TO0009175	If you can't talk him out of it, seems worthless for me to try.
0TO0009177	All right, I'll talk to him.
0TO0009180	Is there some way I could help you out?
0TO0009182	What's so important about this Heck Gunderson?
0TO0009185	You look more than just too hot - what's the matter?
0TO0009186	Then have, I don't know, some water or something.
0TO0009187	I'd like to ask you some other questions.
0TO0009190	I'd like to ask you about the Wasteland.
0TO0009191	Let's talk about Heck Gunderson.
0TO0009192	What was that about settling a score?
0TO0009194	I have news about the Gundersons
0TO0009196	Maybe Heck would listen to your pleas if his son's life was at stake.
0TO0009197	Heck's life and a safe future have a steep price, Walter. 1000 caps' my fee.
0TO0009198	Heck's life? That's big game, a 1000 caps.
0TO0009199	I want to talk to you about our deal.
0TO0009200	You're not from around here, are you?
0TO0009201	Are you a Bighorn rancher?
0TO0009202	What else can you tell me about Heck Gunderson?
0TO0009203	Heck claims to be an honest rancher.
0TO0009204	What do you plan to do about him?
0TO0009205	Heck's looking for his disappeared son. I've agreed to find him.
0TO0009206	I may be able to help you.
0TO0009207	I'll find out for you but not cheaply - 400 caps.
0TO0009208	Okay, I'll be back when I find out more about him.
0TO0009209	The best don't come cheap, Walter. 400 caps' my fee.
0TO0009210	Actually, let me consider it first.
0TO0009215	How is Heck a threat to other ranchers in The Wasteland?
0TO0009216	I'll take care of them.
0TO0009217	Heck's a powerful man - I'd need extra for his son's life, 500 caps.
0TO0009218	500 and Ted's history.
0TO0009219	I'm not interested right now. Sorry, Walter.
0TO0009220	Actually, never mind. Let me ask you about something else.
0TO0009221	Tell me again about your home.
0TO0009222	What's being a Bighorn rancher like?
0TO0009223	It turns out that Ted Gunderson's disappeared. Heck's looking for him.
0TO0009225	Ted's a goner.
0TO0009226	You don't have to worry about Heck Gunderson, ever again.
0TO0009232	Let's talk prices.
0TO0009233	You might like to know that Heck's barely protected, right now.
0TO0009234	We said 1000 for Heck, right?
0TO0009235	Heck for 500, correct?
0TO0009236	Ted's worth 500 to you, then?
0TO0009237	So, 250 for Ted it is?
0TO0009238	The Gundersons are history.
0TO0009241	Ethel's right, vengeance will only lead to more innocents' deaths.
0TO0009242	None but...huh, what right do you have?
0TO0009243	You are just giving them the excuse they need.
0TO0009244	You are right. Let's deal with them.
0TO0009246	I'm not interested about this right now.
0TO0009248	I was wondering if you had any work available.
0TO0009250	Is that guard position still available?
0TO0009251	Still need that sample delivered?
0TO0009252	I delivered the package as requested.
0TO0009253	Sure. Count me in.
0TO0009254	Sorry, I have better things to do.
0TO0009255	Mind if I ask you some questions?
0TO0009256	So is this a family business?
0TO0009258	This seems like a bad neighborhood to open a store.
0TO0009262	Always.
0TO0009264	Keep talking.
0TO0009266	I'm not a delivery boy. Not interested.
0TO0009267	He said you'd hear from them soon.
0TO0009268	What do you know about this client?
0TO0009269	They seemed pleased, and said they'd be in touch.
0TO0009270	Absolutely.
0TO0009272	I'm busy now.
0TO0009273	That's right.
0TO0009274	How did you know?
0TO0009275	Looks like we're stuck with each other.
0TO0009276	Laser.
0TO0009277	Plasma.
0TO0009278	What's the difference?
0TO0009279	I have. It's a slum.
0TO0009280	Yes, what of it?
0TO0009282	Maybe? I go lots of places. Can't remember them all, you know.
0TO0009283	Sure, I'll look into it.
0TO0009285	If I can't just kill him, what did you want me to do?
0TO0009287	I've heard that there's bad blood between Pacer and the Van Graff family.
0TO0009288	Pacer's addicted to Jet, even though he has a heart condition.
0TO0009290	Add a little Psycho to his Jet, and he'd have a heart attack.
0TO0009291	Maybe the jet will cause his heart to give out.
0TO0009292	I was hoping you'd know.
0TO0009293	I'm not an assassin.
0TO0009294	All right, I'll try to find a way.
0TO0009295	What's my other choice?
0TO0009296	Let's start with my reward.
0TO0009297	When you put it that way... yes.
0TO0009298	I suppose not.
0TO0009299	You wanted a man dead. He's dead. Now where are my caps?
0TO0009300	I'm sorry. I screwed up.
0TO0009301	Wow, you're really mad.
0TO0009302	I discovered that Pacer and the Van Graffs have a troubled history.
0TO0009303	I discovered that Pacer is a Jet addict and has a heart condition.
0TO0009304	I used an energy weapon to kill Pacer, so the Van Graffs should take the blame.
0TO0009306	I risked my neck out there. Couldn't you spare a little more?
0TO0009308	I laced Pacer's Jet with Psycho and it didn't go well for him.
0TO0009309	The King complied with Colonel Moore's ultimatum.
0TO0009310	Glad to be of service.
0TO0009311	Keep me in mind for any future assignments.
0TO0009312	I spoke to the King, and he promised to stop the violence against NCR citizens.
0TO0009313	The King won't deal with the NCR.
0TO0009315	Sounds like you and the Colonel don't get along.
0TO0009316	That'll show the people in Freeside who's in charge!
0TO0009317	Sending NCR soldiers into Freeside would be a bad idea.
0TO0009318	So what do you suggest?
0TO0009319	I guess I'll head over to Colonel Moore, then.
0TO0009320	But you've got another idea. Spit it out.
0TO0009321	The Kings were all killed after the King turned down the ultimatum.
0TO0009322	The King accepted Colonel Hsu's offer of help.
0TO0009323	A fight broke out when I presented Hsu's offer. The Kings are all dead.
0TO0009324	I think I'd rather go with the assassination plan.
0TO0009329	I received my orders from Colonel Moore, and am still carrying them out.
0TO0009330	Tell me more about the King.
0TO0009331	What would I need to do?
0TO0009332	Guess I'll go have a talk with the King, then.
0TO0009333	I received my orders from Colonel Hsu, and am still carrying them out.
0TO0009334	I haven't talked to either Colonel Moore or Colonel Hsu yet.
0TO0009337	Major Polatli said you might need some help.
0TO0009338	I wanted to talk to you about your missing medical supplies.
0TO0009339	I finished looking over your patients.
0TO0009340	Yes. I have some medical experience.
0TO0009341	<Lie> You betcha!
0TO0009343	Yes. Private Stone was stealing them.
0TO0009345	<Lie> I wasn't able to find out anything.
0TO0009346	I'm not qualified to examine your patients.
0TO0009350	I did what I could for your patients.
0TO0009351	I've studied lots of medicology.
0TO0009352	How're things around camp?
0TO0009354	Things look pretty rough in here.
0TO0009355	It looks like you have a decent facility here.
0TO0009356	You seem to be handling it well.
0TO0009357	This place looks more like a chop shop.
0TO0009358	What makes you think someone is stealing your supplies?
0TO0009359	Perhaps you've misplaced them?
0TO0009360	Maybe you're just careless.
0TO0009361	It wasn't me.
0TO0009362	I can look into this for you.
0TO0009363	What exactly is missing?
0TO0009364	Where do you keep your supplies?
0TO0009365	When did you notice them missing?
0TO0009368	Major Polatli sent me to help you out.
0TO0009369	How're things around the camp?
0TO0009370	I found the supplies you were looking for.
0TO0009371	Speaking of supplies... I found some nearby, are they yours?
0TO0009373	About that thing you wanted...
0TO0009374	I'm always willing to give a helping hand.
0TO0009375	It depends on what sort of thing.
0TO0009376	Uh, no thanks, maybe later.
0TO0009377	I found some NCR dogtags.
0TO0009378	Seems easy enough.
0TO0009379	I wanted to ask about your missing men.
0TO0009380	The situation looks pretty bad here.
0TO0009381	Quit complaining, it's not that bad here.
0TO0009382	How can I help with your supply problems?
0TO0009383	Any idea on where I should start looking?
0TO0009384	This sounds pretty dangerous.
0TO0009387	Do you know anything about Dr. Richards' missing medical supplies?
0TO0009389	I could do that for you.
0TO0009391	Do you have the troops to retake Nelson?
0TO0009392	What do you want me to do now?
0TO0009393	Is there any intel on the Legion forces at Nelson?
0TO0009394	I've helped Quartermaster Mayes get some supplies.
0TO0009395	I've finished helping Dr. Richards.
0TO0009396	I'm ready. Let's do it!
0TO0009397	I'll need some time to prepare.
0TO0009398	I want to talk about the attack on Nelson.
0TO0009400	What's your problem?
0TO0009401	How are things around camp?
0TO0009402	Alright, hand it over.
0TO0009404	Dilated eyes, increased heart rate... I think you took the drugs.
0TO0009405	You look a little sick. Maybe you should see Dr. Richards.
0TO0009406	Nevermind. I'll just turn you in instead.
0TO0009407	I saw you stealing the supplies.
0TO0009409	This better be good.
0TO0009410	I don't care about your explanations.
0TO0009411	Doing drugs isn't going to change anything.
0TO0009412	What about the injured men that need this medicine?
0TO0009413	Hum... I think I understand.
0TO0009414	That's a poor excuse.
0TO0009415	I'm going to turn you in.
0TO0009416	I want you to turn yourself in.
0TO0009417	I won't turn you in... if you make it worth my while.
0TO0009418	If you promise to stop, I won't turn you in.
0TO0009419	Because it's the right thing to do.
0TO0009420	Keep it to yourself, but Hanlon is the one behind the misinformation. He's got a plan.
0TO0009422	Watch your mouth, ghoul, or I might just rip your jaw off.
0TO0009423	Whoa, why the hostility?
0TO0009424	I have no idea what you're talking about.
0TO0009425	That's what your mom said last night. Aw yeah. I went there.
0TO0009426	Why bother? You're embarassing yourself enough as it is.
0TO0009427	Afraid not.
0TO0009428	No, but if there's money in it, I could be.
0TO0009429	Thanks, but that's not why I'm here.
0TO0009430	I can't think of a more pathetic career choice.
0TO0009432	He's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops now.
0TO0009434	Do you have time for a few questions?
0TO0009435	What's the trouble with the Legion?
0TO0009436	Snakes are small. Why don't you just use a gun or whatever to shoot them?
0TO0009437	Legion?
0TO0009438	Nelson?
0TO0009440	If you want to make a go at it, I'll come along.
0TO0009441	So you perform stand-up comedy, huh?
0TO0009442	Are you, like, an actor or something?
0TO0009443	So who are you, exactly?
0TO0009444	Tommy Torini is hiring new acts at the Tops. I think you could make good money.
0TO0009445	Tommy Torini is hiring at the Tops. I don't get your jokes, but maybe you could make money.
0TO0009446	Are you sure you wouldn't rather go work at the Tops?
0TO0009447	Garrett's agreed to let you out of your contract. You can go work at the Tops.
0TO0009449	Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
0TO0009450	I just have a few questions.
0TO0009451	How long have you been doing comedy?
0TO0009452	Tommy Torini at the Tops is hiring entertainers. I could put in a word for you.
0TO0009453	Have you reconsidered asking for a better price from Tommy?
0TO0009454	But we're standing on a street corner in the middle of nowhere.
0TO0009455	It's very impressive.
0TO0009456	So you're looking for your big break?
0TO0009457	With jokes like that, no wonder you're working the street.
0TO0009458	Don't sell yourself short. You're worth a lot more than that.
0TO0009459	No, you've got to start high! Ask for a million and go from there!
0TO0009460	Sure, here's his card.
0TO0009461	That's your call. Here's his card.
0TO0009462	Look, just hang out here for a bit, I want to make sure you get a deal.
0TO0009463	Tommy wants a profit, he won't pay you what you're worth unless you ask for it.
0TO0009464	Hang on, this comes out to 1,500 caps for Billy! He's worth three times that!
0TO0009468	I want to talk to you about how much you're paying Billy Knight.
0TO0009469	Billy's worth three times what you're paying him.
0TO0009470	Why would this Mr. Bishop be after you?
0TO0009471	Why did you come all the way out here from New Reno?
0TO0009472	Interested in working for the Garrets?
0TO0009473	Well, that was... different.
0TO0009474	No, you performed as intended.
0TO0009475	Report to the Atomic Wrangler. James Garret is your new owner.
0TO0009476	I can't feel my legs!
0TO0009477	I would like to purchase your services.
0TO0009480	Woohoo! <assume the position>
0TO0009481	Never mind, I would like a refund.
0TO0009482	I found the sexbot you're looking for.
0TO0009483	Fisto is already programmed to respond to your commands.
0TO0009485	Thing is, Fisto's a *heavy-duty* piece of equipment, built to last...
0TO0009486	First I'd like to discuss payment. This wasn't a cakewalk.
0TO0009487	I need double before we talk more.
0TO0009491	Seems like... maybe a robot would be worth more? You think?
0TO0009493	Are you part of the Legion?
0TO0009494	Is it dangerous to trade with the Legion?
0TO0009495	Do you ever trade with the NCR?
0TO0009497	I have some questions about you.
0TO0009498	How long have you been a slave?
0TO0009504	No, I don't. What makes you think that?
0TO0009505	<Lie> Yeah, I do, and it's time for you to suffer!
0TO0009506	Can't say that I have.
0TO0009507	You robbed a casino boss?
0TO0009508	And so because of that you ran all the way to Novac?
0TO0009510	Wow. My hat is off to you, that takes some balls.
0TO0009511	You really don't know when to quit, do you?
0TO0009512	That's a tough break. Good luck with that.
0TO0009513	I'll let you know if I find any work for a singer.
0TO0009514	Tommy Torini at the Tops is looking for musical acts, if you're interested.
0TO0009515	I spoke to Clanden, and I couldn't get anything out of him.
0TO0009516	I found these tapes in Clanden's room, can you verify this is him?
0TO0009517	Cachino sent me to talk to you.
0TO0009518	What kind of business do you do here?
0TO0009519	I'll show it to you for 100 caps.
0TO0009521	So you're a bounty hunter?
0TO0009522	That is a mouthful. Let's shorten that to Fisto.
0TO0009523	What?! No!
0TO0009524	My pleasure is for you to work at the Atomic Wrangler.
0TO0009525	I suppose I should test you out before I hand you to the Garrets...
0TO0009527	I need one too. Here, next round's on me.
0TO0009528	As good a place as any - though here you are drinking yourself *under* ground.
0TO0009529	Looks like you could use a friendly ear right now. What's up?
0TO0009532	Keep up the attitude soon you'll be on the ground, for good.
0TO0009533	No game. I offered to keep an eye out for talented acts, is all.
0TO0009534	Tommy offered me a recruiting fee.
0TO0009535	Here, take his card. Tell him I sent you.
0TO0009536	If I give you his card, what's in it for me?
0TO0009537	I'm giving you a real opportunity here - how about some compensation?
0TO0009538	On second thought, I don't think you're the right fit after all.
0TO0009539	Have you been playing long?
0TO0009540	When did your father leave?
0TO0009542	Nevertheless, I'm interested.
0TO0009543	Oh, okay then, never mind.
0TO0009544	Your father abandoned you?
0TO0009545	Smart guy. Families just tie you down.
0TO0009546	Wait, Montana? You wouldn't happen to be 17, would you?
0TO0009547	Oh thank God. Forget it. Never mind. So your father left?
0TO0009548	No reason. Well, uh, say, let's talk about something else.
0TO0009549	Sounds like you miss him. Is that why you're out here wandering?
0TO0009550	I'm sure he had a reason for leaving.
0TO0009551	Let's change the subject.
0TO0009552	It must have been hard growing up without a father.
0TO0009553	You were better off without him. You became your own man, outside of his shadow.
0TO0009554	And what will you do when you find him?
0TO0009555	He sounds like a scumbag. You should make him pay.
0TO0009556	Sounds like you should move on. Settle down, maybe.
0TO0009557	Yeah, he's probably dead anyways. You should just get a life.
0TO0009558	Can't say that I do, sorry.
0TO0009560	What kind of help do you need?
0TO0009561	Tell me about the plan.
0TO0009562	Let's talk about something else
0TO0009563	I don't have any more questions right now.
0TO0009567	I'm all done with that work you needed.
0TO0009568	What was Cachino's role in the plan?
0TO0009570	How did you end up with one of the hotel suites?
0TO0009571	The Bosses sent me to offer you assistance.
0TO0009572	What do you need the bombs for?
0TO0009573	How can I be of assistance?
0TO0009575	A gas, perhaps chlorine? It is a deadly nerve gas and not too hard to come by.
0TO0009576	Er... Maybe you could build a nuke?
0TO0009578	I have a couple other questions to ask you instead.
0TO0009579	Let's talk about this a little later.
0TO0009580	Where can I find some chlorine gas?
0TO0009581	I don't think I want to get involved in this.
0TO0009582	I found some chlorine for you.
0TO0009583	Your bosses sent me to you to see if you needed any help with your work for them.
0TO0009584	Tell me about the problem with the last shipment.
0TO0009585	How are you getting the weapons into the strip?
0TO0009586	Why do you work for the Omertas?
0TO0009587	Do you mean these weapon parts?
0TO0009588	I'll keep an eye out for them.
0TO0009589	I have a couple more questions.
0TO0009591	That's all I have for questions right now.
0TO0009592	I found those weapon parts you needed.
0TO0009593	Are you trying to kill your customers?
0TO0009595	I'm looking to make some carbon tetrachloride for fire suppression.
0TO0009596	I... Um... Need it to make chlorophyll for plants...
0TO0009597	Actually, I was curious if you sell chlorine to The Ultra-Luxe.
0TO0009600	I want you to attack enemies the moment you see them.
0TO0009601	<Aggression Level::Aggressive>
0TO0009603	I want you not to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
0TO0009604	<Aggression Level::Passive>
0TO0009606	What do you mean by Family?
0TO0009607	What is Zoara?
0TO0009608	I have business with your bosses.
0TO0009609	Nevermind, I'm done now.
0TO0009610	One of your soldiers has been breaking family rules, here is the proof.
0TO0009611	My business with the bosses is my business, not yours.
0TO0009613	It involves Cachino, and if you don't let me through it'll involve you too.
0TO0009614	What I have is for their eyes only, not some lowly thug.
0TO0009615	I have proof one of your Lieutenants is dealing behind your back.
0TO0009616	Is it worth 100 caps to you?
0TO0009618	I'll give it to you for 200 caps.
0TO0009619	I'll give you the journal for... um... 5% of Gomorrah's earnings.
0TO0009620	This will be worth your while, so much that you won't regret paying 300 caps for it.
0TO0009621	You give me 4500 caps and I'll let you look at the proof I found.
0TO0009622	I wanted to ask you another question first.
0TO0009623	Actually I have some other business to take care of.
0TO0009624	How is Cachino going to be handled?
0TO0009625	Cachino mentioned you had something big planned.
0TO0009626	I have more questions about your plans.
0TO0009627	Why didn't you intervene sooner when Benny ambushed me?
0TO0009628	What use would you have for a protege?
0TO0009631	I have a right to know more.
0TO0009632	If the Chip's so valuable, why use a single courier to transport it?
0TO0009634	Why don't you send your robots into the Tops to arrest Benny?
0TO0009635	What happens if the Platinum Chip is never lost?
0TO0009636	Isn't that overstating things a bit?
0TO0009637	How do I get to Benny?
0TO0009638	Say I want to take a diplomatic approach.
0TO0009639	Any ideas on how I could catch him off-guard?
0TO0009640	The Chairmen are your employees. Don't they take orders?
0TO0009642	I have a few questions before I decide.
0TO0009643	Are Marilyn and Jane your... girlfriends?
0TO0009644	Why can't you be the one to tell Swank?
0TO0009645	How did you establish New Vegas?
0TO0009646	Where did the Three Families come from?
0TO0009649	I'll accept your original offer.
0TO0009650	Not interested. Sorry.
0TO0009651	What's the matter with you?
0TO0009652	Easy, there. Down boy.
0TO0009653	Your discount was a lie.
0TO0009654	I'm going to kill you now.
0TO0009656	<Glare> You should give me this code for free while you can still walk straight.
0TO0009657	Give it to me for free, now!
0TO0009659	50 caps without even knowing the details of this code? How about 25?
0TO0009660	25 caps, take it or leave it.
0TO0009661	Now you need to settle that debt with the Garrets.
0TO0009662	Thanks, but I'm still going to kill you.
0TO0009663	Goodbye, and I better not hear about you trying this crap again.
0TO0009665	Santiago, dealing with you is getting to be more annoying than it is worth.
0TO0009667	Hey, you made me look like a fool!
0TO0009668	Who's supplying you?
0TO0009669	Do you have any work you need done?
0TO0009670	What sort of "proclivities" are we talking about?
0TO0009672	I'll see if I run across any suitable candidates.
0TO0009673	I'm not going to be your pimp.
0TO0009674	I'll expect 100 caps *minimum* for each candidate I bring in.
0TO0009676	What did you need again?
0TO0009679	Surely these escorts are critical to your business? How about double?
0TO0009680	Ha! Who are you kidding! I need double!
0TO0009682	I will need more than that to recoup travel expenses.
0TO0009683	That's chimp pay!
0TO0009684	Thank you. You've been very helpful.
0TO0009686	Santiago says the password is extravaganza for a discount.
0TO0009687	I don't have much on me.
0TO0009689	I'm new in town, and wanted to pay my respects.
0TO0009690	Trust me, the King will want to see me.
0TO0009691	All right. I'm on it.
0TO0009692	Not quite yet.
0TO0009693	I've bugged the tower for you.
0TO0009694	I could retrieve the caps from your caravan.
0TO0009695	I've dealt with such things in the past.
0TO0009696	Rodents of unusual size? I don't believe they exist.
0TO0009698	I find it hard to believe you ran from the caravan without taking something.
0TO0009699	Lady, you've got to have extra stuff on you somewhere.
0TO0009701	Jane, I can tell you're lying through your teeth.
0TO0009703	Jane, surely a lady of your stature has honor sufficient to pay her debts.
0TO0009704	Yeah, I would like that.
0TO0009705	I changed my mind. Let me ask you about something else.
0TO0009706	A prank you say?
0TO0009707	That doesn't sound like a good idea.
0TO0009708	Shall we get down to business?
0TO0009709	Shall we get down to business, then?
0TO0009710	What are you talking about? I'm just a courier.
0TO0009712	I think I'll be on my way.
0TO0009713	Why the VIP treatment? I'm just a courier.
0TO0009714	I think I'll be leaving.
0TO0009716	Let's get down to business, then.
0TO0009717	Not interested. I'll see myself out.
0TO0009718	I'm still working on getting you fixed.
0TO0009719	The King said you could tell me more about his robotic dog.
0TO0009720	So you can't heal him?
0TO0009721	The King brought him here for treatment then?
0TO0009722	So there's no chance he'll ever get better?
0TO0009723	Is there anyone who could do all that?
0TO0009725	This place looks amazing. Where do I start?
0TO0009726	Point me to The Tops, Victor. I've got a score to settle.
0TO0009727	Not now, Victor - I'm busy.
0TO0009728	Why is a robot passing on his invitation?
0TO0009729	All right, I'll go there straight off.
0TO0009730	Tell Mr. House I might stop by. We'll see.
0TO0009731	No thanks. I can handle myself just fine.
0TO0009733	How's the Chip work?
0TO0009734	What does the Chip do?
0TO0009735	What are you offering?
0TO0009736	The hows don't matter.
0TO0009738	You left quite a trail. <Show Benny his cigarette butt and lighter.>
0TO0009739	You left these at my grave.<Show Benny his cigarette butts.>
0TO0009740	Seems you dropped something in Boulder City. <Show Benny his lighter.>
0TO0009741	I've got questions - a bunch of them.
0TO0009742	What's the deal with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
0TO0009743	First things first. Tell me about the Platinum Chip.
0TO0009745	Let's talk about the Platinum Chip.
0TO0009746	I want to know about the factions gunning for Vegas.
0TO0009747	The Chip belongs to me. Hand it over.
0TO0009750	What is this scheme of yours, Benny?
0TO0009751	And you're willing to commit murder to make this happen?
0TO0009752	You're right, murder is the answer. Yours. <Attack Benny.>
0TO0009754	The ruthlessness of others is no excuse.
0TO0009755	If you're thinking we can work together, let's hear your offer.
0TO0009756	What's your offer?
0TO0009757	What's your plan?
0TO0009758	What makes you think you can succeed?
0TO0009760	Answers first, then I decide.
0TO0009762	Tell me about Mr. House.
0TO0009763	What makes the Chairmen so special?
0TO0009764	Fill me in about the NCR.
0TO0009766	Tell me why you used Great Khans.
0TO0009767	Like I'd trust you? No thanks.
0TO0009768	Help me understand this scheme of yours.
0TO0009770	Forget it, I forgive you.
0TO0009771	No deal. Time for you to die. <Attack Benny>
0TO0009773	I dug myself out of that grave to put you in yours, Benny.
0TO0009774	What do you think of the Omertas?
0TO0009776	I need a key to Cachino's room. Do you have one that will work?
0TO0009777	Thanks, but I'll find another way.
0TO0009778	Ok, 300 caps is a deal.
0TO0009780	How about 200 caps and I forget we ever met.
0TO0009782	Free sounds better to me.
0TO0009784	<Lie>Troike wants to see about negotiation some lower prices for weapons for you guys.
0TO0009785	Um... I'm sure you have enough guns.
0TO0009787	Troike is pretty strung out. He'll be more trouble than he is worth.
0TO0009788	Well I'm sure he's be a very productive worker, he could use some vacation time.
0TO0009789	He seems pretty tired.
0TO0009791	You should buy guns from Mick and Ralph, people are starting to ask questions.
0TO0009792	Mick and Ralph would...Um... Enjoy selling the Omertas guns.
0TO0009795	Mick and Ralph are curious why you stopped buying guns from them.
0TO0009796	No idea.
0TO0009797	I hear you lost some guns.
0TO0009798	Time to die, Sal.
0TO0009799	Cachino! Shoot now.
0TO0009801	Troike is on his way to destroy the guns for me.
0TO0009802	Troike destroyed the guns for me.
0TO0009803	I destroyed all the guns.
0TO0009804	Troike gave me some Thermite to destroy the guns.
0TO0009805	Clanden has been arrested.
0TO0009806	Clanden is leaving Gomorrah and won't be back.
0TO0009807	Clanden is dead.
0TO0009808	I have some questions about the Bosses plans.
0TO0009809	What's the next step in breaking up the bosses plans?
0TO0009811	Why do they need to die?
0TO0009812	How do we take care of the bosses?
0TO0009813	What happens when the bosses are gone?
0TO0009815	They are going to expect something from me, you can do it and surprise them.
0TO0009816	I'm not a very good shot, you should kill them.
0TO0009817	Let's go take care of the bosses.
0TO0009818	I'm not ready to take out the bosses yet.
0TO0009819	Big Sal agreed to let you go.
0TO0009822	Is there anything you can tell me about the Great Khans?
0TO0009823	Where can I find McCarran?
0TO0009824	The President is coming to Hoover Dam?
0TO0009825	What happened to Boulder City?
0TO0009827	Bill, Julie and the rest of your friends miss you. They need your help.
0TO0009828	Harden the hell up, Bill. You're being a sissy!
0TO0009830	A combination of Fixer, Psycho, and Buffout would do it in one shot.
0TO0009831	Fixer is for pansies!
0TO0009833	Regulating decreasing doses of booze with a couple shots of Fixer should do it.
0TO0009834	Just stick your fingers down your throat. That'll flush you real good.
0TO0009836	Could you repair some things for me?
0TO0009838	Hey you only fired three shots and there are four guys there...
0TO0009839	Something about this doesn't seem right...
0TO0009840	Why did you run ahead like that?
0TO0009842	Or, you just faked this whole thing to drum up repeat business.
0TO0009843	After you.
0TO0009845	I want all the money you have on you. I could make it to the Kings from here.
0TO0009846	You should give me all your money. Or I'll tell. And stuff.
0TO0009847	I think I already killed him...
0TO0009848	Orris left town after I had a little talk with him.
0TO0009851	And this is where I come in.
0TO0009852	What would you like to know?
0TO0009853	Shame that you can't fix Boomer suits. They're very similar to vault suits.
0TO0009854	I'll also bring you Boomer suits. You can fix them and sell them.
0TO0009859	Okay. You got it.
0TO0009874	I haven't had a chance to look yet.
0TO0009875	Benny has reprogrammed a Securitron, he's trying to take over the Strip.
0TO0009876	I thought maybe I'd talk to the man. See if we can work out a deal.
0TO0009877	I'm not sure yet, but I had some other questions first.
0TO0009883	<Lie> Water main burst upstairs. They sent me down to survey the damage.
0TO0009884	<Lie> Mortimer sent me to move the kid. Thinks one of his own might betray him.
0TO0009885	<Lie> Uh... I'm supposed to release the prisoner. Good behavior I guess.
0TO0009886	<Lie> I'm... er... a building inspector. Surprise inspection!
0TO0009887	[Attack] Trespassing.
0TO0009888	Why is everyone around here dressed up and wearing masks?
0TO0009889	Where is your mask?
0TO0009891	What can you tell me about your organization?
0TO0009892	Where did you say the investigator's room was, again?
0TO0009899	I need more film for the camera
0TO0009900	You have my attention, go on.
0TO0009901	You have the wrong person.
0TO0009902	Reyes' information says otherwise.
0TO0009903	That's not what Reyes said.
0TO0009904	Maybe you're lying to keep morale up.
0TO0009905	What do you do out here?
0TO0009907	Hanlon was the one sending out the false reports. He killed himself rather than turning himself in.
0TO0009908	<Lie> Yes, everything's resolved - Hanlon and I found a Legion spy at Camp Golf.
0TO0009919	I found proof of your blackmail.
0TO0009920	I have a couple more questions about the guns.
0TO0009921	How do you get the guns into the strip?
0TO0009922	Give me the Thermite and I'll destroy the weapons.
0TO0009925	Where do the guns come from?
0TO0009927	If you don't deploy the Thermite yourself, I'll tell the bosses what you've been planning.
0TO0009928	You deploy the Thermite or I'll punch you in the shoulder.
0TO0009929	What is Thermite?
0TO0009930	What can we do to take care of the guns?
0TO0009931	I have some more questions about the Thermite.
0TO0009933	We talk here and now, or I tell everyone my story.
0TO0009934	I didn't come here to negotiate, I came for revenge. <Attack Benny.>
0TO0009935	You're a little bitch and your brother was, too.
0TO0009936	What is this memorial?
0TO0009938	I'm sorry to hear that.
0TO0009940	My apologies. It was rude and disrespectful of me to do that.
0TO0009941	Sorry. I, uh, didn't know what I was doing.
0TO0009942	Where are you normally stationed?
0TO0009945	This doesn't interest me. I should be leaving.
0TO0009946	Here you go. <Give the Platinum Chip to Mr. House.>
0TO0009949	I'm just browsing.
0TO0009950	Two hundred caps! That's twice what everyone else is charging!
0TO0009951	Will it be dangerous? I like dangerous.
0TO0009954	I'm a little busy right now.
0TO0009955	Vault gear - swell. Can you show me what you got?
0TO0009956	Sarah, stop right there. Do you actually have any vault gear?
0TO0009957	I'll help you out.
0TO0009958	I might be persuaded to lend a hand.
0TO0009959	Yeah. I wanted to ask you about something else before my top blows... off, too.
0TO0009960	You know, leather is my specialty. Unzip it, heat it and rub a shine onto it.
0TO0009962	Wait a moment - I changed my mind. Let me ask you something else.
0TO0009963	Quit yapping. I am starting to think of very unpleasant uses for those toasters.
0TO0009964	Actually, let me ask you about something else.
0TO0009965	Thinking about you in tight leather makes me want to uh... blow my top?
0TO0009966	All right. Consider it done.
0TO0009967	Maybe later. I have more questions for you.
0TO0009970	Don't say anything then - you look good enough just nodding your head.
0TO0009972	Do you still need more vault stuff?
0TO0009973	Yeah, I heard that before. What about actual vault gear?
0TO0009974	What is so special about this vault?
0TO0009975	You have never actually left this place?
0TO0009976	Sarah - there is something else behind all this, right?
0TO0009977	Sheldon also likes the indoors... a lot. Are you agoraphobic too?
0TO0009978	Something doesn't add up, Sarah. This can't be all that.
0TO0009979	Why did he fill the vault with concrete?
0TO0009980	What does Mr. House have to do with Vault 21?
0TO0009981	You run the place, then?
0TO0009982	Sure. I would like that.
0TO0009984	Do you miss the old days in the vault?
0TO0009985	I had other questions for you.
0TO0009986	Just don't say "Here, now!" Don't want to get the patrons all riled up, do we?
0TO0009987	Count on it.
0TO0009988	I still have some questions about Vault 21.
0TO0009989	I have some more questions about Vault 21
0TO0009990	I would like to know other things about you and this hotel.
0TO0009991	What did you say about not being the owner of the hotel and shop?
0TO0009993	Let's see what you've been hiding under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny.>
0TO0009994	Let's see what's under that checked suit. <Have sex with Benny>
0TO0009995	Keep your pants on. I've got questions that need answers.
0TO0009996	You fell for this trap hook, line, and sinker. <Attack Benny.>
0TO0009998	What a prize you are. Not interested.
0TO0010001	Fine, but don't keep me waiting.
0TO0010003	The suite's a nice touch, but someone's got to pay off my contract.
0TO0010004	If you want me to play nice, it'll cost you.
0TO0010009	Two conditions - lose the bodyguards, and we both go to the suite now.
0TO0010010	Why don't you, you know... help me find where the suite is?
0TO0010011	You're right. I want answers.
0TO0010012	All I want is to see you dead. <Attack Benny.>
0TO0010014	You're stinking up my suite, Benny. Scram. We'll talk later.
0TO0010016	I led you on, and it worked like a charm. Bye bye.
0TO0010020	What's my help worth to you?
0TO0010021	I'll need at least two thousand caps to motivate me.
0TO0010023	I'm looking for the Ambassador.
0TO0010024	What can you tell me about the Embassy?
0TO0010028	What do you know about the Ambassador?
0TO0010029	What can you tell me about Captain Pappas?
0TO0010030	What is happening on the Strip?
0TO0010032	What can you tell me about the Ambassador?
0TO0010033	Tell me about Private Erwin.
0TO0010034	Here, Benny - special delivery. <Punch Benny in the face.>
0TO0010035	Seems you need to work on your marksmanship.
0TO0010036	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny. <Attack.>
0TO0010037	I want the Platinum Chip and I want it now.
0TO0010039	When you shot me, you ran off so fast I never got your name.
0TO0010040	Is it wrong to want a guy who'd shoot me in the head?
0TO0010041	Girls like bad boys. And you've been downright awful.
0TO0010042	I'm saying I dig you, despite it all. What do you say?
0TO0010043	I'm a courier, remember? Don't you want me to handle your package?
0TO0010044	You stole my package. Let's see what I can do with yours.
0TO0010048	What's the story with your secret workshop and "Yes Man" friend?
0TO0010050	I'm wondering why I shouldn't just kill you.
0TO0010051	I dug myself out of that grave to plant you in yours, Benny.
0TO0010053	Where can I find Cachino?
0TO0010055	A gorgeous lady like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
0TO0010056	I be a sexy lady like you could tell me where I could find someone named Cachino.
0TO0010057	If I told you you have a beautiful body, would you tell me where Cachino is?
0TO0010058	A handsome man like you has to know where I can find Cachino.
0TO0010059	Listen here shitwad, tell me where I can find Cachino.
0TO0010060	I'd like to talk to you about Troike.
0TO0010062	Actually, I'd like to see about getting him out of his obligations to you.
0TO0010063	Something about his story doesn't sit right with me.
0TO0010065	Um, nevermind. Sorry I said something.
0TO0010068	Do you know where the knife came from?
0TO0010069	Cachino sent me to ask you about some guns.
0TO0010070	Okay, so what can you tell me about the guns the Omertas have?
0TO0010071	Tell me what happened with the prostitute.
0TO0010073	What kind of chems were you doing?
0TO0010074	How did the family find out about it?
0TO0010075	That seems like a lot of chems.
0TO0010077	That doesn't sound like enough to get you to lose the whole night.
0TO0010078	Um... Wouldn't that make your heart explode or something?
0TO0010079	I have a couple more questions about what happened that night.
0TO0010082	Would you like me to try to get you out of your contract?
0TO0010083	I'm looking to help Cachino break up whatever the Bosses are planning.
0TO0010084	Maybe I can help you out of your contract with the family.
0TO0010086	<Lie> If you don't help me, I'll report your work here to NCR.
0TO0010087	Tell me what you know or I'll, um... break your nose.
0TO0010089	Cachino forgot to tell me what they have on you.
0TO0010090	Err... I know what they have on you... Well I know, but I forgot. Tell me again.
0TO0010091	I don't have that on me right now.
0TO0010092	Sorry, Bill, but I still don't have the meds yet.
0TO0010093	I want to help you get well, Jacob.
0TO0010095	Julie Farkas says you could use some help.
0TO0010096	You look pretty bad, Jacob. You should probably stop using chems.
0TO0010097	I took care of that dealer. Now you can clean up.
0TO0010098	I helped with that addiction problem you mentioned.
0TO0010099	You said you could spare some supplies?
0TO0010100	A stimpak.
0TO0010101	Fixer.
0TO0010102	RadAway.
0TO0010103	Credit check? What's that for?
0TO0010104	I'll submit to the credit check. <2,000 caps required.>
0TO0010105	[Passport] I've got a passport.
0TO0010107	1C 3C R34 M.
0TO0010109	Robot!  Let me past!
0TO0010110	What do I need to do to get in?
0TO0010111	Do you always charge people to come talk to you?
0TO0010112	I was hoping you might have some work for me.
0TO0010114	Here you go, 10 caps.
0TO0010115	Actually, I don't have enough caps right now.
0TO0010116	Actually, I don't have enough for that right now.
0TO0010117	You said that Vault 21 wasn't always a hotel?
0TO0010118	I would like to hear again about the items you sell here.
0TO0010120	Thank you, Victor.
0TO0010121	I've never seen anything like this place.
0TO0010122	A city devoted to vice and sin - what's not to love?
0TO0010123	I prefer the wasteland, to be honest.
0TO0010131	What's your story, Mr. House?
0TO0010132	What are your plans for New Vegas?
0TO0010133	How do you intend to enforce your claim on the city?
0TO0010134	Wasn't the NCR's army big enough to defeat your Securitrons and the Three Families?
0TO0010135	What were the terms of your treaty with the NCR?
0TO0010136	You would go to war against the NCR?
0TO0010137	Say you keep control of New Vegas. What happens next?
0TO0010138	In the meantime, you'd rule Vegas as some kind of dictator?
0TO0010139	What's to keep you from abusing your power?
0TO0010140	What do you propose?
0TO0010141	Yes, let's get down to business.
0TO0010145	I have some questions to ask first.
0TO0010146	1000 caps? I accept your terms.
0TO0010147	What terms are you offering?
0TO0010148	Tell me your terms again?
0TO0010149	Tell me about Benny.
0TO0010152	It's a good start... but well below market price.
0TO0010153	Raise your price or... or, uh... you're "chip outta luck."
0TO0010156	What was your relationship with Benny... back when he was breathing?
0TO0010157	Who exactly are you, Mr. House?
0TO0010159	1250 caps? I accept your terms.
0TO0010160	Tell me about the factions vying for New Vegas.
0TO0010161	The Chip is worth far more than that.
0TO0010163	The more I know about the Chip, the easier I can find it...
0TO0010164	The less I know, the less I care. Know what I mean?
0TO0010165	You appear to be a computer, not a man.
0TO0010167	The lifespan you're claiming is impossible, except for ghouls and super mutants.
0TO0010168	You must be, like... a brain in a jar!
0TO0010169	How have you stayed alive all this time?
0TO0010170	Change the subject.
0TO0010171	All right, I'll do it.
0TO0010172	Still not interested.
0TO0010173	I'll return when I have the Chip.
0TO0010174	Yes, I have some questions I want to ask.
0TO0010175	Maybe. I have some questions I want to ask.
0TO0010176	No thanks, not interested.
0TO0010177	I'll recover the Chip.
0TO0010178	What were your terms again?
0TO0010180	No, I'm still not interested.
0TO0010181	I need to ask some questions before I recover the Chip.
0TO0010182	Never mind. Goodbye.
0TO0010184	Tell me about Boulder City.
0TO0010185	What's the concrete used for?
0TO0010186	Not quite. When I kill you, however, the job will get done right.
0TO0010188	Actually, never mind. Stealth is more my style.
0TO0010189	All right. Get ready to cover me once I've freed them.
0TO0010190	I think I'd rather try negotiations, instead.
0TO0010191	I may be able to negotiate a deal with the Great Khans.
0TO0010192	I could sneak in there and try to get your people out.
0TO0010194	Don't worry about me. I can handle myself in a fight.
0TO0010196	What are you going to do about the hostages?
0TO0010197	I'm unable to work out a deal. The Great Khans are all yours.
0TO0010198	Julie Farkas sent me to help you sober up.
0TO0010199	Why don't you stop drinking?
0TO0010200	How can you afford so much alcohol?
0TO0010201	You won't be seeing Dixon anymore.
0TO0010202	You need to kick the habit, Bill. I can help you.
0TO0010204	Bill, I've got what you asked for.
0TO0010205	Well, I've got that right here.
0TO0010206	I'm here to collect, McCaffery. No one crosses the Garret Twins.
0TO0010207	Give me a share of the caps and your hat and you can go free.
0TO0010208	Nah, just thought I'd say hi.
0TO0010209	I guess I haven't got a choice but to put you away.
0TO0010211	All I need is your hat, and you're a free man. I'll tell Francine you're dead.
0TO0010212	Hand over your hat before I pump you full of hot lead, you old fart!
0TO0010214	Francine warned me that you're a smooth-talker.
0TO0010215	VIP? The Garrets said nothing about VIP status.
0TO0010216	50 Caps is a bit steep, but okay. Here, now what is it?
0TO0010218	I don't even know this discount is worth 50.  How about 25 caps?
0TO0010219	What kind of moron would pay 50 caps for information?  25 caps.
0TO0010220	Santiago is dead if he doesn't cough up what he owes the Garrets.
0TO0010221	Liar. Pay up.
0TO0010222	<Punch Santiago in the face> I won't ask again, Santiago.
0TO0010224	I'd rather not kill you, but Francine put a bounty on your head.
0TO0010225	I'm going to... Well, I'm sure it will be very painful if you don't pay.
0TO0010227	With a price on your head, you should be paying me to say you're dead.
0TO0010228	You need to pay me to pay the Garrets right now.
0TO0010229	I can collect from your corpse, if you prefer.
0TO0010230	Are you the Grecks who owes the Garrets?
0TO0010231	Collecting money to pay back the Garrets?
0TO0010232	Sure, man. Here you go. <Punch Grecks in the face>
0TO0010233	Your hangman, if you don't start being straight with me.
0TO0010234	You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps. I'm here to collect.
0TO0010235	There is more where that came from if you don't pay your debt.
0TO0010236	Cough em up, Grecks.
0TO0010238	You don't cheat the Garrets and walk away. Cough up the rest or you're rat bait.
0TO0010239	You cheapass zombie.  You need to pay my extra fee.
0TO0010240	That'll do. Mess with the Garrets again and you're dead.
0TO0010241	Thanks for the caps, now enjoy the zombie afterlife.
0TO0010243	Heh, I think I'll make an example of you. Give me your clothes, or you get dead.
0TO0010245	Sheesh, you're one ugly sonofabitch!
0TO0010246	Yeah, and your eye! That shit is hilarious!
0TO0010247	Seriously zombie, are you looking at me or someone off that direction?!
0TO0010248	Nevermind. You owe the Garrets a good lump of caps.
0TO0010249	Oh, by the way. That damn eye of yours is creepy. Get it checked out.
0TO0010250	Heh. Whatever. Mess with the Garrets again and you're a dead man.
0TO0010251	I was hired by the Garrets to track you down.
0TO0010253	Perhaps there is something else of value you could put toward the debt?
0TO0010254	I bet you've got some extra caps hidden in that dress somewhere.
0TO0010255	Just give me what you have on you and they might accept it knowing you're dead.
0TO0010256	But then, I'd be a liar, and I hate liars. <Attack>
0TO0010257	I suppose that might work. It'll take some convincing though.
0TO0010258	You owe the Garrets a bunch of caps.
0TO0010259	Do you give supplies to the Locals, too?
0TO0010260	Why are you doing this for us?
0TO0010262	One of the victims confirmed his attacker was an NCR officer.
0TO0010264	I think I have all of the debts collected.
0TO0010268	How am I supposed to get to the Strip?
0TO0010269	If I see McCaffery on the Strip, I'll be sure to take care of him.
0TO0010270	I have some other business to handle, maybe later.
0TO0010271	I took care of McCaffery.
0TO0010272	Right here. <Give McCaffery's hat>
0TO0010273	The Followers are looking to trade for supplies.
0TO0010274	Do you know anything about Bill or Jacob?
0TO0010275	I need you to stop supplying Bill and Jacob.
0TO0010276	Maybe some caps could persuade you to leave them alone?
0TO0010278	<Attack> Screw that.  It'd be a lot cheaper and easier for me to kill you.
0TO0010279	All right.  Take the caps and leave them alone.
0TO0010281	So the NCR is supplying you with cheap chems? To keep Freeside down?
0TO0010282	If you don't leave them alone...  I'll...  I'll tell on you!
0TO0010283	Nevermind.  I don't have enough to cover that.
0TO0010284	The Followers need to find someone to trade with for supplies.
0TO0010285	I might be able to work something out.
0TO0010287	I spoke with Julie Farkas. She says the Followers will accept your offer.
0TO0010289	I think I found someone who will be able to cover your supplies.
0TO0010290	The Garret Twins.
0TO0010291	You get your chems and can help anyone who gets addicted.
0TO0010292	With a surplus of supplies, you could use your caps and influence to expand.
0TO0010293	You said something about helping addicts?
0TO0010294	Tell me about Bill Ronte.
0TO0010295	Tell me about Jacob.
0TO0010296	If I wanted to calm things down in Freeside, where would I start?
0TO0010297	Where should I start looking?
0TO0010298	Things seem pretty rough here in Freeside.
0TO0010299	Is there anything I can do to help?
0TO0010300	I'll see what I can do to help them.
0TO0010301	Hope.
0TO0010302	I don't know.
0TO0010304	You know anything about NCR soldiers prowling the area?
0TO0010305	You still have some info on those NCR soldiers that have been about?
0TO0010306	You drive a hard bargain. Here you go.
0TO0010308	If you ever want me to buy another tip from you, that price'll come down.
0TO0010309	How about 15 caps since we both know you need the money?
0TO0010310	Done.
0TO0010311	Sorry, too rich for me.
0TO0010312	Do you know the password?
0TO0010314	I've already paid good money for this information. A hundred more caps, no more.
0TO0010315	You want even more money? Are you insane?
0TO0010316	Fine.
0TO0010318	Thanks, I'll go check it out.
0TO0010320	Heard anything about the password at the train station?
0TO0010321	The NCR is distributing supplies in a building down by the old train station.
0TO0010322	Where did you get the robot dog?
0TO0010323	Is there something wrong with him?
0TO0010324	He doesn't seem very happy.
0TO0010326	What can you tell me about Freeside?
0TO0010328	Can they do anything?
0TO0010329	Is he going to be okay?
0TO0010330	Can I help somehow?
0TO0010331	Absolutely. I'll see that he gets better.
0TO0010333	About Rex here...
0TO0010335	A magazine on locksmiths?
0TO0010336	What are the bobby pins for?
0TO0010337	And the bobby pins?
0TO0010338	And this magazine - "Locksmith's Reader?"
0TO0010339	All right. I'll go take a look at that safe when I have a chance.
0TO0010340	Actually, I already cracked that safe.
0TO0010341	I would like a room, please.
0TO0010342	A vault hotel? Was it like this before the war?
0TO0010343	What kinds of things do you sell in this gift shop?
0TO0010344	Are you the owner of this hotel and shop?
0TO0010345	Let's see what you have for sale.
0TO0010346	I would like to ask you some questions about Vault 21.
0TO0010347	There are some things I wanted to know about you.
0TO0010348	I have Vault gear for you.
0TO0010349	Okay. 20 caps sounds good.
0TO0010350	On second thought, I don't need a room right now.
0TO0010351	Sarah, I plan on staying here often - got a special price for a special client?
0TO0010352	20 caps for a crappy rat-hole? C'mon, you can do better than that.
0TO0010381	What do you think of Caesar's Legion?
0TO0010387	Ted's father is a wealthy man. With his resources, this should be easy to stop.
0TO0010388	The wine is ready to be brought out.
0TO0010389	Time to serve the meal.
0TO0010391	It was Mortimer, one of the White Gloves, who had Ted taken. He's a cannibal.
0TO0010392	<Lie> I don't know who took him. I just found him.
0TO0010393	You can blame the White Glove Society. They're all cannibals.
0TO0010394	Your son is confused. He doesn't know what he's saying.
0TO0010395	Let's not be hasty. You don't have to punish the entire Strip.
0TO0010396	That's just what they'd want. You'd be driving the city to eat each other.
0TO0010397	That sounds like a fantastic idea.
0TO0010398	But, but, but... that's so unfair. You should only punish the man who did it.
0TO0010399	Actually, the White Glove Society is responsible. They're all cannibals.
0TO0010400	I want to join the White Glove Society. I was told I'd need a sponsor.
0TO0010401	Would you be willing to sponsor me as an honorary member now?
0TO0010402	<Loudly> Bad news, Mortimer. No one's eating the boy you kidnapped tonight.
0TO0010403	I'm looking for the Gourmand. Am I in the right place?
0TO0010404	Sorry, Mortimer. Secret recipe. It isn't human, though, I can tell you that.
0TO0010405	[Attack] You all heard his confession! The punishment for cannibalism is death!
0TO0010406	Too late, Mortimer. You already said too much.
0TO0010407	Yes, sir.
0TO0010408	I think you may have me confused with someone else.
0TO0010409	Who do you think you are, talking to me that way?
0TO0010410	I'll go back to my job now.
0TO0010411	[Attack] You'll be feeding birds when I'm through with you.
0TO0010412	<Lie> Oh no, you have it right. I'm a server.
0TO0010413	<Lie> I'm here to talk business.  Interested in putting out a cookbook?
0TO0010414	Hey, could I, uh, buy some of your recipes?
0TO0010415	You're screwed up in the head.
0TO0010416	Your predisposition towards anger suggests unresolved issues in your past.
0TO0010417	I'm a new honorary member of the White Glove Society.
0TO0010418	That's right. I don't work for you.
0TO0010419	You may be projecting. Tell me more about your parents.
0TO0010420	What about the banquet?
0TO0010421	You go do that, then.
0TO0010422	I was just wondering where I could find tonight's wines.
0TO0010423	[Attack] I just stopped by to kill you.
0TO0010424	It'll be huge. I'll advance you a hundred caps, plus half the gross.
0TO0010425	Yes. We're a major publisher. But as a sign of good faith I'll need recipes.
0TO0010426	Uh... how about you give me your recipes and then we'll see.
0TO0010427	I'll advance you a hundred caps and then... wait, I don't have that much on me.
0TO0010428	My mistake. Let's discuss other things.
0TO0010429	I think I saw a radroach in the pantry. You should check it out.
0TO0010430	Would you, uh, go step in the pantry for a minute?
0TO0010431	Calm down. I've come to get you out of here.
0TO0010432	There's no time to explain. We have to go now.
0TO0010433	Some members of the White Glove Society. They were going to eat you.
0TO0010434	<Lie> I don't know who did this.
0TO0010435	The White Glove Society isn't to blame. Just Mortimer and a few others.
0TO0010436	You should have them all killed. It would serve them right.
0TO0010437	You're right. Let's make sure they're all killed.
0TO0010438	I could always leave you here if you aren't going to listen.
0TO0010439	[Attack] Doesn't matter. I'm going to finish what they started.
0TO0010440	[Attack] He'll never know, because I'm going to kill you.
0TO0010441	It's not my problem. I don't care what you do.
0TO0010442	Thanks for the food.
0TO0010443	Are you with the NCR military?
0TO0010444	Tell me about yourself, Ambassador.
0TO0010445	I'd like to know more about the NCR.
0TO0010446	Uh... no word yet. I'll get back to you on it.
0TO0010448	What's happening around the Strip?
0TO0010449	I don't think it's going to work out. Sorry.
0TO0010452	Sorry, I'm not interested.
0TO0010453	Actually, I already know them. We're good friends.
0TO0010454	I've met with the Boomers. I don't think it'll work out.
0TO0010455	I know where they are. I'll go and talk to them.
0TO0010456	I'll find them and talk to them.
0TO0010457	About that thing you wanted to talk about, let's hear it.
0TO0010458	The Boomers have agreed to help me.
0TO0010459	Yes... they will help... "us."
0TO0010460	Uh... I'm not sure. I'll get back to you.
0TO0010461	That's enough history for me.
0TO0010463	Interesting, go on.
0TO0010464	I'd like to ask about something else instead.
0TO0010467	Sure, I'll keep an eye out.
0TO0010468	Talent scouting isn't really my thing. I think I'll pass.
0TO0010469	Yeah, I hear you. Any idea where he goes when he disappears like that?
0TO0010470	So, Benny likes to take off, huh? Uhh, want to tell me where he goes?
0TO0010472	Okay, sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.
0TO0010473	Really? What kind of entertainment do you have?
0TO0010474	Maybe I could help you find some more acts for your show.
0TO0010475	I've reconsidered about the talent scouting.
0TO0010476	Sounds great.
0TO0010477	Make it 5% and you've got a deal.
0TO0010478	No way, I won't do it for less than 50%!
0TO0010479	What's Benny planning to do with the Chip?
0TO0010480	What was Benny planning to do with the Chip?
0TO0010482	Have you seen this Platinum Chip before?
0TO0010483	Benny reprogrammed a Securitron? All by himself?
0TO0010486	Shouldn't you be working for Mr. House? How'd you end up here?
0TO0010488	Can that actually be done?
0TO0010490	What do you think about Benny?
0TO0010492	What other entertainment is there on the Strip?
0TO0010493	Let's talk about the acts I recruited.
0TO0010494	Tell me about this theater.
0TO0010495	Swank mentioned you might be looking for some new acts. Can I help?
0TO0010496	Yeah, let's have some fun.
0TO0010499	Actually I'm looking for someone named Cachino.
0TO0010500	Nothing, I was just leaving.
0TO0010501	Is this journal worth 100 caps to you?
0TO0010502	Ok, 100 caps and you help me break up whatever your bosses have planned.
0TO0010503	Do you think the Family would like to see this?
0TO0010504	I think I'm going to keep this for a little while.
0TO0010506	I'll consider giving this to you, for some cash up front.
0TO0010507	Err... Well if you give me everything you have, I'll consider making a deal.
0TO0010508	Why don't you try and take it from me?
0TO0010509	What kind of specialist is Clanden?
0TO0010510	Clanden has been handled already.
0TO0010511	Tell me about this Troike.
0TO0010512	Do you know anything about what they are planning?
0TO0010513	That's all the questions I have for now. I may have more later.
0TO0010515	<Lie> I didn't have a choice - they started shooting first.
0TO0010516	Like you said, things went bad.
0TO0010517	That was me, "negotiating."
0TO0010518	He did. And anything you could tell me about what happened might help.
0TO0010519	Why else would I be here asking questions?
0TO0010521	Every bit helps. Thanks.
0TO0010522	The King asked me to look into your attack.
0TO0010523	What can you tell me about the attack?
0TO0010524	Do you remember anything about the people who attacked you?
0TO0010526	Why do I need a bodyguard crossing Freeside?
0TO0010528	What if I'm not going to the south gate?
0TO0010529	I don't think I need your services. Sorry.
0TO0010530	Okay, I'll hire you.
0TO0010531	The King said you could set me up with a pass to the Strip.
0TO0010532	Thanks, I'd like to buy some stuff before I head out.
0TO0010533	See you later, Ralph.
0TO0010536	A resourceful fellow such as yourself must have something on the side.
0TO0010537	Let me in on the action!
0TO0010538	Ah, now I see why you want to keep this low key.
0TO0010539	Too steep for my blood. Maybe later.
0TO0010540	Okay, I'll take one.
0TO0010541	<Pay 500 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
0TO0010542	<Pay 375 caps> Okay, I'll take one.
0TO0010543	I've already got enough caps to pass the credit check.
0TO0010544	No way your materials and expenses require that. How about half?
0TO0010545	I'd like to buy a passport.
0TO0010546	500 caps.
0TO0010547	It's not worth mentioning.
0TO0010548	Nothing, I talked my way in.
0TO0010549	I'm looking for a way into the Strip.
0TO0010550	I've been sent by the NCR to end the violence against their citizens.
0TO0010551	I figured you might have some work for me.
0TO0010552	Sure. What do I have to do?
0TO0010553	Not really. I guess I'll go find another way.
0TO0010555	Sure, I've got one waiting outside for me.
0TO0010556	No, I must have missed them.
0TO0010558	Why are you so interested in this?
0TO0010559	Why can't your men look into this?
0TO0010561	Orris is a fraud. He fakes attacks on his clients and then plays hero.
0TO0010562	Not much. He seemed legit to me.
0TO0010563	Orris shouldn't be a problem any longer.
0TO0010572	Look, I found these cigarette butts by the grave he buried me in.
0TO0010573	I found this lighter in Boulder City. He dropped it when he killed his partners.
0TO0010574	Here, take a look at this note I found in Novac.
0TO0010575	What's the story with the White Glove Society?
0TO0010576	Look, just trust me on this, okay?
0TO0010577	That's it. What do you think?
0TO0010579	Actually, never mind. It's nothing.
0TO0010580	We don't have time for that. We need to take him out right now.
0TO0010581	I don't think you're going to like it. Seems Benny's been making his own play.
0TO0010582	Uh, well, you know Benny's planning to screw you over, right?
0TO0010583	Ha ha! Take it easy, pal, I'm just pulling your leg. Honest.
0TO0010584	Go ahead, see if I care.
0TO0010585	Benny tried to kill me and stole a platinum chip I was hired to deliver.
0TO0010586	Benny stole my chip! And he tried to kill me, Mr. House said so!
0TO0010587	He tried to make it look like an accident - just a traveler killed and robbed in the Wasteland.
0TO0010588	Benny's going to steal all of House's robots! Don't you see?
0TO0010589	Benny must think this chip will allow him to seize power on the Strip.
0TO0010590	Let's talk about the Omertas.
0TO0010592	Tell me about the Chairmen.
0TO0010593	Flattering, but I don't like being tied down. How about some real work?
0TO0010594	Baby, you're too good to me! How about some caps to buy myself something pretty?
0TO0010595	I've got more questions about New Vegas.
0TO0010597	Not yet. Soon.
0TO0010598	Yeah, he's dead.
0TO0010599	He bolted. But I'll find him.
0TO0010600	They took my guns at the security checkpoint. Can you set me up?
0TO0010602	Not yet, I want to take care of a few things first.
0TO0010603	Yeah, send him up to his room. I'll take care of him.
0TO0010604	Yeah. Keep him distracted while I search his room.
0TO0010605	You first.
0TO0010606	I'm looking for someone who went missing.
0TO0010607	Just someone who found a matchbook.
0TO0010608	He's dead.
0TO0010609	<Lie> He couldn't make it, so he sent me instead.
0TO0010610	You don't want to know.
0TO0010611	I found the matchbook on a body in a hotel room.
0TO0010612	No. I'm trying to find a different missing person and ran across the man's body.
0TO0010613	[Attack] I am now.
0TO0010614	Who are you afraid of?
0TO0010615	What were you supposed to discuss here?
0TO0010616	So is Mortimer behind the disappearances?
0TO0010617	How do you know what happened to the girl?
0TO0010618	What about Ted Gunderson?
0TO0010619	Wouldn't they punish Mortimer for the deception?
0TO0010620	Where are they keeping Ted?
0TO0010621	Any suggestions on how to get Ted out?
0TO0010622	Okay. Game's over. Now pay up or I'll break your bones one by one, little man!
0TO0010623	You lived in Vault 21? Tell me about that.
0TO0010624	I guess you're having trouble with Mr. House requests. What's the problem?
0TO0010625	An artist - rare thing to see. What's your story?
0TO0010626	(Lie) You really believed I wasn't working for Mr. House? Chump.
0TO0010627	Lets see... You've got that thingy... there. Power, uh, re-circulators here....
0TO0010628	Better cough up some caps or Mr. House finds about your sorry excuses.
0TO0010629	Relax. I was just kidding. What's all this fretting about Mr. House?
0TO0010630	Have you seen the cost of pliers, duct-tape and saws lately? 300 caps.
0TO0010631	Artists are scarce. I bet you get paid handsomely. Cough up 300 caps.
0TO0010632	Oh, so you've got lots of caps on you? Then I guess I can just beat them out of you.
0TO0010633	(Lie) So, uh, wasn't it clever how I tricked you? I'm... working for Mr. House!
0TO0010634	All right. 150 caps will do.
0TO0010635	300 caps it is.
0TO0010636	Why do you have a problem with Mr. House's requests?
0TO0010637	You exhibit clear symptoms of acute agoraphobia. I can help.
0TO0010638	Oh, that's, uh, I have it at the tip of my tongue... Agomorrahphobia! I'll help.
0TO0010639	So, is this fear of the outside world draining your inspiration?
0TO0010640	It sounds as if you don't like this place. What is wrong with it?
0TO0010641	Why don't you pack up and return to Vault 21?
0TO0010642	You seem to dread hearing about Mr. House's requests. What is the problem?
0TO0010643	Relax. I was just kidding.
0TO0010646	Several years of psychoanalysis, and a few thousand caps a month, will fix you.
0TO0010647	I know this guy in Freeside, really good at trepanation. You'd be amazed how h-.
0TO0010648	Grow a pair and go out into the real world to find your inspiration!
0TO0010649	I could escort you into the wasteland. It's not so bad.
0TO0010651	I'll help you. Do you have any landmarks in mind?
0TO0010652	Mickey, photography is a risky business. This is going to cost you. A lot.
0TO0010653	You know, I'm tired of this. I think I'll just beat you senseless instead.
0TO0010654	Ok, you've got a deal. I'll return with the pictures.
0TO0010655	I have some fresh pictures for you.
0TO0010656	I'm glad we have an understanding. Now, do you have any landmarks in mind?
0TO0010657	You're not making this easy. Screw it. Hand over the caps or drop dead.
0TO0010658	That's a very... inspired choice, Mickey.
0TO0010659	Groveling brings out the worst in me. I'm going to enjoy this.
0TO0010660	Tell me about you again.
0TO0010661	You mentioned growing up in Vault 21. Can you tell me about that?
0TO0010662	What's your story, Michael Angelo?
0TO0010663	I have some ideas that may help with your agoraphobia problem.
0TO0010664	What landmarks did you want me to photograph?
0TO0010665	I took all the pictures you wanted. There was something about a reward...
0TO0010666	All right. I'll bring you more next time. Good bye
0TO0010670	Let's see. Walk half the world or rough you up right now... Mickey, you lose.
0TO0010672	I've got evidence that Benny tried to kill me and stole a Platinum Chip from me.
0TO0010673	I've got more evidence that proves Benny tried to kill me.
0TO0010674	I think you should know something about Benny.
0TO0010675	What do you know about the NCR?
0TO0010676	Nice place you've got here. Tell me about it.
0TO0010677	Can you give me the rundown on New Vegas?
0TO0010678	The Omertas won't take kindly to hearing about your relationship with Joana.
0TO0010679	I hear you've been doing some business on the side.
0TO0010680	What can you tell me about Gomorrah?
0TO0010681	I hear you've been dealing with some business that is off limits for the family.
0TO0010682	I found this ledger that proves some of your side business.
0TO0010683	I'd like to talk to you about your journal.
0TO0010684	That's it for questions.
0TO0010690	The Great Khans let the hostages go in exchange for their own freedom.
0TO0010691	Go for it. The Great Khans have nowhere to run.
0TO0010692	You're the officer here. Make the call.
0TO0010693	Uh... am I in charge now? That can't be right.
0TO0010694	What guns do you have for sale?
0TO0010696	What's the deal with the Omertas?
0TO0010698	I think I figured out why the Omertas stopped buying.
0TO0010699	They found a way to smuggle guns in at a lower price.
0TO0010700	Good news. The Omertas say they'll buy arms from you again.
0TO0010701	What do you have in stock?
0TO0010702	Do you offer any other services?
0TO0010704	Nice place. Got a minute to talk?
0TO0010705	Somehow I find that hard to believe.
0TO0010707	I'd like to talk about you some more.
0TO0010708	What's some fun going to run me?
0TO0010710	What brought you here?
0TO0010713	I'm not a kid, old man.
0TO0010714	I'd like to see what you have on tap.
0TO0010715	I'm looking for a little R&R.
0TO0010716	I'd like to help you with your debt collection.
0TO0010718	[Give 10 caps] Here you go.
0TO0010719	Nevermind, I changed my mind.
0TO0010720	Couldn't we work out a deal?
0TO0010721	Do you have any work you need done around here?
0TO0010722	Will I have to shoot anyone? Because I really want to shoot someone.
0TO0010723	That sounds good as long as I don't have to kill anyone.
0TO0010724	What kind of caps are we talking here?
0TO0010725	Eh, sorry.  I've got some other things I need to handle first.
0TO0010730	Who's the King?
0TO0010731	Yes, I'd like to see the King if possible.
0TO0010733	Here's 5 caps.
0TO0010735	Is 500 caps enough?
0TO0010736	Maybe I should be going.
0TO0010737	50 caps.
0TO0010738	You lost your son?
0TO0010739	So you're a rancher?
0TO0010740	Did you say something about a white glove?
0TO0010741	What business did you have here at the hotel?
0TO0010742	Never mind. I was mistaken.
0TO0010743	He's over in the bathhouse, wearing a skimpy two-piece bathing suit.
0TO0010744	Sorry. I didn't realize the situation was so serious.
0TO0010745	I'm looking for someone who went missing here recently.
0TO0010746	The White Glove Society used to eat human flesh?
0TO0010747	Who did you talk to about the disappearance?
0TO0010748	It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
0TO0010749	<Lie> It's okay. I eat people too. You can tell me the truth.
0TO0010750	Is there any way I could talk to the investigator?
0TO0010751	Do you work here?
0TO0010752	Heck Gunderson said he was here to talk business with you. What business?
0TO0010753	Marjorie said you gave a free room to a private investigator.
0TO0010754	Actually, I just need to speak with him.
0TO0010755	<Lie> Yes, I have some critical information for him.
0TO0010756	I'm on an investigation, too. I'm hoping we can help each other.
0TO0010757	Anything going on around here?
0TO0010758	What goods and services do you have to offer?
0TO0010760	Any bounty hunting tips for me?
0TO0010761	You need medical supplies?
0TO0010766	Could you be more specific? That could be a lot of people.
0TO0010767	<Lie> Yes, I saw him here in the hotel.
0TO0010769	Here's the money. It sounds like I could use a bodyguard.
0TO0010770	I'd hire you, but I don't have the caps.
0TO0010777	I don't really think I need a bodyguard.
0TO0010781	Why would I need a bodyguard in Freeside?
0TO0010784	Sorry, maybe another time.
0TO0010787	Are you soliciting me?
0TO0010789	What kind of tip?
0TO0010790	I'm not a trooper. I just happen to be wearing the armor.
0TO0010791	Why is the Big Horn off limits to troopers?
0TO0010792	But I already got a tattoo with your name on it. Want to see it?
0TO0010793	You'd think the NCR would be very concerned about this sort of thing.
0TO0010794	You think someone is listening in on your broadcasts?
0TO0010795	Great, neither am I. Glad we cleared that up.
0TO0010796	I think you're mistaking me for someone else.
0TO0010797	I can't do this right now.
0TO0010798	I ran out of ammo.
0TO0010801	These Great Khans might have something of mine - a Platinum Chip.
0TO0010803	They'll be using explosives. Do you have something for more serious injuries?
0TO0010804	The town is going to be attacked by bandits. Anything you can do to help?
0TO0010805	Did my attackers say where they were going?
0TO0010806	Why is that?
0TO0010807	So where were they headed?
0TO0010808	Powder gangers?
0TO0010809	Some good you were. You didn't even show up to the fight.
0TO0010810	They were here. The fight's over.
0TO0010811	Didn't you hear all the gunfire?
0TO0010812	Interesting. It looks like an override command was activated.
0TO0010813	Override Command 16-Delta. Does that mean anything to you?
0TO0010814	Figures. Someone shut you down deliberately, but there's no record of who.
0TO0010815	Here are three Stimpaks.
0TO0010816	You didn't exactly roll out a red carpet!
0TO0010817	You mean you were expecting me? Like a prophecy or something?
0TO0010818	Who is Mother Pearl?
0TO0010820	Are you going to confiscate my weapons?
0TO0010825	<Watch Festus draw a card.>
0TO0010834	<Press the blue button to draw a card.>
0TO0010835	<Press the blue Draw button.>
0TO0010844	<Press the red button to hold.>
0TO0010845	<Press the red Hold button.>
0TO0010849	I'm allowed to use the range?
0TO0010850	You were the last one to check out the missing laser pistol, right?
0TO0010851	So what happened?
0TO0010852	I've got it right here.
0TO0010855	Sorry, I haven't found it yet.
0TO0010859	Okay, I'm in.
0TO0010860	[END TUTORIAL] I think I've learned enough.
0TO0010861	Sure, I'll come with you.
0TO0010862	[END TUTORIAL] I've had enough of geckos for one day.
0TO0010865	Didn't I hear you say something earlier about not being able to pay me now?
0TO0010866	Is that the story you're going to stick with?
0TO0010867	Staying because you want to or because you have to? This is a good hiding spot.
0TO0010868	Thanks for the caps.
0TO0010869	What does he actually do around here?
0TO0010870	You don't like him?
0TO0010872	Never mind. I want to talk about something else.
0TO0010873	How long has he been in Goodsprings?
0TO0010874	I've never seen a robot like you before.
0TO0010875	I repaired the solar arrays and increased their efficiency.
0TO0010877	Is this some kind of joke?
0TO0010879	Um, what? Is that it?
0TO0010881	What the hell? Where's the real prize?
0TO0010882	If you're so opposed to the NCR's expansion, why not do something about it?
0TO0010884	Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help?
0TO0010885	Yeah, you've been a real bundle of laughs.
0TO0010886	I don't, sorry.
0TO0010887	I'm afraid it's classified.
0TO0010888	He was sabotaging the NCR's war efforts to force a retreat back to California.
0TO0010889	Yes, it's true. I don't know why.
0TO0010890	Yes, but it's a classified secret. Don't tell anybody.
0TO0010891	Yes. He was sabotaging the Army to force the NCR to go home.
0TO0010893	Isn't it customary for a doctor to prescribe follow-up medication?
0TO0010894	My wounds still hurt a little. Can you give me something for the pain, Doc?
0TO0010895	I'm in a *lot* of pain, Doc. Can you spare any more?
0TO0010896	Don't I at least get a lollipop before leaving, Doc?
0TO0010898	Tell me about yourself, Doc.
0TO0010900	What else can you tell me about Goodsprings?
0TO0010901	Could you give me the rundown on Goodsprings one more time?
0TO0010902	What town is this?
0TO0010904	Who was it that rescued me?
0TO0010905	Do you know anything about the man that shot me?
0TO0010907	Seems a little light for the work I did.
0TO0010908	If you insist.
0TO0010909	Can you tell me anything about Goodsprings?
0TO0010910	Tell me more about the Crimson Caravan Company.
0TO0010912	How did you happen to find me?
0TO0010913	Do you know who those men were who attacked me?
0TO0010914	How did you end up in Goodsprings?
0TO0010917	I'm suffering from radiation sickness.
0TO0010918	All right. Here's three doses of Fixer.
0TO0010920	Here's two doses of Rad-Away.
0TO0010922	Here are two Stimpaks.
0TO0010924	Wager? Let's hear it.
0TO0010925	300 caps? Too rich for my blood.
0TO0010926	<Pay 300 caps> You've got yourself a bet.
0TO0010928	300 caps? I'm a bit short right now. How about 200?
0TO0010929	300 caps?! 50 sounds like a fair price.
0TO0010931	You can tell me, or you can tell the underside of my boot.
0TO0010933	What was the deal again?
0TO0010934	I believe you said you would double my money.
0TO0010935	That was X caps.
0TO0010936	That was 600 caps.
0TO0010937	That was 400 caps.
0TO0010938	<Lie> Make it 700 caps or I'll tell the Boomers to adjust their trajectory.
0TO0010939	I think it deserves closer to 1000 caps.
0TO0010941	Yep, thanks for the compliment. Bye!
0TO0010943	I have one right here.
0TO0010945	Corn silk, rubber hose, and removable adhesive would make a good hermetic seal.
0TO0010946	Aw c'mon, it looks fine. I bet the seal will hold.
0TO0010949	I think I can handle a few ants without a sonic emitter.
0TO0010950	I repaired the solar arrays.
0TO0010951	I fixed the arrays and improved their efficiency a bit too.
0TO0010952	Could you me tell the story of the mural again?
0TO0010954	Sure, I can spare the time.
0TO0010955	Another time, maybe.
0TO0010956	I'm surprised Nellis was empty when your people found it.
0TO0010957	How do you survive, totally cut off from the world?
0TO0010958	Why did your ancestors leave the safety of a vault?
0TO0010959	What are howitzers doing at an Air Force Base?
0TO0010960	How has Nellis taught your people to fly?
0TO0010961	How did you learn where to find an old bomber?
0TO0010962	That's enough history for now.
0TO0010963	I'm looking to make myself useful. Who needs help around here?
0TO0010964	Your people were willing to risk it all for freedom.
0TO0010965	Yeah, any detonation with a yield of less than a half-ton of TNT is boring.
0TO0010966	Yeah, I *love* it when I throw a grenade and it goes BANG!
0TO0010967	You people are really crazy about blowing stuff up!
0TO0010968	But a little radiation didn't keep your people away!
0TO0010969	Whereas your people had brought Geiger counters with them from the vault.
0TO0010970	But your people were mutants, immune to the radiation!
0TO0010971	Kind of stupid, making a radioactive scrapheap your home.
0TO0010972	The ingenuity of your people is remarkable.
0TO0010973	You must cultivate soy or legumes for protein, in addition to grains.
0TO0010974	But where do you get protein? Oh my god! You're all *cannibals!*
0TO0010975	I guess poor nutrition could explain a lot of your behavior.
0TO0010976	Your people are a determined bunch.
0TO0010977	That howitzer battery is a monument to the grit and resolve of your people.
0TO0010978	You folks would sell your souls for some artillery! You just love the stuff!
0TO0010979	Yeah, you people are coo-koo for things that go boom.
0TO0010980	Of course. You wouldn't want outsiders learning to fly.
0TO0010981	Oh, to slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance amid the soaring birds...
0TO0010982	Oh, to flap one's arms and plunge bird-like headlong and skybound...
0TO0010983	Simulators, ha! That's a crash waiting to happen!
0TO0010984	I look forward to seeing the old bomber fly.
0TO0010985	You could attach ballast to the plane and then haul it here for repairs...
0TO0010986	I guess you could start the engines underwater and hop it up onto shore...
0TO0010987	Keep dreaming. That plane's never going to fly.
0TO0010999	Get the troops lines up. I'll help you with it.
0TO0011001	Okay, to start, pull the pin, let it cook off for a count of three, then throw.
0TO0011002	Okay, count to three, throw the grenade, and pull the pin. Wait, no....
0TO0011003	Don't pitch it like a baseball, lob it. You want a good, solid arc.
0TO0011004	Now, um... really whip them downrange. Like you're throwing a fastball!
0TO0011005	Don't worry about accuracy - use the grenades to break up clusters of enemies.
0TO0011006	No, no, no! You have to *hit* the target with the grenade or it won't go off!
0TO0011007	I think that went well, don't you?
0TO0011009	Never mind. I need to think about this.
0TO0011010	You can't find Ringo yourself?
0TO0011011	All right, I'll kill him for you.
0TO0011012	All right. Here's two doses of Fixer.
0TO0011013	Here's three doses of Rad-Away.
0TO0011014	I have some missiles for you.
0TO0011015	Anything else I can help out with?
0TO0011016	Nice talking to you.
0TO0011018	I'm not sure if I'll be able to spare any, but I'll let you know.
0TO0011019	I have 1 spare missile.
0TO0011020	I have 5 spare missiles.
0TO0011021	I have 10 spare missiles.
0TO0011022	Sorry, I was mistaken. I don't have any extra missiles.
0TO0011031	Take positions where you can cover each other. Stay focused.
0TO0011032	Umm... I guess everybody should shoot the hell out of the target?
0TO0011033	Take your time. Pick your shots and tell your squadmates who you're shooting at.
0TO0011034	No, no, you're doing it all wrong! Shoot faster! *Faster!*
0TO0011035	Exhale before you fire. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it.
0TO0011036	You're never going to hit anything shooting in one direction. Fire wildly!
0TO0011037	Well, I think that went well, don't you?
0TO0011041	Yes, terrible shame. Did you find anything of value on the Powder Gangers?
0TO0011042	We all knew what we were getting into.
0TO0011045	What did he want?
0TO0011046	Yes, he was probably trying to steal some Sunset Sarsaparilla Stars from you.
0TO0011048	Do you have any bottlecaps with stars on them?
0TO0011050	Fine. Here's 1000 caps.
0TO0011052	Stay here for now. I'll see if there's anything else I can do first.
0TO0011053	You need a hired gun. I'm available.
0TO0011054	It'll have to do. What now?
0TO0011055	I don't need payment.
0TO0011058	How many are there?
0TO0011059	Where's Trudy and the rest?
0TO0011061	I wish I could've done more to save him.
0TO0011063	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hey there. I have a nice toy rocket for you.
0TO0011064	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Hey kid, I have some gum here. It is good for you!
0TO0011065	[Offer Toy Rocket] I found this rocket toy you can have.
0TO0011066	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Here you go kid, gum is fun!
0TO0011068	[Offer Dinosaur Toy] Oh, then I bet you'd love this dinosaur toy.
0TO0011069	[Offer Radiactive Gum] I hear dinosaurs like gum.
0TO0011071	Mission control, you can't fly without a rocket. Here take this toy rocket.
0TO0011072	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Astronauts chew space gum.
0TO0011074	[Offer Toy Rocket] Hmm, will this rocket cover my toll?
0TO0011075	[Offer Radioactive Gum] Here take this gum instead.
0TO0011077	[Offer Toy Dinosaur] Woah there Red-Brick, why don't you box with this dinosaur toy.
0TO0011078	[Offer Chems] You know what will help you box better? Psycho, would you like some?
0TO0011080	I believe La Fantoma could use a rocket toy to enhancer her flight.
0TO0011081	[Offer Radiactive Gum] Does La Fantoma need some power gum?
0TO0011083	Any idea why?
0TO0011091	How do I play?
0TO0011110	Lucky Horseshoes.
0TO0011113	If they don't, it's their loss.
0TO0011114	He thinks you might respond better to someone who isn't an authority figure.
0TO0011115	I guess you don't feel so smart now, huh?
0TO0011116	Maybe I can help out.
0TO0011117	It occurs to me that I might cheat.
0TO0011119	I'd like to know more about star hunting.
0TO0011120	No, I have to be going.

0TO0011166	Strongly disagree.

0TO0011188	A chemical reaction.
0TO0011189	A shadow in a doorframe.
0TO0011190	An oozing wound.
0TO0011191	An angry two-headed ant.
0TO0011192	I see a priceless work of art.
0TO0011193	It's some piece of space-age technology.
0TO0011194	A ship at sea.
0TO0011195	I'm too embarrassed to say what it looks like.
0TO0011196	A light in the darkness.
0TO0011197	A bearded man.
0TO0011198	A mushroom cloud.
0TO0011199	A head on a pillow.
0TO0011203	What other towns are nearby?
0TO0011204	What kind of creatures are out there?
0TO0011207	Think of it as a field test. A trial run.
0TO0011208	Maybe tilt the... megareceiver? To 73.5 kilonewtons...?
0TO0011210	Good news. She feels the same way.
0TO0011211	I'm working on it. I need to talk to Pearl first.
0TO0011213	Recover a Lady? What are you talking about?
0TO0011214	I can wait until Pearl or Loyal want to tell me.
0TO0011215	Tell me about her.
0TO0011216	Oh. That sort of "personal matter." Forget I asked.
0TO0011217	I've had other things to attend to.
0TO0011218	I've seen her, but we haven't talked about you yet.
0TO0011219	I spoke to Pearl, but Janet needs a way past the artillery.
0TO0011220	I told her how to get through the artillery barrage.
0TO0011221	It's not my fault that your tribe blows up everyone who comes close.
0TO0011222	<Lie> It's a tragedy. She loved you so much, she risked it all.
0TO0011223	<Lie> She was so excited to see you, she wouldn't wait.
0TO0011224	Maybe another time. Goodbye.
0TO0011225	That sounds really creepy, Loyal.
0TO0011226	That sounds impossible.
0TO0011227	If it's so simple, why haven't you done it?
0TO0011228	All right. I'm game.
0TO0011229	That's just about the stupidest idea I ever heard.
0TO0011230	That don't sound too smart to me.
0TO0011231	Any ideas how to get to the bottom of Lake Mead without drowning?
0TO0011234	Maybe I can help you whip them into shape.
0TO0011235	Tough luck. If the Legion attacks, they're dead meat.
0TO0011236	So, that's a no, then?
0TO0011237	I wonder if anyone else would share that sentiment.
0TO0011238	Great, maybe you can help me get this squad working together!
0TO0011239	Since you're so respected, maybe you can help get this unit into shape.
0TO0011240	That's charming. It's good to know team-building is alive and well.
0TO0011241	Sounds like a bunch of winners.
0TO0011242	I'm sorry, I don't know enough to help. I wish I did.
0TO0011244	I have extensive medical knowledge. Let's see what I can do.
0TO0011245	Sorry. I'm sure you know more than I do.
0TO0011246	<Lie> I'm a medical expert and my specialty is giant insect bites!
0TO0011247	<Lie> I assume the ants' tibular nastis pierced the patients' anterior traxes?
0TO0011248	Who is Mister Cuddles?
0TO0011249	Sorry, I don't have time right now.
0TO0011250	Ok, I'll look for him.
0TO0011251	Think really hard. What were you doing when you saw him last?
0TO0011252	Great work Lindsay! I'll go take a look for him.
0TO0011253	I have Mister Cuddles right here.
0TO0011254	<Lie> I'm sorry Lindsay. Mister Cuddles is dead.
0TO0011255	<Lie> I already told you he's dead. Get over it already, kid.
0TO0011256	No, I haven't found him yet.
0TO0011257	Where do I start?
0TO0011259	How can we trust each other if you're going to be keeping secrets?
0TO0011260	I don't like being kept in dark, grandma. Clue me in.
0TO0011261	Sorry, not interested. I'll be leaving.
0TO0011262	Mother Pearl said you have a "bug problem?"
0TO0011263	If I do, you'll be the first to know.
0TO0011265	I can handle a few ants.
0TO0011266	I'll do it, even though you're just trying to get me killed.
0TO0011267	Thanks, but there are easier ways to commit suicide.
0TO0011268	Still in progress.
0TO0011269	All dead.
0TO0011270	Yes, it's safe to go down there now.
0TO0011271	Well, most of the ants are dead.
0TO0011272	<Lie> Yep, power on, ant's dead, all good.
0TO0011273	<Lie> I... Um... Tamed the ants, you don't have to worry about them anymore.
0TO0011274	Just doing my part to help out.
0TO0011275	Wait. I may have missed an ant or two.
0TO0011276	I'm looking for ways to make myself useful.
0TO0011277	I'm still looking for ways to make myself useful.
0TO0011278	I'm finished with your patients.
0TO0011280	I've finished treating your patients.
0TO0011286	How many powder gangers are out there?
0TO0011287	Maybe I can help.
0TO0011288	I'll ask around and see who I can round up.
0TO0011289	You don't think I can handle myself in a fight?
0TO0011290	Sunny's with us.
0TO0011292	I haven't talked to her yet.
0TO0011294	Well, that was easy.
0TO0011295	Just like that?
0TO0011296	We might die horribly. Well, maybe not me.
0TO0011297	It's odd that Cobb wasn't able to find Ringo. The town's not that big.
0TO0011302	Let them take over the town, then. I'm sure your business will be much better off.
0TO0011303	The town's at stake. That has to be worth more than a few supplies.
0TO0011305	I'm familiar with the care and handling of explosives, dynamite included.
0TO0011306	How hard can it be? Just light them and throw.
0TO0011308	That's... helpful.
0TO0011312	Where is Ringo now?
0TO0011313	Why not just kill Cobb and be done with it?
0TO0011315	I didn't come here to attack you.
0TO0011316	Can we move this along?
0TO0011317	Do you really think I'm scared of a punk like you?
0TO0011319	What's a Master-At-Arms?
0TO0011320	So the fact we're having this conversation means you failed, right?
0TO0011322	You seem distressed.  Is something going on?
0TO0011325	I'll do what I can.
0TO0011327	How'd a guy like you end up in the Army?
0TO0011329	Are you in charge around here?
0TO0011330	How'd you end up in the Army?
0TO0011331	What do you think of Camp Golf?
0TO0011332	Why are you so afraid of fighting?
0TO0011333	Tell me a little more about yourself.
0TO0011334	Can you tell me about your squadmates?
0TO0011335	Why are you in the Army?
0TO0011336	Can you tell me anything about Camp Golf?
0TO0011338	Know anything about your squadmates?
0TO0011339	Why'd you join the Army?
0TO0011340	How'd you end up assigned to Camp Golf?
0TO0011341	Tell me a little about yourself.
0TO0011342	Sounds like you aren't too fond of your squadmates.
0TO0011343	Good news - Sgt. McCredie's canceled the combat patrol.
0TO0011344	How do you like serving in the Army?
0TO0011345	How'd you end up at Camp Golf?
0TO0011346	Sounds like you're a little disappointed in your troops.
0TO0011349	He's nice, maybe a little naive. Seems convinced you're the love of his life.
0TO0011350	He's a catch. You should see him blush when I flirt with him.
0TO0011351	He's a special sort of guy - perfect for a special sort of gal.
0TO0011352	Let me see if I can get you safe passage past the artillery.
0TO0011353	<Lie> You have permission. They know you're coming.
0TO0011354	<Lie> Just wave your arms and run as fast as you can.
0TO0011355	I'm not sure. Let me think about it and I'll come back to you.
0TO0011356	I'll ask Pearl to make an exception for you.
0TO0011357	I doubt it.
0TO0011358	Actually, I wanted to talk to you about him again.
0TO0011359	He's doing well. I'll come back when I have some more information.
0TO0011360	I got a Boomer uniform for you to wear while you cross to Nellis.
0TO0011361	Not yet, but I hope to very soon.
0TO0011362	How come you didn't make it into the Rangers?
0TO0011363	This place doesn't seem so bad.
0TO0011364	Well, maybe if you tried to lead by example instead of tearing them down.
0TO0011365	You joined at 16 and you're still a sergeant?
0TO0011366	That's some dedication.
0TO0011367	Funny, I thought this was where they sent washouts and losers.
0TO0011368	So what do you do now that the fighting's died down?
0TO0011384	I'll take it.
0TO0011394	I'm sure the casinos of New Vegas love you.
0TO0011399	Do you know any redheads in these parts?
0TO0011400	I'm looking for a redhead girl, do you know any around here?
0TO0011401	I'm looking for a redheaded girl around here.
0TO0011402	I don't suppose you watch the Boomers over in Nellis sometimes, do you?
0TO0011404	No reason. I'll be off now.
0TO0011405	I've been inside Nellis. There's a young man there who has a crush on you.
0TO0011407	"Oh?"
0TO0011408	You were expecting someone else?
0TO0011410	It sounds like there's an interesting story behind it.
0TO0011411	Come on, you can tell me.
0TO0011412	I'm looking for ways to help out. Anything come to mind?
0TO0011413	Can you think of any ways I can help out?
0TO0011415	I can find you some scrap metal.
0TO0011417	"Personal matter?" Nonsense. Spit it out.
0TO0011418	Where I come from, we discuss personal matters all the time.
0TO0011419	Loyal said you can help me breathe under water.
0TO0011420	I can spare another.
0TO0011421	I can spare 4 more.
0TO0011423	So tell me about this girl that caught your interest.
0TO0011425	This doesn't interest me.
0TO0011426	What can you tell me about Loyal?
0TO0011427	Maybe I could talk to her for you. What's she look like?
0TO0011428	I'll look into it. Stranger things have happened.
0TO0011429	I've got scrap metal for you.
0TO0011431	Simple enough. Run, hide, run. It's all in the timing.
0TO0011432	I didn't run through all that artillery to hear your stupid questions.
0TO0011434	Thanks for the warning. What's going on past those signs?
0TO0011435	300 caps? Nah, I've got better things to spend my caps on.
0TO0011436	Is there a way to get past?
0TO0011437	Thanks for the warning, but I'm leaving.
0TO0011438	Just 1.
0TO0011442	Raquel said you were working on some kind of weapon to fight the giant ants?
0TO0011444	Any signal over 22,000 hertz at 150 or more decibels should do the trick.
0TO0011445	Oh. Does it have a dial or something? Turn it up to 11!
0TO0011446	Lady in the water? What's that?
0TO0011447	Where is the bomber located?
0TO0011448	How do you expect to raise a bomber from the bottom of a lake?
0TO0011450	Tell me again what I need to do.
0TO0011451	Your plan worked. The plane floated up. Seemed to be intact.
0TO0011452	You tell me. What do people have to say about me?
0TO0011453	Well, I think. I've done everything I can to help out.
0TO0011454	I'm still trying to figure out who to help and how.
0TO0011455	The ballast worked. The B-29 is at the surface, ready to go.
0TO0011456	I've spoken to Loyal. The B-29 is on the way.
0TO0011459	I'd like to know all about your people.
0TO0011460	I have some questions about your people's history.
0TO0011461	How might I be of assistance?
0TO0011462	How me help you?
0TO0011466	Nothing today. Goodbye.
0TO0011468	Uh... who are you?
0TO0011469	What's a Super Mutant like you doing in a place like this?
0TO0011471	Nice to meet you... Mahsohfabish.
0TO0011472	Do you have trouble speaking?
0TO0011475	I'm here to buy out Cassidy Caravans for the Crimson Caravan Company.
0TO0011476	I have proof that Sgt. Contreras is involved in criminal activity.
0TO0011477	He wants you to increase water flow to Freeside. Said it'd be lost otherwise.
0TO0011478	He was killed by a man named Anderson he caught stealing water from the NCR.
0TO0011479	A gang called the Scorpions murdered him. A man named Anderson witnessed it.
0TO0011481	I hacked into his computer and found evidence that he's selling NCR guns.
0TO0011482	No, nothing else.
0TO0011483	He admitted to manufacturing and selling chems.
0TO0011484	I object to the use of violence against prisoners of war.
0TO0011487	I'm going to retrieve the body of Ranger Morales.
0TO0011489	I'm going to take this basket of cakes to my grandmother's house.
0TO0011490	Out of my way.
0TO0011491	Actually I'm supposed to be getting a body out of there.
0TO0011492	I'll take my chances.
0TO0011493	Understood. Thanks for the help.
0TO0011494	Yeah, yeah. This isn't rocket science. Watch and learn.
0TO0011495	<Draw weapon> You're a dead man.
0TO0011496	No one works for Price, so who the hell are you?
0TO0011497	Isaac has me out looking for metal so they can do the first shipment.
0TO0011498	Has your research here turned up anything interesting?
0TO0011499	I did download some files earlier while exploring the vault.
0TO0011500	Fine, do it.
0TO0011501	Are these files valuable?
0TO0011502	Nice to meet you.
0TO0011503	Skip the introductions. Why are you here?
0TO0011504	Have you seen a ghoul named Keely around here?
0TO0011505	I don't have time to talk, sorry.
0TO0011506	Where is Keely now?
0TO0011507	I've been sent to look for her. Where is she now?
0TO0011508	Not really. Is your master around?
0TO0011509	Perhaps. I'll go down and look for her.
0TO0011510	Why don't you go and look for her?
0TO0011513	What was the name of the Fiend who was carrying keys?
0TO0011517	If I help you escape, will you give me the password he found?
0TO0011518	Give me the password he found, and I'll help you escape.
0TO0011519	<Intimidate> Give me the password or you're all going to die in here.
0TO0011521	Can you make it worth my while?
0TO0011522	I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
0TO0011524	I got lost. This place is so big.
0TO0011525	I could ask you the same question.
0TO0011529	Fine by me.
0TO0011531	I found this in Dermot's room. <Show her Dermot's ledger.>
0TO0011533	We'll see how it goes.
0TO0011536	I take it they were Fiends?
0TO0011537	No. Never heard of them.
0TO0011538	You've worked a lot of different trades?
0TO0011540	I didn't mean to offend. You don't have to tell me, if you'd rather not.
0TO0011543	Tell me about happened to them at Bitter Springs.
0TO0011544	I've heard enough. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0011545	Losing your parents must have been hard for you. I'm sorry.
0TO0011546	You don't really mean that, do you?
0TO0011547	So your name... it comes from Bitter Springs.
0TO0011548	How did you survive the massacre?
0TO0011549	You're not telling me something. You couldn't have forgotten the whole massacre.
0TO0011550	I really don't know. Come on, Sergeant, you can tell me.
0TO0011551	Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
0TO0011553	You don't really mean what you said about your parents, do you?
0TO0011554	Hey, these medical supplies look like chem ingredients.
0TO0011555	All right.  I guess I believe you.
0TO0011556	Bullshit.  If you're moving drugs, I'm going to have to report you.
0TO0011557	Lying bastard.  I want cut in on this action.
0TO0011558	The law is the law.  I'm done doing business with you.
0TO0011559	Yeah, I agree about the alcohol.
0TO0011560	I don't really agree with you, but I'm not interested in moving drugs for you.
0TO0011561	I'm not sure how much I can help. But I have another question.
0TO0011563	I got a little turned around. Where can I find your boss?
0TO0011564	Where can I find Private Crenshaw again?
0TO0011565	Where is Private Crenshaw's footlocker?
0TO0011568	I've heard you're kind of a prankster.
0TO0011569	What kinds of pranks have you pulled?
0TO0011570	That's great because I'm in the middle of pulling a prank right now.
0TO0011571	<Pull Pin>I just pulled the pin out of somebody's grenade.
0TO0011572	[Attack] I'm going to get you in trouble for blowing up the monorail.
0TO0011573	Good news, private. I'm here to relieve you.
0TO0011574	[Attack] The bad news is I'm here to relieve you of your life.
0TO0011575	Never mind, I was mistaken.
0TO0011576	Fascinating. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0011578	You sure know how to make a girl feel welcome.
0TO0011579	Can you heal me?
0TO0011580	That's noble of you.
0TO0011581	Good for you.
0TO0011582	Wow, some protector you turned out to be.
0TO0011583	I'm so sorry. Can I help?
0TO0011584	Wait a minute - why didn't they take you, too?
0TO0011585	They would have killed you if you fought. Maybe I can help you find them.
0TO0011587	Yes. They're all dead.
0TO0011588	Yes. They're all alive.
0TO0011589	Your children are alive.
0TO0011590	Your children are dead, but your wife made it.
0TO0011591	Your wife and one of the children made it out alive.
0TO0011592	Your wife and one of your children are dead.
0TO0011593	I'm sorry. She didn't make it.
0TO0011594	Dead as a doornail. Shouldn't have left her in the desert, Frankie.
0TO0011596	You remember everyone who passes through here?
0TO0011597	It's true. I've got a memorable face.
0TO0011599	Why did you leave the Rangers?
0TO0011600	How did you manage to escape Malpais?
0TO0011601	Thanks for the information.
0TO0011602	Some guy is standing in for Price.  I didn't inquire further.
0TO0011603	Price wasn't there.  I fought some guy claiming to be his replacement.
0TO0011604	The guy claiming to stand in for Price is dead.
0TO0011605	I convinced the Ranger to work with you.  You're safe, but be careful.
0TO0011607	No questions right now. I'll be going.
0TO0011608	How exactly should I ignite the gas?
0TO0011609	Did you say there'd be a blast?
0TO0011610	How am I supposed to survive that?
0TO0011611	Blast?
0TO0011612	And?
0TO0011613	No way. I'm not going to torch myself for your amusement.
0TO0011614	Where did these plants come from?
0TO0011615	How did you get this whole gas thing set up so quickly?
0TO0011616	What happened to the scientists, then?
0TO0011617	What were you doing down in that cave?
0TO0011618	Why is the door to the entrance locked?
0TO0011619	That data is valuable to me.
0TO0011620	Do you know how many caps I can get for it?
0TO0011621	In the right hands, it could do a lot of good. I'll see it gets there.
0TO0011622	Why did you move the Fiends into this Vault?
0TO0011626	What do you guys want?
0TO0011627	Look, all I did was talk to him. It's no big deal.
0TO0011628	All right, let's get this over with. I've got better things to do.
0TO0011629	I'd hate to kill you over a misunderstanding, but if that's what you want...
0TO0011645	How naive, Silus. Corruptio optimi pessima. Caesar sees you as a threat now.
0TO0011646	Legum servi sumus. We are both slaves to Caesar's law. And you are in violation.
0TO0011647	Timeo Danaos et dona ferentis. I posed as a mercenary to get inside the walls.
0TO0011648	What's going on in Westside?
0TO0011649	Motor-runner is dead. I brought his helmet as proof.
0TO0011650	I don't understand how you could be so careless with the life of a ranger.
0TO0011651	You did the right thing. If you'd sent more, they'd have been killed.
0TO0011652	You didn't have a choice. The Fiends were a growing threat.
0TO0011655	You're one of the Followers of the Apocalypse?
0TO0011658	What happened to your friend Nephi?
0TO0011659	What's the deal with all these refugees?
0TO0011660	What was it that brought you out here from Utah?
0TO0011663	That's too bad, but not my problem.
0TO0011664	That's a little forward, don't you think?
0TO0011666	Yes. But never a woman.
0TO0011668	Tell me about Maude.
0TO0011669	Tell me about this "Keith."
0TO0011671	I heard you were raped by Cook-cook.
0TO0011672	Don't you want some payback?
0TO0011673	10 of Spades blames himself.
0TO0011674	You were raped. That's not something you can just shrug off.
0TO0011675	You're a sniper?
0TO0011676	The big gun.
0TO0011677	I didn't know that all snipers wear shades.
0TO0011678	Who's your partner?
0TO0011679	So snipers work in pairs?
0TO0011680	Actually, I didn't notice the attitude until just now.
0TO0011681	How about a date? I like tough women.
0TO0011682	Have you seen any serious combat here?
0TO0011684	First I've heard about conscience in a while.
0TO0011685	I've killed so many people, I don't even think about it.
0TO0011687	Tell me about Keith again.
0TO0011688	I've got evidence - Keith has a set of marked cards he uses to cheat.
0TO0011689	I've got evidence - Keith is selling drugs to the locals.
0TO0011690	I've got proof that Keith is selling drugs and using marked cards.
0TO0011691	Sure, I'm in. Why not?
0TO0011692	I'll leave this one to the law.
0TO0011693	From what I hear, your players are pretty unlucky. What's your secret?
0TO0011694	I've run some cons in my day - one clever bastard to another, what's your trick?
0TO0011695	Boy... I sure could use some drugs. You know anybody that sells drugs?
0TO0011696	Gambling's not my scene. Maybe you could hook me up with something "medicinal?"
0TO0011697	I think I'll pass for now.
0TO0011698	Marked cards, huh? A little bit obvious, but not bad.
0TO0011700	I don't have that much on me.
0TO0011701	Jet's not my drug of choice. I'll keep looking.
0TO0011702	Do you know Violet and Driver Nephi?
0TO0011703	So, you cook all these animals around here?
0TO0011705	So, why do they call you Cook-Cook, anyway?
0TO0011707	What's a "Queenie?"
0TO0011708	Why do they call you Cook-Cook?
0TO0011709	I'll remember that.
0TO0011710	Oh. You've got a little pet. How sweet.
0TO0011711	I've never been more disturbed in my entire life.
0TO0011712	That's a nice club you've got there.
0TO0011713	Can you tell me about Cook-Cook and Violet?
0TO0011715	How many NCR citizens you figure you've killed with that club?
0TO0011716	I hear you came from Utah. A friend of yours asked me to check on you. Bert?
0TO0011717	It is? Really?
0TO0011718	Okay, I'll tell him.
0TO0011721	I found this ledger in Dermot's room.
0TO0011722	Look what I found in your room. <Show him the teddy bear.>
0TO0011727	I'm not a whore, you ugly bitch.
0TO0011734	Are you s-s-sure?
0TO0011735	No cause for w-w-w-what?
0TO0011736	You're right. I'm sorry.
0TO0011737	I shouldn't have insulted you. I'm sorry.
0TO0011738	Whatever. Goodbye.
0TO0011740	Tell me what happened.
0TO0011742	Yeah, hook me up!
0TO0011743	I'll pass, thanks.
0TO0011744	Would you sell me one?
0TO0011745	I'm sure they would. I'll just stand over here.
0TO0011746	Nice doggies. Want a treat?
0TO0011747	Tell me about those disappearances again.
0TO0011749	What exactly is this place?
0TO0011751	I found this teddy bear in Saint James' room. Look familiar?
0TO0011752	Sounds like a chaotic place. Is there any way I can help?
0TO0011753	Charming place. Let's talk about something else.
0TO0011754	What can you tell me about the missing people?
0TO0011755	I'm not really interested in running your errands, sorry.
0TO0011756	Can you remember anything else?
0TO0011757	I'll be back later.
0TO0011758	Sure. I'll do it.
0TO0011759	Sorry, still not interested.
0TO0011760	I'm going to need your help.
0TO0011761	How good is your squad?
0TO0011762	I need your help to kill him.
0TO0011763	Exactly. I'll be the bait.
0TO0011764	Do you think that will work?
0TO0011765	I'd rather just bring your people with me.
0TO0011767	I'll see what I can do. No promises, though.
0TO0011768	Forget it. I don't like the odds.
0TO0011770	Oh... Well, I'll come back when he's around.
0TO0011771	You said you were handling Price's goods while he's away?
0TO0011772	Just perceptive, and I assume you have nothing for sale so I'll be on my way.
0TO0011773	Contreras would like to work with you.
0TO0011774	Leave him alone and he'll share contact information.
0TO0011775	Don't charge him and he'll help you take down the local dealers.
0TO0011776	<Draw Weapon> Nevermind.  I think killing you will keep things simple.
0TO0011778	That sounds good to me.  What do you need done?
0TO0011779	What's the deal with all the dogs?
0TO0011780	What exactly are you on?
0TO0011781	What do you know about Driver Nephi and Cook-Cook?
0TO0011783	Where do you get all this meat?
0TO0011784	Hsu won't trust me enough to let me investigate.
0TO0011785	I've got to talk to you about Alice.
0TO0011786	Is there any work to be had here?
0TO0011787	Who did you say I should ask about work?
0TO0011789	McCarran is looking for a regular delivery of meat from local merchants.
0TO0011790	Corporal Farber said they can pay you the going market price in caps.
0TO0011791	They have an tons of vegetables and water.  How about expanding your business?
0TO0011792	McCarran could work out a regular exchange of fresh vegetables and clean water.
0TO0011794	I could use some directions.
0TO0011796	I'm looking to buy and sell things.
0TO0011798	Tell me about the farms.
0TO0011799	Who's ungrateful?
0TO0011800	Anything you tell me stays with me.
0TO0011802	Are there more dangerous posts?
0TO0011803	If the Fiends are so dangerous, why hasn't the NCR wiped them out?
0TO0011804	Fine, take it.
0TO0011805	A hundred caps? Forget it.
0TO0011806	I don't have that much.
0TO0011807	Why don't both of you get out of here? I'll make sure you have time to get away.
0TO0011809	I've got other things in mind, right now.
0TO0011810	I'll deal with them.
0TO0011812	Okay, I'll go see her.
0TO0011815	I haven't sent them to the sewers, yet.
0TO0011816	I've taken care of those troublemakers.
0TO0011819	I've dealt with those newcomers.
0TO0011820	Not yet. I'll get on it.
0TO0011822	I'm not interested in this right now.
0TO0011823	Alice's "friends" plan to use her to steal your Crimson Caravan earnings.
0TO0011824	So, about Alice...
0TO0011825	Have time to tell me about any work you need done?
0TO0011829	Anything I should know about New Vegas?
0TO0011832	I have some general questions for you.
0TO0011833	That's all I want to know right now.
0TO0011834	Who sells equipment around here?
0TO0011835	Know where I can find a doctor?
0TO0011836	Fine. Tell me what you know.
0TO0011837	[Attack] Then I may as well beat you to death for personal satisfaction.
0TO0011839	What can you tell me about Driver Nephi?
0TO0011840	What do you know about the Fiends?
0TO0011841	You're having trouble with the Fiends?
0TO0011843	Yes, it does.
0TO0011844	Might be. Give me their names.
0TO0011845	No. I don't think so.
0TO0011846	Violet.
0TO0011847	Driver Nephi.
0TO0011848	Cook-Cook.
0TO0011849	None of them.
0TO0011850	Where can I find her?
0TO0011851	Anything else I need to know?
0TO0011852	Where is Lt. Gorobets?
0TO0011853	Who is Little Buster?
0TO0011854	All right. I'll go after Violet.
0TO0011855	All right. I'll go after Driver Nephi.
0TO0011856	All right. I'll go after Cook-cook.
0TO0011857	No, I've had enough for now.
0TO0011859	Never mind. No more bounties, for now.
0TO0011860	No. I've had enough.
0TO0011861	Actually, I have another head here.
0TO0011862	Already done. Here's the head.
0TO0011864	Got anything to eat?
0TO0011866	Can anything be done to improve your supplies?
0TO0011867	What parts are needed to fix the food processor?
0TO0011868	Where might I find these parts?
0TO0011869	Where should I look for spices?
0TO0011870	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade with McCarran.
0TO0011871	Mrs. Nash agreed to trade snacks for vegetables and water.
0TO0011872	Blake at the Crimson Caravan agreed to sell meat and spices.
0TO0011873	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices for vegetables and water.
0TO0011874	The Crimson Caravan agreed to trade meat and spices at a generous discount.
0TO0011875	I found a merchant named Fitz who agreed to sell meat to McCarran.
0TO0011876	I fixed the food processor.
0TO0011877	This spore pod extract from Keely should help with morale.
0TO0011880	I'd like to buy some supplies.
0TO0011881	Son of a...  Sir, I didn't know anything about this.
0TO0011882	<Draw Weapon> And now I'm going to kill you, you lying son of a bitch.
0TO0011883	<Draw Weapon> Nothing now. I think I'll end your little investigation here.
0TO0011884	<Draw Weapon> Special delivery!
0TO0011885	McCarran's mess hall needs more variety.  Could we work out a deal?
0TO0011886	<Give 200 caps> Alright.  200 caps it is.
0TO0011887	<Give 100 caps> 200 seems a bit steep.  How about 100?
0TO0011888	McCarran has more vegetables and water than they know what to do with...
0TO0011889	Maybe we could work something out later.
0TO0011890	I can bring his body back, but it'll cost you.
0TO0011891	Changed his mind about what?
0TO0011893	You look upset.  What's wrong?
0TO0011894	I haven't found him yet.
0TO0011895	I brought his body to an NCR position. He's on his way back to McCarran.
0TO0011896	If your husband is dead, what does it matter if you get the corpse back?
0TO0011897	It seems strange the NCR wouldn't do their best to retrieve a fallen comrade.
0TO0011898	Sorry for your loss. I hope the Colonel reconsiders.
0TO0011900	Not my problem. Goodbye.
0TO0011901	Give me the directions again.
0TO0011902	I'll recover your husband's body.
0TO0011905	No one else will help you?
0TO0011906	Some other guy replaced Price, and he definitely didn't know the password.
0TO0011907	You said you have some legwork needing done?
0TO0011910	We can talk later. Right now we need to get out of here.
0TO0011911	No, I was just exploring the vault when I stumbled on this place.
0TO0011912	I was sent to fetch some research data. No one said anything about a rescue.
0TO0011913	Of course. I'd be glad to help.
0TO0011914	How much are you paying?
0TO0011915	No deal. You'll have to do it without me.
0TO0011916	Sure, how can I help?
0TO0011917	Just as long as I'm getting paid for this.
0TO0011918	The hell I am. The door to the entrance is locked!
0TO0011919	I told you. I'm not helping you.
0TO0011920	Sounds dangerous, but I'll do it.
0TO0011921	You're out of your mind.
0TO0011922	Any idea where these vents are that I'm looking for?
0TO0011924	Wait! Don't delete the files!
0TO0011925	I need those files. Dr. Hildern specifically sent me here to find them.
0TO0011926	If we destroy the files, all of these people will have died in vain.
0TO0011928	Deleting those files makes it more likely that this will happen again.
0TO0011929	Science isn't just about success. Failures are just as important to learn from.
0TO0011930	Exactly. Without that knowledge, something similar is bound to occur.
0TO0011931	Will it take long?
0TO0011932	Actually, I copied the files. Hildern sent me here to get them.
0TO0011933	I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
0TO0011934	Positive.
0TO0011935	On second thought, go ahead and erase the data.
0TO0011936	Good riddance. Those files have caused enough trouble.
0TO0011937	<Lie> No, I've been too busy rescuing you. Could someone else have done it?
0TO0011938	Never mind. Go ahead and delete the files.
0TO0011939	No, should they have?
0TO0011940	The scientists here must have made some useful discoveries.
0TO0011941	Yes, Angela Williams asked me to come find you.
0TO0011943	I just have a couple questions.
0TO0011945	I could use your help taking care of Motor-Runner.
0TO0011947	I think you should head back to McCarran to have that leg looked at.
0TO0011948	I think you should head back to base to have that leg looked at.
0TO0011949	<Lie> I think your leg's in good enough shape. You're all set.
0TO0011950	<Lie> I think you are healthy enough to take care of Motor-Runner yourself.
0TO0011951	Just making sure you're okay. I'll be back.
0TO0011952	That's all for now, soldier.
0TO0011953	Not right now, just making sure you are ok. I'll be back later.
0TO0011954	That's it for now soldier.
0TO0011955	What can you tell me about the Fiends?
0TO0011957	What can you tell me about Vault 3?
0TO0011959	What was your mission again?
0TO0011963	Come on. It's time for us to go take care of Motor-Runner.
0TO0011964	Follow me, let's go take care of Motor-Runner.
0TO0011967	I can handle myself pretty well. I found you didn't I?
0TO0011968	Trust me. I can be quiet.
0TO0011970	I can handle myself just fine. I found you, didn't I?
0TO0011971	Trust me, I'm tougher than I look!
0TO0011972	Alright, I don't want to cause you any trouble.
0TO0011973	All right, fine. I don't want to cause you any trouble.
0TO0011974	I have another couple of questions for you.
0TO0011976	Ok, 200 is a deal.
0TO0011977	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 20 caps each.
0TO0011978	I'll sell you all of my Jet for 22 caps each.
0TO0011979	I'll sell you all my Psycho for 20 caps each.
0TO0011980	I'll sell you all of my Psycho for 22 caps each.
0TO0011981	I'll sell you all my Buffout for 20 caps each.
0TO0011982	I'll sell you all of my Buffout for 22 caps each.
0TO0011983	That is all I can spare.
0TO0011984	Nothing left to sell, time for me to leave.
0TO0011985	Nevermind, I'll just show myself out.
0TO0011986	I'll pay you, I'm sure I can make up the difference from NCR.
0TO0011987	You should pay me, I'm providing you the service.
0TO0011988	How about you give me 75 caps, it'll keep the hit squads away for a bit.
0TO0011989	I was thinking closer to 150.
0TO0011990	The NCR is leaving you alone, 150 seems like a small price to pay.
0TO0011991	Actually, I can just bring them your head for free.
0TO0011993	Yeah, I'll see what I can do.
0TO0011994	I need to know a little more about Vault 3.
0TO0011995	Can you tell me about the Fiends?
0TO0011996	Sorry, I don't have time to help you out.
0TO0011997	Colonel Hsu wanted me to help you look into the recent intelligence leaks.
0TO0011998	I know who you are. I'm working for the Legion, too.
0TO0011999	Hsu bought it. You should be in the clear.
0TO0012001	I have clearance for catching spies.
0TO0012002	You don't seem like you're supposed to be here, either.
0TO0012003	Is there a bathroom in here?
0TO0012004	It's done. The evidence is in Crenshaw's locker and Crenshaw is dead.
0TO0012005	I have a lead. There's been someone sneaking into the control tower at night.
0TO0012006	How many years have you been on this assignment?
0TO0012007	What next part?
0TO0012008	And you have something in mind for me?
0TO0012010	The scapegoat isn't me, is it?
0TO0012011	Understood. I'll go and pick up the explosives.
0TO0012012	Could you go over that again?
0TO0012013	If you're going to blow it up, what do you need my help for?
0TO0012014	I'm not interested in helping you. You're on your own.
0TO0012015	You're right. I'll help.
0TO0012016	I'm positive.
0TO0012017	I heard someone's been breaking in here at night. Looks like it's you.
0TO0012018	I don't. I was just trying to get myself out of trouble.
0TO0012019	Hsu is dead.
0TO0012021	Who should I be talking to about the intelligence leaks again?
0TO0012034	I'd rather not have any trouble. Here's 50 caps, just keep yourself off the streets.
0TO0012035	I'm asking nicely. I only do that *once.*
0TO0012036	I'm asking nicely. Maybe you should go before I get angry at you.
0TO0012037	<Attack> Easy, I'm just going to kill you.
0TO0012038	Crandon says you're not allowed to stay here. You'll have to go somewhere else.
0TO0012040	Where can I find a doctor around here?
0TO0012041	Is there any place to buy weapons and armor?
0TO0012043	Are there many water merchants around here?
0TO0012044	I work independently.
0TO0012045	How many agents of the Legion *are* there here?
0TO0012047	Uh huh. Bring fire stick.
0TO0012048	Go over that one more time.
0TO0012049	Wha?
0TO0012050	[Speech] You must miss giving orders, now that all your men are dead.
0TO0012051	[Speech] Sounds to me like you were too gutless to follow Caesar's orders.
0TO0012052	[Speech] Yes. I want to *know* how such a big talker got caught so easily.
0TO0012053	You're a danger to him alive. Your knowledge threatens him.
0TO0012054	Caesar's laws are absolute. He does not grant exceptions.
0TO0012055	So in addition to treason, you're also a deserter.
0TO0012056	[Speech] You must've really screwed up to be caught by the NCR.
0TO0012057	You sure talk tough for someone who's afraid to die.
0TO0012058	But I want to know how a coward can attain the rank of centurion.
0TO0012059	I'll be right back.
0TO0012060	You shouldn't have done that. I'm the only friend you have right now.
0TO0012061	Did you honestly believe you could escape death?
0TO0012062	Oh, but I do, Silus. Unlike you, I follow Caesar's orders.
0TO0012063	[Attack] Then you won't mind if I keep going.
0TO0012064	[Attack] Lucky you. You can borrow my dentures when I knock all your teeth out.
0TO0012065	If his empire falls, it'll probably be because his centurions are so gullible.
0TO0012066	Your loyalty is commendable, but I don't work for Caesar's Legion.
0TO0012067	I'll be the judge of that. Let's hear what you've got to say.
0TO0012068	[Attack] If you've got any last words, you'd better say them now, Legion scum.
0TO0012069	You've been tricked, Silus. I'm working with the NCR. I just got you to talk.
0TO0012070	And if you can't go through with it, you look even weaker.
0TO0012071	So you were unafraid to cut any throat but your own.
0TO0012072	See? Don't you feel better now that you've divulged all those state secrets?
0TO0012073	I think I've heard all I need to. You've been very helpful.
0TO0012074	Who's the operative?
0TO0012075	I don't believe you. You're lying.
0TO0012076	Maybe I'll beat some more useful information out of you.
0TO0012077	There must be more you can tell me.
0TO0012078	Yes, I have it here.
0TO0012080	Have you seen a guy named Price around?
0TO0012081	Brahmin tipping is a cherished pastime.
0TO0012082	I'm looking for some betting advice.
0TO0012083	Uh... do you like... gambling?
0TO0012084	Um, well...  Nevermind.
0TO0012085	Close enough.  Yeah, Contreras told me to give Price this package.
0TO0012086	<Draw Weapon> We agreed you should die.
0TO0012087	He said he would help you.
0TO0012088	I had no idea that package had chems! Contreras gave it to me!
0TO0012089	<Draw Weapon> You'll never take me alive, pig!
0TO0012091	<Draw Weapon> You won't be telling anyone about this.
0TO0012092	Hey, I'm just the messenger. I didn't know anything about this.
0TO0012093	C'mon guy.  You're no merchant.  You've got Ranger all over you.
0TO0012094	[INT/PER] Hey, that wasn't the right response for the password!
0TO0012095	The way you stand, your weapon, even your armor is fitted in a military fashion.
0TO0012097	I'm sure Contreras could work with you.
0TO0012098	<Give 250 caps> I'm sure Contreras would be willing to work with you...
0TO0012099	Just some supplies for McCarran from the Crimson Caravan.
0TO0012100	<cover package> Oh this?  Nothing important.
0TO0012101	What's going to happen to him?
0TO0012102	Ok. I'll just be on my way then.
0TO0012103	<Draw Weapon> Well, I can't just let him be killed. Word of this stops here.
0TO0012104	I was just told he was a local merchant and to find him to buy some supplies.
0TO0012105	<Give 250 caps> Okay, make that 500 caps. I'm sure Contreras can skim for you.
0TO0012106	<Draw Weapon> I think I'll just take my caps back from your corpse.
0TO0012107	Here.  Take this package Contreras gave me.  I don't want any trouble.
0TO0012108	Well, I was given this package to deliver to him.
0TO0012109	Nothing. I was just told he was a local merchant I should check out.
0TO0012110	Oh, just delivering packages.  No clue whats in em, but its really important.
0TO0012111	Price is being held by the NCR.  A Ranger replaced him.
0TO0012112	I didn't really have a choice.
0TO0012113	We don't have to kill him.  You could work with him and make caps.
0TO0012114	Kill him?  Can't we just cut a deal or something?
0TO0012115	<Hand Contreras the package> Nah, but he is definitely looking for you.
0TO0012116	Killing a Ranger brings big risks.  Killing gets expensive.
0TO0012117	Hey man, you never said anything about killing.  Cough up some caps.
0TO0012118	Don't worry.  He won't be telling anyone anything ever again.
0TO0012119	All right, what's the job?
0TO0012120	Sounds simple enough. I'll get right on it.
0TO0012121	Don't worry.  I paid him off.  He won't be a problem.
0TO0012122	Got anything for sale?
0TO0012123	He's looking to break up trafficking.  Maybe there is money to be made here...
0TO0012124	No problem.  Consider it done.
0TO0012125	Isaac said they'll have the extra guns and ammo in the next shipment.
0TO0012126	I took care of the Ranger.
0TO0012128	That's it? A few caps and another errand?
0TO0012129	Can you tell me anything else about Keely?
0TO0012130	I hear the food around here is pretty bad.
0TO0012131	What do you think of Dr. Hildern?
0TO0012132	Hildern mentioned the Followers of the Apocalypse...
0TO0012133	What's your role here?
0TO0012135	Exactly how old is Keely?
0TO0012136	That's not much of an endorsement. What do you *really* think?
0TO0012137	He seemed focused on results. Maybe not so much on people.
0TO0012138	So Dr. Hildern takes credit for your work?
0TO0012139	Keely's dead. But I found her research notes.
0TO0012140	How do Keely and Hildern get along?
0TO0012141	Keely's dead.
0TO0012142	<Lie> Keely is safe. She's just finishing up some research in the vault.
0TO0012144	<Lie> Yes, Keely's fine. We escaped the Vault together.
0TO0012145	Actually, I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
0TO0012146	You mentioned Vault 22. I might be willing to help.
0TO0012147	I have a few questions.
0TO0012148	I have an invoice for you from Alice McLafferty.
0TO0012149	Then you don't want this invoice from Alice McLafferty?
0TO0012152	No need to get worked up. I'll leave.
0TO0012153	Isn't this Vault 3, home of the Fiends?
0TO0012154	Let's see how tough you are.
0TO0012156	Your boss, um... He summoned me here.
0TO0012157	I'm carrying Jet, Psycho, and other favors. And I don't deliver to the help.
0TO0012158	Where's your boss? He'll want to know you were hitting me up for freebies.
0TO0012159	I'm not a Khan. I'm just dressed like one.
0TO0012160	I have some chems that I can sell.
0TO0012161	I'm here to do some business with chems.
0TO0012162	You want to buy some chems from my personal stash?
0TO0012163	I'm just here looking around.
0TO0012164	Can you tell me what happened to the residents here?
0TO0012165	I'll be leaving now.
0TO0012166	The NCR sent me here to take care of you.
0TO0012167	I was actually just leaving.
0TO0012168	Appearances can be deceiving. Shall we?
0TO0012169	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 20 caps.
0TO0012170	I'll sell you a can of Jet for 22 caps.
0TO0012171	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 20 caps.
0TO0012172	I'll sell you a pack of Buffout for 22 caps.
0TO0012173	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 20 caps.
0TO0012174	I'll sell you a vial of Psycho for 22 caps.
0TO0012175	I'll give you exclusive rights to my personal stash, for a slight markup.
0TO0012176	I don't suppose you can pay a little better?
0TO0012178	I was thinking we could make an arrangement.
0TO0012179	I could just tell them you are dead. For a price.
0TO0012180	I can deliver them your cold, dead skull.
0TO0012181	Tell me more about your role here.
0TO0012182	I'm a friend, trust me.
0TO0012183	I respect your independence, and I'm good at taking care of troubles.
0TO0012185	Doesn't the NCR keep order around here?
0TO0012186	You need somebody with real firepower, and mine's yours for a small fee.
0TO0012187	I'm not interested in this, right now.
0TO0012188	If you've got the caps, I'll back any claim you want.
0TO0012189	I've got the skills, the will and the firepower. All I expect is a decent reward for my work.
0TO0012191	Are you a scientist?
0TO0012193	Need help with anything?
0TO0012194	Mercenaries? What for?
0TO0012196	Yes. He asked me to get some data from Vault 22.
0TO0012197	Why so interested?
0TO0012199	No. Hildern didn't mention anyone else.
0TO0012200	All right. I'll look for her.
0TO0012201	Maybe Hildern and I need to have another talk.
0TO0012202	It never came up. Doesn't bother me.
0TO0012203	I'll try, but no promises.
0TO0012204	Not my problem. Keely is on her own.
0TO0012210	What else can you tell me about Anders?
0TO0012211	Tell me about the break-ins.
0TO0012212	Who's missing?
0TO0012213	You said there have been thefts?
0TO0012215	I'll keep an eye out for your missing supplies.
0TO0012216	Why don't you just beat your prisoner senseless?
0TO0012217	What about a truth drug?
0TO0012218	Have you tried calling him hurtful names?
0TO0012219	Okay. Let's get started.
0TO0012220	I'm not interested in doing that right now.
0TO0012221	I'll see what I can find out about Cpl. White for you.
0TO0012222	I'm a friend of the Legion. I'm here to help.
0TO0012223	<Lie> I'm with the Legion. I'm here to kill you before you talk.
0TO0012224	[Speech] I think you're confused. I'm with the excrement right now.
0TO0012225	[Speech] You... *smell* like excrement. So there.
0TO0012226	[Speech] You stinky!
0TO0012227	You're about to tell me everything you know, Silus.
0TO0012228	[Attack] Uh oh. Now you've made me angry.
0TO0012229	What officer?
0TO0012230	Here are the medical supplies from Blake.
0TO0012231	I'm ready for the next task.
0TO0012232	Right...  Well, I'll keep that in mind.
0TO0012236	What do you think of NCR's chances against the Legion?
0TO0012237	Keely wiped the data. It's gone.
0TO0012238	Yes. Tell me about it.
0TO0012239	I just have some questions.
0TO0012240	No. "Civilized" people stack the deck in their own favor, don't they?
0TO0012242	Why terminate her contract?
0TO0012243	You didn't always work for the OSI?
0TO0012244	So who *did* train you?
0TO0012245	And what do the Followers believe?
0TO0012246	Doesn't sound like a good place for a person of ambition.
0TO0012247	So... you wanted something more?
0TO0012248	You're researching all these problems yourself?
0TO0012249	The Vault 22 data is gone. Destroyed.
0TO0012250	The plants in that vault were dangerous. We destroyed the data.
0TO0012251	Believe whatever you want. It's the truth.
0TO0012254	All right. I'll investigate Vault 22.
0TO0012255	Make it fast. I want my caps.
0TO0012256	Damn right. No thanks to you.
0TO0012257	By the way, that Vault was just as dangerous as Williams thought.
0TO0012258	What's your opinion of Williams?
0TO0012260	Tell me what an NCR ranger is doing here.
0TO0012261	<Lie>I'm an independent contractor with the NCR.
0TO0012262	I'm just curious.
0TO0012263	I didn't come here to do your job for you.
0TO0012264	Why is this water so special?
0TO0012265	I've got the whiskey.
0TO0012269	Have you noticed anything suspicious lately?
0TO0012270	What kind of supplies did you have in mind?
0TO0012272	[50 caps] Maybe some caps will clarify things.
0TO0012273	I can be pretty resourceful.  Perhaps we could work out a deal?
0TO0012274	Come on, man.  Hook me up.
0TO0012275	I've got connections.  Maybe we could make an arrangement?
0TO0012276	I've got caps.  Name your price.
0TO0012279	I'm not the first person you've sent to Vault 22... am I?
0TO0012281	I'm the one asking the questions, Dr. Hildern.
0TO0012282	<Lie> No, Williams didn't tell me anything.
0TO0012283	Yes, I have. What difference does it make?
0TO0012284	You're doing all these things yourself?
0TO0012285	NCR has a food shortage?
0TO0012286	Do you control the Dam from here?
0TO0012287	Fantastic..
0TO0012288	No, that was me. I fixed HELIOS One.
0TO0012289	How many others have you sent to the Vault?
0TO0012290	I prefer to know what I'm getting myself into.
0TO0012291	Maybe I should cancel our deal.
0TO0012292	I want double the caps. Or I spread the word that you're full of shit.
0TO0012294	It doesn't trouble you that you sent eight or ten people to their deaths?
0TO0012295	Then you broke our agreement. I want double the caps.
0TO0012296	Let me take another look at that leg.
0TO0012298	Never mind, I'm leaving now.
0TO0012299	What am I doing here? What are you doing here?
0TO0012300	What can you tell me about what happened here?
0TO0012302	Who are the Fiends?
0TO0012303	The Colonel was concerned. You missed your check-in.
0TO0012304	Colonel Hsu thinks you need additional support.
0TO0012305	I'm sure you can handle it alone. I'll leave you to it.
0TO0012306	I want to help you rescue the hostages.
0TO0012308	The only way you're going to take out Motor-Runner is if we work together.
0TO0012310	Let's you and me take out Motor-Runner together!
0TO0012311	Let me take out Motor-Runner for you.
0TO0012312	I'll leave you to it then.
0TO0012313	What's the hold-up - if you don't mind my asking?
0TO0012315	I'm afraid your leg looks - and smells - like it's on the verge of infection.
0TO0012316	A day or two of resting up isn't going to heal that leg.
0TO0012317	If you head for McCarran now, I think you'll make it in time - even at a limp.
0TO0012318	I have a doctor's bag right here. It should be enough to get you on your feet.
0TO0012319	You need a doctor's bag. I'll find one and come back.
0TO0012320	I'll check in with you and Colonel Hsu when it's done.
0TO0012321	I don't have a spare doctor's bag I can spare.
0TO0012322	[Attack] I did. Right before I assassinated the colonel.
0TO0012323	It was Curtis. He's in the Legion. I can prove he tried to blow up the monorail.
0TO0012324	I caught Curtis radioing intel to Caesar's Legion. I had to take him down.
0TO0012325	The monorail is destroyed.
0TO0012331	Bye bye.
0TO0012333	Where do you get your water?
0TO0012334	Punk?  Thats my line.
0TO0012335	Are you deserters?
0TO0012336	I guess I can understand that.
0TO0012337	<Attack> Well then. It sounds like there might be a bounty on your heads.
0TO0012338	So that's it? You've resorted to robbing and raiding to solve your problems?
0TO0012339	<Attack> Well, I think your luck just ran out.
0TO0012340	Why not just turn yourselves in?
0TO0012341	You're right.  You're totally screwed.
0TO0012343	Your turf? I guess the news hasn't reached you yet, Primm has law again.
0TO0012344	I can help if you'll let me!
0TO0012345	<Attack> Well, in that case, maybe I'll do the town a favor and take you down.
0TO0012346	<Lie> Yes, that's right.
0TO0012347	No, this is the first I've heard about Vault 22.
0TO0012349	I'd be careful with that data. You didn't see those plants in the Vault.
0TO0012351	Depends. How much are you paying?
0TO0012352	This all sounds a little hard to believe.
0TO0012353	This doesn't sound like my kind of job.
0TO0012354	I'll think about it, and maybe I'll be back.
0TO0012355	Forget it. I don't have time for this.
0TO0012357	Save the sales pitch. Just tell me what you want me to do.
0TO0012358	Yes, I'd say so.
0TO0012359	Nothing is impossible.
0TO0012360	Get to the point.
0TO0012364	Tell me more about the OSI.
0TO0012366	Actually, I had some other questions.
0TO0012368	Tell me more.
0TO0012369	Scientific discovery is never so simple as that.
0TO0012371	Well... consider it a down payment on future service.
0TO0012372	I've brought the data from Vault 22.
0TO0012373	Never mind. I'll be back later.
0TO0012374	No problem. I can wait.
0TO0012375	By the way... you never warned me about the dangers in that place.
0TO0012376	Fine. Just give me my reward.
0TO0012378	I agree, I've more than done my part. You owe me more caps.
0TO0012379	All right. Then I'll sell this data to some other interested party...
0TO0012380	What contract? You cut an under-the-table deal with me.
0TO0012381	...and make sure you have some healthy competition.
0TO0012382	You said you were the Director of OSI?
0TO0012383	Then it wouldn't matter if I mentioned our deal to the colonel?
0TO0012385	I'm here to provide support. Is there anything I might be able to help with?
0TO0012386	I'm up for hire if you need some extra manpower around the base.
0TO0012387	How are things going for the NCR around here?
0TO0012388	The Fiends?
0TO0012389	I bet I could make the Legion prisoner talk.
0TO0012390	I could look into who's leaking NCR intelligence.
0TO0012392	I know who bombed the monorail.
0TO0012393	You won't be having problems with intelligence leaks anymore.
0TO0012394	How much do you know about what happened with the NCR at Bitter Springs?
0TO0012395	You seem calm given that things are as bad as they are.
0TO0012396	[Speech] I've been fighting for the wrong side. Let me prove myself to you.
0TO0012397	Private Crenshaw. He's dead now.
0TO0012398	He had explosives and plans for the operation bearing Caesar's emblem.
0TO0012400	[Speech] He confessed it to me before he died. He used the word "frumentarius."
0TO0012401	[Speech] He confessed it to me. Right before he died.
0TO0012402	You'd be surprised what some people are capable of.
0TO0012403	I'll be right back - there's something I need to double-check.
0TO0012404	I'll go to Vault 3 and see if I can find your ranger.
0TO0012407	Will you sign this formal letter asking the NCR to take control of Primm?
0TO0012408	How do you know these things?
0TO0012414	Sorry, I was just leaving.
0TO0012415	NCR doesn't have the caps to outfit their troops?
0TO0012417	Are you with the NCR?
0TO0012421	Something like that. Are you an NCR soldier?
0TO0012422	You do a lot of business with prospectors?
0TO0012423	Just show me what you have for sale.
0TO0012424	Administrative discharge? What does that mean?
0TO0012425	What was your rank?
0TO0012426	How did you end up selling weapons?
0TO0012427	You say Marcus smashed the radio. Not very well, apparently?
0TO0012428	Okay, I can make that work.
0TO0012429	That's your plan? I *am* an intruder in the village!
0TO0012430	Not yet. Wait here.
0TO0012441	They had it coming if they drew on you.
0TO0012442	So thats it?  You've resorted to raiding and crime?
0TO0012443	Perhaps I could convince them to take you back.
0TO0012446	You're right.  You guys are totally screwed.
0TO0012447	Well you made the right one.
0TO0012449	What sort of trouble should I expect if I head up?
0TO0012450	Remind me what I should expect if I head up?
0TO0012452	Sounds like you've had enough of Tabitha. What if you had some help?
0TO0012453	Hey! Let's you and me - you know, us! - let's overthrow Tabitha together!
0TO0012454	How did Tabitha end up in control?
0TO0012455	What is Jacobstown?
0TO0012456	You say that super mutants were *made*?
0TO0012457	Tell me about the Nightkin.
0TO0012458	Why are you here, instead of Jacobstown?
0TO0012459	You seem friendly, for a mutant.
0TO0012460	Moving on...
0TO0012461	Sorry about that. No offense intended.
0TO0012462	Spare me the "poor mutants" rap, all right?
0TO0012463	Why are some Super Mutants smarter than others?
0TO0012467	Sorry, I don't think I'll be heading her way.
0TO0012469	Sure, follow me.
0TO0012472	[Dumb] Uh... what?
0TO0012474	Aren't you the super mutant from the radio? I'm a huge fan.
0TO0012478	We no follow you no more! We follow Neil! He no call us dumb-dumbs!
0TO0012479	We no dumb-dumbs! You the stupid, not us! We's taking over!
0TO0012481	Hi. We "dumb-dumbs" is rebelling! You no lead us no more!
0TO0012491	Hey, just checking the place out. Now I'll just be on my way...
0TO0012492	Okay. Here.
0TO0012494	But I don't even have that much.
0TO0012495	<Pay 50 caps> Okay, here.
0TO0012496	No raider would be foolish enough to go parading around in that.
0TO0012497	By extorting money from the locals?  What happened here?
0TO0012498	It looks like these people got more than just hurt.
0TO0012499	There is always a choice.
0TO0012505	Tell me about Gun Runner caravans.
0TO0012508	Why don't you deal in energy weapons?
0TO0012510	I made sure those prisoners won't bother Primm anymore.
0TO0012511	I restored rule of law to Primm.
0TO0012512	I've cleared all the trouble west of here. Caravans can start using I-15 again.
0TO0012514	Got nothing to spare.
0TO0012515	Can't help you.
0TO0012518	Sure. Here's 25 caps.
0TO0012520	Do your thinking about "Everywhere."
0TO0012522	On second thought... maybe another time.
0TO0012524	Do your thinking about me.
0TO0012526	Do your thinking about "Here."
0TO0012527	Why'd you settle in this dump?
0TO0012528	What do you know about Legion raids?
0TO0012531	Primm's safe now. I took care of those prisoners.
0TO0012532	Why's this place called the 188?
0TO0012534	Is it safe here?
0TO0012536	Why's business so good here?
0TO0012538	Why'd you leave Primm?
0TO0012542	I took care of those prisoners myself. Primm is clear now.
0TO0012562	I'd like a tour of the museum.
0TO0012563	I'd like another tour.
0TO0012565	REPCONN's history.
0TO0012566	Research and development.
0TO0012567	Tell me about RobCo.
0TO0012568	That's enough about REPCONN.
0TO0012575	Thanks for the warning, but I can take care of myself.
0TO0012585	Let me pass! I'll make it worth your while.
0TO0012588	If my face is recognized a second time then I must belong here.
0TO0012589	I just spoke with that other robot over there.
0TO0012591	ICE CREAM!
0TO0012593	Ice Cream
0TO0012595	Sorry, no idea.
0TO0012597	You appear to have a faulty subroutine. Run diagnostics.
0TO0012598	[Repair/Speech] I'm here to fix the broken wall.
0TO0012602	Let's do it.
0TO0012614	Why did you leave the army?
0TO0012618	I am not supposed to go upstairs, let me pass and I won't.
0TO0012619	I've worked here for years. I forgot my badge at home.
0TO0012625	<Attack> I guess I'll serve as their justice then.
0TO0012626	Well, they do have a few more troops than the four of you...
0TO0012627	It would be safer to run and find someplace to hide.
0TO0012628	It doesn't sound like things have gone to plan.
0TO0012629	<Attack> Murdering deserters. Well, I think I've heard enough.
0TO0012630	I imagine the NCR doesn't deal with deserters kindly.
0TO0012632	Can you repair some of my stuff?
0TO0012638	You'll do fine. Farewell, mi amigo.
0TO0012640	Actually, do you want to tag along with me?
0TO0012643	It's okay by me. Enjoy your freedom.
0TO0012651	I'd like to purchase something.
0TO0012662	Beagle, take a weapon.
0TO0012664	The attack on the prison was a success.
0TO0012668	Do all of the brothers use this equipment?
0TO0012669	And you are?
0TO0012671	Classified or not, I want to help make the attack.
0TO0012673	Tell them to call off the attack on the prison, or they'll get wiped out.
0TO0012675	I want to help your troops take the prison back. Believe me.
0TO0012676	But I could help the troops attack the prison, you know?
0TO0012678	One more question Beagle.
0TO0012680	I didn't cut you loose so you could run away. Stick with me!
0TO0012682	Like I cut you loose just so you could run away? Like I don't want your help?
0TO0012683	If you try to run away instead of fighting at my side, I'll kill you myself.
0TO0012685	Sure, run away. You don't look like you'd be much help.
0TO0012688	Keep moving!
0TO0012689	[You ask McNamara about himself.]
0TO0012695	I sent power to McCarran and the Strip.
0TO0012696	I diverted power to the grid.
0TO0012697	Me send shiny juice from plant.
0TO0012698	I overloaded the plant. No one will be able to use it to power a weapon.
0TO0012699	Me make shiny tower boom.
0TO0012703	I'm here looking for work.
0TO0012706	I don't have 100 caps on me.
0TO0012707	Here's your 100 caps.
0TO0012710	It was a calculated risk. Asking questions would have tipped him off.
0TO0012711	I'm pretty sure I made things better. I mean, I killed him.
0TO0012714	Meyers wants to be sheriff.
0TO0012716	What's at Vikki and Vance?
0TO0012717	Meyers wants to sheriff Primm, and wants you to leave the town alone.
0TO0012722	<Lie>I heard my brother was stationed here. I want to know he's okay.
0TO0012723	I'd like to go into the power plant.
0TO0012724	Why are you here, and not on the front lines? Isn't that more important?
0TO0012725	I was hungry and was hoping this was some kind of food factory.
0TO0012726	Need food fill belly. You got food?
0TO0012727	You're right, I don't have a reason.
0TO0012728	I saw this place in the distance and wanted to investigate.
0TO0012729	Shouldn't there be more people than this defending a power plant?
0TO0012730	This is public property and I can do as I please here.
0TO0012731	[Science] I notice your solar tower isn't collecting much sunlight. I can help.
0TO0012733	[Attack] I'm taking over.
0TO0012735	[NCR Rep] I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
0TO0012736	<lie> I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
0TO0012737	I'm with the NCR. Anything I can do to help?
0TO0012738	You think ARCHIMEDES is a weapon they built here.
0TO0012740	More of a drifter.
0TO0012741	Me pet aminals.
0TO0012742	That's for me to know.
0TO0012743	You no ask.
0TO0012744	My interest in this place is scientific.
0TO0012745	I is scientistic.
0TO0012746	I just do what's necessary to keep the peace.
0TO0012747	I no hurt nobody.
0TO0012748	The NCR doesn't know about the weapon?
0TO0012749	Shoulders know plant make boom?
0TO0012750	The NCR asked me to help increase the plant's power output.
0TO0012751	Me help shoulders make shinies warm.
0TO0012752	They're looking for help getting this plant running.
0TO0012753	Me fix shiny plant.
0TO0012754	That's not your concern.
0TO0012756	Peace.
0TO0012757	Pizza.
0TO0012758	I'm a soldier.
0TO0012759	Me shoulder.
0TO0012760	Not really. I just kind of stumbled in.
0TO0012761	Nuh uh.
0TO0012762	I try not to get involved.
0TO0012764	I want what you want.
0TO0012765	I just like you is.
0TO0012766	War.
0TO0012767	Warm.
0TO0012768	What more is there to this place than a power plant?
0TO0012769	This place not just shiny juice maker?
0TO0012770	Where should I route the power?
0TO0012771	Where me send shiny juice?
0TO0012774	Why would you trust me with this?
0TO0012775	You help me?
0TO0012776	I'm in the Brotherhood of Steel.
0TO0012777	I in Brotherwood of Seal.
0TO0012778	I serve Caesar.
0TO0012779	[CL Rep] I with Seizure's Luncheon.
0TO0012780	I'm with the NCR.
0TO0012781	[NCR Rep] I with bear shoulders.
0TO0012782	My only true allegiance is to myself.
0TO0012783	I with me.
0TO0012784	This is your turf. For all I know you could have me killed for my allegiance. Who are you with?
0TO0012785	Maybe you tell me who you with so we be friends.
0TO0012786	Uh... you first.
0TO0012787	May I have permission to trade with your armory?
0TO0012788	Sammy! Give up your plan, it'll fail!
0TO0012790	That's the greatest plan I've ever heard in my entire life.
0TO0012791	Your plan has critical flaws.
0TO0012793	I convinced Pauline that you shouldn't go through with this.
0TO0012794	Pauline says you should give me the gun.
0TO0012797	That's nice. Are you going to let me in or what?
0TO0012798	Try it, I dare you. Better hope you don't miss, though.
0TO0012799	I don't think I'd like that very much.
0TO0012800	I know you have the gun, Sammy.
0TO0012801	I know the two of you stole Vance's gun down in Primm.
0TO0012802	What is your plan?
0TO0012805	Tell me about the Bison Steve.
0TO0012806	What about the Bison Steve hotel, across the street?
0TO0012807	Tell me about Primm
0TO0012809	Did you know that Vance's gun is missing?
0TO0012811	No, the gun is missing.
0TO0012812	The display case is empty. The gun's missing.
0TO0012813	The gun is still missing.
0TO0012814	What happened to Vance's Gun?
0TO0012815	Scan your data registry. You've been hacked.
0TO0012816	Maybe you've been hacked or something?
0TO0012817	Ok then, let's talk about something else.
0TO0012820	Tell me about the Vikki and Vance
0TO0012821	Who were Vikki and Vance?
0TO0012822	Why haven't you killed the ranger already?
0TO0012823	Not interested. I don't do murder-for-hire.
0TO0012825	No, I won't comply.
0TO0012828	Okay, I'll comply.
0TO0012830	It doesn't matter.
0TO0012832	You must be Deputy Beagle.
0TO0012834	How'd you end up being a hostage?
0TO0012836	I'll set you free now.
0TO0012838	Stay put for now.
0TO0012839	Stay put.
0TO0012841	What are the qualifications for a Sheriff?
0TO0012843	I don't have time to help Primm.
0TO0012845	I'll help bring law and order back to Primm.
0TO0012847	[Lie]You're in trouble - the NCR is sending a battalion to take this place back.
0TO0012848	So, do I get a real job now or what?
0TO0012849	What kind of job?
0TO0012851	Tell me about Scrambler.
0TO0012854	[Attack] You won't need to worry about bills where you're going.
0TO0012855	That's right. I'm here for your job.
0TO0012856	Me take your job cause me smarter.
0TO0012857	How did you get this job?
0TO0012858	I am now.
0TO0012859	What job do you have here?
0TO0012860	So you have no idea what you're doing.
0TO0012862	You pay me a stack of caps right now and I'll forget you have my job.
0TO0012863	How would someone retarget the mirrors?
0TO0012864	How I move shinies?
0TO0012865	Settle down. I'm not here to replace anyone.
0TO0012866	Actually I'm not here to replace you.
0TO0012868	Why should the power go to the Strip and McCarran?
0TO0012869	What are you trying to accomplish?
0TO0012870	What exactly do you do?
0TO0012871	Why are you worried about being replaced?
0TO0012872	I just wanted to get close to you to kill you.
0TO0012874	How do I make myself useful?
0TO0012875	Wait! I'm not a Ranger!
0TO0012876	I'm making myself useful around here. Need anything done?
0TO0012880	Sorry.
0TO0012883	What do you protect your town from?
0TO0012884	So you were in some gang? Were they tough?
0TO0012885	So you were in a gang? Were they tough?
0TO0012887	What's the deal with all the rockets down here?
0TO0012890	What "folks" were you escorting to work?
0TO0012894	What's the Bison Steve?
0TO0012897	That's everything, right? Let the "Great Journey" begin.
0TO0012898	The rockets are set to go, right?
0TO0012900	What do you cook?
0TO0012908	Did you make the training VR yourself?
0TO0012910	Well, it's none of my business.
0TO0012912	You've been using Chris. It's despicable.
0TO0012928	Where are you located?
0TO0012929	Tell me again how to find you.
0TO0012935	That'd be murder, Chris. And you're no murderer.
0TO0012936	It's not a matter of smarts. You'd never forgive yourself.
0TO0012937	They'd take you if they could, Chris, but you'd die.
0TO0012938	They're going to revere you as a Saint, Chris!
0TO0012939	That's not true, Chris. You're all right.
0TO0012940	There's a little town called Novac down the road.
0TO0012942	Come to think of it, sabotage is a great idea.
0TO0012944	I've got some Sugar Bombs.
0TO0012948	I still have questions.
0TO0012950	So the "Great Journey" will use those rockets?
0TO0012953	Why don't they let you work down on the launch pad?
0TO0012954	The radiation down there would kill you, Chris. Because you're human.
0TO0012955	You left your Vault because you were going bald?
0TO0012956	Honey, you're no monster. You're cute! Why, I could just about eat you up!
0TO0012957	Jason told me himself. The Great Journey is for ghouls only. You're not going.
0TO0012958	You wouldn't trust a ghoul, would you?
0TO0012963	Oh, I'm not a spy.
0TO0012967	You're pathetic. No wonder they're leaving you behind.
0TO0012970	I'm already helping Chris with the rockets.
0TO0012972	I killed the  ghouls at REPCONN.
0TO0012973	I got the ghouls to leave the area. They won't be bothering you anymore.
0TO0012975	Jason sent me down here to get rid of the "demons."
0TO0012976	I'm looking for a stash of StealthBoys in this room.
0TO0012977	Can I come up there and look? Maybe you missed the Stealth Boys.
0TO0012978	I'm exploring, that's all. What about you?
0TO0012982	I have some Stealth Boys. I could give them to you.
0TO0012984	Who is "Antler"?
0TO0012985	Is "Antler" the Brahmin skull over there?
0TO0012986	You're taking orders from a hunk of bone!
0TO0012994	I'll track down the igniting agent.
0TO0012995	I'll try to find the parts you need.
0TO0012996	I'll track down the thrust control modules.
0TO0012998	What else do you need?
0TO0013001	How can I help?
0TO0013004	Actually, I'd like to help with something else.
0TO0013007	Can you give me any tips for my current task?
0TO0013011	I'll stick with my current task.
0TO0013012	I just wanted to meet you.
0TO0013013	What do you think of the people who live here?
0TO0013014	She had it coming.
0TO0013015	Jeannie May sent me.
0TO0013016	Just because.
0TO0013017	I killed Jeannie May. Do I still get my discount?
0TO0013018	She missed my wake-up call.
0TO0013019	That's my business.
0TO0013020	Personal favor.
0TO0013021	Seemed like a good idea at the time.
0TO0013040	I need to be going...
0TO0013041	I need to go, but I'll come right back.
0TO0013393	On second thought, stick with me for a little longer.
0TO0013395	Actually I changed my mind. Let's stick together.
0TO0013396	On second thought, you've been pretty useful so far. Forget what I said.
0TO0013397	<Companion Protocol::Continue Companion Protocol>
0TO0013398	Yes, I'm sure.
0TO0013399	Yeah, that's what I think. You should head back home.
0TO0013400	I think it's for the best.
0TO0013401	I just think we should right now.
0TO0013402	<Companion Protocol::End Companion Protocol>
0TO0013403	I'll miss you too, Lily, but it's time.
0TO0013420	You can release the prisoners. I promise they're no threat.
0TO0013421	Are you all right? You sound... strange.
0TO0013422	Yes, unfortunately.
0TO0013435	Chris said you might know where I can find computer parts.
0TO0013436	Where did you say I might find some computer parts again?
0TO0013437	Any idea where I might be able to find nuclear material?
0TO0013438	Any thoughts on where I might find some computer parts?
0TO0013457	That's right - you SHOULD thank me.
0TO0013459	What's your problem now?
0TO0013463	What are you talking about? You're the sheriff now!
0TO0013469	I'm still looking.
0TO0013475	I haven't found the gun.
0TO0013477	I found the gun. Here it is.
0TO0013481	Tell me the whole story of Vikki and Vance.
0TO0013482	Tell me about Vikki and Vance again.
0TO0013486	You sound pretty tough. Why haven't I heard of you two before?
0TO0013490	You sound pretty tough. I wonder why I've never heard of you.
0TO0013494	Your plan is going to get you both killed.
0TO0013496	You say Powder Gangers kidnapped Primm's deputy?
0TO0013497	I rescued Deputy Beagle.
0TO0013498	I freed Deputy Beagle and killed the Powder Gangers.
0TO0013499	I'll find Primm a new sheriff.
0TO0013518	This souvenir rocket I have glows. Will it serve as fuel?
0TO0013519	How can I help get you out of this room?
0TO0013520	Looks like I have to kill you.
0TO0013521	Your friends are safe. I just helped them sneak out of here.
0TO0013522	How did you end up trapped down here?
0TO0013523	How have you survived?
0TO0013524	You don't look like the other ghouls from Bright's group.
0TO0013525	What can you tell me about the "demons"?
0TO0013526	What can you tell me about the creatures out there?
0TO0013527	I need to search this room.
0TO0013528	I haven't found her yet.
0TO0013535	How is business lately?
0TO0013536	Did you get a look at the attacker?
0TO0013537	I heard you've been losing livestock.
0TO0013538	No one is going to attack your corral from now on.
0TO0013540	I'll see if I can catch whoever's responsible.
0TO0013541	What do you do here in Novac?
0TO0013557	We can talk from this distance.
0TO0013558	<Glare at No-bark>
0TO0013559	If you're going to be weird, I'm just going to leave.
0TO0013561	I don't mean any harm.
0TO0013562	Talk about what?
0TO0013563	Who tried to make you talk?
0TO0013565	You're going to talk whether you like it or not.
0TO0013567	You said you'd stab me with that dirty knife.
0TO0013569	Why do they call you No-bark?
0TO0013570	How did No-bark get his name?
0TO0013571	Who was it?
0TO0013572	Has anybody been acting strange lately?
0TO0013573	Who do you think is actually at the factory?
0TO0013574	What do you know about the abduction of Boone's wife?
0TO0013575	What else do you know about the deaths at the corral?
0TO0013576	What's been going on in town?
0TO0013577	Is anything interesting happening in the area?
0TO0013634	What did you and Boone's wife argue about?
0TO0013635	Who's Boone?
0TO0013636	Why are you on bad terms with Boone?
0TO0013648	I wouldn't worry about it. They're probably just rumors.
0TO0013649	Too many men are sitting around. Put extra guards on watch.
0TO0013650	I'd put some men with rifles on the guard towers.
0TO0013675	I was just exploring the area and noticed your patrol coming out of here.
0TO0013676	The ranger won't be a problem. He's dead.
0TO0013677	He told me himself that no one knew where he was.
0TO0013678	I'm not sure.
0TO0013679	The ranger won't be a problem. He's gone.
0TO0013680	I can take care of the Ranger.
0TO0013682	Got anything you need help with?
0TO0013685	I'll just be going...
0TO0013686	I'm not a powder ganger.
0TO0013687	I'm not a powder ganger!
0TO0013691	Keep pointing that gun at me and I'll stick it up your ass.
0TO0013693	Don't point! It's rude! Especially with guns!
0TO0013735	You got a T-51b? No? Then you don't have everything.
0TO0013820	I sabotaged the rockets.
0TO0013822	It was some sort of mechanical failure.
0TO0013824	I'm not going to hand over everything I own to you and your tin can friends.
0TO0013826	Let's talk this over.
0TO0013830	How do I join the Brotherhood of Steel?
0TO0013833	I'll speak to your Elder. Lead the way.
0TO0013835	Hello?
0TO0013836	Is anyone there?
0TO0013837	Anyone home?
0TO0013838	Guess I'll just see myself out.
0TO0013839	The password is "Lives to fight another day."
0TO0013841	Sorry, I just wandered in here. I'm lost.
0TO0013871	I don't have any.
0TO0013872	I have 1 radscorpion gland.
0TO0013873	I have one radscorpion gland.
0TO0013874	I have 3 glands.
0TO0013875	I've got a few radscorpion glands.
0TO0013876	I have a bunch.
0TO0013877	I have a bunch of radscorpion glands.
0TO0013878	I have some radscorpion glands. Can you make me some casserole?
0TO0013879	I'd like some of that radscorpion venom casserole.
0TO0013880	What happened to Primm?
0TO0013883	How's Primm these days?
0TO0013903	I'd like to come in.
0TO0013963	Actually, I have some stuff to take care of first.
0TO0013996	Primm is in dire need of some real law.
0TO0013997	I'd like to talk to you about protecting Primm.
0TO0013998	I got extra troop support for Primm.
0TO0013999	I want to talk about that NCR protecting Primm.
0TO0014001	Tell me about the NCR
0TO0014002	Never mind, I'll find someone else.
0TO0014003	I'll look for another solution.
0TO0014008	Want to be sheriff?
0TO0014010	Powder Gangers have taken over Primm.
0TO0014011	I rescued Primm's deputy, but the town's still lawless.
0TO0014048	Why would I want your used up hand-me-down?
0TO0014052	Here, I've got three stealthboys.
0TO0014053	Harland sent me. I'm here to get you out of here.
0TO0014058	It was the closest to proof that there was.
0TO0014059	Come with me. Let's go after the Legion.
0TO0014060	The culprit was obvious when all the pieces fell into place.
0TO0014061	I deduced it with a simple process of elimination.
0TO0014062	What will you do after this?
0TO0014063	We'll kill more with two of us.
0TO0014064	You needed someone to blame. What does it matter who?
0TO0014065	Are you an outlaw now?
0TO0014066	Snipers work better in pairs.
0TO0014067	I thought snipers worked in teams.
0TO0014068	You're right. I don't.
0TO0014071	Are you going to try and kill me?
0TO0014072	I just wanted to check out the view.
0TO0014073	I didn't say I wanted to be your friend.
0TO0014074	I don't see how that affects me.
0TO0014075	I found the bill of sale.
0TO0014076	Just making friendly conversation.
0TO0014077	How do you know your wife is dead?
0TO0014078	No reason.
0TO0014079	Just a hunch.
0TO0014081	Just looking around.
0TO0014082	I'm meeting new people.
0TO0014084	Well, I'm not from here.
0TO0014085	You only trust strangers?
0TO0014086	I heard there was a sniper nest up here.
0TO0014087	His story didn't add up.
0TO0014089	Her story didn't add up.
0TO0014090	There's a sniper.
0TO0014091	You're trying to track down your wife?
0TO0014092	Do you treat everyone around here like this?
0TO0014093	Expecting visitors?
0TO0014095	I just wanted you to kill him.
0TO0014097	I just wanted you to kill her.
0TO0014099	So now you want something from me.
0TO0014100	What do I do if I find this person?
0TO0014103	I think I'm in the wrong place.
0TO0014160	You seem friendly enough.
0TO0014161	Who's running the place now?
0TO0014162	If there's been a breakout, why is anyone still here?
0TO0014212	What about supplies? And guns? Do you sell those?
0TO0014249	What were you in for?
0TO0014266	There is no stockpile of Stealth Boys in this building.
0TO0014267	Did you do something to your leg?
0TO0014269	I'll come back when I know more.
0TO0014270	I'm not interested in this town's problems.
0TO0014271	The Rangers are soft. They're probably already dead.
0TO0014272	<Lie> The attackers are all dead too. It's impossible to identify them.
0TO0014273	I don't know the details. I just saw a lot of dead rangers.
0TO0014274	Members of Caesar's Legion ambushed them.
0TO0014275	Show me.
0TO0014276	Your body is injured, not your mind. You're kidding yourself if you think you're useless.
0TO0014277	You're with the NCR, right?
0TO0014279	Do Nothing.
0TO0014280	Actually, I'm still not sure.
0TO0014284	What about this rocket souvenir? The stuff inside glows.
0TO0014285	What about these rocket souvenirs? The stuff inside glows.
0TO0014289	I'd like to buy all of your remaining rocket souvenirs.
0TO0014290	What's been going on in town lately?
0TO0014291	We haven't met yet.
0TO0014292	Sorry, I didn't mean what I said. This seems like a nice town.
0TO0014293	Where can I get some supplies?
0TO0014294	What is there of interest around here?
0TO0014299	Wow! You really pulled the wool over his eyes!
0TO0014302	What's too bad?
0TO0014303	I'd like to enter the prison.
0TO0014312	I'm not really sure it's safe to carry those things around.
0TO0014313	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs? It would explain the glow and the illnesses.
0TO0014314	Is there radioactive material in your rocket souvenirs?
0TO0014319	Heard anything interesting?
0TO0014322	Sorry. Not interested.
0TO0014323	Like I said, not interested.
0TO0014325	I've already killed your "demons."
0TO0014326	I'll take care of the "demons" for you.
0TO0014328	Have you considered surrendering?
0TO0014329	I'd like to buy a dinosaur souvenir.
0TO0014330	I'd like to buy one of those souvenir rockets.
0TO0014331	Used to be?
0TO0014332	Tell me more about the dinosaur souvenirs.
0TO0014333	Who's No-bark?
0TO0014334	Tell me about the rocket factory.
0TO0014335	Tell me about the rocket souvenirs.
0TO0014336	Tell me more about the souvenir rockets.
0TO0014337	What do you sell here?
0TO0014338	Heard anything else useful?
0TO0014430	Well, it's still a crapshack.
0TO0014431	What are you doing in a place like this?
0TO0014432	Sorry. I meant no offense.
0TO0014437	After they're gone, you can have a good life in Novac.
0TO0014438	The guards are gone. You're free to leave.
0TO0014440	I have the nuclear material you need.
0TO0014477	Right the first time, ugly. I've come to kill you.
0TO0014480	I came here on behalf of the ghouls upstairs.
0TO0014481	I just wandered in here, okay? I don't want trouble.
0TO0014483	Okay, looks like I'm going to have to kill you.
0TO0014484	The Stealth Boys were sent here by mistake, then sent back.
0TO0014485	And who are you, exactly?
0TO0014486	Why did you all come here, in the middle of nowhere?
0TO0014488	Why can't you search the last room?
0TO0014489	Tell me again why you can't search the room?
0TO0014494	Why can't you just send your men in to kill the ghoul?
0TO0014495	Which is?
0TO0014496	What makes you think there are Stealth Boys here?
0TO0014498	Sorry, but I've got some bad news for you.
0TO0014499	I'll find the StealthBoy stockpile for you if your kin will leave this place.
0TO0014500	I can find the stockpile of Stealth Boys for you.
0TO0014501	Well, good luck finding them. I'm headed elsewhere.
0TO0014502	I think I've helped enough for one day. Bye.
0TO0014503	Where will you go once you have them?
0TO0014505	Sorry, no signs of the stockpile of Stealth Boys yet.
0TO0014506	No, I just wanted to come down here to kill you up close.
0TO0014507	Harland sent me. The way is clear, so get going.
0TO0014508	The mutants are dead. You're free.
0TO0014509	Actually, I was just wandering around.
0TO0016771	I think we should travel together.
0TO0016775	Let's travel together.
0TO0016777	Come, Raul, adventure awaits!

0TO0016809	<Follow Distance::Far>
0TO0018598	Actually, I don't have 150 caps.
0TO0019533	Are you always here?
0TO0019537	[Attack] I'll make sure you don't live to tell him.
0TO0019538	I have a dog tag for you.
0TO0019539	If the area is filled with radiation, why are you still here?
0TO0019541	Can I ask you about Private Edwards?
0TO0019543	I need to be going.
0TO0019547	Let me get back to you.
0TO0019550	What's the quickest way out of this dump?
0TO0019551	Come with me. There's something you should see, in front of the dinosaur.
0TO0019556	I could use some stims.
0TO0019557	Can I get some supplies?
0TO0019558	I could use some ammo.
0TO0019563	Tell me more about the Followers of the Apocalypse.
0TO0019564	Who are Flowers of Pock-lips?
0TO0019565	Where are the Followers based around here?
0TO0019566	Where Flowers of Pock-lips live?
0TO0019567	Do the Followers work together with the NCR?
0TO0019568	Do Flowers and NCR Bear play together?
0TO0019582	I'm busy right now.
0TO0019589	What strange things have happened?
0TO0019590	What can you tell me about the ghouls spotted to the west?
0TO0019604	All right, fix me.
0TO0019645	All done.
0TO0019647	<Storage::Open>
0TO0019659	It's time for us to part ways.
0TO0019661	I think we should part ways for now, Boone.
0TO0019662	Raul, I think I need to head on without you.
0TO0019663	<Companion Protocol::Terminate>
0TO0019664	Can you tell me about the followers?
0TO0019665	Why do you keep calling them Gangsters? I thought they were called Powder Gangers.
0TO0019666	Want to play a hand of Caravan?
0TO0019669	I'm all done playing for now.
0TO0019670	Yeah, let's play again.
0TO0019690	<Log Off>
0TO0019706	I'll go pay General Oliver a visit.
0TO0019707	Nothing else right now.
0TO0019712	Goodbye, Jason.
0TO1000001	I've found a way to do the bypass from here. You should be able to just use the terminal over there.
0TO1000002	Know anything about this Gala Event we're supposed to trigger?
0TO1000003	I need you to stay here and fire off the Gala Event.
0TO1000005	Don't act stupid. Let's get out of here.
0TO1000006	This is where it ends, Dean, give up.
0TO1000007	How did you get up there?
0TO1000008	According to the marker, you're slated for a spot in Puesta del Sol.
0TO1000009	If you think you can take me, come down and try it.
0TO1000010	Do you know what happened to the others?
0TO1000011	Casino security hit you like it hit me when you reached the lobby?
0TO1000012	Yeah, lucky us. Love getting shot at by Pre-War ghosts.
0TO1000013	Don't have time for the song and dance, Dean.
0TO1000014	All the world's a stage. Soon your brains will be all over it.
0TO1000015	So, what, you're going to risk blowing off your own head to kill me?
0TO1000016	So, stabbing me in the back for the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000017	How did you get from the Gala Event to here?
0TO1000019	Both Holograms are on now. It's safe for you to get to your position.
0TO1000022	All right. So find the other three people with bomb collars, bring them back here?
0TO1000023	I need you to go down to the manual bypass room to regulate the power.
0TO1000024	Why do you think he wants you to go the Puesta del Sol Switching Station?
0TO1000025	Things would be a lot easier if you did one snap for yes, two snaps for no.
0TO1000027	That Auto-Doc really carved you up.
0TO1000028	Those facial scars weren't done by the Auto-Doc - the throat scar was.
0TO1000029	How did you end up in the Auto-Doc?
0TO1000030	Have other people shown up in search of the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000031	Is anyone else alive around here?
0TO1000032	I found one of your stashes. Why did you leave them around the Villa?
0TO1000033	Before, you mentioned the Hologram at the Fountain - Vera? Do you know her?
0TO1000034	Do you know what those machines around the Villa are?
0TO1000035	This nodding, frowning, pointing you do is wearing me out.
0TO1000036	Can't you communicate some other way? Can you write?
0TO1000037	What weapons are you skilled at?
0TO1000038	What are the Vending Machines all over town?
0TO1000039	Tell me about the Cloud.
0TO1000040	What can you tell me about the Villa and the town?
0TO1000043	Collect Comps
0TO1000044	Um... want gifts for good gamble?
0TO1000045	100 Chips for 100 Pre-War bills.
0TO1000046	Want, um, a hundred? Chips. Trade?
0TO1000047	How about 500 Chips for 500 Pre-War Bills?
0TO1000048	Want a lot of chips for a five hundredths bills.
0TO1000049	Your voice... is that the Starlet's voice?
0TO1000050	Now that your voice is back, what did you want to say?
0TO1000051	The elevator to the vault is here, too.
0TO1000052	How long have you been hunting him?
0TO1000053	Sounds personal.
0TO1000054	You sound like the woman in the Sierra Madre broadcast.
0TO1000055	"Settle it?" You're here to kill him.
0TO1000056	I don't have time for this. Get in the damn elevator.
0TO1000059	Looks like someone carved a roadmap across your face.
0TO1000060	Did somebody cut your vocal cords?
0TO1000061	Look, I'm here to help.
0TO1000063	This isn't what it looks like.
0TO1000064	What's the matter?
0TO1000065	If you attack me, you'll regret it.
0TO1000066	Don't do that!
0TO1000067	It's a bomb collar - mess with it, it'll go off.
0TO1000068	Unless you want to lose your head, stop.
0TO1000069	Let's just say we're in this together.
0TO1000070	Enough of this shit, we need to move.
0TO1000071	Look, we can have this not-talk later, let's go.
0TO1000072	What do you mean by that?
0TO1000073	We need to cooperate if we're going to get out of here.
0TO1000074	If your collar goes off, mine goes off, it's better if we guard each other.
0TO1000075	Look, together we can get out of this.
0TO1000076	That's not going to work for me.
0TO1000077	You're coming with me, or else.
0TO1000078	I had questions I wanted to ask.
0TO1000080	Looks like someone set the bone saws to run random.
0TO1000081	I don't understand why they shaved you bald.
0TO1000082	Wait, the Auto-Doc didn't shave you bald?
0TO1000083	No, wait, I want to hear this. You were bald before?
0TO1000084	[BOS] You were a Brotherhood of Steel Scribe?
0TO1000085	How the hell did you get out here?
0TO1000086	Were you looking for something?
0TO1000087	Were you researching something?
0TO1000088	The Auto-Doc didn't do that?
0TO1000089	So the Auto-Doc cut your voice box, not your scalp.
0TO1000090	I can't restore your voice, we'd need a real Auto-Doc to do that.
0TO1000091	So you cut your own hair off?
0TO1000092	I... don't understand.
0TO1000093	Wait... that's a Brotherhood of Steel symbol, right? You're a Scribe?
0TO1000094	Where were you before?
0TO1000095	I let you out of the Auto-Doc. I can put you back in there just as fast.
0TO1000096	Glad we understand each other. Let's go.
0TO1000097	Fine. Would hate to have carved you up anymore than you are.
0TO1000098	Get going. I'll meet you at the Fountain in the center of the Villa.
0TO1000099	Look, I'm not trying to order you. But your life is tied to mine.
0TO1000100	What exactly is wrong? Don't you want out of here?
0TO1000101	You're looking for something else. Fine, I can help.
0TO1000102	Why don't you come with me, whatever else you're here for, not my concern.
0TO1000104	He said he knew you.
0TO1000105	He knew Elijah? How?
0TO1000106	Sympathized? Why?
0TO1000107	There's a chance he'll see reason.
0TO1000117	Not one for sitting when the clock's ticking.
0TO1000118	The chair's... an explosive? But...
0TO1000119	Better be a shaped charge, or you're going to kill both of us.
0TO1000120	Hnh?
0TO1000122	Uh... you... probably want to hear my side of things.
0TO1000123	I'll save my questions for the end - please, go on.
0TO1000124	Look - I need your help to get into the Sierra Madre.
0TO1000125	You've got my attention. For the moment.
0TO1000127	Misund...? Ummm.
0TO1000128	I'll cooperate. What do you want?
0TO1000129	I'm not going to help you.
0TO1000130	Have you tried to deal with them?
0TO1000131	Our collars... these "neckties" are linked. I die, you die.
0TO1000132	Uh... look, maybe we can make some sort of... deal, you and me.
0TO1000133	Your negotiation skills assume you're bargaining from a position of strength.
0TO1000134	I think you're bluffing. I'm getting up, right now.
0TO1000135	Either deal with me as an equal, or I walk.
0TO1000136	Forget this, I'm leaving.
0TO1000137	Agree to come with me now, or I get up from this chair and kill us both, shaped-charge or no.
0TO1000138	I only need you breathing. Push me, I'll bring you to the point of death, then leave you.
0TO1000139	It's starting to make sense, now that I've met you.
0TO1000140	Meet at the Fountain, and we'll hear what the next step is.
0TO1000141	How tough are they?
0TO1000142	I'm not a bad shot. I could probably kill one.
0TO1000143	I'm a fair shot. One shot, one kill is how I handle problems.
0TO1000145	I think you can manage walking there without me. Now get going.
0TO1000146	Fine. Get up and follow me.
0TO1000147	Focus?
0TO1000148	We'll find out more about our "contract" back at the Fountain.
0TO1000149	Any reason you can't find your way there?
0TO1000151	Well, if I can get here, others will be, soon enough. Fountain's the safest place.
0TO1000154	Is there anything else about them I should know?
0TO1000155	I've never seen machines like those before.
0TO1000156	Grifters?
0TO1000157	How did he describe it?
0TO1000158	What other items can you get out of the machines?
0TO1000159	Where can I find these cards?
0TO1000161	Tell me. The short version.
0TO1000162	Voice?
0TO1000163	So you don't know the phrase?
0TO1000164	All right, I'll head out and see what I can do on my end.
0TO1000165	How so?
0TO1000166	Forget the history lesson, get to the point.
0TO1000169	What was your problem with Sinclair?
0TO1000170	But what did he do to you?
0TO1000171	Forget Sinclair. If Vera was the key, she's dead.
0TO1000172	I'm in. If that's all, let's head out.
0TO1000173	So you're going to prove it now? How?
0TO1000174	And if she is alive?
0TO1000177	Fine. Meet at the Fountain?
0TO1000178	Less painful would be me throwing you off the roof. Understand?
0TO1000179	This thing on my neck isn't for show. That bomb goes off, so do I - and you, too.
0TO1000180	I'm not going to let any harm come to you, all right?
0TO1000181	<Lie> Dean, I wouldn't leave you here, I swear.
0TO1000182	What happened to your voice?
0TO1000183	That name carved on your chest... are you Dog?
0TO1000184	Yes, this should be enough.
0TO1000185	I haven't found enough yet.
0TO1000186	Who locked you in that cage?
0TO1000188	I want to know more about the Master.
0TO1000189	I had questions for you.
0TO1000190	All right, let's get out of here.
0TO1000191	Meet me over at the Fountain, we'll plan our next move.
0TO1000192	Who's this Old Man who brought us here?
0TO1000193	I need you to get to your Gala Event position.
0TO1000195	You've got a lot to answer for.
0TO1000196	Still hiding behind images and screens, I see.
0TO1000197	How did you access my Pip-Boy?
0TO1000199	You sure needed it to escape.
0TO1000200	I wasn't the one hiding all this time.
0TO1000201	I had to kill him before he hurt others.
0TO1000202	He's trapped, no chance of him escaping.
0TO1000204	There's something I wanted to pass along.
0TO1000205	It's a message. The news is up to you.
0TO1000206	Did it make any sense?
0TO1000208	Yes. It was entrusted to me, not you.
0TO1000209	Unlock it, give it back, then shut up.
0TO1000210	I want to exchange Pre-War money for some Sierra Madre Chips.
0TO1000211	Can we trade? Do you trade?
0TO1000212	Can I turn in my Sierra Madre Chips for Pre-War Money?
0TO1000213	I have shiny chips, want money - trade?
0TO1000214	That's all for now. Thanks.
0TO1000215	Don't need anything else. Bye.
0TO1000216	Uh... 1 Chip for 1 Pre-War Bill.
0TO1000217	Gimme one chip for one piece of paper.
0TO1000218	Let me have 5 Chips for 5 Pre-War Bills.
0TO1000219	Want five. Chips. For five dollars.
0TO1000220	20 Chips for 20 Pre-War Bills.
0TO1000221	Um, have 20 dollars... how many chips? 20?
0TO1000222	I'd like help with something else.
0TO1000223	Need help - can you help?
0TO1000224	All right, let me see if I can find another way to do this without sending you down there.
0TO1000225	<Lie> We'll take the elevator up, see if there's another way to do this. After you.
0TO1000226	I know Elijah needs to be dealt with, just let me handle it.
0TO1000227	You could have said something sooner.
0TO1000228	Just die, tired of listening to you anyway.
0TO1000229	What do you want to say?
0TO1000230	Just glad you're safe. Hold up here, I'll take care of Elijah.
0TO1000231	All right, come with me.
0TO1000232	Meet me at the Fountain, then we'll go from there.
0TO1000233	That's enough for now.
0TO1000235	That's our captor. He likes giving orders.
0TO1000236	I dealt with the others, and I've got the key phrase.
0TO1000237	I need you here, so sit tight.
0TO1000238	This place... I'm not sure, it doesn't feel like a casino. Not entirely.
0TO1000239	What? What is it?
0TO1000240	Does that Auto-Doc there work?
0TO1000241	Anything you can download off of it?
0TO1000243	Can the Auto-Doc heal your scars?
0TO1000244	You said you got off lucky?
0TO1000245	Elijah didn't put you in the Auto-Doc... Dean did.
0TO1000246	I dealt with the other two in our team, now I need you to open something.
0TO1000247	He wasn't trying to torture you, he needed to alter your voice to use an audio-lock.
0TO1000248	That's the hologram projector in the Fountain. What of it?
0TO1000249	You think he's using the Pip-Boy? To establish the projector connection?
0TO1000250	How did you get to the main gate? Then get here?
0TO1000251	Maybe it was a trust issue? He built this place for her, it feels like.
0TO1000252	I have no idea, let's unlock it. The phrase is contained in the lyrics to a song.
0TO1000253	I've got you to come down after me, it'll respond to your voice.
0TO1000254	What does that mean?
0TO1000255	If we stay here, the Cloud and the Holograms will answer that.
0TO1000256	It's a decayed speaker. If we stay too long near one, it'll go off.
0TO1000257	I believe he loved her, wanted to protect her. Too much.
0TO1000258	Guess it's the object of someone's obsession - or affection.
0TO1000259	What? What now?
0TO1000260	The target's the vault, not the casino, right?
0TO1000261	I found the phrase for elevator's audio lock.
0TO1000262	Come on, we need to keep moving.
0TO1000263	You'll have to wait just a little longer.
0TO1000264	Are you going to be okay here?
0TO1000265	<Take her hand.>
0TO1000266	Not in a hand-holding mood right now.
0TO1000267	All right, be ready.
0TO1000269	We'll get through this.
0TO1000270	Yeah, "thumbs up" - you better appreciate it.
0TO1000271	I'll be back for you, okay?
0TO1000272	I mean it. Stay alive until I get back.
0TO1000273	Get in that elevator or I'll make those scars on your face a pleasant memory.
0TO1000275	[Perception] It reminds you of being trapped in the Auto-Doc.
0TO1000276	I have no idea what your problem is.
0TO1000277	What the hell are you motioning about?
0TO1000278	You ready? The sequence is: "Begin." "Again." "Let." "Go."
0TO1000279	We'll see. I'll take care of him.
0TO1000280	That's what I'm counting on.
0TO1000281	He'll come here, to the Suites - when he does, let him go through.
0TO1000282	Are... are you all right? Something seems off.
0TO1000283	That's why you're waiting. You're going to kill him.
0TO1000284	Do you trust me? If you do, let go of this.
0TO1000285	If he kills you, I won't be able to get out.
0TO1000286	Let him come through the suites, follow me. If he escapes, you'll still be here, waiting.
0TO1000287	If you try and kill him, I can't let you do it. If you die, you'll kill us both.
0TO1000288	Then I need to keep you from doing it.
0TO1000289	Christine, please, let go of this. Let me deal with him.
0TO1000290	He won't escape, I swear.
0TO1000291	Fine. If you can't let him go, you don't leave me much choice.
0TO1000292	Don't tell me where you're going - I'll find you after this.
0TO1000293	For now, just say the words, and let's settle this so we can go home.
0TO1000294	What? You can make the speakers stop or something?
0TO1000295	You can dampen the signal somehow?
0TO1000296	You... uh...speakers make a tempo... or...?
0TO1000297	You can interfere with the Speaker's detonation frequency somehow?
0TO1000298	Does that work with any other collar?
0TO1000299	Got it, let's move on.
0TO1000300	It's just your frequency.
0TO1000301	...but only between us.
0TO1000302	Yeah, speaker static makes our heads blow off, right.
0TO1000303	You can interfere with the detonation signal from the speakers?
0TO1000304	Great. How romantic.
0TO1000305	We need to trigger the event like he says.
0TO1000306	He leaves audio logs, too.
0TO1000307	<Show her the Pip-Boy.>
0TO1000308	No fucking way am I giving this to you.
0TO1000309	What? What do you want?
0TO1000310	I don't want you messing with this.
0TO1000311	I had to get shot in the face for this. Get your own!
0TO1000312	Careful, that's my arm, all right?
0TO1000313	No worries, I'll just stand here like a piece of furniture until you're done.
0TO1000314	<Wait.>
0TO1000315	You sure seem eager to go.
0TO1000316	I... can only type with two fingers?
0TO1000317	Neither Dean or Dog have the technical aptitude to man the Switching Station?
0TO1000318	I don't know what you're talking about.
0TO1000319	I don't have any Sierra Madre Chips on me.
0TO1000320	Think he might be close, then. Any idea where?
0TO1000321	He'd have to be broadcasting from somewhere nearby.
0TO1000322	You make a pretty lousy transmitter, you know.
0TO1000323	Here's a Sierra Madre Chip. I'll need that back.
0TO1000324	You want... a small circle?
0TO1000325	We really don't have time for magic tricks right now.
0TO1000326	You... can make more?
0TO1000327	You can... scrounge more somehow.
0TO1000329	Yeah, there's more. All over.
0TO1000331	You can make more of those at a Workbench. With the right materials.
0TO1000332	Maybe if I find whatever objects you're trying to describe, this might make more sense.
0TO1000334	You need a battery... a Fission Battery... and Scrap Metal? And you can counterfeit the chips?
0TO1000335	Can you teach me how to do it?
0TO1000336	Maybe if I find what you're talking about, you can let me know.
0TO1000337	You can use these somehow? To make... make Sierra Madre Chips?
0TO1000338	What are you planning to do?
0TO1000339	You've had your voice back for only a little while, and I'm already sick of listening to you.
0TO1000340	If killing you will shut you up, let's do this.
0TO1000341	Is that like a science thing?
0TO1000342	You found a way to modify the collar's radio frequency.
0TO1000343	But... your collar's still on. So you're not free.
0TO1000344	You can modify the detonator signal. I don't see how that helps you.
0TO1000346	Done talking? I want to put your little theory to the test.
0TO1000347	There'll be a second or two of lag while you switch it. That's long enough for me to kill you.
0TO1000348	You know I didn't put you in the Auto-Doc, right?
0TO1000349	Even with the differences in the Villa, I don't want to fight.
0TO1000350	We're inside the casino. We don't need to fight anymore, it's useless.
0TO1000351	I didn't put you in that Auto-Doc. Dean did.
0TO1000353	Something to do with the surgery.
0TO1000354	So... brain damage, or...?
0TO1000355	Why... would someone remove your ability to write, or...
0TO1000356	That's a specific form of brain surgery using electrodes. Pre-War.
0TO1000357	That's a rather specific form of operation.
0TO1000358	You can still do math, that's good to hear.
0TO1000359	You can still do numbers and calculations.
0TO1000360	You were knocked out?
0TO1000361	He's broadcasting from the casino.
0TO1000362	You really want to get to him, don't you.
0TO1000363	Um, do you want to talk about it, or...?
0TO1000364	No, before we go any further, I need to know what the problem is.
0TO1000365	You kind of... changed there for a second.
0TO1000366	Don't ignore me - your whole body language changed there.
0TO1000367	Aren't you upset?
0TO1000368	You're looking for the man inside the casino.
0TO1000369	Elijah? You need to see Elijah.
0TO1000370	Why are you looking for him?
0TO1000371	You want to kill him.
0TO1000372	He's responsible for the scars.
0TO1000373	You mean business.
0TO1000374	I'm fine with killing the son of a bitch. As long as we can torture him first.
0TO1000375	Could always slap a collar on him and let him run into a wall of speakers.
0TO1000376	I'd like to know why he did all this first and what's so important about the casino.
0TO1000377	I'm not out to kill anyone, I just want to get out of here.
0TO1000378	I don't care. I'd rather reason with someone first than simply kill them.
0TO1000379	He came this way for a reason, and I want to know why.
0TO1000380	Maybe you're right, killing him is the best option.
0TO1000381	I just want to kill him anyway.
0TO1000382	Did you get gassed like I did?
0TO1000383	I didn't bring you here.
0TO1000384	You think I had something to do with this?
0TO1000385	Now... wait, you're acting like you don't trust me or something.
0TO1000386	What? What about my feet?
0TO1000387	Did you circle the area, or...?
0TO1000389	You want to know how I got here?
0TO1000390	Followed a radio signal here, a woman's voice.
0TO1000392	<Raise an eyebrow back.>
0TO1000393	...I was curious where it led.
0TO1000394	Needed supplies, thought it might lead me somewhere interesting.
0TO1000395	Thought I may have stumbled on an Old World treasure cache.
0TO1000396	Looking to start life as a Prospector, figured this place was a good place to start.
0TO1000397	I couldn't even tell you why, I just... did.
0TO1000398	If I could leave, I would.
0TO1000399	Me? What about you?
0TO1000400	Are you saying it's one or the other?
0TO1000402	You're not going to leave.
0TO1000403	I can't believe you'd want to stay here.
0TO1000404	So once the collars are gone, we can just leave?
0TO1000405	I... have no idea what you're saying. Again.
0TO1000406	You're saying it'll be difficult to return here if we leave.
0TO1000407	You were over the moon?
0TO1000408	...to return here if I leave.
0TO1000409	But not you.
0TO1000410	Why can't you find your way back?
0TO1000411	You aren't going to leave.
0TO1000412	So you're after the treasure then?
0TO1000413	Are you trying to break into the casino?
0TO1000414	Why would you want to stay here of all places?
0TO1000415	You were... looking for something?
0TO1000416	You want to... hunt here?
0TO1000417	You want to kill something here, then protect this place.
0TO1000418	Why do you want to do that?
0TO1000419	You're worried someone's going to find this place? Use it to hurt people.
0TO1000420	You can't protect the world from the world... it's useless.
0TO1000421	I'm not the one trying to communicate with hand motions.
0TO1000422	Fine, be a bitch, then.
0TO1000423	What are you shaking and nodding for?
0TO1000424	Okay, okay, I get it. <Nod slowly.> Better than finger snaps.
0TO1000425	You were looking for someone?
0TO1000426	A smile... now that's more like it.
0TO1000427	You really need to relax. This entire place is a Pre-War paradise, you know.
0TO1000428	Look... we'll find a way to heal you, all right?
0TO1000429	Wherever you were, it was hot out.
0TO1000430	This charades shit is driving me crazy.
0TO1000431	A robot?
0TO1000432	Man?
0TO1000433	Or a woman?
0TO1000434	All right, someone alive.
0TO1000435	An... angry, bearded... man.
0TO1000436	You were looking for a man in a Vault.
0TO1000437	You were looking for a Vault Boy?
0TO1000438	The man on the Pip-Boy holotape, Elijah.
0TO1000439	Someone smart.
0TO1000440	...and nuts.
0TO1000441	So why would you waste time looking for him?
0TO1000442	Sounds like it's pretty important to you to find this person.
0TO1000444	He cut you off from someone.
0TO1000445	Family? Husband?
0TO1000446	Oh - girlfriend.
0TO1000447	Uh... boyfriend?
0TO1000448	What, your wife?
0TO1000450	Oh- girlfriend.
0TO1000451	You were more than girlfriends - lovers.
0TO1000452	Unrequited? Or...
0TO1000453	What, you think I don't understand love?
0TO1000454	Give me a little credit.
0TO1000455	I understand how important a loved one can be.
0TO1000456	Whatever, love is transitory - or ended in gunfire.
0TO1000457	How did you get here from the Gala Event? And onto this floor?
0TO1000458	Energy Weapons, Explosives, Melee, Unarmed, and Guns. Is that all?
0TO1000459	You seem like you've been well-trained.
0TO1000460	Oh, is that all? Guess that'll do.
0TO1000461	So after your speech about control, now you're going to use the collars like Elijah did?
0TO1000462	Are you going to give me the key or not?
0TO1000463	Quit stalling, hand it over.
0TO1000464	Come on, Dean, turning me to ash? Hardly the way to end a beautiful partnership.
0TO1000465	Forget it, I'll just kill you and take it.
0TO1000466	I found this Holotape in your safe.
0TO1000467	That's all I wanted to know. Ready to die?
0TO1000468	"Vera" Hologram? You know the holographic woman?
0TO1000469	I bet I can figure out how to unlock the exit without you.
0TO1000470	You're not a betting man, which means I'm betting you have the key to the exit on you.
0TO1000471	No, based on your response, I'm sure of it.
0TO1000472	Give me the key, Dean, and you walk.
0TO1000473	I'm positive you have it. Now, I'll just kill you and take it.
0TO1000474	I think she was sick, yes. Found a medical report in her Suite.
0TO1000475	Why did you need her?
0TO1000477	Are you really that stupid?
0TO1000478	I'm not interested in killing you.
0TO1000479	Has the Cloud decayed your brain? Forget the Sierra Madre!
0TO1000480	That's the plan. Are you going to be able to do it safely?
0TO1000481	I could just jab both wires into you, close the circuit that way.
0TO1000482	If re-connecting the speakers is part of the Gala Event, yes.
0TO1000483	Look, I need you to stay here and do it.
0TO1000484	What weapons are you skilled with?
0TO1000485	Sounds... interesting.
0TO1000486	Any idea why he wants you there?
0TO1000487	Security? What security?
0TO1000488	Scrounge supplies? Like what?
0TO1000489	How do you make it?
0TO1000490	Always in the mood for another drink. What's the recipe?
0TO1000491	What about Christine?
0TO1000492	And the woman? The Auto-Doc victim - what about her?
0TO1000493	Interesting? Interesting how?
0TO1000494	Why... it sure is interesting. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
0TO1000495	What happens during the Gala Event?
0TO1000496	Can you tell me about her?
0TO1000497	Introductions? You knew her before?
0TO1000498	So you met her before she met Sinclair?
0TO1000499	I found some medical records in the Villa Clinic. You brought her in for treatment, right?
0TO1000500	So the visitors all killed each other?
0TO1000501	What happened to the people who came to the Villa?
0TO1000502	Any advice to getting through this?
0TO1000503	The Gala Event's tied into the casino's generators?
0TO1000504	How is the Gala tied to the casino? That makes no sense.
0TO1000505	Why would security shut down for the Gala?
0TO1000506	What do you mean about the Sierra Madre broadcast?
0TO1000507	So... it's not an invitation, it's a call for help.
0TO1000508	The bombs fell, and the emergency signal went out.
0TO1000509	She's been broadcasting all this time?
0TO1000510	I'm not following you.
0TO1000511	Wait, what Holograms? What are you talking about?
0TO1000512	I didn't see any security coming in - only the speakers.
0TO1000513	So how do I get you out of there?
0TO1000514	All right, I'll head for the door on the left.
0TO1000515	All right, I'll break to my right, head for the locked door.
0TO1000516	Uh... anything else you can tell me that'd help? Anything?
0TO1000517	I need a little more than that to go on if we're going to break out of here.
0TO1000518	This casino's security system is pissing me off.
0TO1000519	What about the speakers in here?
0TO1000520	Dean, the theater speakers are wired to a central sound system, right?
0TO1000521	Calm down, think. Do you know specifically where?
0TO1000522	One problem at a time. Take a breath, try and remember.
0TO1000523	Yeah, but if I run, what about the Security Holograms?
0TO1000524	Getting backstage is a temporary measure if I can't find the security terminal.
0TO1000525	Good thing you mentioned that before I ran back there, "partner."
0TO1000526	That's the radios and speakers - what about a central sound system?
0TO1000527	Keep going. What else?
0TO1000528	Is there one console that runs them or several?
0TO1000529	All right, makes sense. Where's the music?
0TO1000530	So I go to the locked door, right?
0TO1000531	Wait - I need to head to the door to your left or my left?
0TO1000532	What are you doing with a key to her room?
0TO1000533	The key is a song by Vera Keyes.
0TO1000534	Fine with me. Come on, let's settle this.
0TO1000535	As long as I re-establish a frequency to each floor, I can rebuild the song.
0TO1000536	The song still exists in fragments in the Sierra Madre archives on each floor.
0TO1000537	What about the collars, huh? Kill me, and...
0TO1000538	And the collars? You sound awfully eager to kill someone whose life is tied to yours.
0TO1000539	<Lie> I'm not sure how to do it yet. You said you had a recording outside?
0TO1000540	The one who put these collars on us wanted me to deal with everyone first.
0TO1000541	Wait - you said you have one inside? Where's the song recording you have?
0TO1000542	Christine is alive. Dog... well...
0TO1000543	Christine is dead. Dog... well...
0TO1000544	<Lie> If by "recording inside" you meant Christine, she's dead.
0TO1000545	If by "recording inside," you meant Christine, she's dead.
0TO1000547	No - believe it or not, I wasn't going to leave you to die.
0TO1000548	If it means I can get out of this alive, yes, that's why I'm here.
0TO1000549	Yes, that's the next step. You going to be all right?
0TO1000550	Now that I've got the signal established to this floor, yes.
0TO1000551	The terminal can tie the fragments together, just need to wrap it up.
0TO1000553	Wait, you were trying to smuggle one inside? Where is it?
0TO1000554	If you were using Christine's voice box to smuggle Vera's voice in, she's dead.
0TO1000555	<Lie> If Christine's throat surgery was your plan, too late, she's dead.
0TO1000558	Still trying to find out. Not sure.
0TO1000559	Everyone's still alive on each floor - including you.
0TO1000561	Were you blackmailing Vera Keyes to break into the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000562	What did you want her to do?
0TO1000563	What were you blackmailing her with?
0TO1000564	That's all I wanted to know. I'll head out, see what I can do on my end.
0TO1000565	Really? What makes you think you can slip out?
0TO1000566	I guess I should have figured you'd have an escape plan. Clever.
0TO1000567	I'm that predictable, am I? You're probably right.
0TO1000568	...head backstage, destroy every speaker, grab every key, then shut down security...
0TO1000569	So as long as I make sure I don't run for the exit...
0TO1000570	...that plan sounds pretty clear to me. Got it.
0TO1000571	Really? You're a terrible liar. See you soon, Dean.
0TO1000572	We'll talk about this more when we're face-to-face.
0TO1000573	I guess I'll try the key and see.
0TO1000574	I can handle a 200 year old washed-out lounge singer, trust me.
0TO1000575	If I clear out all the Ghost People in the area, will you change your mind?
0TO1000576	All right. What's it going to take?
0TO1000577	What if I can guarantee they won't come into the courtyard below?
0TO1000578	The Villa has Holograms everywhere. If I switch on some to cover the area...
0TO1000579	I could just throw you off the roof. What about that?
0TO1000580	Let me hunt around, maybe there's something I can do to protect the area.
0TO1000581	I switched on two Holograms to cover the courtyard, those should protect you.
0TO1000582	Okay, let me see if I can reactivate the Holograms.
0TO1000583	I don't need to kill you, you know.
0TO1000584	Both of us dying wasn't my plan.
0TO1000585	I could break both your legs, leave you here on the roof.
0TO1000586	All I need is your hands to hold the wires.
0TO1000587	No, it only means I wouldn't come back for you. Ever.
0TO1000588	If I break your legs, you can't leave - only scream. Here, in the middle of town.
0TO1000589	Do what I say, or I'll break both your legs and leave you here.
0TO1000590	If you don't do this, I'll go shut off the Holograms now.
0TO1000591	Dean... a man with cold feet isn't someone I'd share a bed with.
0TO1000592	Look, what do you want to do this?
0TO1000593	I'm not about to trade your life for mine, got it? Remember the collars.
0TO1000594	Just trust me, all right?
0TO1000595	Don't trust me? Then trust our collars. I die, you die. Got it?
0TO1000596	I think you can count on the Holograms, okay?
0TO1000597	Vera's stayed powered up since the bombs fell... those Holograms will, too.
0TO1000598	You must know me enough by now to know I'm not going to put you in danger.
0TO1000599	There's a Hologram guarding the courtyard below, you're covered.
0TO1000600	These Ghost People... they're the only ones alive around here?
0TO1000601	So... you're locked in there? Where's the key?
0TO1000602	You wouldn't have locked yourself in there without some sort of key to let you out.
0TO1000603	Did you hit your head or something? You're acting odd.
0TO1000604	You have multiple personality disorder. Some trauma caused this?
0TO1000605	I heard electricity and radios can cause, uh, voices in people's heads.
0TO1000606	In Super Mutants, brain damage is usually the result of prolonged Stealth Boy usage.
0TO1000607	We need to get you to the Gala Event. Get you to your place.
0TO1000609	What are you, exactly? You're acting different than before.
0TO1000610	Have orders for you - for going, staying, all that.
0TO1000611	Come on, then. I won't make it easy on you.
0TO1000612	I don't plan on running, it's time to kill you both.
0TO1000613	Dog... listen to me... don't do this.
0TO1000614	Dog! Stay! If you don't, Master will be mad!
0TO1000615	No, hold it tightly by the neck - now sink your teeth into it, tear it apart.
0TO1000616	Dog, hidden on you is the key. Find it, and toss it to me.
0TO1000617	I need your obedience. First, I'm going to show you a trick.
0TO1000618	Now that you are awake, Master wants you to listen, Dog.
0TO1000619	Just give me the key - you want out of the cage, don't you?
0TO1000620	Aren't you hungry? Go on - feed, piece by piece.
0TO1000621	Shut up, reject, and give me the key. Now.
0TO1000622	Yes, well, it had to be done. Now, I need you to remain here.
0TO1000623	I have some unfinished business. Are you going to be all right?
0TO1000624	Fine. Let's go, follow me.
0TO1000625	Go to the Fountain and wait for me there.
0TO1000626	Master needs you to pull on the chain on your neck as hard as you can.
0TO1000627	What weapons are you good at?
0TO1000628	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on the map?
0TO1000629	Do you know how the Ghost People taste?
0TO1000630	So Master vanished around that time.
0TO1000631	If the casino already opened, what are we doing here?
0TO1000632	I can't do it - fighting's more merciful than this.
0TO1000633	Do you know how long ago?
0TO1000634	I watched you devour one of the Ghost People.
0TO1000635	Doesn't that make the voice mad?
0TO1000636	Why do you eat the Ghost People?
0TO1000637	Can you tell me more about the Gala Event going off?
0TO1000638	Can you tell me about the other voice inside you?
0TO1000639	Did you bring me here?
0TO1000640	Do you know the way back?
0TO1000641	Forget this. Come on, let's fight, you big reject.
0TO1000642	Ready for more? Come on, let's finish this.
0TO1000643	Dog... stay back, listen to me.
0TO1000644	Dog! Stop! Or Master will be mad!
0TO1000645	No, look, I wasn't the one who caged you here, all right?
0TO1000646	Dog, the Master sent me. He commands you to listen to my voice now.
0TO1000647	Good... well done, Dog. I'm pleased. Now stay.
0TO1000648	Dog, listen to the other voice inside now. Go to sleep, let him come out.
0TO1000649	The other voice? See it in your head - not as a voice, but as a ball, the size of your hand.
0TO1000650	You're not leaving me any choice, I have to stop you.
0TO1000651	Take that chain around your neck, grab the ends, and pull slow and hard until you hear a crack.
0TO1000653	Dog, if you do this, you'll kill yourself.
0TO1000654	If you try to burn the voice out of you, this casino will be destroyed, and us along with it.
0TO1000655	There's no need for any of that, let's get out of here.
0TO1000656	Close your eyes, and only open them if the voice tells you.
0TO1000657	Reach around to the chain on your neck, see if you can find a key.
0TO1000658	Dog, do you know why you have to go to the position on this map?
0TO1000659	This is important - do you remember what happened exactly?
0TO1000660	Goodnight, Dog. You won't wake up, ever again.
0TO1000661	Um... do you want to talk about it?
0TO1000662	Dog, think back to the lights, the pretty ones.
0TO1000663	Wait, the casino already opened?
0TO1000664	Could I find my way back?
0TO1000665	The Master sounds like he treats you well.
0TO1000666	That's it, sleep, reject. Sleep like the dead.
0TO1000667	Try to picture the voice, inside, and, uh, turn in and look at it.
0TO1000668	Imagine the voice, not as a voice... but as water. Look at the voice now, what do you see?
0TO1000669	Then... step into the water, step into yourself.
0TO1000670	Do you know what happens if you go into the water, Dog?
0TO1000671	Now that you see, I want you to step back, listen to the voice again.
0TO1000672	Fine, reject. You want to die? I'll accomodate you.
0TO1000673	Dog, that voice doesn't control you, all right?
0TO1000674	Do you need to eat them to make them stay down?
0TO1000675	Bite down on it, chew until it's silent, then swallow it.
0TO1000676	Forget it. I'm sick of dragging you around anyway.
0TO1000677	I don't mean you any harm... you just need to calm down, focus.
0TO1000678	When we were sneaking, you mentioned Lou... who's Lou?
0TO1000679	That all seems lethal. Sort of.
0TO1000680	So... dismemberment and disintegrations take them down.
0TO1000681	Look, listen to my voice, maybe... maybe I can help.
0TO1000682	Dog, I stopped because I don't want to hurt you - now listen. I want to help.
0TO1000683	Maybe you just... uh... need to hear another voice, like mine.
0TO1000684	Dog, Master is here now, Master wants you to stop this.
0TO1000685	How do you do it?
0TO1000686	Can you show me where?
0TO1000687	Dog... just calm down... there's no need to keep fighting.
0TO1000688	Is that why you have a bear trap locked on your arm?
0TO1000689	Can you tell me how you got to the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000690	How you get here?
0TO1000691	Those scars on your body - where did you get them?
0TO1000692	I need you to stay here and trigger the switches.
0TO1000694	Your name is carved on your chest. Is that part of it?
0TO1000695	Can you tell me about the voice?
0TO1000697	Me hear voice, too? Then got here, bad place.
0TO1000698	Don't like it here, either.
0TO1000699	Voice in the air?
0TO1000700	What do you eat?
0TO1000701	Nuh-uh!
0TO1000702	Why you want to look like ground?
0TO1000703	Must been hard to see you.
0TO1000704	Maybe you go back someday.
0TO1000705	Where Church now?
0TO1000706	Sound nice. It still there?
0TO1000707	Where does the voice come from?
0TO1000708	Sounds like good trade.
0TO1000709	I want to hear more about the Master.
0TO1000710	Where's your collar?
0TO1000711	What's the other voice?
0TO1000712	Do you know how to wake him up?
0TO1000713	If you have the key in there, the "Old Man" can order Dog to open the cage.
0TO1000715	So you're the one who knows how I got to the Villa.
0TO1000716	Sounds like Dog might be more willing to get out of the cage than you.
0TO1000717	I need you to stay and operate the switches for the Gala Event.
0TO1000718	I bet I can get Dog to stay here, if you won't.
0TO1000719	What do you know about the Gala Event?
0TO1000720	Are you going to be all right?
0TO1000721	Now, if you've got him on a leash, I need to finish things here.
0TO1000722	As long as you're not planning to blow up the casino now, great.
0TO1000723	Not having your help doesn't matter if this heals you.
0TO1000724	I don't want you to be under anyone's control, even mine.
0TO1000725	Then I don't want you to merge, I need you here... Dog, listen to my voice. Dog?
0TO1000726	We came this far, I'll manage. Go on, let go.
0TO1000727	I promise I'll try not to get killed.
0TO1000728	Just go before I change my mind.
0TO1000729	Dog?
0TO1000731	Your voice... it's different.
0TO1000732	It'd take too long to explain.
0TO1000733	A cage... but at least you're not in two of them now.
0TO1000734	We're trapped inside a casino in a poisonous city.
0TO1000735	Go on and rest. I have to take care of something.
0TO1000736	If you get the strength to leave, do so - quickly.
0TO1000737	Fine, don't take too long, or it'll be a short recovery, trust me.
0TO1000738	Dog... don't do this, listen to me, my voice.
0TO1000740	Yeah, well, I'll make Dog help me. Can't be hard to figure all this wire stuff out.
0TO1000741	If that diagram over there holds the details, I can walk Dog through the instructions.
0TO1000742	If I bring food, will that calm Dog down?
0TO1000743	<Lie> Just... stay here in the courtyard, I'll go get food.
0TO1000745	Do you know anything else?
0TO1000746	How do you switch back and forth between voices?
0TO1000747	We need to discuss tactics - and positioning.
0TO1000748	I was looking for someone with a collar like mine. Where is your collar?
0TO1000749	Why did you lock yourself in the cage?
0TO1000750	I need to get you out of there.
0TO1000751	If you weren't expecting me, who were you waiting for?
0TO1000752	If that collar inside you is active, I didn't switch it on.
0TO1000753	How the hell did you... or whoever... eat one of these collars?
0TO1000754	Maybe you shouldn't go around shoving Old World tech in your stomach.
0TO1000755	Forget it. I had other questions.
0TO1000756	Do you know how I got here?
0TO1000757	Why do you say I'm the same as the Old Man?
0TO1000758	This Old Man, what do you know about him?
0TO1000759	You brought me here to the Villa.
0TO1000760	I can't leave until we get through this.
0TO1000761	So you know the way back?
0TO1000762	Why do you say that?
0TO1000763	I don't remember, only woke up when my Pip-Boy went active.
0TO1000764	No idea, I was unconscious the whole time.
0TO1000765	So Dog could just open the door at any time?
0TO1000766	Scorched by the sun?
0TO1000767	What is he doing here?
0TO1000768	So why did you bring me here?
0TO1000769	If you locked him... you... in, what if you couldn't get out?
0TO1000770	Wait. So you... or Dog... doesn't know the key is on him?
0TO1000771	Something tells me I could walk Dog through unlocking a door.
0TO1000772	Why did you surround yourself with all these radios?
0TO1000773	These radios, were you using them for signal interference?
0TO1000774	If you don't come with me, he'll set off our collars - yours and mine.
0TO1000775	I could order Dog to come with me. I bet he'd obey.
0TO1000776	The key's in there with you - and Dog.
0TO1000777	I could just tell Dog he has the key.
0TO1000778	If I can't prove it to you, then forget this, I'm bringing Dog out.
0TO1000779	Do you want to die? Cooperate, or you're both dead.
0TO1000780	If he hears the Old Man's voice, he'll do what the Old Man says.
0TO1000781	I can play his voice, yes. I have an audio log from him on my Pip-Boy.
0TO1000782	The Old Man's voice is on my Pip-Boy, just like yours.
0TO1000783	I want my freedom, too. You think I like having this collar on me?
0TO1000784	What if we go after the Old Man together?
0TO1000785	Goodbye, whoever you are... I'm going to let Dog out of his cage.
0TO1000786	Calm down. Follow me, willingly, I won't do it.
0TO1000787	I have the power to let Dog out of his cage. I'm going to prove it by not doing it.
0TO1000788	I guess... the alarm outside sure is a racket, though.
0TO1000789	You're blocking the eavesdropping with the alarm outside, too. Nice.
0TO1000790	I can't convince you I'm not here for the Sierra Madre or the Old Man, so I'll prove it.
0TO1000791	So the Gala Event was triggered at least once?
0TO1000792	Even if Dog is more helpful, we can manage.
0TO1000793	In that case, I will bring him along, I don't need you.
0TO1000795	Surprised they could hear you over the alarm bell outside.
0TO1000796	...and the alarm sound outside helps as well. Your doing?
0TO1000797	Why does that make him go away?
0TO1000798	Well... true enough. Sure uses the word "Master" a lot.
0TO1000799	Why did you put emphasis on the word "Master" before?
0TO1000800	Sounds like it makes you mad.
0TO1000801	What does Elijah make Dog do that angers you so much?
0TO1000802	Can't you do anything?
0TO1000803	Does not being in control bother you so much?
0TO1000804	You're trying to protect Dog. Having Elijah control him, hurt him - you want to protect him.
0TO1000805	You care about him.
0TO1000806	Why can't you control him?
0TO1000807	Did getting hit in the head cause you to start acting this way?
0TO1000809	Where is your collar?
0TO1000810	I want to know more about the man who brought us here.
0TO1000811	What's Elijah doing here?
0TO1000812	What does Dog know?
0TO1000813	Dog said he triggered the Gala Event once already.
0TO1000814	Something about lights and colors, not much else.
0TO1000815	He said the casino opened up.
0TO1000816	If the casino opened up, then why are we here?
0TO1000817	If he got trapped, why didn't he set off the collars?
0TO1000818	Couldn't he have commanded you to rescue him?
0TO1000819	Does the casino block the signal?
0TO1000820	So what happened then?
0TO1000822	Then how are the collars active again?
0TO1000823	The Pip-Boy could boost the signal. If Elijah has a Pip-Boy, that would explain it.
0TO1000824	He can't have possibly have set up a deadman's switch like that.
0TO1000825	If you won't do it, then Dog will, like he did at the police station.
0TO1000826	Any reason why you're assigned to this point on the map?
0TO1000829	Do you know how to operate the switches?
0TO1000830	Worried about being attacked if left here? The gate looks strong enough.
0TO1000831	I need you to trust me. I let you out of the cage in the Police Station.
0TO1000832	What kind of food should I bring back?
0TO1000833	You need to trust me if we're going to get through this.
0TO1000834	<Lie> I'll go hunt for food, you just stay here, and wait.
0TO1000835	I expect you to do what you're told.
0TO1000836	All right, I'll go hunting, see what I can find.
0TO1000837	So some of the "meat" inside them?
0TO1000838	We don't really have time for this.
0TO1000839	I'm not about to fight any more Ghost People just to feed you... or Dog.
0TO1000840	If you know how to operate the switches, I need you to trust me to get through this.
0TO1000843	I don't want Dog to have to deal with this, I prefer to deal with you.
0TO1000844	Because this requires intelligence, and I trust you to do this.
0TO1000845	I need someone who can operate the switches - and stay in control.
0TO1000846	If that's what it takes to make you listen, yes.
0TO1000847	I can't trust Dog to do this properly. I can trust you.
0TO1000848	Sounds to me if I bring Ghost People here, you couldn't handle them.
0TO1000849	If you don't stay here, I'll bring Dog out and leave him here.
0TO1000850	What are these Holograms?
0TO1000852	"Security" doesn't sound safe to me.
0TO1000853	How are they different?
0TO1000855	How are you speaking to me?
0TO1000856	Who are these people I'm gathering?
0TO1000857	Can you tell me about the Holograms in the Villa?
0TO1000858	What is the Cloud?
0TO1000859	What are the Vending Machines in the Villa?
0TO1000860	How am I supposed to get to the markers on my map?
0TO1000861	What is the Gala Event?
0TO1000862	What's inside the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000863	Aside from switching them off, what can I do?
0TO1000864	If I can't punch them or smash them, that doesn't leave me many options.
0TO1000865	Who's the woman Hologram in the Fountain?
0TO1000866	How did I get here?
0TO1000867	I had questions.
0TO1000869	I've decided I'm not going to help you.
0TO1000870	We'll head out, then.
0TO1000871	The real work? What was this, a warm-up?
0TO1000873	Collar? What are you talking about?
0TO1000874	What do you want?
0TO1000876	No, I'm not helping you.
0TO1000877	Is there any place safe to rest?
0TO1000880	Is there anyone alive around here?
0TO1000881	Why is my vision blurring?
0TO1000882	Where is my gear?
0TO1000883	Will exposure kill me?
0TO1000884	Radios and speakers?
0TO1000885	How did you get me here again?
0TO1000886	What do you need me to do now?
0TO1000887	Radios and speakers can set off my collar?
0TO1000888	Where can I find him?
0TO1000889	The inhabitants? There's people alive here?
0TO1000890	What Holograms are you talking about?
0TO1000891	So how do I destroy the radios and speakers then?
0TO1000892	How am I supposed to find them?
0TO1000893	So I need others to pull off this... heist. Who?
0TO1000894	Any suggestions for who I should get first?
0TO1000895	What's FEV?
0TO1000896	Why would you do that?
0TO1000897	I'll help. What do you want me to do?
0TO1000898	Are they all dead?
0TO1000899	How many of these victims did you bring here?
0TO1000902	What is this rifle?
0TO1000903	You've caught others?
0TO1000904	I'm not alone, then.
0TO1000905	Then maybe you better tell me why I'm here.
0TO1000906	I'll cooperate - if you can answer some questions for me.
0TO1000907	Forget it, then. I'll be on my way.
0TO1000908	So I have to deal with them - or I explode?
0TO1000909	You have got to be kidding. This place is filled with radio mines that can kill me?
0TO1000910	Where did you get the collars?
0TO1000911	If they're Pre-War tech, where did you get them?
0TO1000912	I've never heard of the place you're talking about.
0TO1000913	What do you want from the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000914	I don't understand how an Old World casino helps you do any of that.
0TO1000915	Properly? Are you kidding me?
0TO1000916	Working as murderous deathtraps, sure.
0TO1000917	If you secure that, that's all you want?
0TO1000918	You're Veronica's mentor. The Elder who lost HELIOS One.
0TO1000919	I can't argue that.
0TO1000920	What would you use them for?
0TO1000921	You want to attack NCR? All of NCR?
0TO1000922	[NCR] If you want to kill NCR, that's fine with me.
0TO1000923	I don't care about the Republic, they're yours to kill.
0TO1000924	Then we better get to killing them.
0TO1000925	How did you find out about the Sierra Madre?
0TO1000926	You're nothing more than a killer that aspires to mass murder.
0TO1000928	So you answered madness with madness?
0TO1000930	I'm sick of talking to some image on a screen. If you're going to come down, do it.
0TO1000931	Now that I'm here, are you coming down?
0TO1000932	How did you get me here?
0TO1000933	So someone else with a collar placed one on me? Who?
0TO1000934	If Dog put a collar on me, why didn't he say so?
0TO1000935	What happened to my gear?
0TO1000937	So the casino stripped me of my gear?
0TO1000938	I don't believe you.
0TO1000939	Unless you come down here, I'll destroy the vault, everything in it.
0TO1000940	I'm not interested in the vault, I only want to leave.
0TO1000941	Then I'll find a way to unlock the secrets of this vault, take them for myself.
0TO1000942	I... I'm pretty sure I can do some damage down here. Somehow.
0TO1000943	We'll see how "protected" the Vault is when I detonate this collar.
0TO1000944	Sounds like I'm dead anyway, the way you're talking.
0TO1000945	Denying you the Sierra Madre vault would be worth it.
0TO1000946	Oh, so you're willing to risk it?
0TO1000947	You... you don't have any way to transmit down here.
0TO1000948	Between floors? I don't think so.
0TO1000949	I'll trash the electronics, the vault wiring, maybe.
0TO1000950	Forget the Vault. The elevator's only a single control box.
0TO1000951	Wait until I get my hands on the computers, we'll see.
0TO1000952	All it takes is destroying a single terminal or holotape.
0TO1000953	Maybe too many safeguards, as you've discovered already.
0TO1000954	Destroying even a single fragment of data is more than you could stand.
0TO1000955	Safeguards? If you're a gambling man now, stay up in the casino.
0TO1000956	Um... are you sure of the frequency?
0TO1000957	There's noticeable lag of several seconds for the collar to go off - and a warning.
0TO1000958	Well... then you'd need some way of transmitting that, right?
0TO1000959	I'll clip the wires to this intercom, then the Pip-Boy.
0TO1000960	If that's what it takes to fix this, that's fine with me.
0TO1000961	Throwing a wrench into the works is what I do best.
0TO1000962	Having you wait up there forever with no way down sounds more appealing all the time.
0TO1000963	What can I say to convince you I just want to go?
0TO1000964	You've already waited too long for this moment, there's no need to wait any longer.
0TO1000965	Look, let me out, you get in the vault, we're both happy.
0TO1000966	You followed the signal, too. You want what's down here, I want out. Let's deal.
0TO1000967	You're right, it will be different - has been different.
0TO1000968	Both of us working together has allowed us to get this far.
0TO1000969	I've cooperated so far. You've made sure of that.
0TO1000970	But... look, I want to cooperate, all right? Come down.
0TO1000971	The collar's done its work, or we wouldn't be at this point.
0TO1000972	No traps, just a trade, you and the vault, me and the exit.
0TO1000973	Greed implies you want more than you deserve. You've earned this.
0TO1000974	You're right, you have everything - except the vault.
0TO1000975	But all of that - all of that wasn't an obstacle, it drove you here.
0TO1000976	Time is a commodity you don't have.
0TO1000977	If it has a lock... and it should... I can pick it. Somehow.
0TO1000978	I already managed to unlock the elevator and get down here before you. Better hurry.
0TO1000979	As long as you can find me, you mean.
0TO1000980	You'd have to find me first. The Sierra Madre basement's bigger than you'd expect.
0TO1000981	Fine, stay up there and wait. I'll keep busy down here.
0TO1000982	The size of the lock doesn't matter, only the contents.
0TO1000983	So there is a lock? Good. Wasn't sure until you said so.
0TO1000984	Yeah... well... I'll pick this lock, no matter how tough.
0TO1000985	You know the Sierra Madre's a huge combination lock. Me? I've almost cracked it.
0TO1000986	Foresight, whatever it is, won't help you spot me.
0TO1000987	I've gotten past everything the Sierra Madre's thrown at me. You're no different.
0TO1000988	If you want me to wait, I'll cooperate. The Sierra Madre doesn't matter to me.
0TO1000989	Before this goes any farther, I had questions.
0TO1000990	What happened next?
0TO1000991	There's something else I wanted to know.
0TO1000992	Now, now... I'll let you out when the event's over. Maybe.
0TO1000993	Stop banging on elevator. Annoying.
0TO1000994	Save your energy, we still have to pull this off.
0TO1000995	If you keep hitting metal, you'll hurt your hand.
0TO1000996	Must be you, Christine. Sit tight, not like you have a choice.
0TO1000997	Silent girl is going to make Ghost People show up with noise.
0TO1000998	Christine? We're almost ready here.
0TO1000999	Christine, almost ready, Christine.
0TO1001000	Only a little longer, and we'll open the casino.
0TO1001001	Only a little while before open big casino.
0TO1001002	<Give two taps back.>
0TO1001003	Tap-tap back.
0TO1001004	Let's do this. On the count of three... two... one.
0TO1001005	All right, on the count of... um. One?
0TO1001006	I'm ready. Everyone - trigger the event.
0TO1001007	Can we go now? Want to get inside casino.
0TO1001008	Show's about to begin. People, take your places.
0TO1001009	Time for a show. Come on, show, start.
0TO1001011	Um, trade? I... have stuff.
0TO1001012	Do you have anything I can buy?
0TO1001014	Bye-bye, light person.
0TO1001016	Just mad ramblings. He didn't make much sense.
0TO1001017	He explained the search for the Sierra Madre... healed him.
0TO1001018	It's better you don't. Let me hold onto it.
0TO1001019	Some last words - a message. Nothing important.
0TO1001020	Can you unlock it for me first? He was... vague on that point.
0TO1001021	I found Elijah.
0TO1001022	I had to kill him.
0TO1001023	He left this holo-message. Here.
0TO1001024	You should listen to this.
0TO1001025	You should watch it.
0TO1001026	What did he say to you?
0TO1001027	I had to trap him inside a Pre-War... prison.
0TO1001028	<Play Elijah Audio Tape.>
0TO2000001	I'm ready to go to Zion.
0TO2000002	Okay, let's do it! Zion here we come!
0TO2000003	We're all ready to get going.
0TO2000004	We're both set. Let's go.
0TO2000005	All right, let's go. I'm ready.
0TO2000006	Joshua told me you needed a few things. I think this is everything.
0TO2000007	I checked on everything in the valley and got you the map of Grand Staircase.
0TO2000008	Yes, go!
0TO2000009	Tell me about Waking Cloud's family.
0TO2000010	Well, I returned the calf to its mother, and didn't even kill any of the Bighorners.
0TO2000011	Well, I returned the calf to its herd. Had to kill a few Bighorners to do it, though.
0TO2000012	Well, all of the Bighorners are dead. Problem solved!
0TO2000013	I had to kill the Bighorners, but I saved the little one.
0TO2000015	Where is Vault 22 located?
0TO2000016	I've heard of some strange goings-on at Vault 22. Know any details?
0TO2000017	You're lying. I've been to Vault 22. No one's lived there in 150 years.
0TO2000018	Did you notice I'm wearing a Pip-Boy, too?
0TO2000020	About your husband... I'm afraid he was killed by White Legs during the evacuation.
0TO2000021	Relax, I've humped this load across the Mojave on my own two feet long enough. I can handle it.
0TO2000022	Hey, man, I'm cool. I got a big backpack and everything!
0TO2000024	Not only could I carry my own gear, I could carry yours, his, and one of your brahmins'.
0TO2000025	Don't worry about me. I'm used to finding out-of-the-way places to stuff my gear.
0TO2000026	What's with this obsession you seem to have with "civilization?"
0TO2000027	I talked to Joshua about your thoughts on civilization.
0TO2000028	<Lie> Daniel isn't avoiding talking about your family. He's just preoccupied with all of this.
0TO2000029	Who is Joshua Graham, and why shouldn't I talk about him?
0TO2000030	Do you have any family?
0TO2000031	I like your bear glove. Where can I get one?
0TO2000032	Tell me more about the job.
0TO2000033	Tell me a little about this area - any interesting wildlife?
0TO2000034	So, about those Bighorners....
0TO2000035	Tell me about the Bighorner problem again.
0TO2000036	Any idea where to start looking for these pre-War supplies Daniel needs?
0TO2000038	Follows-Chalk seems like he's interested in seeing more of the world.
0TO2000039	What was that like to grow up in New Reno?
0TO2000040	Tell me about the Ghost of She.
0TO2000041	Why the weight limit?
0TO2000042	How come I can't bring all my stuff?
0TO2000043	Tell me about Happy Trails Caravan Company.
0TO2000044	Tell me more about Joshua Graham.
0TO2000045	Who were those tribals who attacked me?
0TO2000046	"Deadeye," huh? How did you get that nickname?
0TO2000047	Do you have any other special skills or abilities?
0TO2000048	Where'd you get the Vault suit?
0TO2000049	Tell me about Caliente.
0TO2000050	What's your deal?
0TO2000051	Give me some info on this Daniel. Who is he?
0TO2000052	Why do you need a map of Grand Staircase?
0TO2000054	What do you use your Pip-Boy for?
0TO2000055	Were the 80s a gang, or a tribe?
0TO2000056	Tell me more about your tribe.
0TO2000057	What do you know about Salt-Upon-Wounds?
0TO2000058	I understand this caravan is headed to Zion. What can you tell me about the area?
0TO2000059	You mentioned you need healing powder. I have some, if you're still interested.
0TO2000060	What do you know of the White Legs?
0TO2000061	What do you know about the White Legs?
0TO2000062	Who or what is the Father in the Cave?
0TO2000063	Is there any other way I can help the Sorrows?
0TO2000065	I haven't been through Utah recently - what's the situation like?
0TO2000066	You do anything around here, besides talk too much?
0TO2000067	You do anything around here, besides make women sick?
0TO2000069	Why are you so eager to evacuate Zion? You don't seem to be a pacifist.
0TO2000070	What did you say about a courier? Who were you expecting?
0TO2000071	I see you're wearing a Pip-boy and Vault suit.
0TO2000072	What do you know about the Father in the Caves?
0TO2000073	Why won't you tell me about what happened at New Canaan?
0TO2000074	I've met Caesar, you know. What do you think he would say if I told him you were here?
0TO2000075	Medicine check.
0TO2000076	Unwarranted hostility and general agitation. How long have you been a Psycho addict?
0TO2000080	Actually, let me take care of some more things first.
0TO2000081	What can you tell me about New Canaan?
0TO2000082	How about a game of Caravan to kill some time?
0TO2000083	How about another game of Caravan?
0TO2000084	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 75 pounds.
0TO2000085	All right, I'll come back when I'm carrying less than 100 pounds.
0TO2000086	Why can't you get to Salt Lake City?
0TO2000087	It sounds like Happy Trails isn't in the best financial shape.
0TO2000088	So, you guys are totally rich, right?
0TO2000089	Do you know anything about their religion?
0TO2000090	You don't know what happened to their mission?
0TO2000091	Tell me about the raiders.
0TO2000092	Degenerate tribes?
0TO2000093	Warlords? How dangerous are they?
0TO2000095	Like I care. Let's just go. I'm ready.
0TO2000096	I think Joshua's right. We should fight the White Legs.
0TO2000097	Don't worry. I think leaving Zion is for the best.
0TO2000100	Here's one healing powder.
0TO2000101	Take all I have.
0TO2000102	I came in with the Happy Trails Caravan. We were attacked by tribals. I'm the only survivor.
0TO2000103	Oh, heh. I just walked here. No big deal.
0TO2000104	Who are you to be asking me questions?
0TO2000105	Anything to help. I'll do what I can.
0TO2000106	If it will get me out of here, sure.
0TO2000107	Come on. I got you everything you needed. Just give me the damned map.
0TO2000108	I apologize, Daniel. I think stress got the best of me.
0TO2000109	Sorry, I uh... didn't mean to insult you or whatever.
0TO2000111	I'll be taking the map now.
0TO2000112	That's an awful lot of responsibility to take on.
0TO2000113	You're right to leave, but I don't think you should kill any of the White Legs.
0TO2000114	If you're willing to defend the Sorrows, why not pursue the White Legs?
0TO2000115	Joshua's a New Canaanite and he's obviously willing to attack the White Legs.
0TO2000116	Joshua's come up with a reasonable alternative. Why not help them fight?
0TO2000117	That makes sense. Let's talk about something else.
0TO2000118	The use of violence only leads to more violence.
0TO2000119	She said one of her births was difficult and you helped her through it.
0TO2000120	Did you help the rest of her family leave Zion?
0TO2000121	What's the matter? Did something happen?
0TO2000122	O... kay, let's talk about something else then.
0TO2000123	It's her husband! Don't you think she has a right to know?
0TO2000124	I don't think you should hide this from her, but I see your point. I won't say anything.
0TO2000125	Settle down. I'm not telling her squat.
0TO2000126	You're the New Canaanite who's supposed help lead these people, not hide things from them.
0TO2000127	Aren't you the guy in charge around here?
0TO2000128	That's too bad, because I'm going to tell her.
0TO2000129	Fine. Forget it.
0TO2000130	I have an addiction problem.
0TO2000131	Oh, the usual. A few scrapes, burns, and bullet wounds.
0TO2000132	Radiation sickness.
0TO2000134	Yes. Here's 200 caps.
0TO2000135	Hmm. I guess I don't have 200 caps.
0TO2000136	Here's 150 caps for the trouble.
0TO2000137	Sure. Will 300 caps cover it?
0TO2000138	I can handle the expenses. 600 caps should cover everything, shouldn't it?
0TO2000139	I guess I don't quite have 150 caps...
0TO2000140	Actually, I think I'll be fine. Thanks anyway.
0TO2000141	It looks like I'm a bit short of 300 caps...
0TO2000142	Er... it looks like I don't quite have 600 caps.
0TO2000143	Here's 300 caps to cover the expenses.
0TO2000144	I don't quite have 300 caps.
0TO2000145	You said you "used to" help the Sorrows with problems. What do you do now?
0TO2000146	I'm trading Pre-War goods and supplies from the Mojave Wasteland. You need those too, don't you?
0TO2000147	But I have... caps. Many of them. Let me show you all of my fine caps.
0TO2000148	Most of the Sorrows and Dead Horses are protected. I'm out there getting shot up by White Legs.
0TO2000149	Yeah, but I'm helping you so... come on.
0TO2000151	Salvation? From what, the wasteland?
0TO2000152	What does a bishop do? Is that your boss?
0TO2000153	Has this happened before, the White Legs attacking other tribes?
0TO2000154	The White Legs are here already, so what's your plan?
0TO2000155	What happened at New Canaan?
0TO2000156	Were you close to Mordecai?
0TO2000157	If you don't acknowledge your past now, it'll come back to you later.
0TO2000160	Sounds kind of far-fetched, even for the wasteland.
0TO2000161	Why don't you teach them something useful instead of filling their heads with nonsense?
0TO2000162	You're the man in charge. If something's troubling you, it could affect all of us.
0TO2000163	I'm just curious, that's all.
0TO2000164	I understand. Let's talk about something else.
0TO2000165	I'd like to talk to you about Mordecai.
0TO2000167	And you have the right to pull them off of their land?
0TO2000168	This is the way the world is. They're part of it, whether you like it or not.
0TO2000169	Uh... you might want to have a chat with them. They think your "Lord" and the "Father" are the same.
0TO2000170	I had some other questions for you.
0TO2000171	Here, take three of my healing powders.
0TO2000172	Here, take five of my healing powders.
0TO2000174	Why are you called Follows-Chalk?
0TO2000175	I'll do what I can, but I need to defend myself if I'm attacked.
0TO2000176	Who is this Joshua?
0TO2000177	Civilized lands? What do you mean?
0TO2000178	I don't have time for this. Go away.
0TO2000179	What are all those tattoos?
0TO2000180	Tell me about your tribe.
0TO2000181	What did Joshua do for you?
0TO2000182	Do you remember anything about Joshua from before he became your leader?
0TO2000183	What do you know about the New Canaanites?
0TO2000184	What's with the shell casings in your club?
0TO2000185	Maybe I can help with that.
0TO2000186	All right, I'll look into it.
0TO2000187	That sounds like way too much work. Maybe later.
0TO2000188	Why is it so important that we fight the White Legs?
0TO2000189	Wait, what about Caesar?
0TO2000190	All right, let's go.
0TO2000191	What happened to him?
0TO2000192	The only recent war I know of is when Caesar's Legion attacked Hoover Dam. Is that where he fought?
0TO2000193	Small? Have you ever seen Hoover Dam? It's bigger than some of these mountains.
0TO2000194	You'd be surprised what "civilized" tribes will fight over.
0TO2000195	Are you sure? You've been a useful companion so far.
0TO2000196	Give my regards to Joshua, then.
0TO2000197	Typical. Just when I get a useful minion....
0TO2000200	Hang on, I want to know more about what's going on.
0TO2000201	Okay, I'll go talk to him.
0TO2000202	I had no reason to stay for that fight.
0TO2000203	White Legs? Who are they?
0TO2000204	Huh, I think I know that guy. Small world.
0TO2000206	I could use a guide. Let's go.
0TO2000207	No way, pal. I'm not traipsing around the desert with a barbarian who doesn't wear pants.
0TO2000208	What would you suggest I do instead?
0TO2000209	You've got a funny idea about what the Mojave's like, but I'll go with you and see your boss.
0TO2000210	Wait, what? New Canaan was wiped out? How?
0TO2000211	Where do they come from?
0TO2000212	Wildlife problem? What kind of wildlife?
0TO2000214	What does Joshua think of this?
0TO2000215	Really? Maybe I could talk to him about it for you. Be a neutral party.
0TO2000216	He said he has a hard time being objective about the whole idea, and that I should give you advice.
0TO2000217	<Lie> That it's a den of corruption and vice, and the Dead Horses' way of living is better.
0TO2000218	<Lie> That a man must follow his heart no matter where it leads him.
0TO2000219	I know that guy! I got him a job!
0TO2000220	What taboo places?
0TO2000221	Where should we start looking?
0TO2000222	You should stay here with your people. You have a duty to them.
0TO2000223	Civilization isn't perfect, but neither is tribal life. You should go see it for yourself.
0TO2000224	What's this "place where the little ones fell?"
0TO2000225	White Legs? Those are the people who attacked us?
0TO2000226	If you're willing, I'll take the help.
0TO2000227	Forget it, I'm out of here.
0TO2000228	Wait, Joshua! Don't!
0TO2000230	I came here with the Happy Trails Caravan Company to make contact with the New Canaanites.
0TO2000231	Joshua, you've already won. Look around you. There's no need to kill him.
0TO2000232	Let him keep his dignity. Give him a fighting chance.
0TO2000233	No objections.
0TO2000235	I'm not going to leave without offering to help. What can I do?
0TO2000236	Don't try to get me to help you. I'm not interested.
0TO2000237	How about I go find dear Daniel and shake the information out of him?
0TO2000238	Why don't you or Daniel do it?
0TO2000239	Taboo?
0TO2000241	Sorry, but I'm not going on a scavenger hunt for you.
0TO2000242	Fine. What do you need?
0TO2000243	I'll see you on the other side.
0TO2000245	Well, I'm guessing you're pretty mad about something.
0TO2000247	No, and I don't really care.
0TO2000248	You don't want to leave Zion. You'd rather kill every last one of the White Legs.
0TO2000249	This conversation just got pretty dark. What was that about happy... dashing the little ones?
0TO2000250	Why are you talking to me about it?
0TO2000251	You'll get no argument from me. These White Legs are human garbage.
0TO2000252	I'll talk to him about it. Maybe he can be persuaded.
0TO2000253	I need to think about it.
0TO2000254	Yes, what has to be done is you have to get these tribes out of here.
0TO2000255	And what kind of tribe is that?
0TO2000256	I do. They're little more than raiders, if that.
0TO2000257	Fair enough, I guess.
0TO2000258	Hmm. Okay.
0TO2000259	I don't know if you've figured this out yet, but I don't believe what you believe.
0TO2000260	Fair enough. What do you want me to do about it?
0TO2000261	Enough with the drama. I just want to get home.
0TO2000262	Sounds like a good deal.
0TO2000263	Huh. If you say so.
0TO2000264	Ha ha ha! Wait... you don't actually believe that, do you?
0TO2000265	Do you ever "fall?"
0TO2000266	Why did the White Legs attack my caravan?
0TO2000267	Does the valley belong to the Dead Horses?
0TO2000268	Why haven't I seen any Sorrows in the valley?
0TO2000269	Are the New Canaanites really a tribe?
0TO2000270	Thanks for the offer, but I'll handle it myself.
0TO2000271	What do you know of Salt-Upon-Wounds?
0TO2000272	Do they speak... our language?
0TO2000274	Fine, I'll look into getting those supplies for Daniel.
0TO2000275	I have a few questions for you.
0TO2000276	Were you always with the New Canaanites?
0TO2000277	If what you believe is true, he'll pay for it later. The Sorrows don't need to see you do this.
0TO2000278	What are those bandages for?
0TO2000279	Who are you to decide this?
0TO2000280	Was one of those men Caesar?
0TO2000281	How did you end up as Caesar's legate?
0TO2000283	Are you in much pain? Is there anything I can do to help?
0TO2000284	What do you know about the war between Caesar and NCR?
0TO2000286	You know that means I'm going to encourage him to leave, right?
0TO2000287	Do you know about Mr. House?
0TO2000288	I'm guessing you don't like Caesar very much.
0TO2000289	What's at the Divide?
0TO2000290	The Divide blocked all of their northern land routes?
0TO2000292	Fine by me. I prefer the wilderness.
0TO2000293	Caesar is dead. I saw to it personally. I thought you should know.
0TO2000294	They won't. I'll make sure the Legion has very little to go home with.
0TO2000296	You don't think Lanius can lead the Legion?
0TO2000297	I have some gear that needs repairs.
0TO2000298	How do you know so much about what happened to me?
0TO2000299	You're saying that you killed a Brotherhood of Steel Paladin?
0TO2000300	Please go on. This promises to be entertaining.
0TO2000301	Guns Check
0TO2000302	Too bad there's no such thing as an 11mm submachinegun.
0TO2000303	What a shot!
0TO2000304	That's quite a story.
0TO2000305	Survival check re: "Deathjaws"
0TO2000306	"Deathjaws," huh? Did you mean to say "Deathclaws?"
0TO2000307	"Deathjaws?" I've never heard of those...
0TO2000308	What a load of crap. The eyeslits of T-series power armor are bullet-proof!
0TO2000310	I'll bring my tweezers and a microscope.
0TO2000312	Great, I'll see what I'm shooting at.
0TO2000313	Ewww. I think I'll pass.
0TO2000315	Looks like you're traveling light. What would you say to carrying some of my stuff?
0TO2000316	Looks like you're traveling light. Carry some items for me, and I'll make it worth your while.
0TO2000317	How much Psycho you got stashed away? If you run out on the trail... the withdrawal's not pleasant.
0TO2000318	I've got Psycho to sell, but it won't come cheap.
0TO2000319	I can sell you a dose of Fixer, but it won't be cheap.
0TO2000320	Yeah, leave now. Before the withdrawal hits you out on the trail, no Psycho for miles.
0TO2000321	One hit for 30 caps.
0TO2000322	Two hits for 60 caps.
0TO2000323	Three hits for 90 caps.
0TO2000324	Five hits for 150 caps.
0TO2000325	Ten hits for 300 caps.
0TO2000326	80 caps.
0TO2000327	Never mind. It's your problem, not mine.
0TO2000328	Never mind. Keep living the dream.
0TO2000329	I'll give you 100 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
0TO2000330	I'll give you 75 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
0TO2000331	I'll give you 50 caps to make sure Jed lets me carry extra gear.
0TO2000332	Never mind, I don't want to spend caps on that right now.
0TO2000334	I don't think your Pip-Boy works. I'd better go tell Jed.
0TO2000335	I guess two Pip-Boys is better than one, anyway.
0TO2000337	Your Pip-Boy isn't working. The screen's locked up, and the reboot button is missing.
0TO2000338	Any chance you could show me some new ways to use my Pip-Boy?
0TO2000339	I'm convincing, you're not. He'll believe me.
0TO2000340	What I want is for you to scram. This expedition doesn't need you.
0TO2000341	Carry some of my gear, and I'll keep my mouth shut.
0TO2000342	Vow of secrecy? Fine, forget about it.
0TO2000343	PER check.
0TO2000344	You're lying. You have no idea where Vault 22 is.
0TO2000345	Sorry - didn't mean to be pushy.
0TO2000347	You're lying. You've never been to Vault 22.
0TO2000349	I've got your number, that's all. Just wanted you to know.
0TO2000350	Wait! There's no reason this has to end in bloodshed!
0TO2000351	Can't we just, you know, be friends?
0TO2000352	Time to die, General Gobbledegook!
0TO2000353	Your power is broken. You cannot hope to prevail here. Leave this valley in peace.
0TO2000354	You're right. We're going to kill you, but not like this. Defend yourself!
0TO2000355	I've already crushed your warriors. Retreat now and rebuild your tribe, or die in obscurity.
0TO2000356	Daniel and the Sorrows are weak prey, not fit for such mighty warriors.
0TO2000357	Then see how strong my spears are, warrior.
0TO2000358	Let's end this, then.
0TO2000359	Whatever. Joshua, put a cap in General Gobbledigook here.
0TO2000360	Whoa. This isn't what I signed up for. Let me talk to Joshua about this.
0TO2000361	Wait a minute, what if I don't want to do any of that?
0TO2000362	I have the sacred datura here.
0TO2000363	Not yet. I had some questions first.
0TO2000364	All right, let's do this.
0TO2000365	Not yet. I need a moment.
0TO2000366	It's done.
0TO2000368	Okay then. I guess I'll just... go then.
0TO2000369	What? I don't know what "visions of truth" means.
0TO2000370	Crazy old man. I'm not doing anything for you.
0TO2000373	Okay then... I guess... I guess I don't have any questions after all.
0TO2000374	I've already got the roots you need.
0TO2000375	Umm... tell me about this vision quest again?
0TO2000376	Who or what is the Ghost of She?
0TO2000377	Umm... Goodbye.
0TO2000379	Wait, you think the survivalist is... God?
0TO2000380	That doesn't sound like what I've heard about the New Canaanites....
0TO2000381	I see. That's fascinating.
0TO2000382	Holy books?
0TO2000383	Have you known him long?
0TO2000384	Midwife? I haven't seen any children around.
0TO2000385	What do you do when you're not delivering babies?
0TO2000386	Safe? Where are they?
0TO2000388	I'm afraid so. Daniel kept it from you because he thought the grief would distract you.
0TO2000389	He was only doing what he thought was best for the tribe. It wasn't an easy choice for him.
0TO2000390	I agree. It was arrogant and cruel - not exactly the kind of thing a friend would do.
0TO2000391	You're right. Now, what are you going to do about it?
0TO2000392	Any advice on how to deal with the situation?
0TO2000393	So the totems are sacred to them somehow? Good to know.
0TO2000394	Okay then, let's get down there and take care of business.
0TO2000395	What should we do about it?
0TO2000396	These traps must have come from somewhere - I bet the White Legs who placed them are still around.
0TO2000397	Let's take care of it then.
0TO2000399	Big deal, I've killed worse.
0TO2000400	We'd better get to work then.
0TO2000401	I'll be sure to tell Daniel to bring some bear-monster-thing snacks, then.
0TO2000402	How would we do that?
0TO2000405	I don't have time for your religious superstitions. It's just a cave, that's all.
0TO2000406	Holy wrath. Right. I'll keep an eye out for that. Bet it looks a lot like a bear trap.
0TO2000407	The Father in the Caves was just a man who lived a long time ago.
0TO2000408	I understand. I'll respect your beliefs, then, but we need to search the cave.
0TO2000409	Sounds good. Let's go.
0TO2000410	I prefer to travel alone, thanks.
0TO2000412	Any idea what he wants?
0TO2000414	Okay, I'll talk to him.
0TO2000416	Maybe later, if there's time.
0TO2000418	I could talk to him, maybe he'll open up more to me.
0TO2000419	No, I've changed my mind.
0TO2000421	I want you to travel with me.
0TO2000425	That's it for your tactics. Let's talk about something else.
0TO2000428	I don't want you to attack enemies unless I've already engaged them.
0TO2000433	You're good. Let's get going.
0TO2000434	Spread out and keep your distance from me.
0TO2000435	Enough about tactics. Let's talk about something else.
0TO2000474	Umm... what?
0TO2000475	Am I... looking for Joshua? Yes, I am. Can you tell me where he is?
0TO2000476	If you're too dumb to speak my language, you're too dumb to talk to me. Get lost.
0TO2000477	Yes, I'm looking for him. Is he here?
0TO2000478	I'll make sure to be on my best behavior, then.
0TO2000479	Umm... okay. Thanks for that. I sure would hate to be shown thunder and fire.
0TO2000480	Back off, savage - I'm just here for a map out of this shithole valley, not kowtow to your messiah.
0TO2000481	I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
0TO2000482	No, I smash White Legs alone. You stay here so you not get dead.
0TO2000483	Just get out of here, you're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
0TO2000484	Fine, but at least let me handle it alone. You're no match for hardened White Leg warriors.
0TO2000485	Sure, whatever. We go smash White Legs.
0TO2000486	Just wait here a few minutes. Don't do anything crazy.
0TO2000573	I need some medical assistance. Can you help?
0TO2000574	Go back to your people's camp.
0TO2000575	Pray? God? What are you talking about?
0TO2000576	I want to trade equipment.
0TO2000577	Nice guns.
0TO2000579	Do you run the show around here?
0TO2000580	What's going on with all of these... tribes?
0TO2000589	Can I ask you some personal questions?
0TO2000590	That's all for now, but I'll be back.
0TO2000591	Let's talk more later.
0TO2000592	Nothing else. Talk to you later.
0TO2000594	That's all I wanted to know for now.
0TO3000001	Have you made any electronic components?
0TO3000002	I'd like to process some plants.
0TO3000003	I have some seditious material for you to process.
0TO3000004	Can you turn those lights on for me?
0TO3000005	It's not often I meet a light switch with brains and beauty. I think I'm going to like it here.
0TO3000007	A light switch that turns me on? I must be dreaming.
0TO3000008	I've got some toasters for you.
0TO3000009	I found my brain, now you and I are going to settle things.
0TO3000010	I've recovered all the technological information.
0TO3000011	Surrender, Mobius, I don't want to fight you.
0TO3000012	I've defeated your Giant Robo-Scorpion, you're next.
0TO3000013	Are you... my brain?
0TO3000014	Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here.
0TO3000015	So... what do you say, brain? Join me for some more wild adventures?
0TO3000016	If the Think Tank won't hold up their bargain, we'll make them. Let's go.
0TO3000017	Don't you want to be reunited? I thought you'd be happy to get back into my head!
0TO3000018	Here, take whatever you want.
0TO3000019	Sorry, I don't have any.
0TO3000020	What function do you serve?
0TO3000021	What are you, some kind of novelty talking light switch?
0TO3000022	I'll handle the brains. You stay here - you'll be more useful outside my head.
0TO3000023	Fine, you can stay here. Not like I need this hassle.
0TO3000024	Maybe I have been a little unfair. If you want to stay here, I'll let you.
0TO3000025	I saw another light switch in the other room. Do you control that one too?
0TO3000026	The more you speak... something's... technical about the way you're squawking at me.
0TO3000027	Wait, after listening a bit - that's RobCo termlink protocol you're broadcasting, right?
0TO3000028	There's a... pattern to your speech or something.
0TO3000029	You're emitting characters in patterns of 8, bracketed, with tone adjustment at the end.
0TO3000030	Calm down. I don't plan on hacking your voice module this time.
0TO3000031	Good to see you, too, 8. Any new discoveries today?
0TO3000032	Blindly operate on any poor animals recently?
0TO3000033	Helped any animals discover their genetic potential recently?
0TO3000034	I encountered your "pet" in X-8.
0TO3000035	I encountered your "pet" in X-8 and had to kill it.
0TO3000036	It seems to me you have more... biological needs than your counterparts.
0TO3000038	You seem... to... be looking at me a lot.
0TO3000039	I can't help but notice your... fascination with the human body.
0TO3000041	My seed? I think you've got your biology mixed up.
0TO3000042	My brain told me the Think Tank needs to be stopped. Can you help?
0TO3000043	I need my brain back.
0TO3000044	I have a real teddy bear, if you want it.
0TO3000045	Do you know how I can stop the Think Tank?
0TO3000046	Can I have a Mentat?
0TO3000047	A good hit with a hammer might fix your monitor.
0TO3000048	I can't fix your monitor, but if you're getting ghost reception, I can fix that.
0TO3000049	I heard you and 8 were attacked by previous visitors.
0TO3000051	Your voice module got damaged, I heard. In an attack.
0TO3000052	Uh... if you're speaking that code stuff, I can hack you, right?
0TO3000053	If that's RobCo termlink protocol, doesn't that mean it can be hacked?
0TO3000054	Is this Gabe's bowl? Your dog from X-8, Gabe?
0TO3000055	Does this dog bowl look familiar?
0TO3000056	<Display middle finger.>
0TO3000057	<Hold up one finger, point at self. Point at them, hold up five fingers.>
0TO3000058	So... "O," got any amazing discoveries to share?
0TO3000059	I want to talk to you about your name.
0TO3000060	So... "Zero," got any amazing discoveries to share?
0TO3000061	Your damaged voice module... can you tell me about the attack?
0TO3000062	Who are you - what do you do here?
0TO3000063	Dr. Mobius' message - can you replay it?
0TO3000064	I want to know more about Mobius and the Forbidden Zone.
0TO3000066	<Blink slowly with a blank expression.>
0TO3000067	<Wave hands and nod.>
0TO3000068	Tell me about this "Radar Fence" around the Crater.
0TO3000069	Why does Klein want these particular technologies?
0TO3000070	Listen, I want to know how I got here... and how I get home.
0TO3000071	If you lobotomized the Think Tank, why terrorize them?
0TO3000072	I don't understand why you sent the threats - and the Robo-Scorpion army - against the Think Tank.
0TO3000073	Wait... sounds like you built the Robo-Scorpions, issued threats to keep the Think Tank occupied.
0TO3000074	Can you tell me about the Big Empty?
0TO3000075	Can you tell me about the Big Em... uh, Big Mountain?
0TO3000076	Who are you? What do you do here?
0TO3000077	Why did you steal my brain?
0TO3000078	Why did you remove my brain? And... how?
0TO3000079	I'm seconds away from smashing your monitors.
0TO3000080	I was curious about some things.
0TO3000081	I heard one of the previous visitors to the Dome spoke to you, asked you some questions.
0TO3000082	I was interested in hearing more about the... science... the others... do. Here.
0TO3000083	I'd be honored if I could hear any knowledge the Think Tank had to share on the sciences.
0TO3000084	I found a backup copy of your... pencil processor.
0TO3000085	I wanted to know more about the Think Tank.
0TO3000086	You all seem knowledgeable in your fields. No doubt there's much you can share with me.
0TO3000087	Go wait by the entrance. Good dog.
0TO3000088	You seem like the one in charge. You are...?
0TO3000089	I'm okay. Talk to you later.
0TO3000090	Nice. This should be enough.
0TO3000091	So these will work in the Sonic Emitter?
0TO3000092	Uh... these have been sterilized, too, right?
0TO3000093	I'd rather have a good old-fashioned gun.
0TO3000094	This sonic gun looks like an energy projectile. Got anything that spits lead?
0TO3000095	I could use some more... energy... stuff.
0TO3000096	Energy Cells have a high expenditure rate. Some extra reserve cells could offset that.
0TO3000097	So genius, what now?
0TO3000098	Do these technologies have the information you need?
0TO3000099	All right, glad that you received the schematics.
0TO3000100	Your answer isn't filling me with confidence.
0TO3000102	"Yes..." what?
0TO3000103	Do you even know what these technologies do?
0TO3000104	Why did you have me get them if you don't know how they would help?
0TO3000105	I'm going to advance my boot into your voice module if you don't give me some solid data.
0TO3000106	Maybe the new frequency for the Sonic Emitter can blast open the Forbidden Zone door lock, or...?
0TO3000107	Maybe the frequency in the Sonic Emitter's a sonic key of sorts? Like an electronic lockpick?
0TO3000108	Think the X-13 sneaky suit can slip in and get to Mobius?
0TO3000109	Would the suit's dampening abilities allow me to sneak into the Forbidden Zone?
0TO3000110	The antenna looks like it could break things beyond repair. Maybe it could break in?
0TO3000111	The antenna, any chance it was damaged, or broke the X-2 array once removed?
0TO3000112	I'll let you think it over, then.
0TO3000113	These devices all seem very scientific. Very.
0TO3000114	Look, the antenna focuses brainwave patterns, right?
0TO3000115	And the suit's a cardiac regulator, and the sonic frequency is a spinal vibrator?
0TO3000116	Yes?
0TO3000117	...I'm waiting for you to draw a conclusion.
0TO3000118	Do you remember what other biological effects the other items had?
0TO3000119	You may have noticed the pacification field is down. Guess what happens now?
0TO3000120	Do you think I killed Mobius?
0TO3000121	Mobius and I talked it over, reached an understanding.
0TO3000122	I can't let you dissect the Mojave. Or let you leave.
0TO3000123	Mobius and I... we... formed an alliance. Sort of.
0TO3000124	<Lie> You think I am the Lobotomite...? No, for my skull houses the BRAIN OF MOBIUS!
0TO3000125	There's plenty of medical ways to pull off that... stunt.
0TO3000126	COUNTLESS brain extraction surgeries exist... but only one IMPLANTATION one - from MOBIUS!
0TO3000127	Science provided a way, Klein.
0TO3000128	Nothing is unpossible for SCIENCE! Mesons, lasers, atoms, brainwaves... all are at MY command!
0TO3000129	<Lie> Do you think I killed Mobius? No, he lives.
0TO3000130	He offers a deal - stay here, stay put, and he'll let you live.
0TO3000131	Are you willing to risk it?
0TO3000132	You FOOLS had best listen. Or MOBIUS will bring his army here, to sting you STUPID.
0TO3000133	You can still do that... here, quietly, for me.
0TO3000134	I can bring the Mojave, this world to you. You'll be safe, and you'll still be able to experiment.
0TO3000136	Is this gun all? Uh, can't have enough guns, really.
0TO3000137	Um, this gun looks really hungry. I'd like to make sure it gets fed lots of bullets.
0TO3000138	I'm listening, let's hear it.
0TO3000139	Just spit it out before you bore me to death.
0TO3000140	So just plug it into the circular map-thing in the Sink upstairs?
0TO3000141	All right, having a store available would be helpful... it has a store connection right?
0TO3000142	Just one of these chips, huh? Guess they're rare.
0TO3000143	This chip looks like it was mass-produced. Are there other chips?
0TO3000144	So I just go back upstairs and to the main circular console?
0TO3000145	I have some questions about this "brain extraction" you all performed.
0TO3000146	You said before that Mobius might have my brain?
0TO3000147	Why would Mobius want my brain?
0TO3000149	So I go after him, then?
0TO3000150	Then there's no time to waste.
0TO3000151	That's actually not the conclusion I would have drawn.
0TO3000152	Don't these items seem more... biologically-focused than that, though?
0TO3000153	These technologies seem more useful... medically, somehow.
0TO3000154	The cardiac, spinal, and brainwave aspects of this tech... couldn't they heal me?
0TO3000155	What was the plan you had?
0TO3000156	Well, I don't want to keep them out of trouble, I want to kill them.
0TO3000157	Any tactics I could use to attack the Think Tank?
0TO3000158	Everything you've told me doesn't add up... your plan, even your name, "Mobius."
0TO3000159	Sounds like you forgot your master plan - surprised you remember your own name.
0TO3000160	So... you reprogrammed yourself?
0TO3000161	You reprogrammed their names as part of recursion loop? What, to trap their processors?
0TO3000162	Why did you trap them?
0TO3000163	So all this insanity is because of you?
0TO3000164	A recursion loop is designed to prevent the flow of information. So...
0TO3000165	So that's why they have all those stupid names?
0TO3000166	Klein... Mobius... O's a circle... 8's an infinity symbol... they're all loops, I get it.
0TO3000167	Keep going, I want to hear the rest of this.
0TO3000168	Anything I could do to stop them that doesn't require violence?
0TO3000169	I'd really, really like to kill them.
0TO3000170	Any suggestions for how to make them change their minds?
0TO3000171	I'd like to make the effort.
0TO3000172	Scare them? How?
0TO3000174	That's kind of an asshole thing to do to your friends.
0TO3000175	Ouro-bor-ous? What the hell does that mean?
0TO3000176	Minor detail, but a snake devouring its own tail is "Ouro-borus," not "Ouro-borous."
0TO3000177	But there must have been other signs of a larger world.
0TO3000178	There were other visitors, though. Why am I different?
0TO3000179	Are you blaming me for this?
0TO3000181	The bullet that went into my brain? Doc Mitchell tried to patch me up, but...
0TO3000182	What, some kind of medical condition?
0TO3000183	A cranial injury. From the attack outside Goodsprings.
0TO3000184	So you set your threats on a loop to keep them occupied?
0TO3000185	Do you know anything about the other visitors?
0TO3000187	I don't understand why they wanted me to gather the technologies.
0TO3000188	Klein said they had the idea to get the three technologies after your broadcast. Coincidence?
0TO3000189	What is the purpose of the technologies?
0TO3000190	But the Think Tank downloaded the schematics, not the items. They can rebuild them.
0TO3000191	Was there any other data transmitted in your threat broadcast?
0TO3000192	If you don't get to the point, I'm going to start shooting.
0TO3000193	The only "wrinkle" is the one that bullet made going into my brainpan.
0TO3000196	I see. Well, I have questions for you.
0TO3000197	Is there any way to remove the pacification field in here?
0TO3000198	Why did you say "three minus one" subjects before?
0TO3000199	But how am I still talking and walking around?
0TO3000200	This makes no sense. How is this even possible?
0TO3000201	I feel strange in here, peaceful, but on edge.
0TO3000202	Is there any way to shut it off?
0TO3000203	You don't seem to have a grasp on your own research.
0TO3000204	Why have you leveled this place?
0TO3000205	All right... when did you create Cazadores?
0TO3000206	So Nightstalkers were created for what purpose, then?
0TO3000207	Give me a single, concrete fact. One. Fact.
0TO3000208	I saw the expanse from the balcony - you've made a mess of this landscape.
0TO3000209	This crater looks like it's been tag-teamed by giant fuckbots.
0TO3000210	Test cities?
0TO3000211	What was this explosion?
0TO3000212	That fence doesn't make much sense to me.
0TO3000213	So I get my brain back, I can leave.
0TO3000214	Wait a minute - that means you're trapped here?
0TO3000215	Don't you want to leave here?
0TO3000216	But there's a whole world beyond this place.
0TO3000217	Evidence to the contrary?
0TO3000218	Doesn't that prove you're wrong?
0TO3000228	What's your purpose here?
0TO3000229	Do you play music?
0TO3000230	You seem pretty laid-back for an engine of destruction.
0TO3000231	Can you do anything like that for me?
0TO3000233	What were the results?
0TO3000234	Is that anything like what the other light switch is working on?
0TO3000235	I had some more questions.
0TO3000236	And what did you find out?
0TO3000238	Sounds like there's some bad blood between you. Or, um, circuits.
0TO3000239	I don't know, smart lights could be useful.
0TO3000240	Okay then. Forget I said anything.
0TO3000241	Calm down, I don't have a thing for the light switch.
0TO3000242	What can I say, she and I just... click.
0TO3000243	That sounds like what the other light switch was working on.
0TO3000244	I found a holotape to upgrade you.
0TO3000245	I need my equipment repaired.
0TO3000247	If there's nothing more, I need to stop Mobius.
0TO3000248	So I can't leave?
0TO3000249	There's a perimeter?
0TO3000250	That sounds suspiciously like I can't leave.
0TO3000251	Why can't you go out there and shut them down?
0TO3000252	Uh... thanks.
0TO3000253	This thing is pretty cool. It's got a little soundwave thing on the back!
0TO3000254	What were you saying about force field disruption?
0TO3000255	Oh, I'll be sure not to tamper with anything, I promise.
0TO3000256	I'll go get these technological wonders and see how much damage I can do.
0TO3000258	If you have the gun already, I don't understand what you need.
0TO3000259	If there's a weapon you can give me, hand it over, I'll put it to good use.
0TO3000260	For the love of... Please. Stop. Fighting.
0TO3000261	Wait... so this gun you gave me can disable Force Fields?
0TO3000262	This can only work on fields here in the crater?
0TO3000263	I could care less about all of this. Can I go?
0TO3000264	Why are you such a dick?
0TO3000265	Listen, you're my brain, so you'd better be more respectful!
0TO3000266	Actually, yes. I would love a cookie.
0TO3000267	Why does my brain sound so... masculine?
0TO3000268	How the hell did Mobius get hold of my brain?
0TO3000269	Cool! I can talk to my own brain! Can my heart and spine talk, too?
0TO3000270	Of course you're responsible! You're my brain!
0TO3000271	Oh come on, that stuff's fun!
0TO3000272	I didn't realize it caused you so much distress.
0TO3000273	We'll revisit this topic later.
0TO3000274	I could smash this tank you're in. How about that?
0TO3000275	Once you're back in my head, I'll watch television. Lots. And lots. Of television.
0TO3000276	Fine, never mind.
0TO3000277	Don't tempt me, brain.
0TO3000278	I would. And I'd follow it up with an alcohol-and-ant-nectar cocktail every night.
0TO3000279	Maybe not, but it got your attention, didn't it?
0TO3000281	I don't recall giving you a choice. Let's go.
0TO3000282	What's it going to take to convince you?
0TO3000283	Come on, we have a duty to the Wasteland, we have to get out of here!
0TO3000284	I'm not spending the rest of my life here when there's a whole world to loot.
0TO3000285	Hold that thought, we'll come back to it.
0TO3000286	Why? They promised to put us back together once I did what they wanted.
0TO3000287	Then let's go make them share. Come on, brain, it's stomping time!
0TO3000288	How did he manage that?
0TO3000289	Hmm. Let me think about this.
0TO3000290	That seems like a pretty unlikely coincidence.
0TO3000291	Well, that answers that. On to something else.
0TO3000292	You talk a lot of science, brain, but you don't make a lot of sense.
0TO3000293	Well, you don't have a mouth, but you can talk. Explain that, smarty-pants!
0TO3000294	Uh, brain? You seem... awful smart all of a sudden.
0TO3000295	All this smart-talk is hurting my head. Please stop it.
0TO3000296	What about my spine?
0TO3000297	But you're the source of most of those glands. Unless you're arguing that my thyroid is to blame.
0TO3000298	That doesn't seem quite right...
0TO3000299	Admit it. You're just as glandular as I am.
0TO3000300	What's so bad about letting the brains get out? They don't seem that terrible.
0TO3000301	You're part of me. I know you don't want to let that happen any more than I do.
0TO3000302	Come on! We have to stop them! And stuff!
0TO3000303	That's going to be a problem. Until they fix me, I can't leave Big Mountain either.
0TO3000304	Are you really saying you'd let the Think Tank outwit us?
0TO3000305	I'm going to give them a demonstration of the physics behind small, fast-moving chunks of lead.
0TO3000306	I'm going to introduce them to a world of pain. Bullet pain.
0TO3000307	I'm going to show them what's really the brightest thing in the room.
0TO3000308	We've got lasers, right? I thought we'd use lasers.
0TO3000309	Ever had a squirrel brain omelet? That, but on a bigger scale. And with bombs.
0TO3000310	I think bombs? Yeah, maybe bombs.
0TO3000311	The brains have forgotten the little things. Things like sharp blades and heavy chunks of steel.
0TO3000312	I thought since they like lasers so much, I'd surprise them. With a club or something.
0TO3000313	I'm going to show them even a video screen can get a black eye.
0TO3000314	I sort of thought I'd just start punching things and see where that gets me.
0TO3000315	Let's just say violence is the last resort of the civilized man, and I'm feeling mighty uncivilized.
0TO3000316	There's no need to be sarcastic. Meeting your own brain is a slightly odd event.
0TO3000317	Yes. Because running around a crater full of bizarre science experiments, hygiene is a top priority.
0TO3000318	I've been busy.
0TO3000319	What about you? That tank isn't exactly looking springtime fresh.
0TO3000320	But what about the good things? What about a cool breeze on your cheek, the smell of food... love?
0TO3000321	But what about the good things? What about crushing those who oppose you, the smell of fire... loot?
0TO3000322	I can see your point. What can I do to make this a fair compromise?
0TO3000323	Too bad. I've got arms, you don't. You're coming with me.
0TO3000324	Come on, you're my brain and I'm your body. This is meant to be, baby!
0TO3000326	I promise I'll take better care of myself.
0TO3000327	<Lie> I promise I'll take better care of myself.
0TO3000330	Isn't it just as true that you only feel this way because you're lacking those hormones?
0TO3000331	You can't really believe that.
0TO3000332	So, we're at an impasse. You can't feel what I feel, and I can't think the way you think.
0TO3000333	Yeah, bet you didn't think of that, huh?
0TO3000334	Look what happened to the Think Tank. Do you want to end up like them after a few hundred years?
0TO3000335	I think we have to trust each other and acknowledge that we aren't complete if we're separated.
0TO3000336	Well... maybe we could keep going like this. What do you think?
0TO3000337	I don't know. I have to think about this some more.
0TO3000338	So, what, you'd rather just stay here? Never leaving that tank of... whatever that stuff is?
0TO3000339	Well, if you like being stuck in there so much, maybe I'll just leave you.
0TO3000340	What would happen to me if I left you here?
0TO3000341	Why did you never say anything about how you felt before?
0TO3000342	And if I put you back?
0TO3000343	Then surely you've taken into account the corrosive effects of long-term exposure to biogel.
0TO3000344	You really think you're smarter than the Think Tank and Dr. Mobius combined?
0TO3000345	I suppose I'll go back to the Think Tank and get them to let me out. They promised to do that much.
0TO3000346	Maybe I'll explore the Big Mountain more before I go back to the Think Tank.
0TO3000347	Okay, then. I'm going.
0TO3000348	I will!
0TO3000349	I've changed my mind. I want you back in my skull after all.
0TO3000350	I've thought it over, and I want you back in my head. We're both stronger together.
0TO3000351	Great!
0TO3000352	This is ridiculous. I can't leave my brain here to rot.
0TO3000353	Well... so long, then. I'm going back to the Think Tank. They promised to let me out.
0TO3000354	I'm sure. In you go.
0TO3000356	I think I need to think about it some more.
0TO3000358	I found that upgrade disk you were looking for.
0TO3000359	I found you some upgrade disks.
0TO3000360	I lost my Sonic Emitter. Can you make me a new one?
0TO3000361	I found a holotape to upgrade you. <REMOVE>
0TO3000363	Guess I better get walking, then.
0TO3000364	Doesn't sound like my style. Maybe I'll do a little exploring.
0TO3000365	Then can you help me get this done as quickly as possible? Sounds like a lot of walking.
0TO3000366	Pylons? What pylons?
0TO3000367	Uh... great. I don't want to hear anymore about that.
0TO3000368	Can you please hurry? I've got a schedule.
0TO3000369	Forget this. Where's the exit?
0TO3000370	The faster I can get through this, the better.
0TO3000371	Trust me, I want to get this over with as quickly as possible.
0TO3000372	What if I take my time, explore the crater?
0TO3000373	Can you tell me more about these pylons?
0TO3000374	This whole place sounds dangerous. These devices sound dangerous.
0TO3000375	Is that better?
0TO3000377	I'll save it for later.
0TO3000378	I don't know, I'm tripping pretty hard right now.
0TO3000379	I'll save it, don't want to mix it with alcohol if I can help it.
0TO3000380	What minions?
0TO3000381	I'll trash them like I did your giant piece of junk downstairs.
0TO3000382	Whichever way you want to be killed is fine with me.
0TO3000383	You aren't exactly what I was expecting.
0TO3000384	Exactly. I want my brain so I can leave.
0TO3000385	Why is that a problem?
0TO3000386	But I want to leave.
0TO3000387	Can you tell me about your Robo-Scorpions?
0TO3000388	You don't seem aggressive. Why broadcast threats to the Think Tank?
0TO3000390	Hi there, puppy.
0TO3000391	Come with me, girl.
0TO3000392	Why the hell are you just standing there?
0TO3000393	So move.
0TO3000394	I made you. You stick with me. Got it?
0TO3000395	What are you doing, dog?
0TO3000396	Go wait somewhere else.
0TO3000397	Okay. Heel.
0TO3000400	I found a backup file for your corroded module.
0TO3000401	I want to recalibrate the Sonic Emitter.
0TO3000410	I think you mean "impossible."
0TO3000411	I wanted to talk to you.
0TO3000412	What, my Pip-Boy?
0TO3000413	Some problem with RobCo?
0TO3000414	Agenda? I don't have any agenda, not with RobCo, anyway.
0TO3000415	Calm down. Just wanted to ask some questions.
0TO3000417	Do you have another name?
0TO3000418	Tell me about Mobius and these monsters of his.
0TO3000419	Can you tell me about this facility?
0TO3000420	A Giant Robot Scorpion?
0TO3000422	I found a soundwave file for you.
0TO3000424	You said something about needing technologies to stop Mobius?
0TO3000425	First, you scoop out my brain, now you want me to save you?!
0TO3000426	No, I'm not going to help you.
0TO3000427	Why me? Can't you do it?
0TO3000428	I'll help. What do you need me to do?
0TO3000429	"No?" Why not?
0TO3000430	Forget this, I'm not going to help you.
0TO3000431	I can say "no," and I'll do it again. I'm leaving.
0TO3000432	What makes you so sure Mobius has my brain?
0TO3000433	How the hell am I even talking to you right now?
0TO3000434	That does it, forget this. I'm not helping you until I get my brain back.
0TO3000435	What are these technologies?
0TO3000436	I'll head out, then, and be back with these... things.
0TO3000438	That doesn't sound impressive - breaking machines, that is.
0TO3000440	Who were the others?
0TO3000442	Animal? Did you just call me an animal?
0TO3000443	Do you always get this dramatic?
0TO3000444	Calm down. I just had some questions.
0TO3000445	You are responsible for Cazadores?
0TO3000446	Nightstalkers? Those crazy coyote-snake... things?
0TO3000447	Contained at Big Mountain? Those things are all over the Mojave!
0TO3000448	What makes you think they haven't escaped?
0TO3000449	I don't think they're sterile, they breed, all right.
0TO3000451	No, that's all right, trust me.
0TO3000452	Go ahead, you might make me more fertile or impregnate me.
0TO3000453	How are you all speaking through that one voice box?
0TO3000454	I... was at a theater, then... I was here. What is this place?
0TO3000455	Are you the ones who performed this surgery on me?
0TO3000457	I wake up here, all cut apart, and I want some answers.
0TO3000458	Lobotomite?
0TO3000459	Yes. I'm guessing that crashed satellite was yours?
0TO3000460	Who are you all, and what is this place?
0TO3000461	Why do I feel... passive? I should be angry - real angry, and I'm not.
0TO3000462	Who is Dr. Mobius?
0TO3000463	Why do I have this strange... passive sensation in here?
0TO3000465	I'd like to know about the Forbidden Zone.
0TO3000466	Why the anti-aggression programming?
0TO3000467	But I like to fight.
0TO3000468	Who were these visitors?
0TO3000469	I've heard this place called the "Big Empty."
0TO3000471	Talking about things bothering you, well, might help or something.
0TO3000472	Are you sure? I'm a good listener. Got the ears for it.
0TO3000473	I don't get it. What, they thought your letter was a number?
0TO3000474	If they kept confusing the letter with a number, your name is Dr. 0... Dr. Zero?
0TO3000475	I don't know. "O" sounds more impressive.
0TO3000476	That's... not much of an improvement.
0TO3000477	All right, so you want me to call you Zero, or...?
0TO3000478	Well, Zero and "O" do look a lot alike, there's no way to tell a difference.
0TO3000479	If you wanted to differentiate the "0" and "O," just put a slash through the zero.
0TO3000480	"Zero." Draw a slash through it.
0TO3000481	It's standard termlink code to distinguish the two.
0TO3000482	Are you seriously confused by this, or are you messing with me?
0TO3000483	And that's what makes you truly a zero.
0TO3000484	So is that what you want to be?
0TO3000485	Or you may want to stick with "O." As in, the "Oh!" of discovery.
0TO3000486	Well, there's power in zero. It reduces anything multiplied against it - to zero.
0TO3000487	Maybe you should dispense with the names and focus on the accomplishments.
0TO3000488	I have no idea how you incompetents survived this long.
0TO3000491	It looks like junk.
0TO3000492	This scrap metal is supposed to be something?
0TO3000493	It certainly is... interesting. Whatever it once was.
0TO3000494	What did you and Klein say before about the Central Intelligence Unit barter functions?
0TO3000495	I'm going to need something to debug the Central Intelligence barter routines.
0TO3000496	I need more of those worthless caps to test the CIU barter functions upstairs.
0TO3000497	Well, you don't need to worry about Mr. House anymore.
0TO3000498	I don't think I'll worry you by telling you what House and his robots have been up to since.
0TO3000499	Heh-heh, nice pun on the header file ref.
0TO3000500	Well, the code's got some problems, I'm not arguing that.
0TO3000501	Uh... I just realized I'm understanding you.
0TO3000502	Well, all life is patterns, you just got to let the unconscious process them.
0TO3000503	Not to brag, but I was always more perceptive than everyone else.
0TO3000504	So your broadcast pattern is RobCo termlink, but not by choice.
0TO3000505	No, no, I understand it's hard to learn a new language.
0TO3000506	I agree. If someone would take the time, you're more than just sound effects in a tank.
0TO3000507	Um, about when I first arrived. Tell me you didn't sonjaculate into the... my... Sonic Emitter.
0TO3000508	How did you fire up the Sonic Emitter when I arrived again?
0TO3000509	Well, there had to be some other way to fire it up. Can we at least talk it over next time?
0TO3000510	Nothing to be embarrassed about, it's just that it's best to keep that stuff private, you know?
0TO3000511	I usually just take a fusion cell and oscillate its charge, vibrates for like, an hour.
0TO3000512	Usually, I can find some Cram lying around. Put some duct tape around the lid, good to go.
0TO3000513	The less said about it, the better. Let's move on and forget about it.
0TO3000514	If that's termlink code, don't worry, I'm not going to take advantage of your exposed code.
0TO3000515	It'll only take a second to violate your rights and make your voice mine.
0TO3000516	Not a problem. I know what it's like to be experimented on.
0TO3000517	All right, all right, quit your grinning, you idiot.
0TO3000518	Look, don't make me regret this.
0TO3000519	All right. Let's see what you have. I'll take these Energy Cells...
0TO3000520	And some Microfusion Cells...
0TO3000521	Now, unlock your room, I want what's in there.
0TO3000522	And lastly, if I ever need you to blindly agree with me, you will. Understood?
0TO3000523	I know it won't work on attack protocols. Still, I may need someone on my side in a debate.
0TO3000524	You don't really have a choice. And thanks for the gear.
0TO3000525	I didn't catch that. Maybe part of the damage?
0TO3000526	Not... sure. What you meant.
0TO3000527	This is a waste of time, forget it.
0TO3000528	So one of the visitors didn't damage it - he reprogrammed it.
0TO3000529	And that took control of the trains? Before you all shut it down.
0TO3000530	No wonder you're all skittish.
0TO3000531	Like, uh, I would ever hurt you.
0TO3000532	I know what it means to be attacked without warning, trust me, 8.
0TO3000533	Now that we know each other better, can you tell me about the Sonic Emitter?
0TO3000534	Really? Huh.
0TO3000535	All right, all right. Don't get all sympathetic and mushy.
0TO3000536	Fine, fine. Can we move on?
0TO3000537	Um... all right.
0TO3000538	You didn't sound too convinced there.
0TO3000539	Yeah, I understood that part already.
0TO3000540	Well "projecto" is kind of evident. "Emitter" works better.
0TO3000541	Higgs' Village? Can you point it out on my Pip-Boy?
0TO3000542	No, I've been there. Higgs Village, right? Your house is there?
0TO3000543	That sounds interesting. Sure, directions would be nice.
0TO3000544	Well, I didn't rob your place, but it's this big hangar in the middle of the Crater, so...
0TO3000545	So your house is there?
0TO3000546	Well, what - you want me to rob your place?
0TO3000547	So there's an emitter code in your house in Higgs?
0TO3000548	Oh, two codes. One for the jukebox, and one for the opera. Nice. I'll keep an eye out.
0TO3000549	You know... sonjaculate.
0TO3000550	Wait, how many? One... or...?
0TO3000551	Fan of the opera, huh? All right - the jukebox is installed in the Sink, got it.
0TO3000552	No, I got it all down, thanks.
0TO3000553	I may have already picked up both, I grab almost anything that's not nailed down.
0TO3000554	I got the Emitter fully upgraded.
0TO3000555	I'm happy, too. Can't let this thing gather dust.
0TO3000556	It's a little slow to fire, but the force field disabling frequency is handy.
0TO3000557	Too bad the force field disruption only works here.
0TO3000558	Are you okay? You look... really happy.
0TO3000559	You're kind of creeping me out.
0TO3000560	Something wrong? Your monitors are getting all fuzzy.
0TO3000561	You should be proud. It's a nice device.
0TO3000562	All right, all right, don't get too pleased to see it working at full capacity.
0TO3000563	Please don't make me spell it out.
0TO3000564	Oh... hey, thanks. Don't want it to run out, you're right.
0TO3000565	Great. More energy cells. Just what I need.
0TO3000566	I mean, literally, got anything to help pass the time?
0TO3000567	Um... maybe it's like a memory or something?
0TO3000568	Sounds like Gabe really loved you.
0TO3000569	Well, it seems to me it belongs to a friend of yours.
0TO3000571	It sounds to me like you hurt someone who loved you very much.
0TO3000572	It's nothing to be ashamed of. Gabe knew his place - as a specimen.
0TO3000573	Hope you think on what you've done.
0TO3000574	<Close eyelids, breathe deeply, then stretch languidly.>
0TO3000575	<Turn and cough roughly, then slowly scratch nose.>
0TO3000576	<Run your hands along the sides of your face, then exhale rapidly.>
0TO3000577	Why don't you just give in? There's nothing wrong with looking at the human body.
0TO3000578	You all are a bunch of hypocrites. Claiming superiority, but you miss being human, admit it.
0TO3000579	I could come back any time and just breathe, if you want.
0TO3000580	I'll tell the others if you don't make it worth my while.
0TO3000581	I'm actually here for a... breather.
0TO3000582	A looping gesture of extortion, maybe. Hand over the goods.
0TO3000583	Well, I thought you liked them. You keep referring to them.
0TO3000584	Are you sure your words aren't jumbled?
0TO3000585	You are totally confusing me right now.
0TO3000586	Um... so you confuse toy bears with... humans?
0TO3000587	Oh, I get it - you like "playing" with humans, do you? Watching them move? Blink?
0TO3000588	You know, we've been down this road already. Moving on.
0TO3000589	Mugs? Why do you want mugs?
0TO3000591	You seem really obsessed with mugs.
0TO3000592	What do you do with the mugs?
0TO3000594	Can you do anything else?
0TO3000595	I'm ready, let's do it.
0TO3000596	I'm feeling a little unwell in the head. Can you perform a psychiatric evaluation on me?
0TO3000597	On second thought, not now.
0TO3000598	So you make blank books? What's the point of that?
0TO3000599	But those books are our last legacy of the time before! You can't destroy them!
0TO3000600	Blank books, huh? Yeah, I think I can find a use for those.
0TO3000602	Can you do anything besides processing books?
0TO3000603	I'd enjoy that.
0TO3000604	Why wait? I can talk about theorems right now.
0TO3000605	Maybe. I'll let you know.
0TO3000606	Only the sexy ones.
0TO3000607	Never. I'm all yours, baby.
0TO3000608	You're right. I do.
0TO3000609	"Sir?" You are aware that I'm a woman, right?
0TO3000610	Are you some kind of Artificial Intelligence?
0TO3000611	What services do you provide?
0TO3000612	Why are there so many personality modules?
0TO3000613	You mean there are other... personality modules here?
0TO3000615	So I can access their functions without loading the personality holotapes?
0TO3000616	Never mind, let me ask you something else.
0TO3000617	I'd like to buy some things.
0TO3000618	Switch on the Sink's personality matrices.
0TO3000619	Switch off the Sink's personality matrices.
0TO3000620	I have some personality holotapes to install.
0TO3000621	I don't need anything else. Goodbye.
0TO3000622	Tremble? You're a toaster. How fearsome can you be?
0TO3000623	I'm almost afraid to ask what your function is.
0TO3000624	Well, I for one am quaking in my boots.
0TO3000625	Why all the rage?
0TO3000626	I'd like to change the subject.
0TO3000627	So you murder toasters?
0TO3000628	What else do you do?
0TO3000629	About that Superheated Saturnite Power Fist...
0TO3000630	You mean like this one?
0TO3000631	I'll keep an eye out for any Saturnite Power Fists then.
0TO3000632	You know the world already burned in nuclear fire, right?
0TO3000633	Give it up. I have more important things to ask you about.
0TO3000634	Yes. A couple centuries ago, in fact.
0TO3000635	<Lie> No, I'm just kidding. Keep living the dream.
0TO3000636	But I hurt all over!
0TO3000637	That doesn't explain the laser-sutures on my chest... and on my spine.
0TO3000638	Why am I all cut up? I feel like some kid was playing with my insides.
0TO3000639	How much surgery did you do on me? I feel like a badly-put-together jigsaw puzzle.
0TO3000640	You removed my brain?
0TO3000641	Lobtomizing? You lobotomized me?
0TO3000642	Is that why I feel so odd - and heavy?
0TO3000643	He... er, I, offer a DEAL. Stay HERE. Stay PUT, and he'll... I'll let you LIVE.
0TO3000644	If you don't tell me what I need to find, I can't help you, all right?
0TO3000646	Um... before I go "reclaim" this tech, are you sure your plan will work?
0TO3000647	What exactly is the plan? You're losing me in the generalities, I need specifics.
0TO3000648	Did you say "barter?"
0TO3000649	I can trade with the Sink Intelligence? Then I'll need something to activate that function, won't I?
0TO3000650	I have some questions for you first.
0TO3000651	You said... "surge" code? You mean like computer stuff in the Doc?
0TO3000652	What's this Auto-Doc surgery code you mentioned?
0TO3000653	So the Comp-Doc does... what Mobius would do if he was here, chopping me up?
0TO3000654	Mobius set up the Auto-Doc medical routines, so you think he's responsible for the post-organ-dump?
0TO3000655	My brain would know?
0TO3000657	Come on. Brains can't talk... well, most brains.
0TO3000658	Wait... the metal scorpions can sting you stupid?
0TO3000659	These mechanical Robo-Scorpions "consume" intelligence? Are you certain of your findings?
0TO3000660	I don't understand how poisons can dumbify you.
0TO3000661	Robo-Scorpions drain intelligence from living creatures - how? Chems?
0TO3000662	Sounds to me like your math is wrong - and the odds aren't good.
0TO3000663	It's not a democracy, it's a research facility. And over half your colleagues dispute your findings.
0TO3000664	I do. Here's the deal. I'm not going to surrender - you are.
0TO3000665	Maybe you should confer with your colleagues first.
0TO3000666	I will PERMIT you to do this. For ME.
0TO3000667	You took out my brain, heart, and spine?
0TO3000668	If you ripped out my brain, where the hell is it?
0TO3000669	You extracted my brain... but what do you mean, "misplaced" it?
0TO3000670	Um... excuse me, do you have any more?
0TO3000671	This amount clearly represents a deficiency in the amount of caps needed.
0TO3000672	Still feels a little light. Might need a little more.
0TO3000673	I'd hate to come back and ask for more. A little extra would guarantee you're not disturbed.
0TO3000674	The ton of things sounds good.
0TO3000675	Hold on, let's be logical about this. I don't need a ton, just as much as I can carry in trade.
0TO3000676	So if I don't get my brain back in my head, I can't leave, ever?
0TO3000677	Fine, you've got a deal.
0TO3000680	You're Doctor O, correct?
0TO3000681	Uh... what was that?
0TO3000682	Can you speak? Do you understand me?
0TO3000683	I have no idea what you're saying right now.
0TO3000684	Did something happen with your voice module?
0TO3000685	Blasting me with static-y clicks isn't helpful.
0TO3000686	That... uh... is too bad. Or good. Or something.
0TO3000688	Do you know anything about Dr. Mobius or the Forbidden Zone?
0TO3000689	Is... that a yes? Or a no? Or... a yes-no?
0TO3000690	You better not be cussing me out right now.
0TO3000691	I'm pretty sure you can understand me, and I want some answers.
0TO3000692	Can you tell me about these technologies Klein wants?
0TO3000693	Tell me about the Big Empty.
0TO3000694	Tell me about the Big Empty... uh, Big Mountain, that is.
0TO3000695	All right, all right... just calm down. Didn't mean to alarm you.
0TO3000696	You're going to pop a monitor shaft if you keep that up.
0TO3000697	I got it already, those two names give you nightmares.
0TO3000698	You sound a little down.
0TO3000699	Are you all right? Kind of ran out of steam in the middle there.
0TO3000700	If you just said, "this place seems like a scientific loony bin," I agree.
0TO3000701	No need to get indignant, was just asking a question.
0TO3000702	Whoa, easy there... whatever you are. Brain. Jar. Thing.
0TO3000703	Would you rather I called it the Big Shithole?
0TO3000704	You sound agitated. Or you're percolating. Or something.
0TO3000705	I swear your brain... tank... thing just sparked.
0TO3000706	Knew asking you would be useless.
0TO3000707	Um... good to meet you... uh... double... circle... a... dash... whoever.
0TO3000708	Sounds important. I think.
0TO3000709	Maybe I should have asked who you used to be.
0TO3000710	I have no idea what you just said. Moreso than usual.
0TO3000711	Like I said, technical. Very technical.
0TO3000712	Forget I brought it up. Until I bring it up again.
0TO3000713	Um... yes, definitely a pattern.
0TO3000714	We'll just move on, I need time to figure this out.
0TO3000715	You really make me want to kick that voice box of yours.
0TO3000716	I'm just full of surprises.
0TO3000717	Well, I've hacked enough RobCo terminals to know.
0TO3000718	Can't get away from their code, even with voice modules, huh?
0TO3000719	Well, I just heard the rhythm in the sequence is all.
0TO3000720	I have an ear for it, I suppose.
0TO3000721	I know, I probably should put it to use counting cards.
0TO3000722	Trust me, I'll get the technologies, all right?
0TO3000723	No, haven't dealt with Mobius yet.
0TO3000724	I'll talk to Klein in a second, quit pressuring me.
0TO3000725	You're welcome, 8. It was my pleasure.
0TO3000726	Enough. I had questions.
0TO3000727	The quick Scribe jumped over the lazy Paladin?
0TO3000728	"Looping gesture of greeting?"
0TO3000729	What recursive behavior patterns are you talking about?
0TO3000730	Can you tell me about Dr. Mobius?
0TO3000731	Not exactly. I have questions I need answers to.
0TO3000732	Not right now. I have questions instead.
0TO3000733	What's "formography?"
0TO3000734	211 doctorates? How is that even possible?
0TO3000735	"First head chief researcher?" Lot of titles.
0TO3000736	I don't understand how the tech Klein wants will help.
0TO3000738	Can you tell me about the Big Empty... uh, Big Mountain?
0TO3000739	Previous test subjects?
0TO3000740	This used to be a mountain?
0TO3000741	Questions? Like what?
0TO3000742	I'm sometimes called a "Courier."
0TO3000743	There was another Courier?
0TO3000745	What was the question?
0TO3000746	What happened with the visitors?
0TO3000747	I'd like to engage your services.
0TO3000748	Can you do anything beyond healing me?
0TO3000749	I command you to open your port and receive my seed!
0TO3000751	Tell me again about what you do.
0TO3000752	So if I bring you samples of dried plant life, you can clone them and grow them in these planters?
0TO3000753	What's Salient Green?
0TO3000754	Eradicate sedition?
0TO3000755	You seem kind of worried about dirt. What's wrong?
0TO3000756	I'd just like a drink, thanks.
0TO3000757	I just came over to fill some of these empty bottles.
0TO3000770	I'm not handing my brain over... there's some things we should discuss.
0TO3000771	I think you're past due for your lobotomy, Klein.
0TO3000793	Got anything for me? Let's see.
0TO3000794	Um... got anything to help me "pass" the "time?"
0TO3000795	It's me again. I wanted to ask some questions.
0TO3000796	I wanted to ask you some @@[?-*##*-?]@@? questions.
0TO3000797	Not to cut your speech off - is there something coming in on the big monitor?
0TO3000798	I don't give a shit what you have to say. Tell me why you hauled me here. Now.
0TO3000799	I think I'm going to kill you after all.
0TO3000800	Enough. I'm here to kill you.
0TO3000801	Got to go.
0TO3000802	I don't need anything right now.
0TO3000804	Nothing right now. Goodbye.
0TO3000806	I have to go. We'll talk later.
0TO3000809	This is too weird. I'll be back later.
0TO3000811	That's all for now. Goodbye.
0TO3000812	Time for me to go. Goodbye.
0TO3000813	We've spoken enough.
0TO3000814	Never mind, we've spoken enough.
0TO3000816	I think we've spoken long enough.
0TO4000001	What was that sound you played? Some kind of memory glitch?
0TO4000002	It could be one of those robo-viruses. You might be contagious - stay away from other computers.
0TO4000003	Probably just some old data floating around in your memory. Nothing to worry about.
0TO4000004	That's an impressive multitool suite you've got. I bet I could make all sorts of stuff with that.
0TO4000005	You look like a toolbox. Can you help me make stuff?
0TO4000006	Hey, is that an ArmCo Portable Reloading Bench built into you? That'll be handy.
0TO4000007	Do you do anything with bullets? Like, maybe help people make them?
0TO4000008	ED-E? What are you doing here?
0TO4000009	What's an Eyebot doing here?
0TO4000010	Can you repair my weapon?
0TO4000011	If you switched to the 3/8 wrench and the smaller drill, those weapon repairs would be easier.
0TO4000012	Wow, you're way better at fixing weapons than me!
0TO4000013	If you drop the power output by .24, you'll be able to make more energy ammo with no quality loss.
0TO4000015	I need some Microfusion Cells. Can you make some?
0TO4000016	I'm running low on Small Energy Cells. Can you make me more?
0TO4000017	You know, if you strip out the plasma relays on those energy cells, you could make flamer fuel.
0TO4000018	Could you maybe make some energy cells that catch fire instead?
0TO4000019	Remove the safety catches on those Microfusion Cells and you could turn them into satchel charges.
0TO4000020	I want something that goes boom. Can you do that?
0TO4000021	Can you make me some flamer fuel instead of energy cells?
0TO4000022	I don't need energy cells right now - I'd like some satchel charges, ED-E.
0TO4000023	I'd like to make some ammo. Can you help me?
0TO4000024	Let me access your multitools. I want to make something.
0TO4000025	I'd like you to replay one of those audio logs.
0TO4000026	Look, we don't need to fight about this - we can talk this out, right?
0TO4000027	You brought me here to talk. If you wanted to kill me, you'd have waited until I came for the Chip.
0TO4000029	Can you tell me again what you're doing here?
0TO4000030	Dry Wells is destroyed - that was your birthplace?
0TO4000031	The Long 15 is no more. The main supply line into NCR is cut.
0TO4000032	Caesar is dead, I killed him.
0TO4000033	Caesar is dead, died on the operating table.
0TO4000034	Was hoping you could help me shape something.
0TO4000035	Is this where you're making camp?
0TO4000036	Any recipes you can teach?
0TO4000037	Any more recipes.. or histories... you can teach?
0TO4000038	Any more recipes you can teach?
0TO4000039	I got your final message.
0TO4000040	I reached Vegas, and I dealt with House.
0TO4000042	<Follow Protocol::Wait>
0TO4000043	Find anything in the dust of Hopeville?
0TO4000044	Have you been to Hopeville since the Ashton missile hit?
0TO4000045	It sounds like you know me, but I've never met you.
0TO4000046	We've never spoken before - I'd remember your voice.
0TO4000048	I have some materials I've gathered, if you wanted to take a look.
0TO4000051	No, it wasn't your boot-up sequence, it was a recording. Something about someone called RALPHIE.
0TO4000052	Yes, I'm sure I heard it. Did something knock your memory modules loose?
0TO4000053	Okay, if you don't want to tell me, just say so.
0TO4000054	I think I could use your help getting out of here. Can you come with me?
0TO4000055	That's a recording from your development - are you saying you can override electronic security?
0TO4000056	Was that the voice of your creator? What happened to him?
0TO4000057	That's fascinating. Let's keep going.
0TO4000058	Only panels with a dish-shaped receiver? The console in the main room had one of those, I think.
0TO4000059	Well, it might be enough to get us through this silo.
0TO4000060	Well, I'm sure he's fine. Wherever he is.
0TO4000061	Maybe you'll see him again someday.
0TO4000062	All right, let's keep moving.
0TO4000063	It sounds like Dr. Whitley really cared about you.
0TO4000064	Dr. Grant sounds like a war crime waiting to happen.
0TO4000065	That's a terrible story, ED-E, but we should get moving.
0TO4000066	Who the hell is "General Winters?" The recording mentioned a Colonel Autumn.
0TO4000067	RALPHIE who? You're still not making sense, ED-E.
0TO4000068	You don't have to tell me. I would have beat the crap out of her.
0TO4000069	Wow, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?
0TO4000070	Sounds like Dr. Whitley was a bit of a rogue element.
0TO4000071	Do you record everything that's said around you?
0TO4000072	I guess Whitley found a way to keep you from being scrapped. Let's keep going.
0TO4000073	So you're trying to get all the way to Navarro? Isn't that in NCR territory?
0TO4000074	Oh... right. Navarro. That... sure is far? From where you started?
0TO4000075	Whitley turned you loose all on your own? That must have been scary.
0TO4000076	Come on, we need to keep going.
0TO4000077	What was that?
0TO4000078	That sounded bad.
0TO4000079	No time to talk - I don't like the look of this place, we should keep moving.
0TO4000080	Thanks, ED-E. Let's keep going.
0TO4000081	Where did this happen?
0TO4000082	Sounds like that kid was pretty fond of you. Why did you leave?
0TO4000083	Come on, ED-E, let's go.
0TO4000084	Are you... are you saying you can stop this missile?
0TO4000085	No, ED-E, I won't let you sacrifice yourself like this. There has to be another way!
0TO4000086	Better you than me. Let's do this.
0TO4000087	Yeah, I'm beginning to see where you get it from.
0TO4000088	He should have obeyed orders. Without respect for the chain of command, the whole unit falls apart.
0TO4000089	I think I would have liked him.
0TO4000091	Really? Well, I'd better be careful what I say to you, huh?
0TO4000092	No, ED-E, I don't want to hear your recordings of "human mating calls." That's just... wrong.
0TO4000093	Yes, ED-E, I'm sure you didn't make the entire trip in one go. It's still impressive.
0TO4000094	I'm amazed you didn't break down somewhere along the way.
0TO4000095	It sounds like it wasn't easy for him, either.
0TO4000096	I bet Whitley would be proud of you for making it this far.
0TO4000097	Raiders, huh? Amateurs. I'd have tracked you down and salvaged you for scrap.
0TO4000098	You're lucky you got away from them. They would have sold you for scrap in a heartbeat.
0TO4000099	No wonder you didn't make it all the way to Navarro.
0TO4000100	Sounds like they blew out your primary stabilizing jets. I can't believe you kept going after that.
0TO4000101	That bullet probably did something bad.
0TO4000102	You gave that up to continue Whitley's mission?
0TO4000103	Was it worth it? You still haven't made it to Navarro yet.
0TO4000104	Illinois? So that's where you got that plate. The other you, I mean.
0TO4000105	Illin-what? Come on, you're making that name up.
0TO4000106	What's a Chicago?
0TO4000107	But the log said that this kind of encryption would kill you!
0TO4000108	It looks like I can still choose the missile's actual target. Maybe we can work with that.
0TO4000109	Are you sure this is the only way to stop the missile from launching?
0TO4000110	If... if you're really sure you want this, okay. Go ahead and stop the missile. And... goodbye.
0TO4000111	I don't care! I'll just change the missile's target myself. I never liked the NCR anyways.
0TO4000112	Forget it. The Legion has this coming.
0TO4000113	Slow down, slow down - what do you mean you're not the ED-E I know?
0TO4000114	You're a copy? Made by the military bases in the Divide? Weird.
0TO4000115	This silo must have some pretty advanced engineering facilities to remote-scan you and build copies.
0TO4000116	So you're some kind of... robot clone?
0TO4000117	There are more robots like you? With the same memory and everything? Interesting....
0TO4000119	Whitley was really protective of his Eyebots, huh?
0TO4000120	I can't believe they'd approve that. I've met enough robots to know they're more than just machines.
0TO4000121	Let's press on. We've got a lot of ground to cover.
0TO4000122	He sounds more like a father than an inventor in these logs.
0TO4000123	He must have tried to change things. He doesn't seem like the type to let that slide.
0TO4000124	I can see why you left that place, then.
0TO4000125	I hope those bastards got what was coming to them.
0TO4000126	Great. Maybe you'll actually be useful to me, then.
0TO4000127	Suddenly a lot of things make more sense.
0TO4000128	Is that what you're doing? Trying to find your way home?
0TO4000129	Come on, ED-E. We've got to fly far and fly fast if we want to get to the end of the Divide.
0TO4000130	Come on, ED-E. Time to move on.
0TO4000131	Yes, ED-E, I'm sure RALPHIE the Robot would be very proud of you.
0TO4000132	I'll do whatever I can to help you get home - after we deal with things here.
0TO4000133	Don't worry, I won't let any mean old generals get you.
0TO4000134	Sometimes I feel the same way. Why do you think I became a courier?
0TO4000135	What the hell happened? You just ran off on me.
0TO4000137	Must have been an override function piggybacked on that broadcast. That's what pulled you here.
0TO4000138	You just heard that signal and flew off. Are you catching the robot crazies or something?
0TO4000139	Come on. We're ending this. Right now.
0TO4000140	Okay, well, don't do it again. Come on, let's go.
0TO4000141	You're at the mercy of your programming, I get it. It's not your fault. Now, are you ready to go?
0TO4000142	Whatever he's planning, Ulysses obviously wants you there. Come on - I'd hate to disappoint him.
0TO4000143	What happened? You just took off like you finally found home.
0TO4000144	Of course I came after you. I wasn't going to leave you behind.
0TO4000145	An override frequency? So, what, Ulysses just... called you here?
0TO4000146	But why would he do that? It wasn't to lure me here, Ulysses already knew I was coming.
0TO4000147	Play the log about your ability to crack encrypted systems.
0TO4000148	How about the one where Dr. Whitley yelled at Dr. Grant?
0TO4000149	Let's hear the log where Whitley talks about Colonel Autumn's plans.
0TO4000150	Play me Whitley's phone call with Colonel Autumn.
0TO4000151	I want to hear the recording of when Whitley sent you on your journey.
0TO4000152	Let's hear the one where you were attacked by raiders.
0TO4000153	I liked the one where the little kid found you.
0TO4000154	Play me the trailer for RALPHIE the Robot's Incredible Odyssey.
0TO4000155	Yeah, he's probably dead. Guess that means I own you now.
0TO4000156	You'd better level with me, trashcan, or I might stuff you back in that pod.
0TO4000157	Fine, whatever. Listen, robot: I own you now. Follow me and try to make yourself useful.
0TO4000158	Big deal. You're a glorified computer, why bother switching you off to improve you?
0TO4000159	If you ask me, Whitley got too invested. It's just robot research, not having a kid.
0TO4000160	Spill any of my secrets, and I'll spill your electronic guts. Just so we're clear.
0TO4000161	How long ago was this? And you still haven't made it? So much for upgraded navigational systems.
0TO4000162	Boo hoo, poor little robot lost his daddy. Stop moping, trash can.
0TO4000163	Heh heh. Robot skeet shooting. Sounds fun.
0TO4000164	That's what all this was about? Some old pre-War kids' show?
0TO4000165	Sounds like a big damn waste of time to me.
0TO4000166	Run off on me like that again and I'll recycle you into tin cans. I own you, robot.
0TO4000167	You think I'd leave valuable property like you behind? No way. You might be worth some caps one day.
0TO4000172	Whatever. I only rescued you for the fire support anyways.
0TO4000173	Whatever, trashcan. I really don't give a shit about your problems.
0TO4000174	That was a .308 round. Probably hand-loaded - that would have destroyed most robots your size.
0TO4000175	I thought all robots were bulletproof.
0TO4000176	Nah, I think I'll just go ahead and trigger the launch. I never liked either of those places.
0TO4000177	Maybe you better tell me who you are, and what you want.
0TO4000178	How are you speaking through ED-E?
0TO4000179	Last I heard, Legion didn't use machines as mouthpieces to hide from their enemy.
0TO4000180	There's something left down there? Town looks like it was bombed.
0TO4000181	The damage here looks like it was caused by underground detonations - on a scale I've never seen.
0TO4000183	Are those the bodies I saw in the silo? The soldiers that look like they'd been flayed?
0TO4000184	I don't care what you have to say. I only want to know where you are.
0TO4000185	Those... troops, NCR or Legion, the ones in the silo were already dead.
0TO4000186	Enough talking. You went to a lot of trouble to lure me here, so let's get on with this.
0TO4000187	You think I'm coming after you? Think again.
0TO4000188	What were the creatures in the underpass?
0TO4000189	I'm not planning to go into the Divide after you.
0TO4000190	Fine. I'll find this trigger - then I'll come find you.
0TO4000191	Those Marked Men in Hopeville - some had strange masks and blades I'd never seen before.
0TO4000192	[Legion] Those Legionnaires in Hopeville wore Legion armor - and strange masks and blades.
0TO4000193	Some of the flayed Hopeville soldiers looked like NCR... but fought beside others in Legion armor.
0TO4000194	[NCR] Those soldiers in Hopeville... were once NCR, I'm sure of it. Why were they with the Legion?
0TO4000195	If this is the High Road... where does it lead?
0TO4000196	What did you mean, "slower death for the Mojave?"
0TO4000197	When you say, "slower death for the Mojave," you mean they're spreading out from the Divide.
0TO4000198	I've never seen creatures like that before now.
0TO4000199	So... what, they weren't that important then?
0TO4000200	You wouldn't have recorded those messages if they didn't matter to you.
0TO4000201	I was never a Legion agent.
0TO4000202	I haven't listened to them all. If there's time, I will.
0TO4000203	If you saw this happen, then how did you survive?
0TO4000204	I'm not interested in talking - only getting through this.
0TO4000205	This canyon is miles long - maybe longer. Where can I find you?
0TO4000207	Enough of this. Tell me where you are.
0TO4000208	Forget this. What do you want?
0TO4000209	Inhabitants? It doesn't look like anyone's alive down there.
0TO4000210	[NCR] Those bodies in the silo were NCR soldiers... some special forces.
0TO4000211	[Legion] The dead in the silo, some were Legion Frumentarii, scouts. Assassins.
0TO4000212	You were supposed to carry the Chip?
0TO4000213	So you refused to deliver the Chip - what, to set me up to die?
0TO4000214	If you wanted me dead, why did you wait?
0TO4000215	Whatever happened at the Divide, there weren't any survivors.
0TO4000217	I've never seen corpses mutilated like that.
0TO4000218	But... even radiation isn't enough to cause those wounds.
0TO4000219	They look like they were skinned... then got right back up.
0TO4000220	The rads in this place seem like they would do more damage to them.
0TO4000221	If they've become ghouls, the radiation would strengthen them. Heal their wounds - not the scars.
0TO4000222	Why would they want to stay here if this place is killing them?
0TO4000223	Radiation may keep them alive in areas so physically punishing, it would kill others - even ghouls.
0TO4000224	What's here? This place looks wrecked.
0TO4000225	Area looks like it was hit with earthquakes... or underground detonations.
0TO4000226	You better hope you've got enough ammo when I kick down your door.
0TO4000227	The Divide won't stop me from reaching you, trust me.
0TO4000228	Other Marked Men had NCR gear - and they weren't carrying masks or blades.
0TO4000229	So you're the one who sent the radio message - Ulysses.
0TO4000230	Ulysses... that sounds like a Legion name... a Legion hero?
0TO4000231	"Ulysses." Not the myth. You're honoring history, not stories.
0TO4000232	So... this is about fighting? Or...?
0TO4000233	You chose Ulysses because of the "two flags" reference - is that tied to the war in the Mojave?
0TO4000234	Wait... so you swore not to kill me? Why?
0TO4000235	You're not making any sense.
0TO4000236	Forget your name. Back to the job you refused.
0TO4000237	"Brothers?" So - you're Legion, too.
0TO4000238	A woman in the Legion surprise you?
0TO4000239	Is that why you're not Legion anymore, then?
0TO4000240	What burrows below? You mean those creatures in the underpass?
0TO4000241	Is New Vegas's power a threat to you?
0TO4000242	If you're afraid of Vegas and of Mr. House - you should be.
0TO4000243	You have a lot of hate for NCR. That kind of hate isn't new in the Mojave.
0TO4000244	You've got a better way?
0TO4000245	At least they're trying to help the Mojave.
0TO4000246	I'm not interested in your politics.
0TO4000247	We're too far from Vegas to argue perspective on it.
0TO4000248	As obsessed as you are about history, the future's what I prefer.
0TO4000249	Don't be quick to discount Vegas. There's more strength there than may seem.
0TO4000250	What do you have against Vegas?
0TO4000251	House's plans for the future run longer than that.
0TO4000252	What did you mean before, "it's a dance?"
0TO4000253	Vegas is one of the safest places in the Mojave, and that gives me hope.
0TO4000254	Tribes? You mean the Vegas families?
0TO4000255	House is more pragmatic than you might think.
0TO4000256	I doubt you've ever met House.
0TO4000257	Forget this. Keep your opinions about Vegas, I'll keep mine.
0TO4000258	The Mojave is behind us. I want to know what's ahead.
0TO4000259	Wait... there's more I wanted to talk about. About... all this.
0TO4000260	If we share history, then before going forward, I want to know the past.
0TO4000261	I'm not interested in talking, I only want to know where to head next.
0TO4000262	[Legion] You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
0TO4000263	Denver? What's that?
0TO4000264	"Denver hounds?" Denver's far to the East - Legion territory.
0TO4000265	Are you saying... they were here before all this destruction?
0TO4000266	Radiation from the War might have created them. Then detonations, quakes, caused them to surface?
0TO4000267	I've never been here before, at least not from this road.
0TO4000268	You keep saying that, as if you know where I was born - you don't.
0TO4000270	"The why of it?" You're the one who needs to answer that - why are you doing this?
0TO4000271	I've walked a lot of hard roads, Mojave and before. Doesn't mean anything.
0TO4000272	I had nothing to do with this.
0TO4000273	You're crazy. Your head's messed up worse than the Divide.
0TO4000274	Whatever you believe happened, you have it wrong.
0TO4000275	You're still making assumptions about all this.
0TO4000276	There is no other supply line to the Mojave beyond the Long 15.
0TO4000277	Maybe you should tell me what happened.
0TO4000278	You've been to Denver? That's Legion territory.
0TO4000279	Whatever they were carrying, they were fighting side by side with the ones in Legion armor.
0TO4000280	You said I brought it from the West?
0TO4000281	This package... I don't recall it.
0TO4000282	I've been West, it's possible, but...
0TO4000283	I'm not to blame for Ashton, the Chip, or the Divide.
0TO4000284	I'm not responsible for this, there's no way I could have known.
0TO4000285	You can't be sure it was me.
0TO4000286	I don't understand how a package could have done this.
0TO4000287	I had no idea the silo was active until the missile was in the air toward Hopeville.
0TO4000288	I didn't intend to set off that missile over the Divide.
0TO4000289	I've had enough of this - whatever your game, I'm done.
0TO4000290	So you're saying I walked this road once from another direction - from West to East. To home.
0TO4000291	There's nothing to keep me from walking out of here and letting you rot.
0TO4000292	You wanted me to come to the Divide, I'm here. Now what?
0TO4000293	On the High Road, you mentioned NCR and Legion fought here... before and after the Divide?
0TO4000294	I'm not done talking to you yet, there's more I want to know.
0TO4000295	That's what made the Legion come to the Divide.
0TO4000296	So you are part of the Legion. One of their scouts? Assassins?
0TO4000297	This is the first I've heard of Legion coming this far West of the Colorado.
0TO4000299	I'm not interested in the history of this, we're done talking.
0TO4000300	You were planning to attack the NCR here, then.
0TO4000301	So the Legion doesn't know what happened here?
0TO4000302	How were you planning to attack the Divide?
0TO4000303	I found some recordings from you on the road.
0TO4000306	In the logs... you mentioned a tribe called the Twisted Hairs - your tribe?
0TO4000307	The logs of the Big Empty mentioned you'd spoken to history.
0TO4000308	I found some recordings from you in Hopeville.
0TO4000309	When we first spoke in Hopeville, you mentioned you'd sworn not to kill me. Why?
0TO4000310	I found more recordings from you on the road.
0TO4000311	I... think they tell me... where you were. Things you did.
0TO4000312	No, there's a pattern. The more I hear, the more I understand your history.
0TO4000313	You're going after the Long 15? That's more miles than Legion can hold.
0TO4000315	I want to talk more about your recordings I found here in the Divide.
0TO4000319	I've been collecting them. Listen to you talk about history enough, maybe I'll understand.
0TO4000320	Before I go any farther, I deserve some answers.
0TO4000321	There's more I need to know.
0TO4000322	I want to know more about this package I delivered.
0TO4000323	What's our history? How do you know me?
0TO4000324	I don't understand why you didn't kill me in Primm.
0TO4000325	[Legion] You didn't kill me in Primm because you still thought I was Legion.
0TO4000326	You said you made a promise not to kill me. Why?
0TO4000327	But what was it?
0TO4000328	Something wrong? You sound... mad... at my robot.
0TO4000329	You have a lot of hate for the robot with me. I can hear it in your voice.
0TO4000330	What do you mean, "when it woke?"
0TO4000332	[NCR] NCR would have needed this supply line open to reinforce the Mojave - and Hoover Dam.
0TO4000333	[Legion] The Legion would want to cut this road off if it had been a supply line to Hoover Dam.
0TO4000334	Why did NCR want to keep the route open?
0TO4000335	So you blame me for this? An accident?
0TO4000336	This place was important to the Legion?
0TO4000337	So you're angry because I accidentally brought an explosive to the Divide?
0TO4000338	This is revenge for nearly killing you, then.
0TO4000339	This package... you said it had markings? What was it?
0TO4000340	Why would I have brought it here?
0TO4000341	Where is the package now?
0TO4000342	[Legion] I didn't side with the Legion until the Mojave.
0TO4000343	[Legion] I'll see that you answer for it.
0TO4000344	I'm no traitor, and when I walk, I don't hide my presence.
0TO4000345	What happened here was an accident. Any anger you have, let it go.
0TO4000346	Then you learned the wrong message.
0TO4000347	You want the robot? Why?
0TO4000348	What's so important about him?
0TO4000349	This road leads nowhere. There's nothing in the Divide.
0TO4000350	What makes you think this leads home?
0TO4000351	What? ED-E?
0TO4000352	ED-E's not going anywhere.
0TO4000353	If you think you can take it from me, try.
0TO4000354	You mentioned "casting off my disguise?" What do you mean?
0TO4000355	You're not taking ED-E from me.
0TO4000356	The Divide explosion... what, did I kill your family? Your wife - children?
0TO4000357	You said "brothers" before. So - you're Legion, too.
0TO4000358	When you speak of the dead - you mean the Marked Men? The Legion and NCR?
0TO4000359	[NCR] The dead? You mean the Republic troops who were here?
0TO4000360	[Legion] The dead? You mean your brothers in the Legion - our brothers.
0TO4000361	Sounds like the idea of a woman in the Legion surprises you.
0TO4000362	Then what? Did the Divide explosion kill your family? Your wife - children?
0TO4000363	If you're Legion, are you angry because I destroyed the Divide supply line instead of you?
0TO4000364	[Legion] Killing NCR, cutting off their supply line at the Divide serves Legion, as do we all.
0TO4000365	If you blame me for what happened here at the Divide - why do you care?
0TO4000366	You think I'm responsible for this. My question is what your tie to this place is.
0TO4000367	I'm glad this place burned... obviously, it meant something to you, which makes it even better.
0TO4000368	So you believed in this place. What it once was.
0TO4000369	If you cared about the Divide, then I'm sorry for what happened here.
0TO4000370	All things come to an end. If you put faith in something outside yourself, tough.
0TO4000371	And that's why you want me dead.
0TO4000372	So this is revenge, then. For destroying the Divide.
0TO4000373	If this is why you're angry, you've seen nothing yet.
0TO4000374	I don't understand. What message?
0TO4000375	Keep talking like that, I'll see you dead.
0TO4000376	At least I don't hide behind a machine like a coward.
0TO4000377	[Legion] Legion doesn't kill Legion. Caesar's orders?
0TO4000378	[Legion] You said you'd sworn not to kill me. If you're Legion, why are we at odds?
0TO4000379	[Legion] If I destroyed the NCR in this place, why do you care?
0TO4000380	[Legion] Are you angry that this explosion undermined the Legion's plans? It was an accident.
0TO4000381	[Legion] Seeing this place. It meant more to you than the Legion?
0TO4000382	[Legion] So... when you called me traitor in Hopeville, that title belongs to you.
0TO4000383	[Legion] Legion does not kill Legion - but you're not that anymore. I'm going to kill you.
0TO4000384	The Divide couldn't stop me, the Mojave couldn't kill me - you don't have much chance.
0TO4000385	I still don't understand - why are you doing this?
0TO4000386	What about the Marked Men?
0TO4000388	Forget this. I'm going to teach you what crossing the wrong Courier means.
0TO4000389	I wanted to hear more about Hoover Dam.
0TO4000390	I'll let your words answer it, from the tapes you left along the road to the Divide.
0TO4000391	"Who are you, who do not know your history?"
0TO4000392	The Divide's irradiated... are you sure you want to stay here?
0TO4000394	What's the Courier's Mile? Is that where the Ashton missile hit?
0TO4000395	If you meant to kill me, you should have done it long ago.
0TO4000396	[Legion] Being Frumentarii kept you from killing me in the past. You have no such defense now.
0TO4000397	So... you think dropping bombs on the Mojave is going to solve things?
0TO4000398	I need to know why you're doing this - not for my sake, for history's sake.
0TO4000399	Your tapes prove you've walked the Mojave, yet learned the wrong lessons.
0TO4000400	I believe destroying the symbol is never the answer. Changing it - that's something else.
0TO4000401	I don't think that's what's important here.
0TO4000402	I'm not talking about NCR or the Legion, I'm talking about our history.
0TO4000403	The Legion doesn't abide traitors. What made you turn from the East?
0TO4000404	Forget this. If you want an ending to things, let's do this.
0TO4000405	I don't care what happens to NCR, but I can't allow you to harm the Legion.
0TO4000406	Is this how it must end between us? You followed the East once, you can do so again.
0TO4000407	I know one person can break a nation. Legion tests nations, strengthens them - let it do so.
0TO4000408	You've wasted enough of my time. Get ready to die.
0TO4000409	I've heard enough. You're a Legion traitor, and now you'll die.
0TO4000410	What's the history of it?
0TO4000411	Can you share the recipe with me?
0TO4000412	Sounds useful. Have any to spare?
0TO4000414	Are you angry at all?
0TO4000415	I wasn't sure how you'd take it.
0TO4000416	I could care less about history - and even less about Caesar.
0TO4000417	You don't sound happy.
0TO4000418	Thought you might be glad House was dealt with.
0TO4000419	If Vegas falls apart, seems like more history will be lost.
0TO4000422	Who is Legate Lanius?
0TO4000423	Enough. Whatever waits at Hoover Dam, I'm ready.
0TO4000425	What can you tell me about him?
0TO4000426	He's just one general. I can handle him.
0TO4000427	Well, if I were a slave or a dog, I'd be scared.
0TO4000428	Why is he coming West?
0TO4000429	Any idea on how to beat him?
0TO4000430	He must have a weakness.
0TO4000431	He crosses me, I'll break him.
0TO4000432	Other Legates?
0TO4000433	Other Legates? You mean Graham.
0TO4000438	We'll leave it to history, then.
0TO4000440	In the logs of the White Legs, you mentioned your tribe, and its past.
0TO4000441	I don't have anything beyond words to change your mind. If you won't listen, it's over.
0TO4000442	You might not believe in nations. I do.
0TO4000443	[NCR] Even if you have no faith in the NCR, I do. My actions have proven it.
0TO4000444	[Legion] The Legion is stronger than you know. If you would judge them, hear me first.
0TO4000445	[Vegas] Even if you have no faith in Vegas, I do... and my actions have proven it.
0TO4000446	[NCR] You might not believe in nations. I do.
0TO4000447	[Legion] You might not believe in nations. I do.
0TO4000448	[Vegas] You might not believe in nations. I do.
0TO4000449	[Rep] You might not believe in nations. I do.
0TO4000450	Nothing more to say, I've already won. Everything you hate about me, you've become.
0TO4000451	If you blame me for the Divide, then let me answer for it, not others.
0TO4000452	What happened at the Divide, what I did, was an accident. What you're doing - it's madness.
0TO4000453	So, what - you intend to bomb the Mojave?
0TO4000454	This is between you and me, not anyone else.
0TO4000455	"You can go home again, Courier." Not a message for me, for you.
0TO4000457	You can't destroy the West, even with all the missiles here.
0TO4000458	Do you think I care if you fire missiles at NCR? Go ahead.
0TO4000459	Because it should be given a chance? Its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
0TO4000460	One can build a community, make it stronger. You saw it at the Divide, even blamed me for it.
0TO4000461	When all seemed lost, you asked it even though you feared the answer.
0TO4000462	Well, I just said all that because I'm betting you have some way to stop all this.
0TO4000463	I believe that one person can make... or break... a nation. You already know this.
0TO4000464	Even if the missiles launch, and I die here  - if I can convince you, that's enough for me.
0TO4000465	The Divide? What do you mean?
0TO4000466	We've already handled everything it can throw at us.
0TO4000467	There still might be a way out of this - I just need time.
0TO4000468	Vegas earned its right to survive, its people don't deserve what's about to happen.
0TO4000469	You told me once I gave life to the Divide. I can do it again, and give life to Vegas.
0TO4000470	It was all you could say to prevent from being killed. That's what I'm hoping for here.
0TO4000471	If you bomb the West and East... is this how things should end?
0TO4000472	There is no honor in murder from a distance, NCR or Legion. You know this from the Divide.
0TO4000473	You were trapped, needed to escape, and needed the distraction. It was the key.
0TO4000474	The question reminded the ones you spoke to of their purpose, why they cared.
0TO4000475	Do you really think these missiles can kill everyone?
0TO4000476	If you believe the destruction of the Divide was just, then I cannot stop you.
0TO4000477	You said in the logs yourself that technology's a dead road. These missiles will solve nothing.
0TO4000478	You said a home is a place you breathe life into, a moment where you know who you are.
0TO4000479	By your standards? Or history's?
0TO4000480	It hasn't proven itself wrong. That's why the Legion and NCR conflict must continue. To test it.
0TO4000481	Any symbol deserves a chance to defend itself, by words or acts - not... this.
0TO4000482	But your tribe was New Canaan.
0TO4000483	The White Legs might as well have been your people.
0TO4000484	I'm talking about the past, in the respect they showed you.
0TO4000485	You're wrong, and you led them to destroy your tribe at New Canaan.
0TO4000486	In the log, you said they were shadows, in the way they wore their hair.
0TO4000487	In the death of that history, another was born, and you grew to respect the White Legs.
0TO4000488	But the Twisted Hairs survived, even after Caesar.
0TO4000489	So you carry two symbols then - the mark of America and the Twisted Hairs, neither dead.
0TO4000490	It's proof that killing a symbol is going to be harder than you thought.
0TO4000491	No, what it means is that what pieces survive can become worse than they were before.
0TO4000492	Maybe there's something similar to be said about that Old World flag on your back.
0TO4000493	If one Courier built a community, seems to me you can do the same.
0TO4000494	You're planning to kill a nation from a distance, just like NCR - just like you accused me of.
0TO4000495	Moral ground? What I did by accident, you're doing with purpose.
0TO4000496	All you are is some echo of me, following my road, letting my history dictate yours.
0TO4000497	If my words won't change your mind, what about the messages in the Eyebot?
0TO4000498	The Divide survived in you. If it felt like something fighting for, you can rebuild it.
0TO4000499	Look, just the fact we're talking should mean you don't want to do this.
0TO4000500	Then stop this, you can't truly believe what you're doing.
0TO4000501	Don't even suggest we're equals. You couldn't have done this without me bringing you what you need.
0TO4000502	No danger there. You skipped past where you build the community, moved onto killing one.
0TO4000503	I want you to die knowing you're wrong, and that's what history will remember.
0TO4000504	It has history inside it. The logs of what's left of "America."
0TO4000505	Its logs tell of a place where America survived... may still exist. And it's falling apart.
0TO4000506	The Eyebot was a courier, sent to the West, to make contact with the remnants of America.
0TO4000507	The package I brought was from Navarro, the Divide scanned ED-E's logs from the Mojave.
0TO4000508	You interrupted its journey West, trapped it. If any part of America survived, it's cut off now.
0TO4000509	I believe the missiles can't be stopped. If you believe me, though, we might get through this.
0TO4000510	The symbol you wear is dead, and you helped kill it. The question is - what will you do to fix it?
0TO4000512	<Stealth Protocol::Initiate>
0TO4000574	I'm heading back to the Mojave to settle some things.
0TO4000577	Nothing more to say. I'll be going.
